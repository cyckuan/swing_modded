Report: Investment to halve in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Foreign and domestic investment in
crisis-ridden Indonesia could drop as much as 50 percent this year,
but might stay flat or start to improve next year, a local
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted the deputy chairman of the Indonesia's
Investment Coordinating Board, Sugihono Kadarisman, as saying this
year was one of the worst for the country in terms of foreign and
domestic investment.
	   At the end of September, the board had approved 743 foreign
investment projects, worth dlrs 12.63 billion, compared with dlrs
33.8 billion last year.
	   Sugihono said Indonesia had also approved 248 domestic
investment projects this year, worth 55.06 trillion rupiah (dlrs
6.2 billion), compared with 119.8 trillion rupiah (dlrs 103.6
billion).
	   ``Next year I guess there will be a slight rise in the value of
investment. At the very least the value will equal that of this
year's,'' Sugihono said.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Report: 1,200 workers protest in central China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 1,200 factory workers protested outside
government offices in a central China city after a local company
went bust, taking their savings with it, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   The demonstration Monday in Shiyan, in Hubei province about
1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Beijing, blocked a major
thoroughfare in the city, paralyzing traffic, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said hundreds of police were called in
to break up the protest and that 10 demonstrators were detained.
	   A Shiyan government official, Xiong Juguo, said it was
impossible that such a big protest had occured.
	   ``We have not heard of such a large demonstration,'' he said,
contacted by telephone from Beijing.
	   The Information Center said the demonstrators were protesting
about a local company that applied for bankruptcy in June after
having collected 10 million yuan (dlrs 1.2 million) in investments
from factory workers in the city. The company offered high rates of
interest to those who invested, the center said.
	   Workers who invested in the firm already had appealed repeatedly
to local authorities to recover their money, but had not received a
reply.

Report: Underground Catholics detained in northern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities have detained a priest, a nun and
dozens of members of the underground Catholic church in northern
China's Hebei province, according to a U.S.-based advocacy group
for the church.
	   The detentions occurred on Aug. 15, the date of the Feast of the
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, an important date in the
Catholic calendar, Joseph Kung, director of the Cardinal Kung
Foundation, said in a statement received Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Father Wei Jingkun, a priest in the underground church in
Baoding, Hebei, was detained while leading a mass at a nearby
village. Six members of the church were also either detained or
fined, the report said.
	   It said Sister Zhang Yanzhi, a nun in the underground church,
was arrested and detained for 15 days for teaching catechism to
children. Another woman, Xie Suqian, who allowed the catechism
class to meet in her home, remains in detention, it said.
	   The children caught in the class were later forced to stand
while attending classes at school, the group reported, although it
said it was uncertain if the punishment continued.
	   Police also stopped a group of about 100 church members who were
travelling to attend an early morning mass and ordered them to turn
back. The report said 11 of them were detained for 15 days and
fined between 800-1,000 yuan (dlrs 97-120).
	   It said another priest, whose name the group withheld for
``security reasons,'' escaped when police arrived at a pear orchard
where about 1,000 families were preparing to attend a mass. Several
organizers of the mass were detained, but details were not
available, the group said.
	   China's underground Roman Catholic church remains loyal to the
Vatican and rejects the state-approved Catholic church, autonomous
from Rome, that was set up by the government in the 1950s.
	   Many clerics and adherents of the underground church have been
imprisoned for refusing to participate in the official Catholic
church.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The first secretary of the Saudi
Arabian Embassy in Australia has been found dead in a pool of blood
in his apartment in the capital, police and diplomatic sources said
Wednesday.
	   Police said the death was suspicious, and the Saudi embassy
issued a statement which called the death murder.
	   There was no indication the death was politically motivated, an
Australian diplomatic source told The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity.
	   The embassy said first secretary Abdullah Al Ghamdi, 54, failed
to appear or telephone the embassy on Tuesday.
	   ``A member of the diplomatic mission was sent to his residence
and after the door was opened, Al-Gahmdi was found lying on the
floor in the kitchen in a pool of blood,'' the statement said.
	   ``While the embassy wishes to know the reasons behind his murder
as soon as possible, it gratefully appreciates the big efforts that
the (Australian) Federal Police are working on.''
	   Australian Federal Police spokesman Eric Meyer said the body was
found in an apartment in the inner-Canberra suburb of Kingston,
close to Parliament House.
	   More than 40 officers were involved in a search of an field near
the apartment, which would continue Wednesday.
	   A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy said he was not aware of
security measurers being stepped up.

 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Revenge complete. The American League pennant is
back in the Bronx.
	   Yankee Stadium rocked long and hard Tuesday night, as New York
reached the World Series for a record 35th time by beating the
Cleveland Indians 9-5 to win the AL championship series in six
games.
	   And when it was over, the first thing on the Yankees' minds was
Darryl Strawberry, their teammate who underwent cancer surgery Oct.
3. Seconds after the final out, his picture went up on the
scoreboard behind the right-field bleachers.
	   ``Darryl, this is yours. You pushed us,'' manager Joe Torre
said. ``I know you're going to be all right.''
	   Scott Brosius seemed to finish Cleveland off with a three-run
homer for a 6-0 lead in the third inning. But David Cone nearly
gave it all back, allowing a grand slam to Jim Thome that pulled
the Indians within a run.
	   Derek Jeter then restored the safety margin with a two-run
triple in the sixth, a drive to right that Manny Ramirez tried to
snag with a leap at the top of the wall _ only the ball landed on a
hop at his feet.
	   New York, which opens the World Series at home Saturday night
against Atlanta or San Diego, won an AL title at home for the first
time since the Reggie Jackson-Thurman Munson-Ron Guidry team in
1978.
	   ``It was something we fought hard all year for _ these guys are
wonderful,'' said David Wells, who went 2-0 and was voted ALCS MVP.
``This is for you, Darryl.''
	   Cleveland, which beat the Yankees in the first round last year
and came within two outs of winning its first World Series since
1948, failed to force a seventh game because it allowed five
unearned runs.
	   ``Absolutely disappointed that we didn't go on,'' Indians
manager Mike Hargrove said, ``but we have to recognize the Yankees
have a very good ballclub and they played better than we did.''
	   The game included another controversial umpiring call, a line
drive that hit an umpire on the backside and a pumped-up crowd that
took every opportunity to make up for the taunts Wells endured in
Cleveland last week.
	   After going 114-48 during the regular season and sweeping Texas
in the first round, the Yankees felt pressure to reach the Series,
which they won in 1996.
	   ``It's only fun when you win,'' Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill
said.
	   Cleveland felt pressure, too, after losing Game 7 of the World
Series to Florida last October. But after falling behind two games
to one, New York turned it around at Jacobs Field behind strong
pitching from Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez in Game 4 and Wells in
Game 5.
	   By the eighth inning, fans were taunting the Indians with chants
of ``1948.'' Responding to a remark by Cleveland's David Justice
that the only way Yankees fans could get tougher would be if they
brought Uzis to the ballpark, one fan hung pictures of a machine
gun from the upper deck for each strikeout by Cone, who fanned
eight.
	   ``I try to get the guys fired up any way I can,'' Wells said.
``Sometimes, it's not the right way.''
	   Forgotten with the win was Chuck Knoblauch's blunder in Game 2,
which allowed Cleveland to blunt New York's momentum.
	   ``What a great team we've got,'' Knoblauch said. ``They gave me
a lot of support when I was down. We don't have to worry about that
now.''
	   Umpires again were in the center of controversy. Ted Hendry, the
second-base umpire, appeared to blow a call in the third inning,
ruling New York's Chili Davis safe on a force play, claiming Omar
Vizquel was pulled off the base by the throw. Two outs later,
Brosius' homer made it 6-0.
	   Brosius' homer came after Williams' leadoff single and the
controversial call by Hendry. Davis grounded to second and Enrique
Wilson's throw to second for the force was wide to the shortstop
side. While Vizquel appeared to keep a foot on the bag, Hendry
called Davis safe.
	   Cleveland starter Charles Nagy, who took the loss, quickly got
in trouble, and Cleveland fell behind on consecutive one-out
singles in the first by Jeter, O'Neill and Williams. Davis followed
with a sacrifice fly.
	   New York made it 3-0 in the second on an error by left fielder
Brian Giles. Joe Girardi singled with one out, Knoblauch doubled
into the left-field corner and Giles, after picking up the ball,
let it fall out of his glove.
	   Cone took a shutout into the fifth. After singles by Wilson and
Kenny Lofton put runners on first and third, Vizquel hit a liner up
the middle that hit Hendry in the rear end. Lofton remained on
third instead of scoring and a walk to Justice forced in a run.
After fanning Ramirez, Cone gave up the grand slam to Thome, who
set an AL championship series record with his fourth homer.
	   Ramiro Mendoza came in to start the sixth and allowed a hit in
three shutout innings. Mariano Rivera finished with a 1-2-3 ninth.

 &UR; Predators 3, Hurricanes 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   At Nashville, Tennessee, Mike Dunham made 34 saves as the
expansion Nashville Predators recorded the first win in franchise
history with a victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.
	   Andrew Brunette, Denny Lambert, and J.J. Daigneault scored in a
span of 7:06 in the first period to give the Predators (1-1-0) a
3-0 lead. Nashville had been shut out in its opener Saturday, and
was the last NHL team to score a goal this season.
	   Martin Gelinas and Keith Primeau scored for Carolina (0-1-1).
 &UR; Stars 3, Blackhawks 1
	   At Dallas, Mike Modano scored the tiebreaking goal early in the
second period on an assist from linemate Brett Hull as the Dallas
Stars beat the Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Goaltender Ed Belfour needed to make only 13 saves to help the
Stars to their second victory in as many games.
	   Jeff Hackett stopped 29 shots for Chicago (1-1), which got its
only goal from Chad Kilger in the first period.
	   Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk scored an empty-net goal with
one second left. Pat Verbeek scored the other goal for the Stars.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Oilers 2
	   At Edmonton, Alberta, Mats Sundin scored twice, including the
winner midway through the third period, and Curtis Joseph made a
triumphant return to Edmonton with 28 saves as the Toronto Maple
Leafs beat the Oilers.
	   Joseph was playing against his former teammates for the first
time since signing as a free agent with the Maple Leafs in July.
	   The boos were much louder than the cheers when Joseph was
introduced before the start of the game. He was also booed when he
made his first save and when he was announced as the game's second
star.
	   Garry Valk had the other goal for the Maple Leafs (2-0), who
were 2-for-6 on the power play. Rem Murray and Bill Guerin scored
for the Oilers (0-2).

U.S. concerned economic crisis hurting ASEAN political influence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The regional economic crisis may be
constricting the influence of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, but there is no danger of the group collapsing, Stanley
Roth, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific
affairs, said Wednesday.
	   ``I do not think there is a danger of ASEAN disintegrating, and
I certainly don't think there is any danger of a shooting war
between any members of ASEAN,'' Roth said in an interview with CNBC
Asia and Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Although the crisis has particularly strained relations between
Singapore and its large neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia, positive
economic steps are still being made at the multilateral level in
the 10-nation group, he said.
	   ``I believe ASEAN will survive this,'' Roth said.
	   He was interviewed during the East Asian Economic Summit,
sponsored by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, and was
scheduled to speak later Wednesday on the crisis' impact on
stability and security in the region.

Asian stock exchangers call for stronger rules, more cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian stock exchange chiefs meeting at an
economic summit Wednesday pledged more transparency and a stronger
regulatory framework to rein in increasingly volatile financial
markets and hasten recovery.
	   ``There are serious concerns about transparency'' of regional
financial markets, said Michael Shepherd, vice chairman of the
Australian Stock Exchange, ``The perception is that it's risky to
invest here.''
	   Other stock exchange officials agreed, outlining plans to
improve and calling for more cooperation among the bourses.
However, only the chief of Thailand's stock exchange was willing to
predict a domestic upturn within the next 12 months.
	   Their intentions echoed a 15-point action plan for reforming the
world financial system, adopted Tuesday by economists, officials
and businessmen at the East Asia Economic Summit, organized by the
World Economic Forum, a private agency based in Switzerland.
	   Participants expressed concern about the drift of the world
economy and the growing risk of global recession. They called on
members of the Group of Seven major industrial nations to establish
a new regime for the monitoring, disclosure and regulation of
highly leveraged short-term financial flows and other potentially
volatile transactions.
	   ``Our aim is an open, orderly and efficient market,'' said Lee
Hon Chiu, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
	   In order to achieve that, Lee said, bourses should reduce their
ability to deal with short-term capital flows and focus on
transparency and stronger rules for corporate infrastructure.
	   Lee cautioned this would only work if an international
coordination of financial markets intensifies, saying it was time
to ``establish a sort of international supervision'' of markets.''
	   While agreeing that new international market rules are a
priority in the region, most of the stock exchange leaders said
they were optimistic about the future.
	   Yoshiaki Kaneko of the Tokyo Stock Exchange said the Japanese
economy is at the ``turning point.''
	   ``Our aim _ our `big bang' _ is to achieve a free, fair and
global market by the year 2001,'' Kaneko said, adding that the
Japanese government is ``firmly committed to stimulate the
economy.''
	   Kaneko said some signs of recovery will appear in the first half
of 1999. But he cautioned that foreign investors, who in the past
year have been leaving Japan, will not come back in larger numbers
before they've been encouraged by domestic investors.
	   While ``greater transparency'' seemed to be the official mantra
of the 7th annual East Asian Economic Summit, some participants
privately expressed doubts about the likelihood of the new market
rules being globally enforced.
	   Some wondered aloud whether a deeper cooperation between the
competing national markets was indeed possible.
	   ``In the case of Asia, it might be too early for alliances,''
Kaneko said.
	   By the summit's third day, many of the participants had already
left, having forced the organizers to issue the adopted action plan
a day earlier.

China to blast dikes to prevent flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hundreds of dikes surrounding eastern China's
Poyang Lake will be destroyed to increase its capacity to store
floodwaters, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The report said the local government was preparing to move
468,000 rural residents to higher ground due to the change in
policy.
	   Land reclamation and the drainage of wetlands and lakes,
reducing their ability to absorb torrential seasonal rains, was a
factor behind catastrophic flooding this summer along the Yangtze
River.
	   To prevent future disasters, the government ordered an end to
logging along the upper reaches of the Yangtze river and decreed
that some of the wetlands that had been converted into farm and
industrial land be abandoned.
	   Poyang Lake, which lies along the middle stretches of the
Yangtze in eastern Jiangxi province, is China's largest lake and a
key flood control region.
	   To that end, some 234 dikes near the lake with a height lower
than 22 meters (72.6 feet) will be destroyed, increasing its flood
storage capacity by 5.92 billion cubic meters (207 billion cubic
feet) _ an increase of almost 25 percent, Xinhua reported.
	   ``The severe flooding this year has taught us a profound
lesson,'' it quoted Liu Zhengmin, head of the provincial
Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief as saying.
	   ``Even though we can reap tons of grain from the reclaimed land,
our gains are outweighed by losses when compared with the manpower
and materials used to fight against the floods,'' he said.

Dow Chemical, LG to build joint venture plastics plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LG Chemical Corp. of South Korea said
Wednesday it will build a dlrs 320 million engineering plastics
plant in South Korea in a 50-50 joint venture with Dow Chemical Co.
of the United States.
	   Construction will begin in the first half of 1999 in the Yochon
petrochemical industrial complex on the south coast and is due to
be completed in 2001, it said.
	   The plant, or LG Dow Polycarbonate Ltd., will have an annual
production capacity of 130,000 tons of polycarbonate, a plastics
material used in compact discs, mobile phones and car interiors,
the company said.
	   ``Despite the tough economic conditions in the Asia-Pacific
region, polycarbonate is early in its product life cycle and is
expected to grow at a double digit rate in this region,'' an LG
news release quoted Dow Chemical executive Anthony Carbone as
saying.
	   The plant will export dlrs 200 million worth of polycarbonate a
year and also meet rising demand at home, LG officials said. South
Korea meets half of its polycarbonate needs with imports.
	   Dow Chemical is the world's No. 5 chemical company with annual
sales estimated at dlrs 20 billion. LG Chemical, a unit of South
Korean conglomerate LG, is the country's largest chemical company
with dlrs 4 billion in 1997 sales.

MVP Wells is a baseball rebel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the buttoned-down world of the New York
Yankees _ no facial hair, no names on the backs of the uniforms _
David Wells is a baseball rebel.
	   And by the way, a pretty good pitcher, too.
	   He won 18 games _ one of them perfect _ during the regular
season, followed that with a shutout of Texas in the first round of
the playoffs, and then won two games against Cleveland to earn the
MVP award of the American League championship series.
	   After the Yankees beat the Indians 9-5 in Game 6 Tuesday night
for a trip to the World Series, Wells was having a ball.
	   ``This is for every guy on the team,'' he said. ``This is
wonderful. The guys are wonderful. Darryl, you're wonderful.''
	   Teammate Darryl Strawberry, hospitalized after colon cancer
surgery, was on Wells' mind. And so was the Yankees' next task _
the World Series.
	   ``We've got to look ahead now,'' he said. ``Now is what it's all
about. We've just got to play the baseball we've been playing.''
	   Wells almost certainly will be the Game 1 pitcher when the
Series opens Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. He shut out Texas in
the opener of the divisional playoff and shut out the Indians until
the ninth inning of the AL series opener. He shrugged off a shaky
start in the fifth game to pitch into the eighth inning, striking
out 11 batters for the victory. He allowed five runs on 12 hits
with 18 strikeouts in 15 2-3 innings for a 2.87 earned run average.
	   When last seen on the mound, Wells had manager Joe Torre
laughing out loud and wrestling him for the baseball because he
didn't want to come out of Game 5.
	   ``There's still time,'' he told Torre, even as reliever Jeff
Nelson was making his way toward the mound. ``There's still time to
send him back.''
	   That's just not done. But in Wells' world, anything goes.
	   ``I try to get these guys going, one way or another,'' he said.
``You don't get in this situation too often. If they have to be
fired up, I'm going to do it.''
	   He pushes the envelope almost all the time. The no-hair rule
doesn't mean no stubble, so the left-hander skips shaving a couple
of days at a time before exposing his face to a razor. The Yankees
have no complaints. Perfect games earn extra privileges.
	   Wells' teammates call him Boomer, a tribute to his bulk. He
pitches with the top two buttons of his jersey open, always tugging
at his shirt and sleeves, looking like a guy trying to fit his big
man's body into a tapered jacket.
	   His musical taste runs to heavy metal and he's not shy about it.
In the baseball shrine that is Yankee Stadium, opera star Robert
Merrill sings the national anthem and Wells plays Metallica and Van
Halen over his stereo in the clubhouse.
	   Wells delights in Yankees history. He would have loved to wear
Babe Ruth's No. 3 but with that number retired he settled for a
double Babe _ No. 33. One time, he bought an old Ruth cap from a
collector for dlrs 30,000 and wore it out to the mound before he
was told to replace it with his own cap.
	   Ask Torre about his disheveled left-hander who has tattoos of
his mother and son on his back and arm and the manager shrugs,
saying, ``Boomer is Boomer.''
	   And right now, Boomer is a pennant playoff MVP.

India agrees to two patent treaties, ends isolation in field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India has agreed to abide by two key
treaties protecting inventors' patents, a major move by a nation
that for years had flouted international norms on intellectual
property.
	   The decision was welcomed by patent lawyers, India's trading
partners and the United Nations alike Tuesday.
	   The signing is particularly significant coming amid the
increasingly vocal debate over biopiracy _ what many developing
nations and indigenous groups consider the theft of their
innovations by companies that use patent laws to gain exclusive
rights over their resources.
	   India has claimed biopiracy in a current case involving a patent
granted to a U.S. company for rice similar to India's famous
Basmati grain.
	   India agreed to abide by the Paris Convention for the Protection
of Industrial Property and the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the U.N.
patent agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization said
Tuesday.
	   Both treaties will be binding on India as of Dec. 7.
	   The two treaties are considered the main accords regarding
international protection of intellectual property. The Paris
Convention lays down the basic principles governing protection of
patents, trademarks and industrial designs.
	   The Patent Cooperation Treaty makes it possible to fill out a
single application for a patent that will be valid in several
countries, reducing costs and paperwork.
	   Patents allow inventors to exclude all others from making, using
or selling their invention for a specified period of time.
Inventors can get a patent if they can prove that their product is
useful, new and isn't obvious.
	   India had for years resisted the growing trend of worldwide
patent protection that came along with the global economy, where a
bottle of aspirin in a New Delhi drug store was as likely to be
imported as it was to be locally made.
	   India had a shortened patent exclusivity period, meaning Indian
companies could sell generic drugs at an earlier date than what was
specified in the patent of the name-brand drug. While enabling
Indians to buy cheaper drugs, the policy drove away foreign
investment.
	   The New Delhi government apparently began to change its view
toward the need for patent protection last year, when it
successfully overturned a U.S. patent obtained by American
scientists for using tumeric as a wound healer.
	   Indian scientists, armed with ancient medicinal texts, argued to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the patent didn't meet
the ``novelty'' requirement because Indians had long used tumeric
to heal wounds.
	   India has also been faced with another patent issue that
surfaced earlier this year. An Alvin, Texas-based company, RiceTec
Inc., received a patent to produce and market a long-grain rice
called Texmati, which is similar to Basmati, an aromatic rice grown
in parts of India and Pakistan.
	   Claiming a case of biopiracy, India has argued that the
exclusive rights that the patent confers would hurt vital Indian
rice exports.
	   There are now 151 countries which adhere to the Paris Convention
and 98 countries which have signed the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, ADDS quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If ever a team seemed destined for a World
Series, it was this one.
	   The 1998 New York Yankees aren't just a very good team, they are
the winningest American League team ever, trying to justify their
place as one of the best teams in baseball history.
	   Cleveland found out just how good they are Tuesday night. New
York took a quick six-run lead, nearly gave it back and then
disposed of the Indians, winning 9-5 to take the AL championship
series 4-2, a record 35th pennant that seemed inevitable as early
as May.
	   ``We expected it,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said.
	   New York, which opens the World Series at home Saturday night
against Atlanta or San Diego, won an AL title at Yankee Stadium for
the first time since the Reggie Jackson-Thurman Munson-Ron Guidry
team in 1978.
	   ``It was something we fought hard all year for,'' series MVP
David Wells said.
	   And the year was special practically from the start.
	   On May 17, Wells pitched a perfect game against Minnesota. From
June 28 to Aug. 20 New York set a major league record by leading in
48 consecutive games. Also in August, the Yanks became the first
team ever to clinch a playoff spot in that month. On Sept. 4, the
Yankees won their 100th game _ the earliest date ever _ and later
broke the AL record for wins set by Cleveland in 1954.
	   No such magic for Indians, who beat the Yankees in the first
round last year and came within two outs of winning its first World
Series since 1948. On Tuesday night they failed to force a seventh
game because they allowed five unearned runs.
	   ``Absolutely disappointed that we didn't go on,'' Indians
manager Mike Hargrove said, ``but we have to recognize the Yankees
have a very good ballclub and they played better than we did.''
	   Scott Brosius seemed to finish Cleveland off with a three-run
homer for a 6-0 lead in the third inning. But David Cone nearly
gave it all back, allowing a grand slam to Jim Thome that pulled
the Indians within a run.
	   ``I let them back in the game,'' Cone said. ``But they picked me
up and that's been our trademark all year.''
	   Jeter then restored the safety margin with a two-run triple in
the sixth, a drive to right that Manny Ramirez tried to snag with a
leap at the top of the wall _ only the ball landed on a hop at his
feet.
	   By the eighth inning, fans were taunting the Indians with chants
of ``1948.'' Responding to a remark by Cleveland's David Justice
that the only way Yankees fans could get tougher would be if they
brought Uzis to the ballpark, one fan hung pictures of a machine
gun from the upper deck for each strikeout by Cone, who fanned
eight.
	   ``I try to get the guys fired up any way I can,'' Wells said.
``Sometimes, it's not the right way.''
	   Forgotten with the win was Chuck Knoblauch's blunder in Game 2,
which allowed Cleveland to blunt New York's momentum.
	   ``What a great team we've got,'' Knoblauch said. ``They gave me
a lot of support when I was down. We don't have to worry about that
now.''
	   After Thome's grand slam pulled Cleveland to 6-5, Ramiro Mendoza
blanked Cleveland for three innings, allowing just one hit.
	   Vizquel, who has won five straight Gold Gloves, opened the way
to the three-run seventh by making a throwing error on Brosius'
grounder. Only once during the regular season had the Indians
allowed as many as five unearned runs.
	   ``I'll have the whole year to think about that error,'' Vizquel
said. ``I would have rather made 25 errors during the year and not
made that one.''
	   New York took a 2-0 lead in the first against Charles Nagy on
Bernie Williams' RBI single and Chili Davis' sacrifice fly. An
error by left fielder Brian Giles _ the first of three by the
Indians _ allowed another run to score in the second following
Knoblauch's double.
	   Umpires again were in the center of controversy in the third.
Ted Hendry, the second-base umpire, appeared to blow a call and
ruled Williams safe on a force play. Two outs later, Brosius' homer
made it 6-0.
	   Cone took a shutout into the fifth. After a liner by Omar
Vizquel struck Hendry in the rear end _ keeping Kenny Lofton on
third base _ Cone forced in a run by walking Justice and gave up
the grand slam to Thome, who pulled the Indians to 6-5 with his
fourth homer, an ALCS record.
	   After Mendoza, Mariano Rivera finished with a 1-2-3 ninth. Last
year's loss was history. All that's left is a 24th World Series
title.
	   ``Hopefully,'' Wells said, ``we can wrap it up in four.''

U.S. concerned economic crisis hurting ASEAN political influence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes; CORRECTS in 5th graf to nine-nation
group &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The regional economic crisis may be
constricting the influence of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, but there is no danger of the group collapsing, Stanley
Roth, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific
affairs, said Wednesday.
	   ``I do not think there is a danger of ASEAN disintegrating, and
I certainly don't think there is any danger of a shooting war
between any members of ASEAN,'' Roth said in an interview with CNBC
Asia and Dow Jones Newswires.
	   But tension within the group _ over economic policies, human
rights questions and criticism of each other _ could ``dilute the
influence'' of ASEAN, Roth said.
	   ``Much of this is attributable to strains coming out of the
financial crisis,'' he said.
	   Nevertheless, the United States is concerned by it. Roth said
the group, expanded last year to nine nations, was a strong ally
during the time of the Asian miracle and has helped Washington
resolve issues in Asia.
	   Although the crisis has particularly strained relations between
Singapore and its large neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia, positive
economic steps are still being made at the multilateral level, he
said.
	   ``I believe ASEAN will survive this,'' Roth said.
	   He was interviewed during the East Asian Economic Summit,
sponsored by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, and was
scheduled to speak later Wednesday on the crisis' impact on
stability and security in the region.

China, Taiwan to hold highest meeting in five years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after 0645 GMT scheduled arrival of Taiwan
negotiator &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan prepared for their
highest-level meeting in five years Wednesday, amid mixed signals
that the estranged rivals were ready to resume substantial talks.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, was due to arrive
Wednesday afternoon in Shanghai to meet his Chinese counterpart,
Wang Daohan, for what was billed as an informal get-together.
	   The billing _ something less than formal talks _ illustrates the
distrust that has frustrated efforts to restart negotiations
Beijing broke off three years ago. Beijing suspended the talks in
anger over Taiwanese efforts to raise the island's international
profile.
	   Wang, an 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, and Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and
senior figure in Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, head
government-backed organizations that handle mainland-island ties in
the absence of formal relations.
	   The elder statesmen held their first and last meeting in
Singapore in 1993, ushering in a brief period of cooperation.
Expectations were high that their second sit-down would improve the
atmosphere if not formally re-establish routine negotiations
between their offices.
	   On the eve of Koo's arrival, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang looked forward to the meeting as a ``major event'' in
relations. Koo, meanwhile, called his trip ``a starting point for
rebuilding trust.''
	   After two days in Shanghai, sightseeing, talking with Wang and
attending an opera together, Koo will travel to Beijing to meet
President Jiang, top officials handling Taiwan affairs and attend
banquets.
	   But Beijing and Taipei have also restated old, divisive
negotiating positions. Chinese spokesman Tang said China wants
revived talks to focus on political issues leading to
reunification.
	   He repeated a 3 1/2-year-old proposal that would allow the
island to keep its capitalist system and military as long as it
submits to Beijing's rule.
	   Taiwan has rejected that autonomy formula and said reunification
should wait until China is more democratic and prosperous.
Meanwhile, it wants talks to focus on practical issues, like
fishing disputes, to build confidence.
	   Taiwan's top Cabinet official on mainland affairs, Chang
King-yu, urged Beijing to be pragmatic, firstly by recognizing that
the two sides are ruled separately.
	   Ever since Mao Tse-tung's communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists off the mainland in 1949, China has viewed Taiwan as a
renegade province to be retaken by force if necessary.
	   Despite their divisive positions, economic and political
pressures are edging both sides toward a short-term accommodation.
	   Trade last year totaled dlrs 26.4 billion and Taiwanese
businesses have invested dlrs 38 billion in the mainland over the
past decade. Airlines and shippers are establishing routes that
only thinly respect Taiwan's ban on direct contacts with China.
	   Better ties with China could help the Nationalists win business
community support in December's general elections.
	   Likewise, Chinese President Jiang is believed to be under
pressure from the military and Communist Party hardliners to get
Taiwan to agree to reunification.

Militants kill three police in Jammu-Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Three police officers and 10 were wounded in
separate attacks Wednesday blamed on separatist militants in the
disputed region of Kashmir, authorities said.
	   The attacks occurred as India and Pakistan prepared for a round
of talks beginning Thursday in Islamabad on their dispute over
Kashmir, the Himalayan territory over which they have been fighting
for 50 years.
	   A rocket fired into a police residential complex killed at least
two officers, wounded eight policemen and badly damaged two
apartments in Surankot, a town in the Poonch district, 210
kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Jammu, said K. Rajendra, a
police deputy inspector-general.
	   On the outskirts of town, rebels ambushed a police patrol and
killed one officer and wounded two policemen in an exchange of
gunfire. The six-member patrol belonged to the anti-militancy wing
of Jammu-Kashmir state police.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the militant
groups fighting for an independent Kashmir or a choice to join
Pakistan, an Islamic state. Jammu-Kashmir is the only Muslim
majority state in a predominantly Hindu India.
	   Pakistan denies the accusation, saying it only lends moral and
diplomatic support to the militants in Kashmir.

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS two grafs on Darryl Strawberry &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If ever a team seemed destined for a World
Series, it was this one.
	   The 1998 New York Yankees aren't just a very good team, they are
the winningest American League team ever, trying to justify their
place as one of the best teams in baseball history.
	   Cleveland found out just how good they are Tuesday night. New
York took a quick six-run lead, nearly gave it back and then
disposed of the Indians, winning 9-5 to take the AL championship
series 4-2, a record 35th pennant that seemed inevitable as early
as May.
	   ``We expected it,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said.
	   New York, which opens the World Series at home Saturday night
against Atlanta or San Diego, won an AL title at Yankee Stadium for
the first time since the Reggie Jackson-Thurman Munson-Ron Guidry
team in 1978.
	   ``It was something we fought hard all year for,'' series MVP
David Wells said.
	   And the year was special practically from the start.
	   On May 17, Wells pitched a perfect game against Minnesota. From
June 28 to Aug. 20 New York set a major league record by leading in
48 consecutive games. Also in August, the Yanks became the first
team ever to clinch a playoff spot in that month. On Sept. 4, the
Yankees won their 100th game _ the earliest date ever _ and later
broke the AL record for wins set by Cleveland in 1954.
	   No such magic for the Indians, who beat the Yankees in the first
round last year and came within two outs of winning its first World
Series since 1948. On Tuesday night they failed to force a seventh
game because they allowed five unearned runs.
	   ``Absolutely disappointed that we didn't go on,'' Indians
manager Mike Hargrove said, ``but we have to recognize the Yankees
have a very good ballclub and they played better than we did.''
	   As soon as the game ended, thoughts turned to Darryl Strawberry
and his picture went up on the scoreboard behind the right-field
bleachers. The Yankees outfielder underwent cancer surgery Oct. 3
and watched the game at a hospital.
	   ``Darryl, this is yours. You pushed us,'' manager Joe Torre
said. ``I know you're going to be all right.''
	   Scott Brosius seemed to finish Cleveland off with a three-run
homer for a 6-0 lead in the third inning. But David Cone nearly
gave it all back, allowing a grand slam to Jim Thome that pulled
the Indians within a run.
	   ``I let them back in the game,'' Cone said. ``But they picked me
up and that's been our trademark all year.''
	   Jeter then restored the safety margin with a two-run triple in
the sixth, a drive to right that Manny Ramirez tried to snag with a
leap at the top of the wall _ only the ball landed on a hop at his
feet.
	   By the eighth inning, fans were taunting the Indians with chants
of ``1948.'' Responding to a remark by Cleveland's David Justice
that the only way Yankees fans could get tougher would be if they
brought Uzis to the ballpark, one fan hung pictures of a machine
gun from the upper deck for each strikeout by Cone, who fanned
eight.
	   ``I try to get the guys fired up any way I can,'' Wells said.
``Sometimes, it's not the right way.''
	   Forgotten with the win was Chuck Knoblauch's blunder in Game 2,
which allowed Cleveland to blunt New York's momentum.
	   ``What a great team we've got,'' Knoblauch said. ``They gave me
a lot of support when I was down. We don't have to worry about that
now.''
	   After Thome's grand slam pulled Cleveland to 6-5, Ramiro Mendoza
blanked Cleveland for three innings, allowing just one hit.
	   Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel, who has won five straight Gold
Gloves, opened the way to the three-run seventh by making a
throwing error on Brosius' grounder. Only once during the regular
season had the Indians allowed as many as five unearned runs.
	   ``I'll have the whole year to think about that error,'' Vizquel
said. ``I would have rather made 25 errors during the year and not
made that one.''
	   New York took a 2-0 lead in the first against Charles Nagy on
Bernie Williams' RBI single and Chili Davis' sacrifice fly. An
error by left fielder Brian Giles _ the first of three by the
Indians _ allowed another run to score in the second following
Knoblauch's double.
	   Umpires again were in the center of controversy in the third.
Ted Hendry, the second-base umpire, appeared to blow a call and
ruled Williams safe on a force play. Two outs later, Brosius' homer
made it 6-0.
	   Cone took a shutout into the fifth. After a liner by Vizquel
struck Hendry in the rear end _ keeping Kenny Lofton on third base
_ Cone forced in a run by walking Justice and gave up the grand
slam to Thome, whose four homers in the series set an ALCS record.
	   After Mendoza, Mariano Rivera finished with a 1-2-3 ninth. Last
year's loss was history. All that's left is a 24th World Series
title.
	   ``Hopefully,'' Wells said, ``we can wrap it up in four.''

Russian border guards thwart attempt to smuggle drugs from NKorea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards thwarted an attempt to
smuggle drugs into the country from North Korea, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said Wednesday.
	   Border guards found 200 grams (seven ounces) of hashish in a
ceiling compartment on a train coming from North Korea on Tuesday,
the news agency said.
	   The train on the Tumanggang-Hasan railway was stopped at the
Hasan border crossing in Russia's Far East, it said, quoting the
Pacific Regional Department of the Federal Border Service.
	   It said this was the first case of attempted drug smuggling from
North Korea this year.

Russian parliamentary delegation leaves for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian parliamentary delegation left Wednesday
for Kosovo to get a first-hand look at what is happening in the
southern Serb province and examine sites that could be targeted by
NATO airstrikes.
	   The delegation is expected to stay in Kosovo for three or four
days, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday welcomed an agreement
brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that at least temporarily
averted NATO airstrikes.
	   At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry offered
Yugoslavia military strike in the event it was targeted.

Touting stability, Scalfaro makes pick for Italy's new premier: the

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Toppled Premier Romano Prodi stood a chance
Wednesday to get his job back at least long enough to guide Italy
through the debut of the euro _ but first he had to prove he had a
coalition strong enough to govern.
	   Some political leaders talked of limiting Prodi to just three
months, which would let him see Italy through the January start of
the common European currency that had been a goal of his 2
1/2-year-old government.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered back the premiership to
Prodi on Tuesday. Prodi's center-left government collapsed five
days earlier when he lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of
Deputies by a single ballot, with the surprise defection of a
lawmaker in his own coalition.
	   Prodi, whose government is Italy's second-longest-lived since
World War II, stayed on as interim premier at Scalfaro's request.
	   Prodi had insisted he would take the real job back only if he
could keep carrying out the cost-cutting policies that cost him the
support of hard-line Communists, leading to the failed vote of
confidence.
	   That condition still stood, he said after accepting Scalfaro's
offer.
	   ``I never changed my mind,'' he told reporters. ``What is needed
is an examination of policy and an examination of the situation in
Parliament.''
	   The political crisis was brought on when the Communist
Refoundation party withdrew its support over the proposed 1999
budget, saying it didn't do enough to create jobs.
	   The move divided the Communists. One faction broke away; its
leader, Armando Cossutta, said Tuesday he would support a second
mandate for Prodi.
	   So did centrist leader Francesco Cossiga, although he attached
conditions, including having a say in Cabinet selections. There was
no word on whether he got his way.
	   Scalfaro said the constitution forbid him from limiting Prodi's
new stint to just three months, as some have wanted. That would be
just long enough to get a new budget passed and start Italy off in
the euro.
	   Scalfaro called the budget talks all-important. Italy ``must not
waste the opportunity won when it qualified for European monetary
union,'' he said.
	   Opposition forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi,
insisted the only proper choice was new parliamentary elections, 2
1/2 years early.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi insisted.
	   Berlusconi expressed disgust Tuesday at the behind-the-scenes
political wrangling, declaring, ``This is a farce.''
	   Prodi himself declared at a public appearance Sunday he would
tolerate no under-the-table deals to form a new majority. He
pounded his fist in the air at the suggestion, roaring into the
microphone, ``No! No!''
	   There was no immediate indication when a new vote of confidence
might come. Prodi shrugged off reporters questions about how long
he would haggle with potential allies. ``Seven months,'' he
snapped. ``Seven years.''

 &UR; Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim taken away from police HQ
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar driven away from police station; edits

 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police on Wednesday took
dissident politician Anwar Ibrahim out of police headquarters amid
reports that he may be shifted to a regular jail.
	   Anwar, 51, was driven in a blue Pajero car crammed with
policemen and flanked by outriders, eyewitnesses said. He still
wore a neck brace that was prescribed by doctors after he alleged
being beaten in police custody.
	   It was not immediately clear where police took Anwar. But a
local newspaper on Wednesday said authorities planned to lift the
ex-deputy prime minister's current status of being detained under
the harsh Internal Security Act and instead hold him in a regular
jail for other offenses on which he has been arraigned.
	   Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest under the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite detention without trial, has come in for sharp
criticism, both from domestic rights groups and international
organizations.
	   He was being held in a cell at the Bukit Aman federal police
headquarters. Those detained under the ISA can be secluded from
family and lawyers and held in a secret place.
	   Because he has been denied bail, Anwar will still be held in a
high security jail awaiting trial on 10 counts of corruption and
illegal sex, The Star daily said.
	   The police spokesman was not immediately available to comment on
the report and Anwar's defense lawyers said they had not heard
anything from officials.
	   Once in a regular prison, Anwar, like other prisoners, would be
allowed visits from his lawyers and family members. But he would
not have any special privileges, according to unnamed sources
quoted by the newspaper.
	   Anwar, a former heir-apparent to Mahathir, was fired Sept. 2,
accused of being morally unfit to lead. The two men had differed
over economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy
was a threat to his office.
	   After his arrest, Anwar was brought to a court nine days later,
badly bruised and with a black eye. He said police had beaten him
until he fell unconscious on his first night of detention. He was
advised to wear a neck brace after a medical examination.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated about their role as
defense attorneys. Until last week, lawyers were denied access to
Anwar at police headquarters.
	   The High Court recently denied bail to Anwar, who faces trial
beginning Nov. 2 for charges of illegal homosexual acts and
corruption. He has pleaded innocent.

Australian leader to press hard for free trade in Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will press hard for
progress on free trade at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month, Prime Minister John
Howard said Wednesday.
	   Forecasting a strengthened role for Australia in the region, he
said would use the meeting to urge regional countries to implement
trade and economic reform.
	   He said he would also use it to continue to pursue APEC's key
goals of achieving free trade between developed countries in its
membership by 2010, with developing member countries following suit
by 2020.
	   ``I will certainly be having a few things to say at APEC about
the need to retain the reform process (and) the movement towards
the trade liberalization goals of APEC,'' Howard said.
	   ``That is what I have in mind.''
	   But Howard said he was ``not going to run around the area giving
people extensive domestic lectures,'' although he would not be
reluctant to comment on issues of interest to Australia.
	   He said Australia, the economy of which has so far been able to
hold off the worst effects of the Asian economic crisis, would have
a stronger role in the region.
	   ``I'm very conscious of the fact that over the next few years,
Australia will have to play an even stronger and more assertive
regional role in both political and economic terms,'' Howard said.
	   ``It's very fractured, it's weakened, it is in large measure in
recession. We will have to play a very strong regional role.''
	   Howard also said Australia would strongly oppose any attempt by
Malaysian authorities to interfere with free media coverage of the
APEC meeting.
	   TV reporters said at a news conference with Howard on Wednesday
that Australian networks had been told they will have to transmit
footage of their coverage of the APEC meeting through Malaysian
Telecom.
	   Malaysian authorities delayed television transmissions of
political riots in Kuala Lumpur in September filmed by crews there
to cover the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``I am against any kind of censorship of APEC or indeed other
events of that kind by the Australian media,'' Howard said.
	   ``If there is any attempt at censorship, I will express my views
in very strong terms to the Malaysian authorities about that. I
would regard that as quite unacceptable.

Norman ``ready to play now''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Former No. 1-ranked golfer Greg
Norman has declared himself ahead of schedule to return from a
shoulder injury in time for next month's Shark Shootout in
California.
	   ``I'm ready to play a tournament now. There's absolutely no
problem with the shoulder,'' Norman told Wednesday's Herald Sun
newspaper.
	   He said he was expecting a complete recovery from the shoulder
operation he had in April.
	   Norman said he would play the Shootout, starting mid-November,
and the U.S. Skins, also in California on Nov. 28-29, before
arriving Down Under for the Australian Open and Presidents Cup
tournaments.
	   ``I'm ready now, so in a month and a half I'm going to be more
ready,'' Norman said. ``My passion for the game and competitive
nature will always have me wanting to play.''
	   Norman, 43, is making steady progress in practice ahead of his
return to competition.
	   ``I'm on a routine now where I practice for about two and a half
weeks and then take 10 days off,'' said Norman. ``That's the way
the doctors want me to do it.
	   ``I can hit a driver every day now, about six of them at the end
of my practice routine. So I'm basically making a full swing.''
	   Norman has slipped to a career low on the rankings table,
slipping outside the top 10. He has played just three tournaments
this year.
	   Norman told AP last week that he was pleased with his touch.
``I've been surprised at how quickly I have gotten that back,''
Norman said.
	   Last month he said he was looking forward to his return but
would not let the sport dominate his life the way it has in the
past.
	   ``I don't want to go back to that same old mundane routine,''
Norman said.

Israel's Netanyahu arrives in Jordan for peace talks

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
arrived here Wednesday for talks on the Middle East peace process
ahead of a U.S. summit on the stalemate.
	   Netanyahu flew by helicopter to a royal palace on an Amman hill
where he was met by Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's younger
brother who is acting as regent.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon accompanied Netanyahu,
whose talks with the prince are expected to focus on a summit
between the Israeli prime minister and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in a resort outside Washington on Thursday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is hosting the meeting which will
discuss a long-standing U.S. proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has proposed
a modification in terms of which 3 percent of the land handed-over
will remain effectively under its control.
	   Arafat was in Jordan on Monday for similar consultations.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
pushing for a settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the
core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Jordan is the first since relations chilled
in September 1997 after a botched attempt by the Israeli secret
service to kill a Palestinian militant leader in Jordan.

Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim shifted to regular prison

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar taken to regular jail after internal
security charge dropped.
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities Wednesday
removed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim from detention under the
harsh Internal Security Act and shifted him to a regular jail on
the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar, 51, was driven in a blue Pajero car crammed with
policemen and flanked by outriders, eyewitnesses said. He still
wore a neck brace that was prescribed by doctors after he alleged
being beaten in police custody.
	   Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest under the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite detention without trial, has come in for sharp
criticism, both from domestic rights groups and international
organizations.
	   Because a court had refused him bail, Anwar will be held in the
Sungai Buloh jail pending trial for 10 counts of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts.
	   Since his arrest, Anwar had been held in a cell at the Bukit
Aman federal police headquarters. Those detained under the ISA can
be secluded from family and lawyers and held in a secret place.
	   A police spokesman confirmed that Anwar had been released from
ISA detention. He was arrested under the ISA for posing a threat to
national security when he organized a huge rally demanding Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation on Sept. 20.
	   In a regular prison, Anwar, like other prisoners, will be
allowed visits from his lawyers and family members. But he will not
have any special privileges.
	   Anwar, a former heir-apparent to Mahathir, was fired Sept. 2,
accused of being morally unfit to lead. The two men had differed
over economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy
was a threat to his office.
	   After his arrest, Anwar was brought to a court nine days later,
badly bruised and with a black eye. He said police had beaten him
until he fell unconscious on his first night of detention. He was
advised to wear a neck brace after a medical examination.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated about their role as
defense attorneys. Until last week, lawyers were denied access to
Anwar at police headquarters.
	   The High Court recently denied bail to Anwar, who faces trial
beginning Nov. 2 on the charges of illegal homosexual acts and
corruption. He has pleaded innocent.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian parliamentary delegation left Wednesday
for Kosovo to get a first-hand look at what is happening in the
southern Serb province and examine sites that could be targeted by
NATO airstrikes.
	   The delegation is expected to stay in Kosovo for three or four
days, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday welcomed an agreement
brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that at least temporarily
averted NATO airstrikes.
	   At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry offered
Yugoslavia military strike in the event it was targeted.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will fly to Paris on Wednesday
night to attend a meeting of the six-country Contact Group on
Yugoslavia, the Interfax news agency said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire at a coal mine in the Russian Far East was
extinguished Wednesday after burning for two days, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The fire was started by spontaneous coal combustion at the
Amurskaya mine in the town of Artem, ITAR-Tass said. Mining
operations were stopped immediately.
	   Firefighters cut oxygen to the fire by plugging three plaster
stoppers into the area where the coal was burning 320 meters (1,050
feet) below ground, it said.
	   There were no injuries, said Alexander Sidorenko, deputy chief
of the Primorye region Civil Defense Department.

Peters opens attack on latest New Zealand immigration easing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Struggling to maintain a profile
after being fired from top posts in the New Zealand government,
former deputy prime minister and treasurer Winston Peters on
Wednesday renewed attacks on migrants, calling foreign immigrant
investors ``fly-by-night entrepreneurs.''
	   Peters rejected a government plan announced this week to ease
immigration rules to attract more business people and investment to
the country, which is in recession.
	   The new rules include relaxing English language requirements for
business migrants, fast-tracking business migrant application
procedures and creating a new immigrant class for entrepreneurs
wanting to start businesses in New Zealand.
	   The English language controls, in place since 1995, are cited as
the cause of a fall in business migrants from Asia from thousands a
year to almost nil.
	   Immigration Minister Tuariki John Delamere admitted Wednesday
the requirement had contributed to last year's new migrant target
of 38,000 falling short by 13,000.
	   ``Investors provide jobs,'' Delamere said, announcing the
Cabinet's plan.
	   Asia was not a specific target of the new policy, which would
also attract people from Britain, South Africa and South America.
	   Peters, who rose to power in the last election in 1996 with
attacks on migrants and promises to cut immigration ``to the
bone,'' said New Zealand's infrastructure could not handle the new
measures.
	   His NZ First party won the balance of power in Parliament and he
became deputy prime ministership and treasurer in a coalition
government.
	   Prime Minister Jenny Shipley fired him in August after securing
enough support from independents and minor parties to retain power
without him.
	   Peters denied his objection was based on race, but said New
Zealand had to ``look after our own people first,'' which included
migrants who had ``committed themselves to this country for the
long haul.''
	   ``What is progressive about letting a bunch of fly-by-night
entrepreneurs into New Zealand so they can dump a few dollars into
a bank account, maybe buy a house and leave the family here, and
then head back off overseas to continue to work, safe in the
knowledge they have a bolt hole if things go wrong elsewhere,'' he
said.
	   Observers see the government's new policy as playing into
Peters' hands as he seeks to rebuild a party still languishing at
just three percent support in recent opinion polls.
	   An election is due next year.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin has chosen
Israel Aircraft Industries and the Israeli Elbit Systems company as
its exclusive partners in a consortium to upgrade F-16 jet
fighter-bombers throughout the world, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The consortium will also include Elbit subsidiary El-Op which
manufactures electro-optical instruments, the daily Haaretz
reported.
	   No immediate confirmation of the report could be obtained from
Israel Aircraft Industries. The agreement is to be signed Thursday
at a prime ministerial business summit currently underway, the
paper said.
	   Lockheed President Vance Coffman met Tuesday with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to report
on the joint venture, the paper said.
	   Since the 1970s about 3,600 F-16s have been manufactured and
Lockheed has orders for another 300 in the next five years.
Lockheed's next generation fighter, the F-22, will be much more
expensive and therefore many air forces around the world will be
forced to upgrade their existing fleets of F-16s, Haaretz said.
	   The average cost of upgrading an F-16 is about dlrs 3 million,
depending on which new avionic systems are installed.
	   Meanwhile, Lockheed has dropped its objection to installing
Israeli radar systems in F-16s to be purchased by the Israeli Air
force, the paper said.

Scud back in Davis Cup says official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ US Open finalist Mark Philippoussis
has ended a bitter dispute with Australia's Davis Cup hierarchy and
is available to play again, an official said Wednesday.
	   Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard, who has been working
to heal the rift between Philippoussis and Australia captain John
Newcombe and coach Tony Roche, announced the reconciliation.
	   If selected, Australia's No. 2 player will be available for
Australia's first-round tie against Zimbabwe in April 1999.
	   The feud started when Philippoussis attacked Newcombe in the
press just before the first-round Davis Cup loss to Zimbabwe in
April this year.
	   Philippoussis said Newcombe and Roche had failed to help him
when he struggled with form and did not support him while his
father was battling cancer.
	   He said at the time he would not play Davis Cup until Newcombe
apologized. Newcombe has consistently said that he had nothing to
apologize about.
	   The row flared again last month when Philippoussis played
Australian No.1 Pat Rafter in the US Open final at Flushing Meadow.
	   Philippoussis was offended when Roche sat with the Rafter team
during the match. Roche defended his actions, saying Rafter was a
member of Australia's national team while Philippoussis was not.
	   Roche indicated last month that he might resign his Davis Cup
job over the Philippoussis' claims of bias.
	   Newcombe said he would also resign if Roche stood down and
Rafter, who has always maintained his love of Davis Cup, said he
would also quit if the two mentors were lost to the team.
	   Rafter and Philippoussis also had a falling out during the past
year, with the two-time US Open champion sacking Philippoussis as
his doubles partner.
	   ``Mark and I are starting to patch things up _ we are a lot
better than we were,'' Rafter said. ``But it's hard to defend him
when he also offends another good friend of mine (Roche).''

Tokyo stocks lower in mid-afternoon trading, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices in Tokyo fell Wednesday as investors
grew skeptical over the effectiveness of the government's bank
rescue plan. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 172.06 points,
or 1.30 percent, to close at 13,070.73. On Tuesday, the Nikkei
closed down 312.22 points, or 2.30 percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.68 yen, up 1.30 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 119.15 yen
overnight.
	   Tokyo stock prices fell as investors continued monitoring
developments in Japanese government measures aimed at banking
reform and also possible fresh economic stimulus steps.
	   Traders said investors avoided shares linked to domestic demand
because of the poor outlook for the Japanese economy. Concerns
about economies abroad also pushed down international blue chips.
	   On Tuesday, the lower house of Japan's Parliament passed a bill
that would let the government pump taxpayer money into banks to
induce them to lend more. The bill is expected to pass the upper
house on Friday.
	   The problem of Japan's debt-saddled banks is a major factor
behind the nation's deepest recession in decades. Unless quickly
resolved, economists say the crisis could further affect
economically devastated Asian countries and slow global growth.
	   The market's current focus is on the conditions under which the
government would disburse public funds to weak but viable banks,
traders said.
	   ``There are still many uncertain elements in the banking reforms
before we feel relieved,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the
stock division at Ryoko Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.80 points, or 1.48 percent, to 984.18.
The TOPIX closed down 24.36 points, or 2.38 percent, the day
before.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar rose against the yen amid
growing notions among Japanese investors and traders that dollar
selling by U.S. hedge funds has peaked for now.
	   The currency had gained support from comments by U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who reiterated that a strong
dollar is in the United States' best interests.
	   The comment gave some relief to investors after the U.S.
currency plunged last week and some officials had expressed concern
about the yen's weakness.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was 0.830 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's finish, with its
price remaining at 108.68 yen.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin has chosen
Israel Aircraft Industries and the Israeli Elbit Systems company as
its exclusive partners in a consortium to upgrade F-16 jet
fighter-bombers throughout the world, a newspaper reported

Russian border guards thwart attempt to smuggle drugs from NKorea

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with attempt to smuggle metals to China stopped. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards thwarted an attempt to
smuggle drugs into the country from North Korea, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said Wednesday.
	   Border guards found 200 grams (seven ounces) of hashish in a
ceiling compartment on a train coming from North Korea on Tuesday,
the news agency said.
	   The train on the Tumanggang-Hasan railway was stopped at the
Hasan border crossing in Russia's Far East, it said, quoting the
Pacific Regional Department of the Federal Border Service.
	   It said this was the first case of attempted drug smuggling from
North Korea this year.
	   In a separate case, customs officials using sniffer dogs found
rare metals hidden in sacks full of cedar nuts in a truck headed to
China, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Officials seized 11 sacks filled with dark granules believed to
contain barium or palladium, and 12 sacks containing yellow powder
thought to be antimony.
	   Each sacked weighed about 80 kilograms (176 pounds), ITAR-Tass
said, quoting the press service of the Far Eastern Customs
Department.
	   Less than 24 hours earlier, a truck carrying 915 kilograms
(2,017 pounds) of titanium to China was also seized, ITAR-Tass
said.

Walters ruled out as Hetherington gets call
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian fly-half Kevin Walters
has been ruled out of Friday's deciding third rugby league test
against New Zealand at North Harbor Stadium.
	   Walters suffered a hamstring injury in training and was sent
home, with Jason Hetherington brought in to the squad.
	   Canterbury's Hetherington is expected to start the match at
hooker with Andrew Johns switching to fly-half to cover Walters'
loss.
	   New Zealand has also made one forced change to its team with
Canterbury winger Daryl Halligan replacing injured Matthew Ridge.
	   Ridge announced his retirement from international league after
Australia won the second test in Brisbane last week to level the
series at 1-1. The Kiwis won the first test in Auckland in April.

India agrees to two patent treaties, ends isolation in field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of turmeric in grafs 12 and 13 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India has agreed to abide by two key
treaties protecting inventors' patents, a major move by a nation
that for years had flouted international norms on intellectual
property.
	   The decision was welcomed by patent lawyers, India's trading
partners and the United Nations alike Tuesday.
	   The signing is particularly significant coming amid the
increasingly vocal debate over biopiracy _ what many developing
nations and indigenous groups consider the theft of their
innovations by companies that use patent laws to gain exclusive
rights over their resources.
	   India has claimed biopiracy in a current case involving a patent
granted to a U.S. company for rice similar to India's famous
Basmati grain.
	   India agreed to abide by the Paris Convention for the Protection
of Industrial Property and the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the U.N.
patent agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization said
Tuesday.
	   Both treaties will be binding on India as of Dec. 7.
	   The two treaties are considered the main accords regarding
international protection of intellectual property. The Paris
Convention lays down the basic principles governing protection of
patents, trademarks and industrial designs.
	   The Patent Cooperation Treaty makes it possible to fill out a
single application for a patent that will be valid in several
countries, reducing costs and paperwork.
	   Patents allow inventors to exclude all others from making, using
or selling their invention for a specified period of time.
Inventors can get a patent if they can prove that their product is
useful, new and isn't obvious.
	   India had for years resisted the growing trend of worldwide
patent protection that came along with the global economy, where a
bottle of aspirin in a New Delhi drug store was as likely to be
imported as it was to be locally made.
	   India had a shortened patent exclusivity period, meaning Indian
companies could sell generic drugs at an earlier date than what was
specified in the patent of the name-brand drug. While enabling
Indians to buy cheaper drugs, the policy drove away foreign
investment.
	   The New Delhi government apparently began to change its view
toward the need for patent protection last year, when it
successfully overturned a U.S. patent obtained by American
scientists for using turmeric as a wound healer.
	   Indian scientists, armed with ancient medicinal texts, argued to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the patent didn't meet
the ``novelty'' requirement because Indians had long used turmeric
to heal wounds.
	   India has also been faced with another patent issue that
surfaced earlier this year. An Alvin, Texas-based company, RiceTec
Inc., received a patent to produce and market a long-grain rice
called Texmati, which is similar to Basmati, an aromatic rice grown
in parts of India and Pakistan.
	   Claiming a case of biopiracy, India has argued that the
exclusive rights that the patent confers would hurt vital Indian
rice exports.
	   There are now 151 countries which adhere to the Paris Convention
and 98 countries which have signed the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

Super Typhoon Zeb slams into northern Philippine province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with early reports of damage, evacuations, government
offices closing early &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ ``Super typhoon'' Zeb slammed into a
northern Philippine province Wednesday, dumping rain and toppling
electrical posts and trees, the weather bureau said. There were no
immediate reports of casualties.
	   At 10 a.m. (0200 GMT), Zeb, packing sustained winds of 240
kilometers (150 miles) per hour with gusts of up to 295 kph (184
mph), made landfall near Palanan town in Isabela province, said
chief weather forecaster Frisco Nilo.
	   Nilo said Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to hit the country
this year, is expected to weaken as it plows through mountain
ranges in Isabela and nearby Cagayan province, moving northwest at
22 kph (14 mph).
	   The Office of Civil Defense said at least 10 electrical posts
were uprooted in Malig town in Isabela, about 320 kilometers (200
miles) north of Manila. A bridge in nearby Jones town was closed to
traffic due to flooding.
	   A major road to the resort city of Baguio was closed to traffic
due to dangers that rains dumped by Zeb will cause landslides along
the route.
	   About 565 persons were evacuated in Calabanga town in Camarines
Sur, further south in Luzon island's Bicol region.
	   Local electrical distributors in the northern Philippines cut
power early Wednesday morning to prevent accidents as heavy rains
flooded many areas in Isabela.
	   Many remote towns have been reported to be isolated due to flash
floods.
	   Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora ordered government offices in
the affected areas to close early in the afternoon. He said police
and disaster relief offices will remain open to help.
	   On Tuesday, disaster relief officials were sent to many areas in
the north to tell residents of coastal and flood-prone areas to
evacuate in anticipation of Zeb's fury.
	   Government offices and schools have been prepared to accept
evacuees.
	   Five northern provinces, including Isabela, Cagayan, Quirino,
Aurora and the Batanes Island group have been placed on maximum
storm alert as Zeb is expected to hit these areas hardest, said
forecaster Susan Dampog.
	   A storm gains ``super typhoon'' status if its maximum sustained
winds reach 220 kph (138 mph).
	   Last month, tropical storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

Japanese government now expects no recovery for three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government now expects the troubled
economy could take up to three years to recover instead of the two
years it previously projected, a top official was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
	   The comment by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, reported
by Kyodo News agency, was the second time in recent days that a
Japanese official has downplayed hope for an economic turnaround
next year.
	   Last week, the government revised down its economic forecast for
the fiscal year ending March 31, predicting shrinkage of 1.8
percent instead of the previously forecast growth of 1.9 percent.
	   ``We think the economy will recover in two or three years,''
Nonaka was quoted as saying to reporters. Until now, the government
has said the recovery would take one or two years.
	   The dour prediction came as an advisory economic panel to Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi urged the government to inject ``tens of
trillions of yen'' (tens of billions of dollars) in public funds
into financial institutions and to approve more than 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 84 billion) in stimulus spending.
	   Acknowledging the severe state of the economy, the Economic
Strategy Council report said that the money was needed to stabilize
the financial system, stop economic contraction and bring the
economy to the zero-growth level.
	   The stimulus spending should include both public works spending
and reductions in corporate and income taxes, the panel said.
	   The government has promised to lower corporate and income taxes
by substantially more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 50 billion) next
fiscal year.
	   Nonaka said the government would consider the proposals.
	   Japan is fighting its deepest recession since the end of World
War II. In fiscal 1997, the economy shrank 0.7 percent. Economic
Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya said Sunday that the economy
would also likely shrink next year as well.
	   Also Wednesday, the Sankei newspaper reported that a government
panel was expected to conclude that the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank is insolvent after it looks at the results of its recent
inspection of the bank.
	   Nonaka, however, played down the story, saying that he had
received no report that the bank was insolvent. The LTCB, one of
Japan's biggest lenders, has been rumored to be on the verge of
collapse since summer.

IOC to be briefed on potential new tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee's
coordination commission will be briefed next week on the
implications of Australia's potential new taxation system.
	   The federal government was returned earlier this month on a
platform of taxation overhaul, including a 10 percent tax on goods
and services (GST).
	   Sydney Organizing Committee president and state Olympics Michael
Knight has claimed the GST would cost SOCOG Australian dlrs 110
million (US dlrs 68 million) on athletes' food and other services
if it was introduced on schedule on July 1, 2000.
	   The games will open Sept. 15 and treasurer Peter Costello wants
the GST in place to cash in on overseas visitors.
	   Costello said he did not expect the cost to SOCOG to be as high
as tipped by Knight. He said SOCOG would be entitled to claim
credits on business inputs purchases, sparing those costs from a
GST, while SOCOG is already exempt from paying federal sales tax
and federal income tax.
	   The IOC coordination commission, headed by Jacques Rogge, will
be in Sydney as part of its regular program of visits to monitor
the city's Olympic preparations.
	   IOC marketing director Michael Payne said Wednesday the
commission would seek a full briefing on the GST.
	   ``The GST, I think, is something for us that is a new issue,''
Payne said. ``We're waiting to be briefed on it at the coordination
commission next week and all of its implications.''
	   Meanwhile, Australian Tourism Commission managing director, John
Morse, said he was confident a GST would not deter international
tourists from coming to Australia for the Games.
	   Spain and the United States, which hosted the last two Summer
Games, had similar services taxes.

Debt left by Japanese bankruptcies hits post-war high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese bankruptcies rose in September, pushing
the debt left over from failed businesses for the month to more
than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 25 billion), a post-war high, a research
agency said Wednesday.
	   Corporate bankruptcies rose 17.9 percent from the year-earlier
month to 1,518 cases _ including the massive failure of Japan
Leasing Corp., private credit research agency Teikoku Databank Ltd.
said.
	   Debt left behind by insolvent companies in September soared
370.9 percent from a year earlier to 3.039 trillion yen (dlrs 25.5
billion), the largest amount for any month since World War II,
Teikoku said.
	   The previous record was 2.746 trillion yen (dlrs 23.1 billion),
posted in December 1997.
	   The major reason for September's surge in bankruptcy debt was
the failure of Japan Leasing, a financial affiliate of troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   Japan Leasing had debt of 2.180 trillion yen (dlrs 18.3
billion), making it Japan's largest-ever bankruptcy filing.
	   Japan's recession, the deepest in 50 years, has hit hard at
financial companies, which are also weighed down by mountains of
bad debt left over from the collapse of the speculative real estate
bubble in the early 1990s.

Report: U.S. asks Israel to `consider' Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Senior American officials have informally asked
Israel to consider accepting the principle of an eventual
Palestinian state, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   In exchange, the Palestinians would postpone the declaration of
statehood they have said they intend to make on May 4, 1999, and
terms of statehood would be decided in negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians, the daily Haaretz said.
	   Clinton administration officials believe that if Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, the chances of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
agreeing to postpone the declaration will be much better, the paper
said.
	   If, however the summit beginning Thursday at the Wye Plantation
in Maryland fails, U.S. officials fear that the Palestinian
statehood declaration will be virtually inevitable.
	   Netanyahu has warned that such a unilateral declaration by
Arafat would prompt unilateral but unspecified steps by Israel, and
has hinted that could include annexation of Israeli settlements in
the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday there would be no agreement at Wye
Plantation unless Arafat agrees to clamp down hard on Islamic
militants.
	   Following the killing of a young Israeli and the wounding of
another by assailants who then escaped into Palestinian areas,
Netanyahu's office said ``in light of this gloomy reality, there is
absolutely no chance at this stage of signing an agreement.''

52 people die in Turkish-Kurdish clashes in southeastern Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAN, Turkey (AP) _ Fifty-two people have been killed in clashes
over the past two days in southeastern Turkey between government
troops and Kurdish rebels who sneak into the country from their
bases in nearby Syria, Iran and Iraq, the Anatolia news agency said
Wednesday.
	   Turkish troops killed 36 Kurdish rebels near the city of Van,
1,250 kilometers (781 miles) southeast of Ankara, the capital,
while two soldiers and 14 village guards were killed in the clashes
near the town of Catak, it said. Military officials were
unavailable to comment.
	   Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984 and are a source of tension between Syria and
Turkey, which accuses Damascus of sheltering and supporting them.
The conflict has killed some 37,000 people.

Indonesia's central bank chief says IMF policies working
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ International Monetary Fund policies prescribed
for Indonesia, although criticized by many in the region as
bringing hardship to ordinary people in the name of national
recovery, are working, the country's central bank governor said
Wednesday.
	   Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said the delay in his
country's revival from near collapse is the result of non-economic
factors.
	   Speaking on a panel at the East Asia Economic Summit, sponsored
by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, Sjahril also said
that Indonesian corporations are overexposed to short-term debt.
	   He agreed with other central bankers at the conference that
``better monitoring is needed of short-term capital flows.''
	   Sjahril also said he is confident that the rupiah, trading
Wednesday at around 8,850 to the U.S. dollar, will continue to
improve.
	   It has gained from 10,800 to the dollar at the beginning of the
month.

Thailand's Manager Media Group files for bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A top media company has filed for
protection under Thailand's recently instituted bankruptcy law, a
company employee said Tuesday.
	   The Manager Media Group filed jointly with the Thai Farmers Bank
and the Thai Military Bank, making an agreement with the two
creditors to work out a rehabilitation plan for the company, said
the employee, who asked not to be named.
	   ``We want everything to be done in a transparent manner. We have
filed for court protection to assure our creditors that we would
live up to our agreement,'' Sondhi Limthongkul, the group's owner,
was quoted saying by Manager Daily, one of his publications.
	   The newspaper is one of the company's three surviving
publications. At its height, Sondhi's media empire included a
regional English-language daily meant to challenge The Asian Wall
Street Journal, an English-language business monthly and a Los
Angeles lifestyle magazine, a photo agency, a broadcasting
satellite concession, and a dozen Thai-language publications.
	   Like most publishers in the region, the company took a severe
beating from rising costs and falling revenues caused by the
region's economic crisis last year.
	   The Manager group owed Thai Military Bank 176 million baht (dlrs
4.4 million) and Thai Farmers Bank 467 million baht (dlrs 11.7
million), according to the report in Manager Daily.
	   The company owed a total of more than 1.5 billion baht (dlrs
37.5 million) to all of its creditors, it said.

Philippines' Cardinal Sin to stay longer in hospital due to fever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's influential Roman Catholic
archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, said Wednesday he has developed a
fever and will have to stay in the hospital some days longer.
	   ``Just when I was about to be discharged, I developed a low
grade fever,'' Sin said in a statement.
	   He had been sent to a suburban hospital about two weeks ago with
fever and stomach pains after a tube inserted in his peritoneum,
the membrane lining the abdominal cavity, apparently introduced
bacteria into his system, church officials said.
	   The procedure was needed for kidney dialysis because Sin was
having renal problems.
	   ``I was trying to convince my doctors that I'm feverish with
excitement to see all of you again. They have chosen to play
safe,'' the 70-year-old prelate said, adding he expected to be back
with his flock ``very soon.''
	   Sin helped bring about the ouster of strongman Ferdinand Marcos
in 1986 when he called for citizens to support a military revolt
against the president. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in
the streets, forcing Marcos from power.
	   He continues to be heavily involved in political and social
issues.
	   The Philippines is Asia's only predominantly Catholic country.

Yeltsin, suffering from cold, returns to work at the Kremlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, suffering from a
respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip,
returned to work in the Kremlin on Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin plans several working meetings throughout the day, the
presidential press service said. It gave no other details.
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Tuesday that
doctors ordered the president to stay in bed and that he would not
be in the office all week.
	   Doctors insisted on Monday that Yeltsin fly home from a visit to
Central Asia a day ahead of scheduled because he was suffering from
an upper respiratory infection, was coughing and running a fever.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out
the remaining two years of his term. But whenever he gets sick,
there is speculation about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin stumbled when he arrived Sunday in Tashkent, the capital
of Uzbekistan, and had to be supported by the Uzbek president. He
canceled public engagements, except for a state dinner at which he
made rambling remarks.
	   The Russian leader turned up late for talks with Uzbek officials
on Monday, made some incoherent remarks interrupted by a bad cough
and abruptly cut short a scheduled news conference.
	   Several hours later, after arriving in neighboring Kazakstan,
doctors ordered him to return to Moscow.

Primakov address parliament on Russia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday
that Russia was facing one of the ``most difficult and complex
periods in its history'' and there was no easy way out of the
current economic crisis.
	   Primakov gave his glum assessment of the country's economic and
social conditions in a wide-ranging speech to the Federation
Council, the upper chamber of parliament.
	   The prime minister has been in office for over a month, but his
government is still formulating an economic plan to deal with the
crisis. President Boris Yeltsin has said little about the crisis,
and most of the burden in dealing with the economic turmoil appears
to be falling on Primakov.
	   ``Russia is now passing through one of the most difficult and
complex periods in its history,'' Primakov said. ``We must join
efforts and the government and regional leaders to get out of the
crisis.''
	   One of the biggest problems facing the country is unpaid wages
to millions of workers, many of them state employees. The central
government says that in many cases it has allocated the money to
regional officials, but they have diverted the funds for other
projects instead of paying workers.
	   Primakov accused regional officials of turning a blind eye to
the misuse of government subsidies intended to pay wages, and
called on them to tighten controls over how money is spent.
	   The billions of rubles (dollars) in unpaid wages and pensions
across Russia is ``a social time bomb,'' Primakov said.
	   The Federation Council is made up of regional governors who have
substantial power in their home territories.
	   Primakov also said the government had set up an emergency food
reserve to ensure that the country does not experience food
shortages this winter.
	   ``The reserves will cover the needs of a third of the
population,'' he said. ``We can't allow ourselves more,'' he said,
adding that the reserve cost 600 million rubles (about dlrs 40
million).
	   Primakov also reiterated the government has no plans to ban the
circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies in Russia.
	   Nor are there any plans for the government to set the exchange
rate against foreign currencies, he said, indicating that the
government plans would continue to allow the market to set exchange
rates.
	   The government has promised to make public its plan for
overcoming the economic crisis by Oct. 20. However, it has
acknowledge the plan focus on short-term solutions, rather than
comprehensive, long-term measures for restructuring the Russian
economy.
	   Primakov has also said the government's plans depend on getting
further installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
negotiated with the International Monetary Fund before the crisis
hit.
	   The IMF has frozen disbursement of the loan, saying it wants to
see not only the government's rescue plan, but signs that it has
been implemented.
	   If the loan payments are not forthcoming, the government has
said it will have to print more rubles to pay its bills, which most
experts say will lead to high inflation.

Russian parliamentary delegation leaves for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russia taking credit for Kosovo deal, TRIMS
outdated material. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must touch wood, but it appears there will be no airstrikes.''
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation left for Kosovo to get a
first-hand look at what is happening in the southern Serb province
and examine sites that could be targeted by NATO airstrikes.
	   The delegation is expected to stay in Kosovo for three or four
days, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.

Defying censorship, two Serbian dailies banned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police stormed the offices
of two Belgrade independent newspapers late Tuesday and shut them
down for allegedly violating a recent government decree that
required self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   The newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas, both often critical of
the autocratic President Slobodan Milosevic, did not appear on
newstands Wednesday, triggering strong protests against the latest
crackdown on media not under state control.
	   Ironically, the latest of many Milosevic's crackdowns on
independent media came the same day when he announced the NATO
threat was off due to an agreement he reached with U.S. negotiators
to stop violence in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The decree, hastily brought last week without any discussion in
the parliament, broadened the government's authority envisaging
punishment for companies, institutions and individuals who act
contrary to the government's view of patriotic behavior.
	   Milosevic's authorities claim the Kosovo crisis and the
resulting NATO threats were made worse by reports by foreign and
independent media in Serbia. The decree effectively made it a taboo
to report on the threats, military preparations or any other
developments which, allegedly, could cause alarm among Serbians.
	   Dnevni Telegraf mocked the restrictive decree, publishing
regularly the developments under notes saying ``We have not
reported this:'' ``Respecting the decree, we are not saying
that:''.
	   Reporters, editors and other staff in the two dailies protested
to the law enforcers who eventually physically pushed them out of
their premises.
	   ``This is a barbaric act, an act of sheer violence,'' Nikola
Barovic, a lawyer and legal representative of Danas daily.
	   On Saturday, a popular radio station, Index, was shut down.

Former Kazak prime minister unhurt after shooting

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Shots were fired at former Prime Minister Akezhan
Kazhegeldin of Kazakstan while he was riding his horse, but he was
not hurt, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Kazhegeldin had been expected to announce Wednesday his plans to
run for president of the Central Asian country in January. A
scheduled news conference was postponed, Interfax said.
	   Two shots were fired at Kazhegeldin on Tuesday night while he
was riding near Almaty, Kazakstan's main city, Interfax said.
	   The Kazak Security Committee and Interior Ministry were
investigating, it said.
	   Kazhegeldin resigned in 1997 for health reasons.

Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim shifted to regular prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities moved
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim to a regular jail Wednesday after 24
days of solitary confinement in the police headquarters under a
harsh security law.
	   Anwar, 51, was driven in a car crammed with policemen and
flanked by outriders, witnesses said. He still wore a neck brace
that was prescribed by doctors after he alleged being beaten in
police custody.
	   The former deputy prime minister arrived at the maximum-security
Sungai Buloh jail on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur 30 minutes
later, and waved to local reporters and photographers who were
waiting outside.
	   The end of Anwar's detention under the Internal Security Act
followed weeks of condemnation by domestic and international civil
rights groups that decried the law allowing indefinite imprisonment
without trial.
	   Several world leaders expressed sympathy for Anwar, who was
arrested hours after he organized a mammoth rally in the capital
Sept. 20 to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Malaysia's ruler for 17 years.
	   On Wednesday, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he and
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie were considering writing a joint
letter to Mahathir urging him to hold Anwar under house arrest
instead of in prison during his trial.
	   Anwar was taken to a court nine days after his arrest, badly
bruised and with a black eye. He said police had beaten him until
he fell unconscious on his first night of detention. He was advised
to wear a neck brace after a medical examination.
	   Anwar puts his predicament down to the challenge he posed to
Mahathir. Among other things, the two had differed over policy for
dealing with Malaysia's economic recession. The prime minister says
his former heir-apparent was too immoral to rule. Anwar was fired
Sept. 2.
	   A police spokesman said Anwar did not threaten national security
anymore.
	   ``We've released him from the ISA because we have finished our
investigations on him,'' Ghazali Amin said.
	   That leaves him in a regular prison, where he is expected to be
allowed family visits and regular consultations with his lawyers.
	   Since his arrest, Anwar had been held in a cell at the Bukit
Aman federal police headquarters. Those detained under the ISA can
be secluded from family and lawyers and held in a secret place.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated about their role as
defense attorneys. Until last week, lawyers were denied access to
Anwar at police headquarters.
	   ``If he's treated as an ordinary person accused in court, he has
all the rights of an individual under the law,'' said Kamar Ainiah,
a lawyer who is part of his defense team.
	   Beginning Nov. 2, Anwar faces trial on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts _ all charges he denies. He has been
denied bail by the High Court trial judge.
	   His lawyers have appealed against that order, and now are
hopeful of winning bail _ something not possible under the ISA.
	   ``The courts can now consider his rights to bail. Under the ISA,
the court was powerless to do so,'' Kamar Ainiah said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada said
Wednesday his recent public calls for better treatment for ousted
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim signal a new role for
the Philippines as an advocate of human rights in Asia.
	   He said the role is natural for his country because of its own
history of human rights abuses under the late strongman Ferdinand
Marcos.
	   ``We have experienced this under martial law. We've gone through
it ourselves,'' he said.
	   Estrada has made a number of public statements about Anwar's
Sept. 20 arrest and subsequent beatings while in police custody.
The chastisement of a neighboring country is unusual in Southeast
Asia, where governments customarily avoid mutual criticisms.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has also expressed concern
over Anwar's treatment. Habibie and Estrada met Tuesday night on an
Indonesian island near Singapore specifically to discuss Anwar's
arrest and how they should respond, Estrada said.
	   Both presidents have suggested they might not attend a meeting
in Malaysia next month of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum because of Anwar's situation.
	   Estrada, who is in Singapore this week on a state visit, said he
and Habibie are considering writing a joint letter to Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urging him to hold Anwar under
house arrest instead of in prison during his trial and provide him
due process of law.
	   ``As heads of state we are free to express our views when they
relate to human rights and due process of law,'' Estrada said.
``But we don't mean to interfere. We are just explaining our
opinion.''
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir in early September after differences
over economic policy. He then began criticizing Mahathir publicly
and was subsequently arrested on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct. He has appeared at court hearings with a black eye,
bruises and a neck brace.
	   Estrada said he believes Anwar is innocent.
	   ``I admire Anwar. I believe he's an honest man,'' he said.
	   Philippine and Indonesian officials said Estrada and Habibie
have not yet decided whether to attend the APEC meetings in
Malaysia's capital. A boycott of the meetings would be a severe
diplomatic slap at Malaysia's government.
	   Estrada's visit to Singapore is his first state visit since
winning election in May on a pro-poor platform.
	   In his first major overseas speech, Estrada received loud
applause Tuesday when he mentioned Anwar's case and respect for
human rights.
	   Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said he believes
Estrada is ``tending toward going'' to APEC because the meeting is
``important for the Philippines and for the entire Asian region.''
	   If Habibie passes up APEC, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said, it will be because ``he has difficulty leaving the
country while there is no vice president, while there are so many
problems to deal with.''
	   ``I am not yet in a position to say definitely that the
president will be there,'' Alatas said.
	   Habibie has already canceled a state visit to Malaysia, citing
difficulties at home.

China, Taiwan to hold highest meeting in five years

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan prepared for their
highest-level meeting in five years Wednesday, amid mixed signals
that the estranged rivals from the Chinese civil war were ready to
resume formal negotiations.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, was given a warm but
subdued welcome by Chinese officials inside the exit ramp from his
commercial airplane at the Shanghai airport Wednesday afternoon. He
then headed to meet his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, for what
was billed as an informal get-together.
	   The billing _ something less than formal talks _ illustrates the
distrust that has frustrated efforts to restart negotiations
Beijing broke off three years ago. Angered by Taiwan's perceived
drift away from eventual reunification, Beijing then launched
missiles and war games near the island, raising tensions to their
worst level since the height of the Cold War.
	   Wang, an 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, and Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and
senior figure in Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, head
government-backed organizations that handle mainland-island ties in
the absence of formal relations.
	   The elder statesmen held their first and last meeting in
Singapore in 1993, ushering in a brief period of cooperation.
Expectations were high that their second sit-down would improve the
atmosphere if not formally re-establish routine negotiations
between their offices.
	   On the eve of Koo's arrival, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang looked forward to the meeting as a ``major event'' in
relations. Koo, meanwhile, called his trip ``a starting point for
rebuilding trust.''
	   After two days in Shanghai sightseeing, talking with Wang and
attending an opera together, Koo will travel to Beijing to meet
President Jiang and top officials handling Taiwan affairs and
attend banquets.
	   But Beijing and Taipei have also restated old, divisive
negotiating positions. Chinese spokesman Tang said China wants
revived talks to focus on political issues leading to
reunification. He repeated a 3 1/2-year-old proposal that would
allow the island to keep its capitalist system and military as long
as it submits to Beijing's rule.
	   Taiwan has rejected that autonomy formula and said reunification
should wait until China is more democratic and prosperous.
Meanwhile, it wants talks to focus on practical issues, like
fishing disputes, to build confidence.
	   Taiwan's top Cabinet official on mainland affairs, Chang
King-yu, urged Beijing to be pragmatic, firstly by recognizing that
the two sides are ruled separately. Ever since Mao Tse-tung's
Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland
in 1949, China has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province to be
retaken by force if necessary.
	   Economic and political pressures are edging both sides toward a
short-term accommodation.
	   Trade last year totaled dlrs 26.4 billion and Taiwanese
businesses have invested dlrs 38 billion in the mainland over the
past decade. Airlines and shippers are establishing routes that
only thinly respect Taiwan's ban on direct contacts with China.
	   Better ties with China could help the Nationalists win business
community support in December's general elections. Likewise,
Chinese President Jiang is believed to be under pressure from the
military and Communist Party hard-liners to get Taiwan to agree to
reunification.

Two Serbian dailies banned for defying censorship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Belgrade independent newspapers
failed to appear on newsstands Wednesday, one day after Serbian
police stormed and shut down the publication offices for violating
a recent government decree requiring self-censorship during NATO
threats.
	   The action against Dnevni Telegraf and Danas, both often
critical of the autocratic Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
triggered strong protests Wednesday _ one day after Milosevic
announced the NATO threat was off due to an agreement he reached
with U.S. negotiators to stop violence in the southern Serb
province of Kosovo.
	   Serbia is the larger of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia.
	   The decree, hastily brought last week without any discussion in
the parliament, broadened the government's authority to punish
companies, institutions and individuals who act contrary to its
view of patriotic behavior. It forbade reporting on threats,
military preparations or any other developments, which could cause
alarm among Serbians.
	   Milosevic's authorities claim foreign and independent media
reports in Serbia made the Kosovo crisis and the resulting NATO
threats worse.
	   Dnevni Telegraf mocked the restrictive decree, publishing
regularly the developments under notes saying ``We have not
reported this''; ``Respecting the decree, we are not saying that''.
	   Reporters, editors and other staff in the two dailies protested
to the law enforcers who physically pushed them out of their
premises.
	   ``This is a barbaric act, an act of sheer violence,'' Nikola
Barovic, a lawyer and legal representative of Danas daily.
	   On Saturday, a popular radio station, Index, was shut down.

Report: 1,200 workers protest in central China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official saying traffic accident, not protest,
occurred &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 1,200 factory workers protested outside
government offices in a central China city after a local company
went bust, taking their savings with it, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   The demonstration Monday in Shiyan, in Hubei province about
1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Beijing, blocked a major
thoroughfare in the city, paralyzing traffic, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said hundreds of police were called in
to break up the protest and that 10 demonstrators were detained.
	   A Shiyan government official, Xiong Juguo, denied there was a
protest Monday but said there was an automobile accident near the
government's offices that drew a crowd of 100 to 200 people and
blocked traffic for a few minutes.
	   The crowd later dispersed of its own accord, he said. ``We have
not heard of such a large demonstration,'' he said.
	   The Information Center said the demonstrators were protesting
about a local company that applied for bankruptcy in June after
having collected 10 million yuan (dlrs 1.2 million) in investments
from factory workers in the city. The company offered high rates of
interest to those who invested, the center said.
	   Workers who invested in the company already had appealed
repeatedly to local authorities to recover their money, but had not
received a reply.

Government delaying peace accord, says former rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A tribal leader has warned the
government against delaying the 9-month-old peace accord aimed at
ending a bush war in the southeastern hills, United News of
Bangladesh news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Joytindra Bodhipriya Larma told a public rally at Khagrachari on
Tuesday that the government's approach was frustrating and creating
bottlenecks in implementing the accord.
	   Larma, a former guerrillas leader, has refused to join the
proposed Regional Council for Chittagong Hills, protesting the
inclusion of three Muslim settlers. He also wants the government to
withdraw all troops from the region.
	   Kalparanjan Chakma, a Cabinet minister negotiating with Larma,
said the demands could not be met overnight.
	   Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia on Tuesday bitterly
criticized the accord, saying it had yielded too much to the
tribespeople.
	   She accused the government of agreeing to hand over one-tenth of
the country's territory to the rebels, who are supported by
neighboring India.
	   The insurgency began after thousands of Muslims migrated to the
hills from overcrowded plains and grabbed land from the tribes,
largely Buddhist Chakmas. The violence has claimed more than 20,000
lives.

Yugoslav government reveals plan for Kosovo parliament

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic's
government has outlined a plan for a separate parliament in
autonomy-minded Kosovo, taking the first steps to comply with a
deal to avert airstrikes by NATO.
	   But the government has also closed down two independent
newspapers critical of the Milosevic administration, reinforcing
the suspicion that the Yugoslav president is using the crisis over
Kosovo to strengthen his grip on power.
	   The Kosovo plan, which calls for local elections in the
separatist province for 1999, was announced late Tuesday, a day
after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke reached a breakthrough in
efforts to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   The government statement, carried by the state-run Tanjug news
agency, appeared to recognize the likelihood of NATO airstrikes
unless Milosevic's violent crackdown in the southern province ends.
	   According to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have their
own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them. It
also offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected
war criminals.
	   Despite Milosevic's apparent backing down against the NATO
threat, it was clear that the Yugoslav president has no intention
of loosening his grip on power.
	   Late Tuesday, Serb police stormed the offices of independent
newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas late Tuesday and closed them
down for allegedly violating a recent government decree that
required self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   The newspapers, both often critical of the Milosevic government,
did not appear on newstands Wednesday. The decrees, issued last
week, banned reports on NATO threats, military preparations or any
other developments which could allegedly alarm the populace.
	   Dnevni Telegraf had been publishing such reports regularly under
headlines such as ``We have not reported this'' or ``respecting the
decree, we are not saying that:''On Saturday, a popular radio
station, Index, was shut down.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials made clear Tuesday that the
threat of airstrikes remained in place to pressure Milosevic to
honor his agreement with Holbrooke. They said the strikes could be
conducted any time after Friday, the deadline for Milosevic's
compliance.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international inspectors into the troubled Serb province
to verify compliance.
	   Full compliance should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants, an operation that has killed
hundreds _ most of them civilians _ and left up to 300,000 refugees
homeless.
	   Holbrooke said the key to the accord was Milosevic's decision to
allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to permit aerial
verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon as the
end of the week.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo accord, officials
admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the full complement of
2,000 international observers are on the ground.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
in Kosovo because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees
would die if they could not return to their homes by the time
winter sets in. However, many of those homes have been burned by
Serb forces.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989. But international leaders
oppose independence for Kosovo fearing that could lead to further
instability in the tense Balkans.
	   In a rare televised address, the first since the 1995 Dayton
Accord that ended the Bosnian war, Milosevic sought to portray his
agreement with Holbrooke as a victory, saying it averts ``the
danger of a military intervention against our country.''
	   ``The agreements ... are entirely in accordance with the
interests of our country,'' he added, citing ``enormous pressures
that we have been exposed to.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin returned to work in the
Kremlin on Wednesday, defying doctors' orders to stay home and
recover from a respiratory infection.
	   Yeltsin met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, and planned other working meetings
throughout the day, the presidential press service said.
	   It gave no other details.
	   However, Primakov told parliament earlier that Yeltsin
``telephoned me and I'm going to the Kremlin.'' He said that
Yeltsin was in his office ``despite a ban by doctors.''
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Tuesday that
doctors ordered the president to stay in bed and that he would not
be in the office all week.
	   Doctors insisted on Monday that Yeltsin fly home from a visit to
Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from
an upper respiratory infection, was coughing and running a fever.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago. He insist he has no
major illnesses and plans to serve out the remaining two years of
his term.
	   But whenever Yeltsin gets sick, there is speculation about his
ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin stumbled when he arrived Sunday in Tashkent, the capital
of Uzbekistan, and had to be supported by the Uzbek president. He
canceled public engagements, except for a state dinner at which he
made rambling remarks.
	   On Monday, the Russian leader turned up late for talks with
Uzbek officials, made some incoherent remarks interrupted by a bad
cough and abruptly cut short a scheduled news conference.
	   Several hours later, after arriving in neighboring Kazakstan,
doctors ordered him to return to Moscow.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The first secretary of the Saudi
Arabian Embassy in Australia has been found dead with his throat
cut in his apartment in the capital, police and diplomatic sources
said Wednesday.
	   Australian Federal Police agent Greg Ranse said the death of
Abdullah Al-Ghamdi was being treated as murder and that a number of
people had come forward with information.
	   Police were examining domestic, rather than international
motives for the killing, Ranse said.
	   There was no indication the death was politically motivated, an
Australian diplomatic source told The Associated Press, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   In a statement, the Saudi embassy said Al-Ghamdi, 54, failed to
appear or telephone the embassy on Tuesday.
	   ``A member of the diplomatic mission was sent to his residence
and after the door was opened, Al-Ghamdi was found lying on the
floor in the kitchen in a pool of blood,'' the statement said.
	   ``While the embassy wishes to know the reasons behind his murder
as soon as possible, it gratefully appreciates the big efforts that
the (Australian) Federal Police are working on.''
	   Australian Federal Police spokesman Eric Meyer said the body was
found in an apartment in the inner-Canberra suburb of Kingston,
close to Parliament House.
	   More than 40 officers were involved in a search of a field near
the apartment, which would continue Wednesday.
	   A spokesman for the Saudi embassy said he was not aware of
security measurers being stepped up.

Trial of journalist, accused of treason, is postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ A Russian navy officer, imprisoned on
treason charges for the past 11 months, went on trial Wednesday
only to see the case postponed.
	   Capt. Grigory Pasko, a reporter for the military newspaper
Boevaya Vakhta or Combat Vigil, has been accused of high treason
for allegedly passing classified information about the readiness of
the Russian Pacific Fleet onto Japanese media.
	   Pasko's lawyers called for the trial to be moved from the navy
court in Vladivostok to either the federal Supreme Court or to a
military court in another district. The lawyers said the heightened
press attention could influence the trial.
	   The court agreed to consider the request, and the trial was
postponed, probably for at least several weeks.
	   Pasko was returned to jail were he has been held since his
arrest on Nov. 20 of last year.
	   Lawyers for Pasko say that the documents he passed on to the
Japanese television station NHK and other outlets simply detailed
the environmental problems at several Russian Pacific Fleet bases.
	   Pasko's case has drawn the attention of national and
international human rights organizations and journalist groups.

New Amsterdam crackdown targets dogs _ and humans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Answering the call of nature has
become a crime in the Dutch capital for dogs _ and humans _ who
dare to do their thing in public places.
	   The Amsterdam police force announced new fines Tuesday as part
of an ambitious crackdown on pet owners who don't clean up after
their dogs, and on people who don't behave much better than
canines.
	   Effective immediately, dog owners will be fined 75 guilders
(dlrs 40) if they're caught letting their pets foul the sidewalks.
The fine for people who urinate in public is a bit less: 60
guilders (dlrs 32.50).
	   And for those citizens tempted to express their indignation by
lifting a finger in the direction of an officer, there's also a new
fine for insulting a policeman: 250 guilders (dlrs 135).
	   The fines are detailed in ``Streetwise,'' a manual mailed to the
homes of all 5,000 Amsterdam police officers. The crackdown also
slaps motorists who run red lights with a 50-guilder (dlrs 27)
fine, and subjects people who put their garbage out on the street a
day early to a penalty of 150 guilders (dlrs 80).
	   Bewildered capital prosecutors said they hadn't been consulted
and expressed concerns that the crackdown would further burden an
already clogged judicial system.
	   Amsterdammers, meanwhile, have been flooding police headquarters
with calls expressing outrage and fears that the new fines will
violate the spirit of traditional Dutch tolerance.
	   ``People are calling like crazy, asking whether we've launched a
witchhunt,'' said police spokesman Klaas Wilting. ``That's
certainly not the case. Everything is at the officers'
discretion.''

Yugoslav government reveals plan for Kosovo parliament

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic's
government has outlined a plan for a separate parliament in
autonomy-minded Kosovo, taking the first steps to comply with a
deal to avert airstrikes by NATO.
	   But the government also closed down two independent newspapers
critical of the Milosevic administration, reinforcing the suspicion
that the Yugoslav president is using the crisis over Kosovo to
strengthen his grip on power.
	   The Kosovo plan, which calls for local elections in the
separatist province for 1999, was announced late Tuesday, a day
after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke reached a breakthrough.
	   The government statement, carried by the state-run Tanjug news
agency, appeared to recognize the likelihood of NATO airstrikes
unless Milosevic's violent crackdown in the southern Serbian
province ends. Serbia is the dominant of the two republics that
make up Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989. But international leaders
oppose independence for Kosovo fearing that could lead to further
instability in the tense Balkans.
	   According to the government statement, Kosovo Albanians would
have their own parliament, judiciary and police. The government
said elections in Kosovo would be held within nine months and
invited foreign monitors to observe them. It also offered amnesty
for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected war criminals.
	   Despite Milosevic's apparent backing down, it was clear he has
no intention of loosening his grip on power. Late Tuesday, Serb
police stormed and closed the offices of independent newspapers
Dnevni Telegraf and Danas for violating a recent government decree
that required self-censorship during NATO threats.
	   The newspapers, both often critical of the Milosevic government,
did not appear on newstands Wednesday. The decrees, issued last
week, banned reports on NATO threats, military preparations or any
other developments which could allegedly alarm the populace.
	   Dnevni Telegraf had been publishing such reports regularly under
headlines such as ``We have not reported this'' or ``respecting the
decree, we are not saying that.'' On Saturday, a popular radio
station, Index, was shut down.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials made clear Tuesday that the
threat of airstrikes remained in place to pressure Milosevic to
honor his agreement. They said the strikes could be conducted any
time after Friday, the deadline for Milosevic's compliance.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international inspectors into Kosovo to verify
compliance.
	   Full compliance should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants, an operation that has killed
hundreds _ mostly civilians _ and left up to 300,000 refugees
homeless.
	   Holbrooke said the key to the accord was Milosevic's decision to
allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to permit aerial
verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon as the
end of the week.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   Despite the rush to implement the accord, officials admitted
Tuesday it could take weeks before the full complement of 2,000
international observers are on the ground.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
However, many of those homes have been burned by Serb forces.
	   In a rare televised address, the first since the 1995 Dayton
Accord that ended the Bosnian war, Milosevic sought to portray his
agreement with Holbrooke as a victory, saying it averts ``the
danger of a military intervention against our country.''
	   ``The agreements ... are entirely in accordance with the
interests of our country,'' he added, citing ``enormous pressures
that we have been exposed to.''

Tokyo stocks fall, dollar higher against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, bond, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell further Wednesday as
investors grew skeptical about the effectiveness of the
government's bank rescue plan. The U.S. dollar rose against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 172.06 points,
or 1.30 percent, closing at 13,070.73. On Tuesday, it had fallen
312.22 points, or 2.30 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 119.72 yen, up 1.34 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level
of 119.15 yen overnight. It ranged between 118.70 yen and 120.15
yen.
	   Stock investors avoided shares linked to domestic demand because
of the poor outlook for the Japanese economy, traders said. Worries
about economies abroad also pushed down international blue chips.
	   Players continued watching Japanese government efforts to rescue
the nation's bad loan-burdened banking system and find ways to
stimulate the economy out of recession.
	   ``It's difficult to find shares to buy,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a
manager at the stock trading division at Tokyo Securities. He said
the market will likely remain near current levels in the near term.
	   On Tuesday, Parliament's lower house passed a bill that would
let the government pump taxpayer money into banks to induce them to
lend more. The bill is expected to pass the upper house Friday.
	   But investors are concerned that many banks won't apply for the
funds because the conditions for receiving money are extremely
harsh. While many government officials have suggested forcing banks
to accept funds, such a plan hasn't been approved yet.
	   The problem of Japan's debt-saddled banks is a major factor
behind the nation's deepest recession in decades. Unless quickly
resolved, economists say, the crisis could further affect
economically devastated Asian countries and slow global growth.
	   The market's current focus is on the conditions under which the
government would disburse public funds to weak but viable banks,
traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.80 points, or 1.48 percent, to 984.18. It
had fallen 24.36 points, or 2.38 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the yen amid growing notions
among Japanese investors and traders that dollar selling by U.S.
hedge funds has peaked for now.
	   The currency had gained support from comments by U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who reiterated that a strong
dollar is in the United States' best interests.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.850 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.830 percent,
with its price remaining at 108.68 yen.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities have detained a priest, a nun and
dozens of members of the underground Catholic church in northern
China's Hebei province, according to a U.S.-based advocacy group
for the church.
	   The detentions occurred Aug. 15, the date of the Feast of the
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, an important date in the
Catholic calendar, Joseph Kung, director of the Cardinal Kung
Foundation, said in a statement received Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Father Wei Jingkun, a priest in the underground church in
Baoding, Hebei, was detained while leading a Mass at a nearby
village and remains in police custody. Six members of the church
were also either detained or fined, the report said. It said
further details on the status of the detained church members were
not available.
	   The group said Sister Zhang Yanzhi, a nun in the underground
church, was arrested and detained for 15 days for teaching
catechism to children. Another woman, Xie Suqian, who allowed the
catechism class to meet in her home, remains in detention, it said.
	   The children caught in the class were later forced to stand
while attending classes at school, the group reported, although it
said it was uncertain whether the punishment continued.
	   Police also stopped a group of about 100 church members who were
traveling to attend an early morning Mass and ordered them to turn
back. The report said 11 of them were detained for 15 days and
fined between 800 and 1,000 yuan (dlrs 97-120).
	   It said another priest, whose name the group withheld for
``security reasons,'' escaped when police arrived at a pear orchard
where about 1,000 families were preparing to attend a Mass. Several
organizers of the Mass were detained, but details were not
available, the group said.
	   China's underground Roman Catholic church remains loyal to the
Vatican and rejects the state-approved Catholic church, autonomous
from Rome, that was set up by the government in the 1950s.
	   Many clerics and adherents of the underground church have been
imprisoned for refusing to participate in the official Catholic
church.

U.S. officials return to Serb Republic, Germans stay out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy here
authorized all American officials to return to the Serb-held half
of Bosnia on Wednesday after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
	   Over the past few days, many American and other Western
officials left Serb-dominated areas in Bosnia as a precaution
against possible retaliation that could follow NATO airstrikes in
neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   A new travel advisory for Americans underlines that military
action against Serbia and Montenegro ``remains likely, should
Milosevic fail to implement the commitment he has made.'' But it
indicated that the possibility of immediate airstrikes has
decreased.
	   The advisory encouraged all private American citizens returning
to the Bosnian Serb Republic to remain in close touch with the U.S.
Embassy in Sarajevo and ``to be prepared to leave ... again on very
short notice.''
	   A German official said German nationals will remain out of the
Serb-held half of Bosnia for the moment. Fearing retaliation, the
German embassy to Bosnia closed its office in the northwestern,
biggest Serb-held town of Banja Luka a few days ago.
	   Threatened by the airstrikes, Milosevic agreed to withdraw
special forces from Kosovo, begin peace talks with separatist
ethnic Albanians and allow international observers into the
troubled Serb province.
	   NATO officials said they hadn't called off the airstrikes, and
that they could still bomb any time after Friday, the deadline for
Milosevic's compliance.
	   Yugoslav officials have vowed their military will retaliate in
case of any NATO actions. Serb hard-liners in Yugoslavia and Bosnia
share the goal of creating a greater Serbia, and Western officials
fear any retaliation in case of NATO military intervention could
spread into Bosnia.

Report: 1,200 workers protest in central China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with report of another protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 1,200 factory workers protested outside
government offices in a central China city after a local company
went bust, taking their savings with it, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   The demonstration Monday in Shiyan, in Hubei province about
1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Beijing, blocked a major
thoroughfare in the city, paralyzing traffic, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said hundreds of police were called in
to break up the protest and 10 demonstrators were detained.
	   A Shiyan government official, Xiong Juguo, denied there was a
protest Monday, but said an automobile accident near the
government's offices drew a crowd of 100 to 200 people and blocked
traffic for a few minutes.
	   People dispersed of their own accord, he said. ``We have not
heard of such a large demonstration,'' he said.
	   The Information Center said the demonstrators in Shiyan were
protesting about a local company that applied for bankruptcy in
June after having collected 10 million yuan (dlrs 1.2 million) in
investments from factory workers in the city. The company offered
high rates of interest to those who invested, the center said.
	   Workers who invested in the company already had appealed
repeatedly to local authorities to recover their money, but had not
received a reply.
	   Meanwhile, 200 laid-off workers in the central city of Wuhan,
Hubei's provincial capital, staged a sit-down protest Wednesday
against a decision to halve their unemployment payments to 100 yuan
(dlrs 12) a month, the Information Center said.
	   Holding placards that read ``We want to eat,'' and ``We will
struggle to the end,'' the protesters disrupted traffic on a major
road, causing a 2-kilometer- (1 1/4-mile-)long traffic jam, the
group said.
	   A Wuhan police spokesman denied that a protest took place.

Report: Lockheed chooses Israeli industries to upgrade F-16
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution, CLARIFIES several Israeli companies
taking part, EDITS to conform

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin has chosen
Israel Aircraft Industries and other Israeli companies as its
partners in a consortium to upgrade F-16 fighter bombers throughout
the world, IAI said Wednesday.
	   The consortium will include Elbit Systems, El-Op electro-optics,
Elta, Elisra and the state-run Arms Development Authority, also
known as Rafael, IAI spokeswoman Sylvia Bet-Halahmi said.
	   The agreement is to be signed Thursday at a business convention
being held in Jerusalem.
	   Lockheed President Vance Coffman met Tuesday with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   Since the 1970s, about 3,600 F-16s have been manufactured and
Lockheed has orders for another 300 in the next five years, the
newspaper Haaretz said.
	   Lockheed's next generation fighter, the F-22, will be much more
expensive and therefore many air forces around the world are
expected to upgrade their existing fleets of F-16s.
	   The average cost of upgrading an F-16 is about dlrs 3 million,
depending on which new avionic systems are installed, Haaretz said.
	   Also to be signed Thursday is an agreement between the American
Raytheon Systems Company and Elta, a subsidiary of IAI, on
development, production and marketing of airborne early warning and
command and control systems.

Government rejects opposition calls for summit meeting outside
</HEADLINE>
Cambodia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The government on Wednesday rejected
the opposition's demands for a meeting of top political leaders
outside the country, but the ruling party stopped short of taking
the same position.
	   The party of strongman Hun Sen and the two-party opposition have
asked King Norodom Sihanouk to chair a summit meeting in hopes the
monarch can mediate a breakthrough in stalled talks to form the
next government.
	   Both opposition parties have asked Sihanouk to hold the meeting
outside the country. They say the political environment in Cambodia
is too hostile for them to negotiate freely.
	   But the government will not join in talks outside Cambodia
because of sovereignty issues and the high travel costs, spokesman
Sieng LaPresse said Wednesday.
	   ``Cambodia is an independent and sovereign state. We don't have
any more foreign forces invading our country, so problems should be
solved by Cambodians inside Cambodia,'' Sieng LaPresse said.
	   The spokesman said the cash-strapped government had already
overspent itself at a September summit led by the king at his royal
residence in the northwestern Cambodian town of Siem Reap.
	   That meeting led to the ceremonial opening of parliament, but
efforts last week by the three parties to convene the legislature's
first session did not succeed.
	   Hun Sen's party won a national election in July, capturing 64 of
122 seats in parliament, but fell short of the two-thirds majority
necessary to form a government alone.
	   The opposition claims Hun Sen's victory was achieved through
fraud and intimidation, and has been reluctant to cooperate with
the ruling party until its allegations are thoroughly investigated.
	   A senior opposition politician said Wednesday it appeared
inappropriate for the government to hold a position on talks
between political parties.
	   ``I think this summit has to be decided among the political
parties,'' said Tol Lah, secretary-general of the senior opposition
party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   A spokesman for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party stopped short
Wednesday of endorsing the government statement, saying that the
ruling party maintains its previous position that it will abide by
the king's choice of venue.
	   ``The CPP stance is a bit different,'' party spokesman Khieu
Kanharith said. ``We think the meetings should be held in Cambodia,
but we will wait for the king's decision.''
	   The opposition has suggested Beijing as an appropriate location
for a summit because the king has plans to travel to the Chinese
capital for medical treatment.
	   The 75-year-old monarch delayed his trip to Beijing at the
request of Hun Sen and arrived in Phnom Penh from Siem Reap on Oct.
5.
	   Sihanouk stated in a letter Monday to junior opposition party
leader Sam Rainsy that he would have to consult with Hun Sen and
ruling party president Chea Sim on a foreign venue.

Report: Lockheed chooses Israeli industries to upgrade F-16
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution, CLARIFIES several Israeli companies
taking part, EDITS to conform

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin has chosen
Israel Aircraft Industries and other Israeli companies as partners
in a consortium to upgrade F-16 fighter bombers worldwide, IAI said
Wednesday.
	   The consortium will include Elbit Systems, El-Op electro-optics,
Elta, Elisra and the state-run Arms Development Authority, also
known as Rafael, IAI spokeswoman Sylvia Bet-Halahmi said.
	   The agreement is to be signed Thursday at a business convention
in Jerusalem.
	   Lockheed President Vance Coffman met Tuesday with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   Since the 1970s, about 3,600 F-16s have been manufactured and
Lockheed has orders for another 300 in the next five years, the
newspaper Haaretz said.
	   Lockheed's next generation fighter, the F-22, will be much more
expensive and therefore many air forces around the world are
expected to upgrade their existing fleets of F-16s.
	   The average cost of upgrading an F-16 is about dlrs 3 million,
depending on which new avionic systems are installed, Haaretz said.
	   Also to be signed Thursday is an agreement between the American
Raytheon Systems Company and Elta, a subsidiary of IAI, on
development, production and marketing of airborne early warning and
command and control systems.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Israeli-Palestinian summit beginning
Thursday in the United States could break the stalemate in the
peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday.
	   ``I believe every person in the Israeli government and in the
Israeli people hopes this (summit) will succeed,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein is abroad.
	   The Israeli prime minister returned home by helicopter
afterwards to fly to the United States where he is due to start
intensive negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a
resort outside Washington on Thursday.
	   ``It is very clear that if the Palestinians live up to their
commitments in all the fields _ but most of them touch on security
_ then we shall have the ability to conclude a successful agreement
for advancing the peace,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu said the Hebron accord signed last year with the
Palestinians last year provided a mechanism for fighting terrorism
which, he added, imperiled not only Israeli security, but could
also ``take route in the Palestinian population.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is hosting the summit which will
discuss a longstanding U.S. proposal for Israeli troops to withdraw
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has proposed
a modification in terms of which 3 percent of the land handed-over
will remain effectively under its control.
	   Arafat visited Jordan on Monday for similar consultations.
	   Standing next to Netanyahu, Hassan said that Israel and the
Palestinians should move swiftly toward a final settlement with the
Palestinians so that Israel can conclude similar agreements with
Lebanon and Syria.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
pushing for a settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the
core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Jordan is the first since relations chilled
in September 1997 after a botched attempt by the Israeli secret
service to kill a Palestinian militant leader in Jordan.

World's newest nuclear states meet to try to build peace

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Seeking to ease fears of a nuclear
confrontation, top officials from rival neighbors India and
Pakistan _ the world's newest nuclear states _ will meet Thursday
to discuss safeguards.
	   At the heart of the four-day talks will be the disputed region
of Kashmir _ the flash point of two previous wars _ which has
soured relations between the two South Asian countries since
independence from Britain 51 years ago.
	   Many fear the protracted dispute could cause a nuclear
conflagration on the Asian subcontinent, home to more than one
billion people, one-fourth of the world's population.
	   The big worry among nuclear non-proliferationists is that the
talks will become the first step toward rationalizing the
deployment of nuclear weapons.
	   ``They could be taking a step down the road to deployment,
minimum deterrence,'' said Sameena Ahmed, a defense expert with the
Asia Foundation and co-author of ``Pakistan and The Bomb.'' ``If
India deploys, Pakistan deploys, then Chinese missiles target
India'' and the spiral begins.
	   Neither side expects an early resolution to the talks.
	   ``A dialogue like this is a process to start ... but it also is
clear that one cannot expect breakthroughs on issues like this in
the very first meeting, so we are not expecting any major
breakthrough,'' Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told The
Associated Press.
	   For the past 10 years, an estimated 600,000 Indian soldiers and
security guards have been trying to quell a secessionist movement
by Muslim militants demanding either outright independence or union
with Islamic Pakistan.
	   Kashmir is the only Muslim-dominated state in majority Hindu
India. New Delhi routinely accuses Islamabad of fomenting violence
on its side of the border as well as arming and training militants.
	   Pakistan, which denies the accusations, wants a vote to let
Kashmiris decide whether to join India or Pakistan. Kashmiris, not
been invited to these talks, hope to be eventually included.
	   ``This should pave the way for tri-partite talks ... at some
later stage we should also be involved,'' said Saddar Atiq, a
former lawmaker in the legislature in Pakistan-ruled Kashmir.
	   Officials in India and Pakistan have refused to go into
specifics, but the talks will be closely watched by world leaders
who want the two nations to make some progress on measures that
will prevent a nuclear arms race.
	   ``With the nuclearization of South Asia, it has become a flash
point' of a possible nuclear confrontation, Aziz said. ``We want
the United Nations and the United States to keep track of and
follow the negotiations.''
	   The Indian Express on Wednesday quoted a U.S. State Department
official as saying that the U.S. administration has made
suggestions to both sides: Don't mount nuclear warheads on missiles
and store warheads in different sites from the missile batteries.
	   Pakistan wants to avoid a nuclear arms race, but ``if India
deploys nuclear weapons Pakistan will deploy nuclear weapons,''
Aziz said.
	   A senior Indian official, who spoke on the customary condition
that he not be identified, said new Delhi is not interested in a
new arms race, nor does it want to destabilize Pakistan.
	   Military and security analysts say confidence-building measures
are the most that can be expected. However, confidence-building
measures collapse in times of crisis, Ahmed said.
	   ``There has been little consistency, no transparency and no real
effort to institutionalize confidence-building measures that should
stay in place when political relations are not good,'' she said.

Official: Belarusian Orthodox priest killed by robbers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The killing of a well-known Belarusian
Orthodox priest was apparently motivated by robbery, a police
official said Wednesday.
	   The body of Father Mikhail Satsyuk, secretary of the
Brest-Kobrinsk diocese, was found Tuesday in the back seat of his
Volkswagen car in a forest near the town of Brest, said police
spokesman Maj. Viktor Vasilevsky.
	   He had been stabbed 12 times, Vasilevsky said.
	   Investigators believe that after the attack, killers broke into
Father Mikhail's office at the church, cracked open his safe and
stole a number of gold crosses and other jewelry, Vasilevsky said.
	   Father Mikhail, 46, was one of the most popular and respected
priests of the Belarusian Orthodox Church. He was last seen alive
Monday evening, when he left the church to drive to a village near
Brest, 360 kilometers (223 miles) west of the capital, Minsk,
Vasilevsky said.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police stormed the offices of
two Belgrade independent newspapers late Tuesday and shut them down
for allegedly violating a recent government decree that required
self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   The newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas, both often critical of
the autocratic President Slobodan Milosevic, did not appear on
newstands Wednesday, triggering strong protests against the latest
crackdown on media not under state control.
	   ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and this must be
stopped,'' the manager and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf, Slavko
Curuvija, told The Associated Press. ``Until now we could at least
write about it, now we can't even do that.''

Hong Kong shares fall as investors cash in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks finished moderately lower
Wednesday as investors cashed in on gains built up in the past five
sessions.
	   After a session of choppy trading, the Hang Seng Index, the
market's key indicator of blue chips, was down 168.82 points, or
1.9 percent, closing at 8,840.01. On Tuesday, the index had gained
18.56 points, or 0.2 percent.
	   Analysts said investors taking profits in the afternoon dragged
down the index, which had soared 19 percent in the previous five
sessions.
	   The market ``is likely to be more quiet in the short term,''
said John Lo, equity salesman at BNP Prime Peregrine Securities
Ltd.
	   Trading volume was 6.77 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 879
million), compared with 7.20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
935 million) Tuesday.
	   Losers outnumbered gainers. The day's biggest losers were Hang
Seng Bank, down 3.75 Hong Kong dollars to 55.25; Hutchison Whampoa,
down 1.20 to 48.30; and Swire Pacific ``A,'' down 1.25 to 26.25.
	   HSBC Holdings, the largest capitalized stock, remaining
unchanged at 158.50.
	   Among gainers were Henderson Land, up 0.40 to 32.20, and New
World Development, up 0.35 to 32.20.
	   Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay Pacific lost 0.45, closing at
7.80.

Cook: We'll be watching Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook sent a clear
warning to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Wednesday that NATO
is watching him closely.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview
Wednesday morning, adding that the 16-nation NATO alliance is still
ready to strike if necessary.
	   ``The united consensus within NATO that we were ready to take
military action was there at the beginning of the week, is still
there and that decision is still on the table,'' he said. ``We can
reactivate these plans any time we feel it is necessary to do so.''
	   Cook said the agreement with Milosevic this week as the threat
of military force loomed was just the beginning of NATO's effort to
force reforms in the Kosovo province.
	   ``This is not an ending, nobody should imagine that this
agreement marks the end of an episode,'' Cook said. ``This is a
beginning. It's the start of a process. Britain played a leading
part in getting this agreement. We're determined to play a leading
part in making it work.''
	   Facing a NATO deadline, Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, initiate autonomy negotiations with the
separatist ethnic Albanians and allow a force of as many as 2,000
international observers to ensure U.N. demands are met. Those
concessions, Cook said, represented a ``remarkable climb-down'' for
the Serbian leader.
	   The real test of the agreement, Cook said, will be NATO's
ability to get refugees back to their homes.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese bankruptcies rose in September, pushing
the debt left over from failed businesses for the month to more
than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 25 billion), a post-war high, a research
agency said Wednesday.
	   Corporate bankruptcies rose 17.9 percent from the year-earlier
month to 1,518 cases _ including the massive failure of Japan
Leasing Corp., private credit research agency Teikoku Databank Ltd.
said.
	   Debt left behind by insolvent companies in September soared
370.9 percent from a year earlier to 3.039 trillion yen (dlrs 25.5
billion), the largest amount for any month since World War II,
Teikoku said.
	   The previous record was 2.746 trillion yen (dlrs 23.1 billion),
posted in December 1997.
	   The major reason for September's surge in bankruptcy debt was
the failure of Japan Leasing, a financial affiliate of troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   Japan Leasing had debt of 2.180 trillion yen (dlrs 18.3
billion), making it Japan's largest-ever bankruptcy filing.
	   Japan's recession, the deepest in 50 years, has hit hard at
financial companies, which are also weighed down by mountains of
bad debt left over from the collapse of the speculative real estate
bubble in the early 1990s.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LG Chemical Corp. of South Korea said
Wednesday it will build a dlrs 320 million engineering plastics
plant in South Korea in a 50-50 joint venture with Dow Chemical Co.
of the United States.
	   Construction will begin in the first half of 1999 in the Yochon
petrochemical industrial complex on the south coast and is due to
be completed in 2001, it said.
	   The plant, or LG Dow Polycarbonate Ltd., will have an annual
production capacity of 130,000 tons of polycarbonate, a plastics
material used in compact discs, mobile phones and car interiors,
the company said.
	   ``Despite the tough economic conditions in the Asia-Pacific
region, polycarbonate is early in its product life cycle and is
expected to grow at a double digit rate in this region,'' an LG
news release quoted Dow Chemical executive Anthony Carbone as
saying.
	   The plant will export dlrs 200 million worth of polycarbonate a
year and also meet rising demand at home, LG officials said. South
Korea meets half of its polycarbonate needs with imports.
	   Dow Chemical is the world's No. 5 chemical company with annual
sales estimated at dlrs 20 billion. LG Chemical, a unit of South
Korean conglomerate LG, is the country's largest chemical company
with dlrs 4 billion in 1997 sales.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A top media company has filed for
protection under Thailand's recently instituted bankruptcy law, a
company employee said Tuesday.
	   The Manager Media Group filed jointly with the Thai Farmers Bank
and the Thai Military Bank, making an agreement with the two
creditors to work out a rehabilitation plan for the company, said
the employee, who asked not to be named.
	   At its height, Sondhi's media empire included a regional
English-language daily meant to challenge The Asian Wall Street
Journal, an English-language business monthly and a Los Angeles
lifestyle magazine, a photo agency, a broadcasting satellite
concession, and a dozen Thai-language publications.
	   Like most publishers in the region, the company took a severe
beating from rising costs and falling revenues caused by the
region's economic crisis last year. Only three publications remain.
	   The Manager group owed Thai Military Bank 176 million baht (dlrs
4.4 million) and Thai Farmers Bank 467 million baht (dlrs 11.7
million), according to the report in Manager Daily.
	   The company owed a total of more than 1.5 billion baht (dlrs
37.5 million) to all of its creditors, it said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved
reviving a scaled-down version of an elevated rail project that was
halted in January when the government terminated its contract with
Hong Kong-based contractor Hopewell.
	   The plan, approved in principle, calls for the state railway to
make most of the investment, now reduced to less than half the
original 80 billion baht (dlrs 2.1 billion). The state railway
would invest 23.72 billion baht (dlrs 619.3 million), and the
private sector 12.88 billion baht (dlrs 336.4 million).
	   Transport Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told reporters the
government planned to borrow 30 billion baht (dlrs 783.3 million)
from the German government and state-owned development bank
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau to get the stalled project running.
	   In January, the government terminated the contract between the
Thai unit of Gordon Wu's Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings Ltd. and
the Transport Ministry to build a multi-layered road and rail
system in Bangkok.
	   Thai authorities said they terminated the contract due to long
delays.
	   Hopewell's Wu said recently the company is seeking 100 billion
baht (dlrs 2.6 billion) in compensation for termination of the
contract. But the government maintains it suffered losses from
delays in construction and will not pay compensation.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Belgrade independent newspapers
failed to appear on newsstands Wednesday, one day after Serbian
police stormed and shut down the publication offices for violating
a recent government decree requiring self-censorship during NATO
threats.
	   The action against Dnevni Telegraf and Danas, both often
critical of the autocratic Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
triggered strong protests Wednesday _ one day after Milosevic
announced the NATO threat was off due to an agreement he reached
with U.S. negotiators to stop violence in the southern Serb
province of Kosovo.
	   Serbia is the larger of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia.
	   The decree, hastily brought last week without any discussion in
the parliament, broadened the government's authority to punish
companies, institutions and individuals who act contrary to its
view of patriotic behavior. It forbade reporting on threats,
military preparations or any other developments, which could cause
alarm among Serbians.
	   Milosevic's authorities claim foreign and independent media
reports in Serbia made the Kosovo crisis and the resulting NATO
threats worse.
	   Dnevni Telegraf mocked the restrictive decree, publishing
regularly the developments under notes saying ``We have not
reported this''; ``Respecting the decree, we are not saying that''.
	   ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and this must be
stopped,'' the manager and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf, Slavko
Curuvija, told The Associated Press. ``Until now we could at least
write about it, now we can't even do that.''

U.S. says Anwar case being watched, but most will attend APEC

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite concerns about the arrest and police
treatment of Malaysia's former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim,
most leaders will attend a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur next month, a U.S. assistant
secretary of state said Wednesday.
	   The United States is ``deeply worried about .. the horrifying
treatment of one of the most respected of the new generation of
Asian leadership,'' Stanley Roth, in charge of East Asian and
Pacific affairs, told a news conference.
	   Roth also said the U.S. government was displeased that Malaysia
had recently pulled out of annual military exercises with
Singapore, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. Despite tensions
exacerbated by the economic crisis, and historical differences
between Singapore and Malaysia, Roth said the military exercises
had been a stabilizing factor.
	   Attending the East Asia Economic Summit, which Anwar was to have
addressed, Roth said the U.S. government was worried about the
Malaysian politician's detention without access to family or
lawyers, and even more concerned when Anwar finally appeared in
court with a black eye and bruises ``from a beating.''
	   Nevertheless, Roth said, the APEC meeting is not a Malaysian
event, but a regional one. The rotation for serving as host
happened to fall to Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``I think that most people have made it clear that they intend
to go,'' he said. ``There is a consensus among the leadership that,
despite the internal developments in Kuala Lumpur, that this is a
very important meeting.''
	   He said the White House had made it clear that U.S. President
Bill Clinton is attending an international conference, not making a
state or official visit to Malaysia. Roth said no meeting between
Clinton and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been
scheduled at this point.
	   Anwar was fired Sept. 2 and arrested Sept. 20. Malaysian police
confirmed earlier Wednesday that Anwar had been released from
detention under the Internal Security Act, which allowed police to
prohibit him from seeing visitors. He was transferred from a police
jail to a regular prison to await trial Nov. 2 on charges of
corruption in connection with allegations of illegal homosexual
activity.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie met Tuesday night specifically to discuss Anwar, whom
both have described as a friend.
	   Neither Estrada nor Habibie has decided whether to attend APEC,
their foreign ministers said.

Netanyahu says stalemate could be broken at U.S. summit

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The upcoming Israeli-Palestinian summit in
the United States could break the stalemate in the Mideast peace
process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday.
	   ``I believe every person in the Israeli government and in the
Israeli people hopes this (summit) will succeed,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein is abroad.
	   Netanyahu returned home by helicopter afterward to fly to the
United States, where he is due to start intensive negotiations
Thursday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a resort outside
Washington.
	   ``It is very clear that if the Palestinians live up to their
commitments in all the fields _ but most of them touch on security
_ then we shall have the ability to conclude a successful agreement
for advancing the peace,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said the Hebron accord signed last year with the
Palestinians provided a mechanism for fighting terrorism, which has
imperiled not only Israeli security, but could also ``take root in
the Palestinian population.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is hosting the four-day summit which
will discuss a longstanding U.S. proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has proposed
a modification in terms of which 3 percent of the land handed-over
will remain effectively under its control.
	   Arafat visited Jordan on Monday for similar consultations.
	   Standing next to Netanyahu, Hassan said Israel and the
Palestinians should move swiftly toward a final settlement with the
Palestinians so that Israel can conclude similar agreements with
Lebanon and Syria.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
pushing for a settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the
core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Jordan is the first since relations chilled
in September 1997 after a botched attempt by the Israeli secret
service to kill a Palestinian militant leader in Jordan.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will participate in the OSCE mission to verify
Serb compliance with a U.S.-brokered deal to end the fighting in
Kosovo, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini announced Tuesday.
	   The agreement calls for 2,000 unarmed observers in Kosovo to
verify progress toward peace between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will
oversee the verification force.
	   Under the deal, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised
to stop fighting Albanian secessionists in Kosovo and let refugees
go home. He also agreed to permit to let NATO aircraft make
verification flights.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov saying Yeltsin feels well, talked about
Kosovo. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
work in the Kremlin on Wednesday, defying doctors' orders to stay
home and recover from a respiratory infection.
	   Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, and planned other working meetings throughout the
day, Russian news agencies said.
	   ``The president feels well,'' Primakov said after the meeting,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. He said Yeltsin waved his hand
``when we reminded him that he should stay in bed during his
illness'' and said of his doctors: ``Don't listen to them.''
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Tuesday that
doctors ordered the president to stay in bed and that he would not
be in the office all week.
	   Doctors insisted on Monday that Yeltsin fly home from a visit to
Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from
an upper respiratory infection, was coughing and running a fever.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago. He insist he has no
major illnesses and plans to serve out the remaining two years of
his term.
	   But whenever Yeltsin gets sick, there is speculation about his
ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to
Central Asia. He canceled most of his public engagements in
Uzbekistan, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling
remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.
	   Shortly after arriving in neighboring Kazakstan on Monday,
doctors ordered him to return home a day earlier than planned.

Singapore to issue foreign workers with identity card containing
</HEADLINE>
thumb print &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Trying to stem the rising flow of illegal
immigrants into affluent Singapore, authorities will begin issuing
foreign laborers with identity cards that include their thumb
prints, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The city-state, which has weathered the economic crisis
considerably better than many of its poorer neighbors, has
experienced a surge of immigration by foreigners lacking permits.
	   More than 2,000 were caught in this year's first eight months _
more than twice the number apprehended in the same period last
year, said The Straits Times.
	   On Monday, Parliament passed an amendment to the Employment of
Foreign Workers Act that allows the thumb prints to be included on
identity cards, making it easier for authorities to confirm a
worker's status and harder to forge the cards.
	   Singapore's Manpower Ministry plans to begin issuing the cards
early next year, the report said. Workers in the construction
industry, which receives many of the illegal workers, will be
fingerprinted first.
	   With a resident population of only about 3.1 million, Singapore
employs 450,000 foreign workers, including maids and hard laborers.
	   Foreigners with higher qualifications, including expatriates in
the financial sector and other professionals, will not carry
identity cards with fingerprints.

Russian leaders question U.S. methods in arresting former spy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The FBI used ``provocative methods'' to arrest an
alleged former spy by pretending one of its operatives was a
Russian agent, a Russian foreign intelligence official said
Wednesday.
	   ``We notice that curious patterns have appeared in the American
secret service,'' said Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Yuri
Kobaladze. ``They have adopted provocative methods of using the
Russian flag'' in their sting operations.
	   The FBI arrested 46-year-old David Boone, who they allege sold
top secrets to the Soviet Union, after he met with a bureau agent
posing as a Russian spy looking for new secrets on Saturday.
	   ``It would be interesting to see how Washington would react if
similar methods were adopted by the Russian counter-intelligence.''
	   The FBI used the ploy to lure Boone back from his German home to
a Virginia hotel room, promising to pay him thousands of dollars
for classified information.
	   The U.S. government charges that Boone, who served 21 years in
the Army, sold the Soviet Union top secrets from 1988-1991,
including a list of Soviet targets for U.S. nuclear weapons. They
say he made dlrs 60,000 from the espionage.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Toppled Premier Romano Prodi stood a chance
Wednesday to get his job back at least long enough to guide Italy
through the debut of the euro _ but first he had to prove he had a
coalition strong enough to govern.
	   Lacking the support of the far-left Communist party which had
been his ally, Prodi is counting on the centrist party of former
President Francesco Cossiga to secure the votes he needs for a
majority. Prodi and Cossiga met early Wednesday to see if they
could find common ground.
	   Prodi insists he won't lead a new government unless it sticks to
the same cost-cutting policies as his old one. Cossiga wants a say
in Cabinet choices..
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered back the premiership to
Prodi on Tuesday, five days after Prodi's center-left government
collapsed. It lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies
by a single ballot, with the surprise defection of a lawmaker in
his own coalition.
	   Prodi, whose government is Italy's second-longest since World
War II, stayed on as interim premier at Scalfaro's request.
	   The political crisis was brought on when the Communist
Refoundation party withdrew its support over the proposed 1999
budget, saying it didn't do enough to create jobs.
	   The move divided the Communists. One faction broke away; its
leader, Armando Cossutta, said Tuesday he would support a second
mandate for Prodi. But Prodi would still need Cossiga's centrist
votes to reach a majority.
	   Some political leaders talked of limiting Prodi to just three
months, which would let him shepherd through the 1999 budget and
get through the January start of the common European currency that
had been a goal of his 2 1/2-year-old government.
	   But Scalfaro said the constitution forbid him from limiting
Prodi's new stint to just three months.
	   Scalfaro called the budget talks all-important. Italy ``must not
waste the opportunity won when it qualified for European monetary
union,'' he said.
	   Opposition forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi,
insisted the only proper choice was new parliamentary elections, 2
1/2 years early.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi insisted.
	   Berlusconi expressed disgust Tuesday at the behind-the-scenes
political wrangling. ``This is a farce,'' he said.
	   Prodi himself declared at a public appearance Sunday he would
tolerate no under-the-table deals to form a new majority. He
pounded his fist in the air at the suggestion, roaring into the
microphone, ``No! No!''
	   There was no immediate indication when a new vote of confidence
might come. Prodi shrugged off reporters questions about how long
he would haggle with potential allies. ``Seven months,'' he
snapped. ``Seven years.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of
the turn in the events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to
continue work ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must touch wood, but it appears there will be no airstrikes.''
	   The six-country Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov was to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to
attend the meeting, said ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation, meanwhile, left for Kosovo
to get a first-hand look at what is happening in the southern Serb
province and examine sites that could be targeted by NATO
airstrikes.
	   The delegation is expected to stay in Kosovo for three or four
days, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, also drafted a
resolution Wednesday denouncing the ``NATO threat to unleash a war
against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia.'' The draft, to be
finalized later Wednesday, stated that airstrikes against Serbia
move would hurt NATO's relations with Russia and fuel tensions in
Europe.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov also told a British parliamentary
delegation Wednesday that if NATO goes ahead with its plans for
military action, Russia may revoke its agreement on friendship and
cooperation with the alliance.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.

	   Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for
their work on how to value so-called ``derivatives'' such as stock
options. The award caught the attention of many because it
recognized work with clear practical applications, rather than the
highly theoretical work that usually gets the prize.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners, Long -Term Capital Management, went
bust, necessitating a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout.
	   It's not clear whether Long-Term Capital's failure was due to
misapplication of Merton's and Scholes' theories or whether the
theories themselves are faulty. But the debacle inevitably taints a
prize that many have criticized.
	   The economics prize was not established in Alfred Nobel's will
and was started in 1968. Creating the prize offended those who
believe Nobel's will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize was the fifth of the six Nobels to be given
this year, and the last one announced in Stockholm. The peace
prize, the last in this year's series, is to be announced on Friday
in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 963,000 at
Friday's exchange rate).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   The chemistry prize on Tuesday went to Walter Kohn and John A.
Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for advances
in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, an Indian expert on
poverty and hunger who teaches at Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge, on Wednesday won the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   He was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his contributions to
welfare economics,'' which have helped in the understanding of the
economic mechanisms underlying famines and poverty, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its citation.
	   Sen, 64, has done work including studying the Bangladesh famine
of 1974 and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the
countries of the Sahara. Sen, whose first name is pronounced
Ah-MAR-tya, joined Trinity College this year after teaching at
Harvard University, among other institutions.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling hard-line Taliban
militia accused its powerful western neighbor Iran on Wednesday of
``brazen interference'' and asked the United Nations in a letter to
exert pressure to prevent war between the two countries.
	   Taliban's foreign minister Maulvi Mohammed Hasan sent the letter
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan who sent his special envoy,
Lakhdar Brahimi, to southern Kandahar to meet the reclusive leader
of the Islamic Taliban militia.
	   Annan exempted Brahimi from a travel ban to Afghanistan to allow
him to meet Mullah Mohammed Omar on Wednesday to try to defuse
border tensions between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Hasan said Iran continuously sends weapons to the Taliban's
minority opposition _ actions that hamper international efforts to
find a peaceful end to the standoff between Iran and the Taliban.
	   On Saturday, Kyrgyztan authorities stopped a train in the
southern town of Osh which was carrying weapons and explosives
hidden in a shipment marked humanitarian aid from Iran. Kyrgyz
officials said Tehran did not have permission to send the weapons
to Afghanistan across its territory.
	   Kyrgyz officials allege the weapons were to be loaded onto
trucks and driven to Afghanistan, where they would be delivered to
opposition leader Ahmed Shah Masood's militia.
	   The weapons included anti-tank mines, grenades, ammunition for
large-caliber machine guns, mines shells for 122 mm artillery guns
and rocket launchers, Russian Intermix news agency said Tuesday.
	   Hasan said Iran is the main source of weapons to the
anti-Taliban opposition, which is creating devastation, destruction
and loss of human lives in Afghanistan.
	   Iran has amassed more than 200,000 troops on its frontier with
Afghanistan after the killing of its diplomats and a journalist by
Taliban fighters when they captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
	   The Taliban, which also sent a similar letter to the
Organization of Islamic Conference, said Iran was using the issue
of the killing of its diplomats as a pretext to interfere in
Afghanistan. The Taliban say the slain Iranians were not diplomats,
but military personnel.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Delegates from the former
staunchly pro-apartheid Dutch Reformed Church deliberated Wednesday
whether to desegregate by merging with a non-white sister church.
	   But _ in an echo of the racially divisive past _ a plea written
by the non-white church during the anti-apartheid struggle is
proving to be a stumbling block to a merger. The plea calls for
social justice and racial equality.
	   The mixed-race Uniting Reformed Church says it will only accept
its white counterpart if it approves the plea, called the
Confession of Belhar.
	   Four years after apartheid ended, the church that formed the
religious backbone of white minority rule appeared to be reluctant
to do that.
	   ``My hope and prayer is that it will go through,'' said delegate
Piet Meiring. ``But I doubt it.''
	   Some delegates said they felt they were being forced to sanction
a theologically unacceptable document rooted in outdated
anti-apartheid history.
	   Uniting Reformed Church leader James Buys said he suspected
white church members were objecting to the merger because of
persistent racism, not fine theological points.
	   Outgoing Dutch Reformed Church leader Freek Swanepoel told The
Associated Press his church should accept the Confession of Belhar
``because it came out of the heart of Christians.''
	   On Tuesday, nearly all 400 delegates at the white church's
national meeting _ held once every four years _ approved a
resolution denouncing apartheid as ``sinful.''
	   By adopting the resolution, the Dutch Reformed Church
reactivated its membership in the 75-million strong World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, which comprises reformed and Presbyterian
churches. The world body had suspended the Dutch Reformed Church in
1982 because it violated teachings of the Bible.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that the integration proposal has
angered provincial branches of the Dutch Reformed Church and that
they are threatening to break away.
	   Last month, the 164,000-member Free State provincial branch was
reported to have opposed the merger because it objected to
worshipping with blacks and people of mixed race.
	   Starting in 1982, the 1.5-million-member white church _ the main
religious denomination of Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _
gradually renounced its hard-line position but kept separate
branches for blacks, mixed-race and Indian congregants.
	   In 1994, when apartheid ended with the country's first all-race
elections, the black and mixed-race branches merged to become the
1.5-million-member Uniting Reformed Church.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain's foreign secretary warned
Wednesday that NATO remains prepared for airstrikes against
Yugoslavia if Slobodan Milosevic fails to abide by the agreement to
halt the crackdown in Kosovo province.
	   In a step toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan
for a separate parliament in autonomy-minded Kosovo. But officials
also shut down two newspapers critical of Milosevic, reinforcing
suspicions the Yugoslav president is using the crisis to strengthen
his grip on power.
	   Following marathon talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000
international inspectors into the troubled Serb province to verify
compliance.
	   Full compliance should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 refugees homeless.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO gave
Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply for face airstrikes.
	   On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
Milosevic should take the warning seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The united consensus within NATO that we were ready to take
military action was there at the beginning of the week, is still
there and that decision is still on the table. We can reactivate
these plans any time we feel it is necessary to do so.''
	   Echoing the British official, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel said the world ``must remain watchful'' because of the
Yugoslav leader's record of breaking his promises.
	   The Kosovo plan, announced late Tuesday, calls for local
elections in the separatist province for 1999. According to the
statement, Kosovo Albanians would have their own parliament,
judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them. It
also offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected
war criminals.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989. But international leaders
oppose independence for Kosovo fearing that could lead to further
instability in the tense Balkans.
	   Despite the agreement with Holbrooke, it was clear that the
Yugoslav president has no intention of loosening his grip on power.
	   Late Tuesday, Serb police stormed the offices of independent
newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas and closed them down for
allegedly violating a recent government decree that required
self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   The decrees, issued last week, banned reports on NATO threats,
military preparations or any other developments which could
allegedly alarm the populace.
	   Dnevni Telegraf had been publishing such reports regularly under
headlines such as ``We have not reported this'' or ``respecting the
decree, we are not saying that:''On Saturday, a popular radio
station, Index, was shut down.
	   ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and this must be
stopped,'' said Dnevni Telegraf's managing editor, Slavko Curuvija.
``Until now we could at least write about it. Now we can't even do
that.''
	   Holbrooke said the key to the accord was Milosevic's decision to
allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to permit aerial
verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon as the
end of the week.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   But officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international observers are on the ground.
They hope to get about 50 diplomatic observers, who were evacuated
to Macedonia last weekend, back into Kosovo soon to serve as an
advance party for the monitors.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
in Kosovo because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees
would die if they could not return to their homes by the time
winter sets in. However, many of those homes have been burned by
Serb forces.
	   U.N. officials believe the presence of international monitors is
critical to overcoming fears of the refugees against returning
home. Many of them are afraid they will be arrested by police when
they emerge from the forests.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday
the situation of the refugees was ``basically unchanged.'' Many of
them are afraid to return to their homes because of fear of Serb
reprisals, spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' Janowski
said. ``And that needs to be allayed'' by the arrival of
international monitors.

Super Typhoon Zeb slams into northern Philippine province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zeb's latest location, 9,000 people evacuate,
more details of damage, incorporates reports of typhoon's effect in
Taiwan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ ``Super typhoon'' Zeb slammed into a
northern Philippine province Wednesday, dumping rain, knocking down
trees and electrical posts, and forcing more than 9,000 people to
flee their homes, disaster relief officials said.
	   At 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), Zeb was centered over Kalinga province,
and its maximum sustained winds had weakened to 175 kilometers (110
miles) per hour, with gusts of up to 210 kph (131 mph), the Manila
weather bureau said.
	   The Red Cross said 9,000 people living on the eastern coast of
Luzon Island have been evacuated to avoid floods. About 4,000 of
them fled four towns in Camarines del Sur province in Luzon's Bicol
region.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   Red Cross Secretary-General Lourdes Loyola said the extent of
the typhoon's damage will not be known for at least three days
because many of the hardest hit areas were remote villages.
	   The Office of Civil Defense said at least 10 electrical posts
were toppled in Malig town in Isabela, about 320 kilometers (200
miles) north of Manila. A bridge in nearby Jones town was closed to
traffic due to flooding.
	   A major road to the mountain city of Baguio also was closed
because of fears of landslides.
	   Electrical distributors in the northern Philippines cut power
early Wednesday to prevent accidents as heavy rains flooded many
areas in Isabela.
	   Many remote towns have been reported isolated due to flash
floods.
	   Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora ordered government offices in
the affected areas to close early in the afternoon. He said police
and disaster relief offices would remain open to help.
	   Five northern provinces, including Isabela, Cagayan, Quirino,
Aurora and the Batanes Island group, have been placed on maximum
storm alert as Zeb was expected to hit these areas hardest, said
forecaster Susan Dampog.
	   The storm was expected to be over the South China Sea by late
Thursday.
	   The weather bureau said Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to
hit the Philippines this year, was expected to pick up strength as
it moved toward southeast Taiwan.
	   In Taiwan, the weather bureau said Zeb was expected to slam
southern areas late Wednesday and batter the entire island
Thursday.
	   It said Zeb will be the most powerful typhoon to hit the island
since 1996, when Herb killed 70 people and caused U.S. dlrs 545
million in damage to crops and fish farms.
	   In southeastern Taitung, police said a man was swept out to the
sea by two-story high waves Wednesday as he was fishing near a
port.
	   The official Central News Agency said several airlines have
canceled domestic flights to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and nearby islets. But officials said international flights were
not affected.
	   A storm gains ``super typhoon'' status if its maximum sustained
winds reach 220 kph (138 mph).
	   Last month, tropical storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

for a separate parliament in autonomy-minded Kosovo. But officials
also shut down two newspapers critical of Milosevic, reinforcing
suspicions the Yugoslav president is using the crisis to strengthen
his grip on power.
	   Following marathon talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000
international inspectors into the troubled Serb province to verify
compliance.
	   Full compliance should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 refugees homeless.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO gave
Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply or face airstrikes.
	   On Wednesday, 6th graf

Indian famine expert wins Nobel Economics Prize

 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on Sen's work. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, an Indian expert on
poverty and hunger who teaches at Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge, on Wednesday won the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   He was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his contributions to
welfare economics,'' which have helped in the understanding of the
economic mechanisms underlying famines and poverty, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its citation.
	   Sen, 64, has done work including studying the Bangladesh famine
of 1974 and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the
countries of the Sahara. Sen, whose first name is pronounced
Ah-MAR-tya, joined Trinity College this year after teaching at
Harvard University, among other institutions.
	   Sen's work deals with development economics, the study of the
welfare of the world's poorest people. His best-known work
challenges the common view that the shortage of food is the most
important explanation of famine.
	   On the basis of studies of several catastrophes, he shows that
''famines have occurred even when the supply of food was not
significantly lower than during previous years'' without famines,
the citation said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined as one
of the crops could not be harvested. Due to these factors, the real
incomes of agricultural workers declined so much that this group
was disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for
their work on how to value so-called ``derivatives'' such as stock
options. The award caught the attention of many because it
recognized work with clear practical applications, rather than the
highly theoretical work that usually gets the prize.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners, Long -Term Capital Management, went
bust, necessitating a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout.
	   It's not clear whether Long-Term Capital's failure was due to
misapplication of Merton's and Scholes' theories or whether the
theories themselves are faulty. But the debacle inevitably taints a
prize that many have criticized.
	   The economics prize was not established in Alfred Nobel's will
and was started in 1968. Creating the prize offended those who
believe Nobel's will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize was the fifth of the six Nobels to be given
this year, and the last one announced in Stockholm. The peace
prize, the last in this year's series, is to be announced on Friday
in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 963,000 at
Friday's exchange rate).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   The chemistry prize on Tuesday went to Walter Kohn and John A.
Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for advances
in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

As contacts begin, Taiwan complains of Chinese diplomatic attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China is continuing its campaign to
isolate Taiwan diplomatically even as the sides move to end a
three-year impasse in their dialogue, Foreign Minister Jason Hu
said Wednesday.
	   China is unrelenting in its drive to win away the 27 countries
that still recognize Taiwan and wipe out Taiwan's formal diplomatic
relations by century's end, Hu told a legislative committee.
	   ``As long as the Chinese communists have a chance (to attack
Taiwan's diplomatic relations) there's no way they'll ever release
pressure,'' Hu said.
	   His statements came as Taiwan's senior envoy to China made his
way to Shanghai for informal meetings that represent the most
significant contact between the sides since Beijing suspended
negotiations in 1993.
	   Taiwan hopes the contacts _ including meetings with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing _ will help plot a course back to
negotiations on practical issues such as resolving fishing
disputes, while China hopes to win concessions on political matters
steering the sides toward reunification.
	   But Chang King-yuh, Taiwan's top Cabinet official for China,
said Tuesday that no real breakthrough in relations can occur until
China ends its suppression of Taiwan's foreign relations.
	   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and furiously denies
the island's right to diplomatic relations. Beijing froze talks in
June 1993 in anger over Taiwanese attempts to participate more
fully in international society.
	   China and Taiwan divided politically in 1949, when Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists took refuge on the island from the
Communist takeover of the mainland.
	   Taiwan launched a campaign six years ago to rejoin the United
Nations, where its seat was awarded to China in 1971, and has
sought to expand both official and unofficial ties with other
nations.

Ship carrying illegal charcoal burned by protesters

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ A boat being loaded with charcoal in a
northeastern Somali port for illegal export to Saudi Arabia was
reportedly set ablaze and looted by civilians and freelance gunmen,
sources said Wednesday.
	   The Mashwa was anchored in Al Ayo, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of Bosasso on the Gulf of Aden, when it was burned
Tuesday, businessmen contacted by VHF radio said.
	   The Mashwa was also carrying electronic goods, they said.
	   Early last year, authorities in Bosasso banned the export of
charcoal, wildlife and female camels, goats and sheep through the
port.
	   Charcoal burners have destroyed most of the wooded areas in
northern Somalia to satisfy demand for charcoal from the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
	   Authorities also fear that unregulated export is depleting
Somalia's natural wildlife and its breeding stock of domesticated
livestock.
	   But to elude the ban, the trade in the proscribed items has
simply shifted from Bosasso to small, natural harbors on the Gulf
of Aden or along the Indian Ocean coast.
	   Shipping sources in Bosasso said a dispute had broken out among
Somali businessmen over their share of the cargo space on board the
large dhow, and the unhappy ones set fire to the wooden vessel.
	   Thirteen crew members managed to jump to safety, but four
others, including Capt. Jamal Salah were missing and believed being
held by the gunmen for ransom.
	   The crew included Sudanese, Indians and a Somali.
	   Somalia has had no functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of the late dictator Mohammed Siad Barre and subsequent
disintegration of the country into fiefdoms guarded by clan-based
militia.
	   But in northeastern Somalia, local leaders have managed to
establish some order, and the region is relatively peaceful.

Regional governor gives his own potatoes to orphanages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regional governor in Siberia has donated six
tons of potatoes grown on his own farm to orphanages, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said Wednesday.
	   The potatoes were grown on land leased to Kemerovo Gov. Aman
Tuleyev, like 3,800 other residents of the Kuzbass coal-mining
region who supported a local initiative to cultivate land that was
not being used for agriculture purposes.
	   The governor did not have time to work the land himself, so he
was helped by workers from a neighboring experimental farm,
ITAR-Tass said. He donated his harvest to orphanages in the towns
of Anzhero- Sudzhensk and Berezovsky, it said.

Singapore official supports stronger yen as good for region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock
Suan said Wednesday he is happy with the recent strengthening of
the yen against the U.S. dollar, which he said corrects previous
excessive market moves and will make the region more competitive.
	   ``Personally, I am happy to see the strength of the yen,'' Lee
told Dow Jones Newswires during a World Economic Forum conference
in Singapore. ``It helps to compensate for the excessive movement
of the currencies to the extent that Asian values were
undervalued,'' he added.
	   Lee said he doesn't think a weaker U.S. dollar will hurt the
American economy, an important factor in a Southeast Asian
recovery, while it could increase Japanese demand for regional
goods and services.
	   ``The U.S. dollar is strong for a good reason. The U.S. economy
is strong,'' he said. ``The way Asian currencies have devalued, we
are still very competitive.''
	   Lee said he expects the U.S. and European economies to remain
strong and the foreign exchange fluctuation to have no impact on
Singapore exports.
	   Lee also reiterated comments made in Parliament Monday that
after Singapore's economic growth declined from 6.1 percent in the
first quarter to 1.6 percent in the second, the trend is expected
to continue into the third. He offered no estimate for
third-quarter data.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong recently revised GDP growth
expectations for this year downward to 0 to 1 percent.

British Embassy: no leads to British, New Zealand hostages in
</HEADLINE>
Chechnya &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The British Embassy in Moscow has received no
direct information about three Britons and a New Zealander
kidnapped in breakaway Chechnya nearly two weeks ago, an embassy
official said Wednesday.
	   No ransom demands have been made for the hostages, said an
embassy spokeswoman, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechnya's security forces launched a 10-day crackdown last
week, seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads
to the hostages.
	   A particularly thorough search was being conducted in Chechnya's
mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held. No trace of
the Britons and the New Zealander have been found, Chechen
officials have said.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Another high-profile hostage, Russian presidential envoy
Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped on May 1, remains missing.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain's foreign secretary warned
Wednesday that NATO remains prepared for airstrikes against
Yugoslavia if Slobodan Milosevic fails to abide by the agreement to
halt the crackdown in Kosovo province.
	   Also Wednesday, two independent newspapers in Belgrade critical
of Milosevic failed to show up on newsstands _ reinforcing
suspicions the Yugoslav president is using the crisis to strengthen
his grip on power.
	   The Serb government on Tuesday outlined a plan for a separate
parliament in autonomy-minded Kosovo, the southern Serbian province
where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2 million
population. Serbia is the dominant of the two republics that make
up Yugoslavia.
	   Following marathon talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on
Monday, Milosevic agreed to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin
peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow some
2,000 international inspectors into Kosovo to verify compliance.
	   Full compliance should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 refugees homeless.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO gave
Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply or face airstrikes.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Wednesday Milosevic
should take the warning seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The united consensus within NATO that we were ready to take
military action was there at the beginning of the week, is still
there and that decision is still on the table. We can reactivate
these plans any time we feel it is necessary to do so.''
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the world
``must remain watchful'' because of Milosevic's record of breaking
his promises.
	   The Kosovo plan, announced late Tuesday, calls for local
elections in the separatist province for 1999, and Kosovo Albanians
would have their own parliament, judiciary and police. The
government also said elections in Kosovo would be held within nine
months and invited foreign monitors to observe them. It also
offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected war
criminals.
	   Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989. But
international leaders oppose independence for Kosovo fearing that
could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   In Belgrade late Tuesday, Serb police stormed the offices of
independent newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas and closed them
down for violating a recent government decree that required
self-censorship during NATO threats.
	   The decrees, issued last week, banned reports on NATO threats,
military preparations or any other developments which could
allegedly alarm the populace.
	   Dnevni Telegraf had been publishing such reports regularly under
headlines such as ``We have not reported this'' or ``respecting the
decree, we are not saying that.'' On Saturday, a popular radio
station, Index, was shut down.
	   ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and this must be
stopped,'' said Dnevni Telegraf's managing editor, Slavko Curuvija.
``Until now we could at least write about it. Now we can't even do
that.''
	   Holbrooke said the key to the Kosovo accord was Milosevic's
decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to
permit aerial verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin
as soon as the end of the week.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   But officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international observers are on the ground.
They hope to get about 50 diplomatic observers, who were evacuated
to Macedonia last weekend, back into Kosovo soon to serve as an
advance party for the monitors.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
in Kosovo because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees
would die if they could not return to their homes by the time
winter sets in. However, many of those homes have been burned by
Serb forces.
	   U.N. officials believe the presence of international monitors is
critical to overcoming fears of the refugees against returning
home. Many of them are afraid they will be arrested by police when
they emerge from the forests.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday the situation
of the refugees was ``basically unchanged.'' Many of them are
afraid to return to their homes because of fear of Serb reprisals,
spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' Janowski
said. ``And that needs to be allayed'' by the arrival of
international monitors.

China, Taiwan to hold highest meeting in five years

meeting, Koo's remarks &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan held their highest-level
meeting in five years Wednesday, amid mixed signals that the
estranged rivals from the Chinese civil war were ready to resume
formal negotiations.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, was given a warm greeting
by his Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan at the start of what was
billed as an informal get-together at Shanghai's historic Peace
Hotel.
	   Wang and Koo walked into the hotel's ballroom together, stood
side-by-side and shook hands before the camera. They exchanged
pleasantries that were inaudible due to the din of some 200 Taiwan
reporters who observed the encounter.
	   Soon after arriving in Shanghai aboard a commercial flight, Koo
said he was looking forward to his meeting with Wang as an
opportunity to ``build mutual trust.''
	   Koo said he had no preconditions for the talks. Alluding to
practical matters that Taiwan prefers to discuss prior to political
talks on reunification, he said he was pleased to see Shanghai's
rapid development and noted there were a lot of Taiwanese
businessmen in the city.
	   The billing _ something less than formal talks _ illustrates the
distrust that has frustrated efforts to restart negotiations
Beijing broke off three years ago. Angered by Taiwan's perceived
drift away from eventual reunification, Beijing then launched
missiles and war games near the island, raising tensions to their
worst level since the height of the Cold War.
	   Wang, an 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, and Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and
senior figure in Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, head
government-backed organizations that handle mainland-island ties in
the absence of formal relations.
	   The elder statesmen held their first and last meeting in
Singapore in 1993, ushering in a brief period of cooperation.
Expectations were high that their second sit-down would improve the
atmosphere, if not formally re-establish routine negotiations
between their offices.
	   On the eve of Koo's arrival, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang looked forward to the meeting as a ``major event'' in
relations. Koo, meanwhile, called his trip ``a starting point for
rebuilding trust.''
	   After two days in Shanghai sightseeing, talking with Wang and
attending an opera together, Koo will travel to Beijing to meet
President Jiang and top officials handling Taiwan affairs and
attend banquets.
	   But Beijing and Taipei have also restated old, divisive
negotiating positions. Chinese spokesman Tang said China wants
revived talks to focus on political issues leading to
reunification. He repeated a 3 1/2-year-old proposal that would
allow the island to keep its capitalist system and military as long
as it submits to Beijing's rule.
	   Taiwan has rejected that autonomy formula and said reunification
should wait until China is more democratic and prosperous.
Meanwhile, it wants talks to focus on practical issues, like
fishing disputes, to build confidence.
	   Taiwan's top Cabinet official on mainland affairs, Chang
King-yu, urged Beijing to be pragmatic, firstly by recognizing that
the two sides are ruled separately. Ever since Mao Tse-tung's
Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland
in 1949, China has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province to be
retaken by force if necessary.
	   Economic and political pressures are edging both sides toward a
short-term accommodation.
	   Trade last year totaled dlrs 26.4 billion and Taiwanese
businesses have invested dlrs 38 billion in the mainland over the
past decade. Airlines and shippers are establishing routes that
only thinly respect Taiwan's ban on direct contacts with China.
	   Better ties with China could help the Nationalists win business
community support in December's general elections. Likewise,
Chinese President Jiang is believed to be under pressure from the
military and Communist Party hard-liners to get Taiwan to agree to
reunification.

Indian famine expert wins Nobel Economics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS citation comment on his restoring an ethical dimension,
title of best-known book. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, an Indian expert on
poverty and hunger who teaches at Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge, on Wednesday won the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   He was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his contributions to
welfare economics,'' which have helped in the understanding of the
economic mechanisms underlying famines and poverty, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its citation.
	   Sen, who has taught both economics and philosophy, ''has
restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic
problems.''
	   Sen, 64, has done work including studying the Bangladesh famine
of 1974 and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the
countries of the Sahara. Sen, whose first name is pronounced
Ah-MAR-tya, joined Trinity College this year after teaching at
Harvard University, among other institutions.
	   His work deals with development economics, the study of the
welfare of the world's poorest people.
	   His best-known work, detailed in his 1981 book ''Poverty and
Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation.'' It challenges
the common view that the shortage of food is the most important
explanation of famine.
	   On the basis of studies of several catastrophes, he shows that
''famines have occurred even when the supply of food was not
significantly lower than during previous years'' without famines,
the citation said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined as one
of the crops could not be harvested. Due to these factors, the real
incomes of agricultural workers declined so much that this group
was disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for
their work on how to value so-called ``derivatives'' such as stock
options. The award caught the attention of many because it
recognized work with clear practical applications, rather than the
highly theoretical work that usually gets the prize.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners, Long -Term Capital Management, went
bust, necessitating a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout.
	   It's not clear whether Long-Term Capital's failure was due to
misapplication of Merton's and Scholes' theories or whether the
theories themselves are faulty. But the debacle inevitably taints a
prize that many have criticized.
	   The economics prize was not established in Alfred Nobel's will
and was started in 1968. Creating the prize offended those who
believe Nobel's will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize was the fifth of the six Nobels to be given
this year, and the last one announced in Stockholm. The peace
prize, the last in this year's series, is to be announced on Friday
in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 963,000 at
Wednesday's exchange rate).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   The chemistry prize on Tuesday went to Walter Kohn and John A.
Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for advances
in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

Appeal delayed on extradition order of Maryland teenager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Supreme Court hearings on the appeal of a
Maryland murder suspect fighting extradition to the United States
are being postponed until next month, the Justice Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   The hearings in the case of Samuel Sheinbein had initially been
scheduled to begin Wednesday. Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit
Shemesh said the state attorney's office requested more time for
preparations.
	   Sheinbein's lawyers appealed the Jerusalem District Court ruling
which upheld Sheinbein's claim to Israeli citizenship but said he
has no right to stay in the country because he had not maintained
close ties to Israel.
	   The 18-year-old Sheinbein has been charged with killing and
dismembering a fellow Maryland teen-ager in September 1997.
	   Claiming Israeli citizenship, he fled to Israel after the
scorched, mutilated body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was found in a garage
near the Sheinbein home.
	   Under Israeli law, citizens cannot be extradited for trial
abroad.

U.N. convoys in Kosovo restart after brief interruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed running aid
convoys Wednesday in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province after
staff were briefly evacuated earlier this week, a spokesman said.
	   But it is too early to assess whether the agreement by
Yugoslavia to halt its crackdown in the province will make refugees
more inclined to return home, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' Janowski
said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants has killed hundreds and left
300,000 or more refugees homeless.
	   UNHCR convoys were interrupted on Monday and Tuesday when United
Nations headquarters ordered its staff in Pristina to be evacuated,
Janowski said.
	   They returned last night to Pristina Tuesday after spending a
night in Skopje, Macedonia, he said.
	   The agency's access to refugees remains largely unchanged,
according to Janowski. ``Even before the agreement, we generally
had no major access problems.''
	   However, a ``large international presence'' of monitors and a
reduction in Serb forces is needed to give people the confidence to
return home, he said.

Singapore official supports stronger yen as good for region

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The recent strengthening of the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar will make East Asia more competitive while
not harming the American economy, Singapore's trade and industry
minister said Wednesday.
	   ``Personally, I am happy to see the strength of the yen,'' Lee
Yock Suan told Dow Jones Newswires during a regional conference
sponsored by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum.
	   The stronger yen could increase Japanese demand for regional
goods and services, while not really damaging the U.S. market, he
said. Both of those results would be important factors in a
Southeast Asian recovery.
	   ``The U.S. dollar is strong for a good reason. The U.S. economy
is strong,'' he said. ``The way Asian currencies have devalued, we
are still very competitive.''
	   Lee said the crisis has shown ``the advantage of maintaining a
very open and transparent economy that is clearly linked to the
global economy,'' as Singapore has done.
	   Imposing capital controls, like neighboring Malaysia did in
September to shield its currency and stock markets from
speculators, is ``completely out for us,'' Lee said.
	   No Southeast Asian country is likely to follow Malaysia's
example, Lee said. ``In most countries that have opened up, it can
be very difficult to go backwards.
	   ``Of course, we wish Malaysia well and hope it gets them some
respite for them to make the necessary adjustments,'' Lee said.
``They should put their financial structures in order and overcome
some of the difficulties facing the economy.''
	   ``Malaysia is very much linked to the world in terms of trade,''
he said. ``They will have to make sure that they implement their
controls very carefully so they don't cause disruptions.''
	   Malaysia's controls did cause disruptions in Singapore. A halt
to overseas trading of Malaysian companies' stocks gutted
Singapore's over-the-counter market. Also, the Singapore
government, banks, other businesses and individuals held millions
of dollars worth of ringgit, the Malaysian currency that was
declared without value outside the country as of Oct. 1.

Indian famine expert wins Nobel Economics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS citation comment on his restoring an ethical dimension,
title of best-known book. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, an Indian expert on
poverty and hunger who teaches at Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge, on Wednesday won the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   He was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his contributions to
welfare economics,'' which have helped in the understanding of the
economic mechanisms underlying famines and poverty, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its citation.
	   Sen, who has taught both economics and philosophy, ``has
restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic
problems.''
	   Sen, 64, has done work including studying the Bangladesh famine
of 1974 and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and countries
of the Sahara. Sen, whose first name is pronounced Ah-MAR-tya,
joined Trinity College this year after teaching at Harvard
University, among other institutions.
	   His work deals with development economics, the study of the
welfare of the world's poorest people.
	   His best-known work, detailed in his 1981 book ``Poverty and
Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation.'' It challenges
the common view that the shortage of food is the most important
explanation of famine.
	   On the basis of studies of several catastrophes, he shows that
``famines have occurred even when the supply of food was not
significantly lower than during previous years'' without famines,
the citation said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined as one
of the crops could not be harvested. Due to these factors, the real
incomes of agricultural workers declined so much that this group
was disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for
their work on how to value so-called ``derivatives'' such as stock
options. The award caught the attention of many because it
recognized work with clear practical applications, rather than the
highly theoretical work that usually gets the prize.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners, Long-Term Capital Management, went
bust, necessitating a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout.
	   It's unclear whether Long-Term Capital's failure was due to
misapplication of Merton's and Scholes' theories or whether the
theories themselves are faulty. But the debacle inevitably taints a
prize that many have criticized.
	   The economics prize was not established in Alfred Nobel's will
and was started in 1968. Creating the prize offended those who
believe Nobel's will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize was the fifth of the six Nobels to be given
this year, and the last one announced in Stockholm. The peace
prize, the last in this year's series, is to be announced on Friday
in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 963,000 at
Wednesday's exchange rate).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   The chemistry prize on Tuesday went to Walter Kohn and John A.
Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for advances
in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, whose work combining
economics and philosophy has brought new understanding of the
catastrophes that plague society's poorest people, on Wednesday won
the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   Sen, an Indian citizen who teaches at Britain's Trinity College
in Cambridge, was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his
contributions to welfare economics,'' which have helped in the
understanding of the economic mechanisms underlying famines and

while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined as one
of the crops could not be harvested. Due to these factors, the real
incomes of agricultural workers declined so much that this group
was disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes not only hard economic analysis, but broader
questions including whether the majority principle is the best way
to make decisions and how can it best be determined whether poverty
is increasing or decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective decision
making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of sociology at
the University of Stockholm.
	   ``He cares about the poorest in society, and if that is a
left-wing view, then yes, he is left-wing,'' Eriksson said.
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work. Last year's economics prize went Americans Robert
Merton and Myron Scholes for their work on how to value so-called
``derivatives'' such as stock options.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners failed, necessitating a dlrs 3.6

and Scholes' theories.

Asian stock exchanges call for stronger rules, more cooperation

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian stock exchange chiefs meeting at an
economic summit Wednesday pledged more transparency and a stronger
regulatory framework to rein in increasingly volatile financial
markets and hasten recovery.
	   ``There are serious concerns about transparency,'' said Michael
Shepherd, vice chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange. ``The
perception is that it's risky to invest here.''
	   Other stock exchange leaders agreed, detailing plans to more
carefully manage their markets in the interest of fairness and
bringing back wary investors.
	   However, only the chairman of Thailand's Stock Exchange, Amaret
Sila-on, was willing to predict a domestic upturn within the next
12 months.
	   ``Strict supervision of brokerage firms can be an effective tool
to boost investors' confidence,'' said Amaret. Because of new
regulations and enforcement, ``we will be in much better shape
coming out of this recession than when this financial turmoil
began.''
	   Several central bank governors, meeting in a separate panel,
said they expect increased restrictions to be placed on hedge
funds, which speculate on currency instability and have been blamed
for sudden, disastrous devaluations in Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand.
	   ``It is no longer relevant to talk about the Asian economic
situation. The region continues to be affected by global
developments,'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth told
reporters. He said many conference participants had agreed on ``the
urgent necessity for leadership'' by the Group of Seven major
industrialized nations.
	   Participants expressed concern about the drift of the world
economy and the growing risk of global recession. They called on
the Group of Seven to establish a new regime for monitoring,
disclosure and regulation of highly leveraged short-term financial
flows and other potentially volatile transactions.
	   Some of those ideas were expressed in a 15-point action plan
adopted Tuesday by the economists, officials and businessmen at the
East Asia Economic Summit, organized by the World Economic Forum, a
private agency based in Switzerland.
	   ``Our aim is an open, orderly and efficient market,'' said Lee
Hon Chiu, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. He said it
was time to ``establish a sort of international supervision'' of
markets.
	   While agreeing that new international rules are a priority in
the region, most of the stock exchange leaders said they were
optimistic.
	   Yoshiaki Kaneko, senior managing director of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said the Japanese economy is at the ``turning point.''
	   ``Our aim _ our `big bang' _ is to achieve a free, fair and
global market by the year 2001,'' Kaneko said, adding that the
Japanese government is ``firmly committed to stimulate the
economy.''
	   Kaneko said some signs of recovery will appear in the first half
of 1999. But he cautioned that foreign investors, who in the past
year have been leaving Japan, will not come back in larger numbers
before they've been encouraged by domestic investors.

U.N. convoys in Kosovo restart after brief interruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed running aid
convoys Wednesday in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province after
staff were briefly evacuated earlier this week, a spokesman said.
	   But it is too early to assess whether the agreement by
Yugoslavia to halt its crackdown in the southern Serbian province
will make refugees more inclined to return home, said Kris
Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' Janowski
said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants has killed hundreds and left
300,000 or more refugees homeless. Serbia is the dominant of the
two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   UNHCR convoys were interrupted Monday and Tuesday when U.N.
headquarters ordered its staff in the provincial capital Pristina
to be evacuated, Janowski said.
	   They returned late Tuesday after spending a night in nearby
Skopje, Macedonia, he said.
	   The agency's access to refugees remains largely unchanged,
according to Janowski. ``Even before the agreement, we generally
had no major access problems.''
	   However, a ``large international presence'' of monitors and a
reduction in Serb forces is needed to give people the confidence to
return home, he said.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan held their highest-level
meeting in five years Wednesday, amid mixed signals that the
estranged rivals from the Chinese civil war were ready to resume
formal negotiations.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, was given a warm greeting
by his Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan as they began what was
billed as an informal get-together at the city's historic Peace
Hotel.
	   Wang and Koo walked into the hotel's ballroom together, stood
side-by-side and shook hands before the camera. They exchanged
pleasantries that were inaudible due to the din of some 200 Taiwan
reporters observing the encounter.
	   Soon after arriving in Shanghai aboard a commercial flight, Koo
said he looked forward to his meeting with Wang as an opportunity
``build mutual trust.''
	   ``It is better to start talking sooner rather than later,'' he
said.
	   Koo said he had no preconditions for the talks. He did allude,
however, to practical matters that Taiwan prefers to discuss,
saying he was pleased to see Shanghai's rapid development and
noting many Taiwanese businessmen work in the city.
	   The get-together billing _ something less than formal talks _
illustrates the distrust that has frustrated efforts to restart
negotiations Beijing broke off three years ago. Angered by Taiwan's
perceived drift away from eventual reunification, Beijing then
launched missiles and war games near the island, raising tensions
to their worst level since the height of the Cold War.
	   Wang, an 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, and Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and
senior figure in Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, head
government-backed organizations that handle mainland-island ties in
the absence of formal relations.
	   The elder statesmen held their first and last meeting in
Singapore in 1993, ushering in a brief period of cooperation.
Expectations were high that their second sit-down would improve the
atmosphere, if not formally re-establish routine negotiations
between their offices.
	   On the eve of Koo's arrival, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang looked forward to the meeting as a ``major event'' in
relations.
	   After two days in Shanghai sightseeing, talking with Wang and
attending an opera together, Koo will travel to Beijing to meet
President Jiang and top officials handling Taiwan affairs and
attend banquets.
	   But Beijing and Taipei have also restated old, divisive
negotiating positions. Chinese spokesman Tang said China wants
revived talks to focus on political issues leading to
reunification. He repeated a 3 1/2-year-old proposal that would
allow the island to keep its capitalist system and military as long
as it submits to Beijing's rule.
	   Taiwan has rejected that autonomy formula and said reunification
should wait until China is more democratic and prosperous.
Meanwhile, it wants talks to focus on practical issues, like
fishing disputes, to build confidence.
	   Koo indicated that Taiwan expected political issues to arise
during such talks.
	   ``During the practical negotiations we can find out where the
political issues are and adjust the process,'' Koo said. ``From
this point, we start step-by-step.''
	   Taiwan's top Cabinet official on mainland affairs, Chang
King-yu, urged Beijing to be pragmatic, firstly by recognizing that
the two sides are ruled separately. Ever since Mao Tse-tung's
Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland
in 1949, China has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province to be
retaken by force if necessary.
	   Economic and political pressures are edging both sides toward a
short-term accommodation.
	   Trade last year totaled dlrs 26.4 billion and Taiwanese
businesses have invested dlrs 38 billion in the mainland over the
past decade. Airlines and shippers are establishing routes that
only thinly respect Taiwan's ban on direct contacts with China.
	   Better ties with China could help the Nationalists win business
community support in December's general elections. Likewise,
Chinese President Jiang is believed to be under pressure from the
military and Communist Party hard-liners to get Taiwan to agree to
reunification.

Sentry on Russian submarine killed during snowdrift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian sailor died while keeping watch over a
nuclear submarine docked at an Arctic base, after he was apparently
thrown overboard by a strong gust of wind, a news agency said
Wednesday.
	   Alexei Shvarev, 19, was at his post on top of the submarine when
a powerful snowstorm began, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Shvarev was missing during a check Monday morning, and rescuers
later found his body under the submarine, ITAR-Tass said, citing
the Russian navy.
	   Investigators believe that Shvarev was thrown overboard by a
strong gust of wind.
	   The submarine was docked at an Arctic base of Russia's Northern
Fleet, but ITAR-Tass did not specify which one.

Pope, approaching 20th anniversary, hold 877th general audience
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Just days from marking the 20th anniversary of his
reign, Pope John Paul II held his 877th general audience Wednesday
in a sun-drenched St. Peter's Square.
	   The pontiff thanked the crowd for their prayers and good wishes.
``I trust greatly in the spiritual support of the people of God to
faithfully carry out my ministry,'' he told them.
	   The Vatican says that nearly 14 million people have attended the
general audiences since John Paul was elected pontiff on Oct. 16,
1978.
	   Wednesday's audience had a particularly festive air because of
the upcoming papal anniversary. The faithful applauded and cheered,
and musical groups prolonged their performances in honor of John
Paul's 20th.
	   On Tuesday night, the pope stunned the host of a TV special on
his pontificate by calling midway through the program to thank him.
	   Host Bruno Vespa nearly cried. ``Even journalists have souls,''
he exclaimed.
	   The anniversary is Friday and a special Mass in planned for
Sunday in St. Peter's Square.

For Poland, John Paul's papacy linked to nation's soul

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Every Pole, it seems, has a story about
Pope John Paul II, the favorite son who celebrates the 20th
anniversary of his papacy on Friday.
	   Some remember him as Krakow Archbishop Karol Wojtyla, a one-time
actor and playwright with a passion for hiking and skiing in the
Tatra mountains. Others tell of spiritual fulfillment _ former
President Lech Walesa called it ``charging the batteries'' _ from
encounters close or peripheral during one his seven pilgrimages to
his homeland.
	   To Poles, some of the planet's most devout Catholics, the man
and his two decades as pope symbolize national awakening, freedom
from communism's cloying shackles _ in short, a rebirth of the
national soul.
	   ``Papa to us is like God,'' said nurse Elizabeth Jurek, using
the affectionate Polish name for the 78-year-old John Paul.
``Because of Papa, people around the world talk about Poland.''
	   John Paul's popularity is almost overwhelming here. Plaques and
portraits bearing his image are everywhere _ in churches, offices,
shops. An old joke advises that if you want development money,
arrange for the pope to visit your church or town.
	   Opinion polls consistently show the pope as the nation's most
respected and trusted figure, more than any politician or
intellectual.
	   The papacy in several ways mirrors the evolution of Poland from
a struggling Soviet satellite to a newly democratic, emerging
nation that has embraced Western-style economic and social reform.
	   John Paul's ascension as the first Polish pope on Oct. 16, 1978,
brought immediate change at a time when repeated protest movements
and uprisings against the communists has been relentlessly quelled.
	   Suddenly, the beleaguered people _ tired of chronic food
shortages, political oppression and the general drudgery of East
European communism _ had an international champion. Even better for
the more than 90 percent Catholic population, it was the global
leader of their beloved church.
	   ``Given their history and their beliefs, no other honor to the
nation could have satisfied them so completely,'' journalist Neal
Ascherson wrote in his book ``The Polish August.''
	   The Rev. Andrzej Szostek, rector of the Catholic University in
Lublin where John Paul once taught, recalled his disbelief.
	   ``It was really something absolutely unexpected,'' said Szostek,
who once was an assistant ethics professor under Wojtyla. ``He was
from Poland, not from the Western world. He was very young at the
time. ... I was just full of joy.''
	   A year later, John Paul made his first pilgrimage to his
celebrating homeland, a trip that had long lasting repercussions.
	   ``People went out into the streets to greet their pope and saw
that there are millions of them, thinking the same way,'' said
Zbigniew Romaszewski, a former Solidarity activist who now sits in
the Senate chamber of parliament.
	   ``They realized they are a community and understood that their
oppressor is weak. The crowds participating in papal masses were
the foundation of ... Solidarity, formed a year later.''
	   Led by Walesa, Solidarity frightened the government so much it
banned the labor movement and imposed martial law in 1981. During
papal pilgrimages in 1983 and 1987, John Paul rallied the
anti-communist cause with thinly veiled calls for national
solidarity, while banners for the outlawed movement waved in the
crowds.
	   Two years after Walesa and Solidarity finally ousted the
communists in 1989, John Paul made another pilgrimage, but to a
vastly different country. The newfound freedom in a shifting
society created new divisions, including a general chafing against
new political influence exerted by the church on the power of its
ties to Solidarity.
	   Szostek, the university rector, said people expected the pope to
praise them for gaining their freedom.
	   Instead, they heard harsh homilies against abortion _ which many
Poles consider a personal choice _ as well as pornography and
consumerism, with the pope urging Poles to cope with their new
freedoms by building their lives on the solid ``rock'' of the Ten
Commandments.
	   Resentment against crucifixes in government buildings and the
optional teaching of Catholicism in schools lingers today, but John
Paul's popularity remains powerful. More than 6 million Poles
turned out during his 11-day, 12-city pilgrimage last year billed
as a possible farewell visit.
	   ``I don't agree with him on many different issues, but that
doesn't take away my love for him. Nothing could,'' said Magda
Samborska-Murgio, 30, who stood for three hours then waiting for a
glimpse of the pope.
	   As a 17-year-old schoolgirl, she traveled to Italy with a scout
group and met the pope at a bonfire at his Castel Gandolfo vacation
palace. Memories of that encounter_ the few minutes John Paul spent
with each of the more than 100 young people, his warm clasp of her
hands, the simple questions about her life and school _ remain with
her always.
	   ``It's not really what he stands for as pope. It's more about
the faith, the closeness. To me, he's as close to God as I can
imagine,'' said Samborska-Murgio, who now lives in New York. ``I
just feel this love for him like I do for my mother and father.''

Indian famine expert wins Nobel Economics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to RECAST lede, ADD comment. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, whose work combining
economics and philosophy has brought new understanding of the
catastrophes that plague society's poorest people, on Wednesday won
the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   Sen, an Indian citizen who teaches at Britain's Trinity College
in Cambridge, was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his
contributions to welfare economics,'' which have helped in the
understanding of the economic mechanisms underlying famines and
poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its
citation.
	   Sen, 64, who has taught both economics and philosophy, ``has
restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic
problems.''
	   He has studied the Bangladesh famine of 1974 and other
catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the countries of the Sahara.
Sen, whose first name is pronounced Ah-MAR-tya, joined Trinity
College this year after teaching at Harvard University, among other
institutions.
	   His best-known work, detailed in his 1981 book ``Poverty and
Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation,'' challenges the
common view that the shortage of food is the most important
explanation of famine.
	   On the basis of studies of several catastrophes, he shows that
``famines have occurred even when the supply of food was not
significantly lower than during previous years'' without famines,
the citation said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined as one
of the crops could not be harvested. Due to these factors, the real
incomes of agricultural workers declined so much that this group
was disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes not only hard economic analysis, but broader
questions including whether the majority principle is the best way
to make decisions and how can it best be determined whether poverty
is increasing or decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective decision
making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of sociology at
the University of Stockholm. ``He cares about the poorest in
society, and if that is a left-wing view, then yes, he is
left-wing.''
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work. Last year's economics prize went Americans Robert
Merton and Myron Scholes for their work on how to value so-called
``derivatives'' such as stock options.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners failed, necessitating a dlrs 3.6
billion bailout.
	   It's unclear how closely connected the failure was to Merton's
and Scholes' theories.
	   The economics prize was not established in Alfred Nobel's will
and was started in 1968. Creating the prize offended those who
believe Nobel's will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize was the fifth of the six Nobels to be given
this year, and the last one announced in Stockholm. The peace
prize, the last in this year's series, is to be announced on Friday
in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 963,000 at
Wednesday's exchange rate).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   Also Tuesday, the chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn and John
A. Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for
advances in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death
of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

Nigerian youths offer to stop attacks on oil installations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Youths who have been attacking oil
installations in eastern Nigeria have written to the military junta
offering a two-month cease-fire, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   But the youths, from the Ijaw ethnic group that largely
populates the oil-rich Niger River delta region, also sent a long
list of demands to the government, including the immediate payment
of 20 million naira (about 235,000 dlrs), the Guardian reported.
	   The offer followed more than a week of angry protests by the
Ijaw youths, who have been attacking oil company sites in the delta
region, trying to use Nigeria's dependence on petroleum exports to
force the government to pay attention to their grievances.
	   Alex Preye, who heads a group called the Egbesu Boys of Africa,
made the cease-fire offer after numerous appeals from various Ijaw
leaders, the newspaper said.
	   Preye said the cease-fire was to give the government time to
investigate the situation in the delta region, which holds
virtually all of Nigeria's massive crude oil reserves, but where
most locals still live in desperate poverty.
	   As compensation for the cease-fire, the Ijaw group wants want
all communities in the delta _ many of which are only accessible by
boat _ linked to highways. It is also demanding the creation of
more local administrative councils and wants a regional capital to
be moved.
	   Other demands include the establishment of a univeristy and the
introduction of water and electricity service to isolated areas.

Top suspect in custody pleads innocent to new war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The most senior war crimes suspect
in U.N. custody, a Bosnian Croat accused of guiding a fierce
campaign that nearly wiped out entire Muslim communities, pleaded
innocent to new charges Wednesday.
	   Dario Kordic entered innocent pleas to a broadened Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal indictment which includes nine new counts of war
crimes and crimes against humanity, bringing the total charges
against him from 13 to 22.
	   Wearing a dark-colored suit and a yellow tie, Kordic, 37,
initially was indicted in 1995 along with four other defendants
suspected in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims in the Lasva
Valley between 1991 and 1994.
	   Their alleged crimes were committed on such a large and
widespread scale that they have ``effectively destroyed or removed
almost the entire Muslim civilian population in the Lasva Valley,''
according to a tribunal document.
	   Named in the same indictment is Mario Cerkez, a Bosnian Croat
military commander, who also pleaded innocent Wednesday to 12 new
counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He now faces 22
counts, up from the initial 10.
	   ``Absolutely not guilty,'' a defiant Cerkez said as each count
against him was read.
	   Both men pleaded innocent in their initial arraignments in
October 1997. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   The amended indictment, apparently issued due to new evidence
unearthed by prosecutors, extends the period covered by the initial
indictment and describes in great detail the power and authority of
both defendants.
	   It also recounts extensively an alleged campaign of terror in
which men, women and children were beaten, sexually assaulted and
killed and their homes and mosques torched, shelled or dynamited.
	   According to the indictment, Kordic was an influential
politician who became the vice president of the former Bosnian
Croat state of Herceg-Bosna.
	   He was an ``integral and important figure in the whole
campaign,'' read the amended indictment.
	   Cerkez was the commander of the Croatian Defense Council
brigade, based in the central Bosnian city of Vitez, which was
actively involved in the wide-scale persecution, according to the
indictment.
	   Prosecutors say the planning and carrying out of atrocities came
under Kordic and Cerkez's direction or control, making them
responsible for the actions of their subordinates.
	   Two other defendants in the Lasva Valley indictment, Bosnian
Croat Gen. Tihomir Blaskic and prison commander Zlatko Aleksovski,
are already standing trial separately before the tribunal.

	   GIZA, Egypt (AP) _ To the gentle notes of a violin, the opera
``Aida'' has opened in the desert behind Egypt's pyramids.
	   In a bid to regain its place in world tourism after a massacre
of foreign visitors last year, the government is making a major
effort to sell the country abroad. After an international squash
tournament and a Shirley Bassey concert, ``Aida'' is the third show
to be staged at the pyramids in just three weeks.
	   Rings of police and troops surrounded the venue during Monday's
opening, a reminder of the November attack by Islamic extremists
who shot to death 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians in the
southern city of Luxor.
	   Nearly 3,000 spectators gave the cast of hundreds a standing
ovation Monday on the first of a six-night run.
	   Loudest applause went to Maria Guleghina, a Russian soprano who
sang the title role, delivering high notes of pure emotion that
hung in the air.
	   Spectators spoke glowingly of the set, a wooden stage of six
terraces lined with golden sentinels copied from Tutankhamun's tomb
and built beneath the massive, stippled face of Chephren's Pyramid.
	   ``The stage is fantastic,'' said German Ambassador Peter
Dingens. ``What I'm amazed about is that they put all this up in
the middle of nowhere.''
	   This year's production, the fourth since 1987, cost about 17
million Egyptian pounds (dlrs 5 million). By past experience, the
organizers will be lucky to recoup half that.
	   Although few Egyptians can afford even the cheapest seats, which
go for 75 pounds (dlrs 22), the show generates so much popular
pride that the government is under no pressure to cancel it.
	   The pride stems partly from the opera's history. Giuseppe Verdi
wrote ``Aida'' for the opening of the Cairo Opera in 1872. It tells
the story of a victorious Egyptian general, Radames, who spurns the
hand of a Pharaoh's daughter for that of a captured Ethiopian
princess, Aida.
	   For all the enthusiasm surrounding the opera, there were a few
glitches: The open-air performance made amplifiers essential,
meaning the singing seemed to come from speakers at the sides,
rather than from the performers; English programs were virtually
unobtainable before the show; and caterers ran short of drinks.
	   And in a public relations slip-up, foreign television crews and
photographers were taken to the show in a government bus but then
forbidden to take photographs on opening night.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dozens of fire alarms containing radioactive
materials have been stolen from several apartment blocks in a Ural
Mountains city, and may cause contamination if taken apart,
officials said Wednesday.

the city of Kopeisk, local civil defense authorities said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Police, firefighters, and civil defense workers were

Asian markets lower on Wall Street loss, Japan banking concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many Asian stock markets ended recent rallies
Wednesday, closing lower because of profit-taking, Wall Street's
overnight losses and concerns over Japan's banking rescue measures.
	   In Tokyo, share prices tumbled as investors grew skeptical about
the effectiveness of the government's bank rescue plan.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 172.06 points,
or 1.30 percent, closing at 13,070.73.
	   The market's current focus is on the conditions under which the
government would disburse public funds to weak but viable banks,
traders said.
	   Concerns about the sector helped the dollar to gain. Late
Wednesday, it was trading at 119.72 yen, up 1.34 yen from late
Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 119.15
yen overnight.
	   On Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
63.33 points, or 0.8 percent, to 7,938.14.
	   Hong Kong shares finished lower as investors cashed in on gains
built up in the past five sessions, traders said.
	   After a session of choppy trading, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index
closed at 8,840.01, down 168.82 points, or 1.9 percent.
	   The index had soared 19 percent in the past five sessions,
closing at a 20-week high Tuesday, as institutional investors
bought back borrowed shares, traders said.
	   Singapore shares closed sharply lower on investors'
profit-taking, ending one of its most bullish phases all year,
dealers said.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index closed 29.86 points, or 2.9
percent, lower at 985.78.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the third straight day on
weak investor confidence. The market's key Weighted Price Index
closed down 90.10 points, or 1.3 percent, at 6,819.12.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as investors
cashed on recent gains. The NZSE-40 capital index closed down 9.72
points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,746.12.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower following Wall
Street's fall. The All Ordinaries Index fell 22.9 points, or 0.9
percent, closing at 2,465.6.
	   SEOUL: The market closed slightly higher on a rise in the shares
of some companies in the Samsung Group. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index gained 0.05 points to 346.13.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed marginally lower on
a lack of fresh leads, traders said. The benchmark Composite Index
was down 0.82 point at 384.22.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower as investors took
profits. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 5.07 points, or
1.7 percent, to 285.12.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares ended lower as investors cashed in,
ending a five-day rally. The JSX Composite Index closed down 3.4
percent, or 10.796 points, at 303.190.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended a six-session rally, hurt by the
weak currency and Wall Street losses. The 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index closed down 43.55 points, or 3.2 percent, at
1,324.22.

Mugabe meets Kabila in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe planned a second
round of talks Wednesday with Congolese leader Laurent Kabila in
the southern Congolese town of Lubumbashi, his office said.
	   Mugabe, whose nation deployed warplanes and 3,000 troops to help
avert Kabila's overthrow by rebels in August, was expected to
return to Harare later Wednesday.
	   Mugabe flew to Lubumbashi Tuesday on his first visit to the
Congo since rebels mounted an advance on the capital, Kinshasa, on
Aug. 2.
	   The advance was repulsed by allied southern African forces from
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe fighting alongside Kabila's troops.
	   The official Zimbabwe news agency said no details of the two
leaders' talks were released but their meeting was expected to
focus on a possible allied offensive after rebel advances in the
east of the vast, mineral-rich country.
	   Rebels claimed to have captured the strategic eastern town of
Kindu on Monday.
	   Zimbabwe military officials say Zimbabwean troops have been
deployed in some government-held strongholds surrounded by thick
jungle in eastern Congo, but no information of combat there has
been released.
	   Kabila, who ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997,
accuses Uganda and Rwanda of supporting rebels led by ethnic-Tutsi
fighters in their bid to oust him.

	   VAN, Turkey (AP) _ Sixty-three people died in clashes over the
past two days between government troops and Kurdish rebels in
southeastern Turkey, the Anatolia news agency said Wednesday.
	   Turkish troops killed 42 Kurdish rebels near the city of Van,
1,250 kilometers (781 miles) southeast of Ankara, after the rebels
killed 14 village guards near the town of Gevas on Monday, the
agency said. Two soldiers were also killed.
	   The village guards are paid and armed by the government to help
the troops in their fight against the Kurdish insurgents.
	   Five other rebels were killed in separate clashes in the
southeastern provinces of Diyarbakir and Hakkari, Anatolia said.
	   Military officials were unavailable to comment.
	   Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984 and are a source of tension between Syria and
Turkey, which accuses Damascus of sheltering and supporting them.
The conflict has killed some 37,000 people.

Top suspect in custody pleads innocent to new war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The most senior war crimes suspect
in U.N. custody, a Bosnian Croat accused of guiding a fierce
campaign that nearly wiped out entire Muslim communities, pleaded
innocent to new charges Wednesday.
	   A broadened Yugoslav war crimes tribunal indictment against
Dario Kordic includes nine new counts of war crimes and crimes
against humanity, bringing the total charges against him from 13 to
22.
	   Kordic, 37, initially was indicted in 1995 along with four
others suspected in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims in the
Lasva Valley between 1991 and 1994.
	   Their alleged crimes were committed on such a large and
widespread scale that they have ``effectively destroyed or removed
almost the entire Muslim civilian population in the Lasva Valley,''
according to a tribunal document.
	   Named in the same indictment is Mario Cerkez, a Bosnian Croat
military commander, who also pleaded innocent Wednesday to 12 new
counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He now faces 22
counts, up from the initial 10.
	   ``Absolutely not guilty,'' a defiant Cerkez said as each count
against him was read.
	   Both men pleaded innocent in their initial arraignments in
October 1997. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   The amended indictment, apparently issued due to new evidence
unearthed by prosecutors, extends the period covered by the initial
indictment and describes in great detail the power and authority of
both defendants.
	   It also recounts extensively an alleged campaign of terror in
which men, women and children were beaten, sexually assaulted and
killed and their homes and mosques torched, shelled or dynamited.
	   According to the indictment, Kordic was an influential
politician who became the vice president of the former Bosnian
Croat state of Herceg-Bosna and an ``integral and important figure
in the whole campaign.''
	   Cerkez was the commander of the Croatian Defense Council
brigade, based in the central Bosnian city of Vitez, which was
actively involved in the wide-scale persecution, according to the
indictment.
	   Prosecutors say the planning and carrying out of atrocities came
under Kordic and Cerkez's direction or control.
	   Two other defendants, Bosnian Croat Gen. Tihomir Blaskic and
prison commander Zlatko Aleksovski, are standing trial separately
before the tribunal.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of
the turn in the events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to
continue work ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must touch wood, but it appears there will be no airstrikes.''
	   The six-country Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov was to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to
attend the meeting, said ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Ivanov sounded triumphant Wednesday.
	   ``One can say with a great degree of confidence that we have
averted a threat of a military operation in Yugoslavia,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted him as saying.
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation, meanwhile, left for Kosovo
to get a first-hand look at what is happening in the southern Serb
province and examine sites that could be targeted by NATO
airstrikes.
	   The delegation is expected to stay in Kosovo for three or four
days, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Neighboring Belarus also sent a government delegation to
Belgrade on Wednesday to discuss military aid to Yugoslavia.
Russia's parliament speaker has called on its Slavic neighbors to
help Yugoslavia, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has
promised military support _ though no soldiers.
	   The lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, also
drafted a resolution Wednesday denouncing the ``NATO threat to
unleash a war against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia.'' The
draft, to be finalized later Wednesday, stated that airstrikes
against Serbia move would hurt NATO's relations with Russia and
fuel tensions in Europe.

Hunger strikers urge Tung to step down

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Seven protesters went on a hunger strike
Wednesday to press Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to step down,
underlining growing public dissatisfaction with his government as
Hong Kong's recession deepens.
	   They protested that Tung's annual policy address last week
offered no relief for the ordinary citizen as the economy worsens
and unemployment edges past the current 5 percent, a 15-year high.
	   ``He is blind to the plight of the people,'' said organizer
Tsang Kin-shing, a former legislator.
	   Sitting under a banner saying, ``Tung Chee-hwa must step down to
calm the citizens' anger,'' the protesters urged passers-by in the
teeming commercial district of Tsim Sha Tsui to sign an anti-Tung
petition.
	   The hunger strikers include four city councilors from the
territory's largest political party, the Democratic Party, and a
member of a pro-business party.
	   Four said they would stay as long as their bodies could stand
it, and others said they would strike for about 30 hours.
	   ``The government wants to save the market, not the people,''
they chanted.
	   Michael DeGolyer, a political scientist at Baptist University,
said that although Tung's government is not yet under threat, the
hunger strike indicates that ``Hong Kong people are not happy with
the circumstances.''
	   ``They're not convinced that the chief executive knows what he's
doing,'' he said.
	   Tung's popularity has slipped with the economy, with is expected
to shrink by at least 5 percent this year.
	   Bob Broadfoot, managing director of a Hong Kong-based think
tank, the Political and Economic Risk consultancy, said the
economic downturn has raised questions over whether officials can
``exercise good judgment in a crisis.''
	   A poll by Hong Kong University showed that Tung's policy address
received the lowest support in six years.
	   In another poll, 11.7 percent of respondents said their
confidence rose after the address, compared with 26.4 percent who
became less confident.
	   Ho Wai-ming, a 29-year-old salesman and a hunger striker, said:
``The chief executive is completely out of touch with the
community. He didn't address the most pressing problems, which are
housing and unemployment.''
	   Handpicked by Beijing to lead Hong Kong after its return from
British to Chinese sovereignty, Tung has been under fire for
lacking the political skills and flare needed to lead Hong Kong out
of the recession.
	   In the past year, he has been conspicuously absent from the
limelight when crises broke out, including an outbreak of a
mysterious avian flu last year that killed six people, a series of
medical blunders, and the chaotic opening of the new airport in
July.
	   Tung has repeatedly defended his absence, saying he is
result-oriented and is not interested in what he calls political
show.
	   However, in a move seen as acknowledging the need for an image
make-over, Tung has appointed a senior civil servant to become his
chief spokesman and media strategist.
	   Tsang, the organizer, said Tung exemplifies the weaknesses of an
authoritarian government.
	   ``Tung does not have to face voters,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov ruling out early elections. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
work in the Kremlin on Wednesday, defying doctors' orders to stay
home and recover from a respiratory infection.
	   Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, and planned other working meetings throughout the
day, Russian news agencies said.
	   ``The president feels well,'' Primakov said after the meeting,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. He is ``absolutely fit to
work,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Primakov said Yeltsin waved his hand ``when we reminded him that
he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said of his doctors:
``Don't listen to them.''
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Tuesday that
doctors ordered the president to stay in bed and that he would not
be in the office all week.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from a visit to
Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from
an upper respiratory infection, was coughing and running a fever.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including heart
bypass surgery two years ago. He insists he has no major illnesses
and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term, but
whenever Yeltsin gets sick, there is speculation about his ability
to govern.
	   Primakov reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin has no plans to
resign or call early elections.
	   ``I think the president must serve his term in office to the
end,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to
Central Asia. He canceled most of his public engagements in
Uzbekistan, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling
remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.
	   Shortly after arriving in neighboring Kazakstan on Monday,
doctors ordered him to return home a day earlier than planned.

Report: Anwar's daughter travels overseas as his emissary

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The 18-year-old daughter of
arrested dissident politician Anwar Ibrahim has slipped out of
Malaysia to meet international leaders, a news magazine reported
Wednesday.
	   Nurul Izzah, the eldest of Anwar's six children, went to the
Indonesian island of Batam to meet with President B.J. Habibie on
Tuesday, the Far Eastern Economic Review said.
	   The Review article will be carried in Thursday's issue.
	   An aide to Anwar's family, however, declined to confirm whether
Nurul Izzah had made the trip. He said she was out of the city for
a break with a family friend.
	   Anwar's family had no knowledge of her plans, said the aide, who
refused to be identified by name.
	   Malaysian officials have frowned on Anwar's supporters traveling
overseas to meet foreign leaders and seek support.
	   Nurul Izzah, a first-year engineering student, also planned to
visit Manila to meet with Philippine President Joseph Estrada and
former President Corazon Aquino, a news release by the magazine's
Hong Kong office said.
	   Estrada and Habibie met Tuesday night in Batam specifically to
discuss Anwar, whom both have described as a friend. Neither leader
has decided whether to attend the November meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur, their
foreign ministers said.
	   Estrada, who is in Singapore this week on a state visit, said he
and Habibie are considering writing a joint letter to Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urging him to hold Anwar under
house arrest instead of in prison during his trial.
	   ``As heads of state we are free to express our views when they
relate to human rights and due process of law,'' Estrada said.
``But we don't mean to interfere. We are just explaining our
opinion.''
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir in early September after months of
differences between the two most powerful men in Malaysia. He then
began criticizing Mahathir publicly and was subsequently arrested.
He has appeared at court hearings with a black eye, bruises and a
neck brace.
	   Anwar faces trial beginning Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Excerpts from the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences' citation awarding the 1998 Nobel Economics Prize
Wednesday to Amartya Sen of India, who teaches at Britain's Trinity
College in Cambridge.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Sen's contribution to welfare economics ... (and) applications
of his theoretical approach have enhanced our understanding of the
economic mechanisms underlying famines. He has made a number of
noteworthy contributions to central fields of economic science and
opened up new fields of study for subsequent generations of
researchers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   By combining tools from economics and philosophy, he has
restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic
problems. Sen treated problems such as majority rule, individual
rights and the availability of information about individual
welfare.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Almost all of Sen's work deals with development economics, as
they are often devoted to the welfare of the poorest people in
society. He has also studied actual famines. In his best-known
work, ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and
Deprivation,'' he challenges the common view that a shortage of
food is the most important (sometimes the only) explanation for
famine.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   On the basis of careful study of a number of catastrophes ... he
argues that famines have occurred even when the supply of food was
not significantly lower than during previous years (without
famines), or that famine-stricken areas have sometimes exported
food.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many Asian stock markets ended recent rallies
Wednesday, closing lower because of profit-taking, Wall Street's
overnight losses and concerns over Japan's banking rescue measures.
In Tokyo, share prices tumbled as investors grew skeptical about
the effectiveness of the government's bank rescue plan. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 172.06 points, or
1.30 percent, closing at 13,070.73. The market's current focus is
on the conditions under which the government would disburse public
funds to weak but viable banks, traders said. Concerns about the
sector helped the dollar to gain. Late Wednesday, it was trading at
119.72 yen, up 1.34 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above
its late New York level of 119.15 yen overnight. Hong Kong shares
also finished lower as investors cashed in on gains built up in the
past five sessions, traders said. After a session of choppy
trading, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 8,840.01, down
168.82 points, or 1.9 percent. Singapore shares closed sharply
lower on investors' profit-taking, ending one of its most bullish
phases all year, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times Index
closed 29.86 points, or 2.9 percent, lower at 985.78. (ASIAN

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is facing one of the ``most difficult and
complex periods in its history'' and there is no easy way out of
the economic crisis, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Wednesday. Primakov told the upper chamber of parliament that the
government was preparing for hardships this winter and had recently
established an emergency food reserve. The government has spent 600
million rubles (dlrs 40 million) over the past two weeks to build
up food stocks, Primakov said. No serious food shortages are
expected, but the plan shows the government is concerned that
conditions could worsen. Primakov acknowledged that the reserves,
if used, would only ``cover the needs of a third of the
population.'' Primakov has been in office for over a month, but his
government is still formulating an economic plan to revive the
economy. He said his top priorities were to repay overdue wages,
restructure the banking system and revise the country's unwieldy
tax system. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian stock exchange chiefs pledged to make
their financial dealings more transparent to allay fears of wary
investors and promised to strengthen regulations to rein in
increasingly volatile markets. Other stock exchange leaders at the
Singapore economic summit agreed, detailing plans to more carefully
manage their markets in the interest of fairness and bringing back
investment. The chairman of Thailand's Stock Exchange, Amaret
Sila-on, said that with new regulations and enforcement, ``we will
be in much better shape coming out of this recession than when this
financial turmoil began.'' Several central bank governors, meeting
in a separate panel, said they expect increased restrictions to be
placed on hedge funds, which trade on currency instability and have
been blamed for sudden, disastrous devaluations in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand. (ASIA-ECONOMIC CONFERENCE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Clinton administration predicted that the
182-nation International Monetary Fund would go along with new U.S.
lending conditions in return for dlrs 18 billion in funding.
Germany, Japan, France and Britain, the next biggest IMF
contributors after the United States, made no public complaints
Tuesday about the strings U.S. lawmakers plan to attach to the
American payment. Officials from those four nations and senior IMF
leaders have urged many of the same changes in IMF operations as
members of Congress have, including opening its books and secretive
proceedings to more public scrutiny. ``It's only logical that an
organization change how it does business after 53 years of
existence to adapt to the changing international situation,''
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said last week.
Britain has urged Congress to approve the money as soon as
possible, particularly for a new emergency line of credit. Senior
IMF officials have said they have only dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 9
billion in regular reserves left to lend and dlrs 15 billion in an
emergency fund. The officials said they could manage a dlrs 30
billion Brazil bailout and loans to other countries if they knew
the dlrs 18 billion from the United States was coming because it
unlocks payments from other countries that would build up reserves
by dlrs 90 billlion. (US-IMF-CONDITIONS)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Police turned water cannons on striking
state employees and unions threatened massive to paralyze the
Colombia's capital with massive demonstrations in a the sixth day
of a nationwide walkout. Negotiations to end the strike were
suspended Tuesday as violence erupted in two cities, without
causing injuries. There was no indication when negotiations would
resume. The strike, affecting 650,000 workers, was called in
protest of a government austerity package that cuts public sector
spending and reduces wage increases next year to an average of 14
percent _ less than the annual 18 percent inflation rate. The
government, which has declared the strike illegal, say conceding to
union demands would mean doubling the public deficit, which
President Andres Pastrana said was currently 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product. The state unions plan to march Wednesday in
Bogota to urge an end to plans to privatize state industries.

German Railway and workers agree to extend jobs protection plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The German railway, Deutsche Bahn, and the
railworkers union agreed Wednesday to extend for four years a job
protection plan for the 260,000 railworkers.
	   The agreement protecting workers jobs in the face of downsizing
was to expire at the end of the year. Despite the continuing job
protection, the railway expects to cut back some 20,000 jobs this
year through voluntary severance agreements.
	   The railworkers union has been negotiating to extend the
protection agreement for more than a year, and the union vice
president, Norbert Hansen, credited the election of a new
center-left government for the deal.
	   ``This is a signal for political change in Germany,'' Hansen
said.

Egyptian suspect raises questions

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ An Egyptian formally charged in
the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam has been
providing investigators with a lot of information but has been less
than forthcoming about his role in the blast, sources close to the
investigation say.
	   Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were
charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11
counts of murder each in the bombing in which 11 people, all
Africans, died.
	   On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a
bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213
people, including 12 Americans.
	   Ahmed has told investigators that he volunteered information on
the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 8 to the British High Commission as
well as the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents.
	   But he denied having any information on or involvement in the
Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be
further identified, said Ahmed seemed to know much more about
international terrorism than an ordinary person would.
	   In an interview Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed
likened Ahmed to a chameleon.
	   ``He shows you a certain color, but ultimately you find it is
not his true color,'' he said.
	   Investigators believe that Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades
Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building
of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the
explosive device that blew up the embassy.
	   The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have
reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs.
	   Ameir dismissed a report in the current issue of Newsweek
magazine that members of Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist group posing as U.S. informants had gone to both
embassies with phony bomb warnings to learn how their security
systems would react.
	   ``Such information would definitely have been passed on to me by
my assistants, but as it happens, I had no infomation of that kind
at all,'' he said.
	   The FBI has linked bin Laden and Al Qaeda to both bombings.
	   Other sources close to the investigation said security at the
Dar es Salaam embassy was not high and that the bombing had, in
fact, caught security personnel off guard.
	   Ameir said the investigation has slowed down because the FBI has
completely changed its team of agents in Tanzania.
	   But he did say that investigators have determine that the
vehicle that carried the bomb into the embassy compound was a
two-ton Japanese-made truck purchased from Jaba Tanzania Ltd., a
local firm that specializes in second-hand vehicles.
	   Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried on a
water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the
embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood.

Netanyahu says stalemate could be broken at U.S. summit

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Israeli-Palestinian summit beginning
Thursday in the United States could break the stalemate in the
peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday.
	   ``I believe every person in the Israeli government and in the
Israeli people hopes this (summit) will succeed,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein is abroad.
	   The Israeli prime minister returned home by helicopter
afterwards to fly to the United States where he is due to start
intensive negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a
resort outside Washington on Thursday.
	   ``It is very clear that if the Palestinians live up to their
commitments in all the fields _ but most of them touch on security
_ then we shall have the ability to conclude a successful agreement
for advancing the peace,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu said the Hebron accord signed last year with the
Palestinians provided a mechanism for fighting terrorism.
	   Terrorism imperiled not only Israeli security but could also
``take root in the Palestinian population,'' Netanyahu said.
	   More than 400 students at the University of Jordan staged a
45-minute protest on the campus after the prime minister's
departure, chanting ``Netanyahu, coward, you are neither a human
nor an animal.''
	   The students, who also burnt an Israeli flag, were mostly
supporters of hard-line militant groups which oppose Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is hosting the summit which will
discuss a longstanding U.S. proposal for Israeli troops to withdraw
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has proposed
a modification in terms of which 3 percent of the land handed-over
will remain effectively under its control.
	   Arafat visited Jordan on Monday for similar consultations.
	   Standing next to Netanyahu, Hassan said that Israel and the
Palestinians should move swiftly toward a final settlement with the
Palestinians so that Israel can conclude similar agreements with
Lebanon and Syria.
	   Jordan is pushing for a settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict, the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Jordan is the first since relations chilled
in September 1997 after a botched attempt by the Israeli secret
service to kill a Palestinian militant leader in Jordan.

British unemployment rate remains steady
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unemployment in Britain stayed at 4.6 percent for
the second consecutive month, the lowest level in nearly two
decades, the government reported Wednesday.
	   The number of people claiming welfare dropped by 16,400 to about
1.3 million in September to remain at 4.6 percent, the lowest total
since the summer of 1980.
	   Unemployment had stood at 4.7 percent in July.
	   The government announcement brought largely good news on the
employment front after weeks of high-profile job losses across
Britain. However, most of the recent layoffs had not yet factored
into Wednesday's figures, which indicated a steady growth in
employment.
	   Employment Minister Andrew Smith said the numbers showed many
people had re-entered the job market after being out of work.
	   ``If we want to increase our employment rate to the level of
countries like America and Japan, it is important to bring back
into the labor market those who had given up hope of ever finding a
job,'' Smith said.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ International Monetary Fund policies prescribed
for Indonesia, although criticized by many in the region as
bringing hardship to ordinary people in the name of national
recovery, are working, the country's central bank governor said
Wednesday.
	   Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said the delay in his
country's revival from near collapse is the result of non-economic
factors.
	   Speaking on a panel at the East Asia Economic Summit, sponsored
by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, Sjahril also said
that Indonesian corporations are overexposed to short-term debt.
	   He agreed with other central bankers at the conference that
``better monitoring is needed of short-term capital flows.''
	   Sjahril also said he is confident that the rupiah, trading
Wednesday at around 8,850 to the U.S. dollar, will continue to
improve.
	   It has gained from 10,800 to the dollar at the beginning of the
month.
	   While Indonesia still has serious problems of unemployment, food
distribution and political instability, Stanley Roth, the U.S.
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
said the situation is much better than what had been expected in
May when President Suharto was ousted after rioting.
	   ``Compared to what people thought might be happening, it's not
dire,'' Roth told a news conference during the economic summit.
	   He said President B.J. Habibie had succeeded in arranging a
political process that will lead to elections and in gaining
agreement on tough economic changes.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ An American company will help revamp a
major Bulgarian thermal power plant , with outlays estimated at
dlrs 400 million, the state newsagency BTA reported.
	   Entergy Power Group, based in Ervine, California, is to
reconstruct the Maritza-Iztok-3 power station near Stara Zagora,
some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Sofia, in a joint
venture with Bulgaria's National Electric Company.
	   No details of the venture were released.
	   The project includes implementation of enviroment-friendly
technology that will phase out sulfur dioxide emissions from the
plant, BTA said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid
convoys Wednesday to ethnic Albanians refugees, many of whom are
still afraid to return home despite President Slobodan Milosevic's
agreement to end the Kosovo crackdown.
	   Britain's foreign secretary warned the Yugoslav leader again
Wednesday that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs down on
the agreement, reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, to
withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace talks with separatist
ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000 monitors into the troubled
Serb province to verify compliance.
	   Those steps are designed to end the seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian separatists, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 refugees homeless. NATO gave
Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply or face airstrikes.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday before Milosevic
bowed to international demands. U.N. officials said many refugees
were still hiding in the hills and forests, fearing Serb reprisals
if they go home.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' a U.N.
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   In order to build such confidence, the Holbrooke agreement
provides for about 2,000 international monitors to be stationed in
Kosovo. But the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the ``verification mission,'' has no pool
of monitors and must ask its 54 member governments to provide them.
	   OSCE officials say it could take weeks before all 2,000 of them
are in the province. OSCE expects to receive offers of personnel by
next week.
	   In the hils about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Kosovo,
some refugees said Wednesday that they don't trust Milosevic and
have no confidence in the ability of unarmed monitors to guarantee
their safety.
	   ``He is lying that they are withdrawing their forces,'' said a
56-year-old refugee, who gave his name only as Hasan. ``They are
here. There are tanks dug in the ground.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that
NATO would be watching closely for evidence of compliance and that
Milosevic should take alliance warnings seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The united consensus within NATO that we were ready to take
military action was there at the beginning of the week, is still
there and that decision is still on the table. We can reactivate
these plans any time we feel it is necessary to do so.''
	   Echoing the British official, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel said the world ``must remain watchful'' because of the
Yugoslav leader's record of breaking his promises.
	   In a step toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan
for a separate parliament in Kosovo. The plan, announced late
Tuesday, calls for local elections in the separatist province for
1999. According to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have their
own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them. It
also offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected
war criminals.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose independence for Kosovo fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, said
Holbrooke's agreement had calmed the situation but that the Kosovo
Albanian community remains under pressure.
	   ``I appeal to all, the United Nations, the European Union and
NATO to reach a consensus, to come together for action in Kosovo
and to protect the Kosovo people,'' Rugova told Germany's ARD
television Wednesday. ``We are under Serb domination.''
	   Despite the agreement with Holbrooke, it was clear that the
Yugoslav president has no intention of loosening his grip on power.
	   Late Tuesday, Serb police stormed the offices of independent
newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas and closed them down for
allegedly violating a recent government decree that required
self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   The decrees, issued last week, banned reports on NATO threats,
military preparations or any other developments which could
allegedly alarm the populace.
	   Dnevni Telegraf had been publishing such reports regularly under
headlines such as ``We have not reported this'' or ``respecting the
decree, we are not saying that:''On Saturday, a popular radio
station, Index, was shut down.
	   ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and this must be
stopped,'' said Dnevni Telegraf's managing editor, Slavko Curuvija.
``Until now we could at least write about it. Now we can't even do
that.''

Dream fight only needs two signatures to become reality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis have both given
their verbal consent to put their belts on the line in a
long-awaited world heavyweight unification fight.
	   All that is required for the battle for boxing's ultimate prize
to go ahead is the signatures of both fighters on a contract.
	   A deal for the fight was brokered by rival promoters Don King
and Panos Eliades and Lewis' manager Frank Maloney in London
earlier this week.
	   King has already said the fight will go ahead ``for sure'',
adding that if it doesn't, only the boxers can be to blame.
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF world heavyweight titlist, and Lewis,
the WBC world champion, are tentatively scheduled to fight in
February or March next year. The venue will almost certainly be Las
Vegas.
	   Holyfield, who is expected to earn dlrs 20 million to risk his
two title belts, said he wants to be the ``undisputed champion.''
	   ``I wanted to fight for the right reason and the right reason
has always been to be the very best and to be the undisputed
champion,'' he said.
	   ``Now that things are in place and it appears that this fight
can come off, then I look forward to it,'' he told Sky TV news late
Tuesday.
	   Eliades said Lewis would accept a dlrs 8 million payday for the
fight, noting that his earning potential would increase
dramatically if he wins the winner-take-all fight.
	   ``Lennox wants this fight more than any other fight. He's not
interested in the small fights,'' Eliades said.
	   ``Lennox has always been the one to sign in the past and then
with Evander for one reason or another, things have gone wrong.''
	   In April, Holyfield declined a dlrs 20 million offer from Home
Box Office cable network to fight Lewis.
	   But the major hurdle in the past, the battle between rival
American television broadcasters for the rights to the fight, was
erased Monday when King agreed to screen the fight on the HBO
network instead of Showtime, which screens his regular promotions.
	   While King is confident there will be no obstacles to the
championship bout, Eliades said it was not a done deal until both
boxers signed a contract.
	   The deal reportedly includes a clause for a return fight if
Holyfield loses. While the winner is also obliged to fight leading
WBA contender Henry Akinwande.
	   The promoters are billing the bout as the fight fans have been
waiting to see since 1992, when heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe
trashed the WBC title belt after failing to fight Lewis _ then a
challenger.

	   CAMP DANGWA, Philippines (AP) _ The bodies of seven men, their
heads and arms chopped off, have been found in two northern
Philippine ravines, possibly victims of police or gang executions,
police said Wednesday.
	   A foul smell led motorists Tuesday to the bodies, caught in
vines and shrubs on the sides of two deep ravines in the mountain
town of Itogon in Benguet province, provincial police chief Eugene
Martin said.
	   Police were determining the identities of the men, who could
have been illegally executed by police or killed by rival gangs, he
said.

Kuwait threatens to flood oil market to punish oversuppliers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's oil minister has threatened to flood the
oil market, warning the Gulf states will not tolerate other oil
suppliers pumping beyond their quotas, a Kuwaiti newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   ``Patience has limits,'' the Arab Times quoted Sheik Saud
al-Sabah as telling a seminar in Kuwait late Tuesday. ``We will not
continue to pay the price for other countries' non-compliance. We
refuse to be exploited.''
	   He did not specify which countries he was accusing. But he said
both members and non-members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries were overproducing, destroying efforts to raise
oil prices through agreements to cut back production.
	   ``We warn, as we have repeatedly warned that (Gulf Cooperation
Council) states are capable of flooding the international
markets,'' the official said, adding that Gulf countries can manage
with ``very low'' prices while other producers cannot.
	   However, he said ``we hope that we will not be forced to resort
to this policy because this will hurt all.''
	   Sheik Saud blamed the fall in oil prices on OPEC's agreement in
Jakarta last year. The cartel decided then to boost its output by
10 percent to 27.5 million barrels a day, and prices have taken a
downward turn since despite two cuts that followed.
	   Gulf oil prices are now about dlrs 12 a barrel, up only slightly
from the 10-year low they plummeted to in August.
	   Sheik Saud did not attend the Jakarta meeting. He took office in
March in a government reshuffle, and he has been strongly pushing
for improving the price of oil, the mainstay of his country's
economy.
	   Kuwait is pumping 1.98 million barrels a day, and it foresees a
shortfall of 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.27 billion) in the current
fiscal year that started in June.
	   The Gulf Cooperation Council groups Kuwait with Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police detained a motorist for
questioning Wednesday after his parked car exploded right outside a
school. No one was injured.
	   Investigators suspected a bomb went off inside the auto because
of the force of the explosion, which blew out a number of windows
at the Montessori school in the Osdorp neighborhood on Amsterdam's
southwest outskirts, Dutch television reported.
	   A police bomb squad was on the scene examining the wreckage of
the car for evidence of explosives.
	   School personnel were trying to comfort the scores of young
children who ran out of the building, screaming, after the
midmorning blast.

Netanyahu says ready to go `very long way' toward agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu, Sharon quotes; ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Sending mixed messages, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Wednesday he would go a ``very long way'' toward
negotiating an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback, after
declaring a day earlier there was no chance for such a deal.
	   Netanyahu made the conflicting statements to different audiences
on the eve of a make-or-break Mideast summit hosted by U.S.
President Bill Clinton at a secluded resort near Washington.
	   As the prime minister's departure drew near, opponents of a
withdrawal deal became increasingly vocal, threatening to topple
the government and field a challenger to Netanyahu in the next
elections if he signs off on a pullback deal with the Palestinians.
	   Even two Netanyahu allies in the Cabinet who support a
land-for-peace deal _ in principle _ urged the prime minister
Wednesday not to attend the Washington summit.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and Science Minister Silvan
Shalom said that in light of unrealistically high expectations that
the summit will yield an agreement, Israel would come under intense
pressure to make concessions.
	   ``When so many issues still haven't been concluded, we will be
in a very difficult situation,'' Sharansky said.
	   Israel's new foreign minister, Cabinet hard-liner Ariel Sharon,
said Israel would stand up to pressure and would not close a deal
unless the Palestinians made good on their security commitments.
	   ``We expect that the government will be sufficiently resolute
and its delegation will be sufficiently strong to insist on the
fulfillment of the commitments,'' Sharon said in a brief
question-and-answer session as he took control of the ministry.
	   Netanyahu has cited nine conditions the Palestinians must
fulfill before Israel with withdraw troops from 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   The Palestinians must arrest suspected Islamic militants,
cooperate with Israel on security matters, reduce their police
force by several thousands, confiscate illegal weapons, extradite
prisoners sought by Israel and annul sections of the PLO charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have noted that an understanding on security
matters was negotiated last year by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S.
officials, and that it was Netanyahu who rejected the deal. The
United States has been trying to work out a new arrangement.
	   One of the sticking points is that the Palestinians demand
reciprocity, saying that if they are to disarm Islamic militants,
then Israel must confiscate the weapons of Jewish extremists.
	   After a meeting Wednesday with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in
Amman on Wednesday, Netanyahu said that if Israel's security
demands are met, ``we will be willing to go a long way, even very
long'' toward a peace agreement.
	   However, on Tuesday evening, in response to the killing of an
Israeli man in a shooting attack blamed on Palestinian militants,
Netanyahu appeared very pessimistic.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   In other developments Wednesday, an Israeli newspaper said U.S.
officials are floating a new formula to entice the Palestinians not
to go through with a planned unilateral declaration of statehood in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in May.
	   Under the plan, Netanyahu would declare now that he agrees in
principle to the creation of a Palestinian state. However, the
exact borders and powers of this state would be determined in
future negotiations, reported the Haaretz daily.
	   In exchange for such an Israeli declaration, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat would forgo the planned declaration of statehood.
	   Netanyahu spokesman Aviv Bushinsky denied such a proposal was
made by U.S. officials.

Ukrainian president meets with lawmakers to discuss government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma asked a
group of non-affiliated lawmakers Wednesday to suggest candidates
for his embattled government.
	   ``The president is expecting proposals and candidacies to make
changes in the government,'' said Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr
Maidannyk.
	   He said Kuchma also was ready to consult with all factions in
the Verkhovna Rada parliament over the composition of his Cabinet.
About 25 of its 450 members are not affiliated with any party.
	   Kuchma's meeting with the lawmakers came one day after the Rada,
dominated by his leftist and centrist foes, failed to muster enough
votes to bring down the Cabinet of Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko over its handling of Ukraine's deep economic crisis.
	   ``The results of the vote show that the government's efforts to
overcome the crisis are bringing certain positive results,'' Kuchma
said Wednesday, according to Maidannyk.
	   Kuchma, who has made such offers before, says he opposes
parliamentary attempts to bring down the entire government, which
he views as being motivated by political reasons rather than by
problems with the Cabinet's competence.
	   Maidannyk suggested that those lawmakers who voted against the
no-confidence motion Tuesday or abstained might eventually form the
basis for a broad parliamentary majority.
	   If consensus is to emerge from the currently divided parliament,
Kuchma would entrust lawmakers with forming a new government,
Maidannyk said.

Yeltsin, suffering from cold, returns to work at the Kremlin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin's TV appearance in new grafs 5-6. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
work in the Kremlin on Wednesday, defying doctors' orders to stay
home and recover from a respiratory infection.
	   Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, and planned other working meetings throughout the
day, Russian news agencies said.
	   ``The president feels well,'' Primakov said after the meeting,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. He is ``absolutely fit to
work,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Primakov said Yeltsin waved his hand ``when we reminded him that
he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said of his doctors:
``Don't listen to them.''
	   The start of the meeting was later shown on Russian television.
Yeltsin looked a little pale and tired, and walked stiffly, but he
was smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his ministers.
	   ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making a fuss about it,
he told Primakov.
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Tuesday that
doctors ordered the president to stay in bed and that he would not
be in the office all week.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from a visit to
Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from
an upper respiratory infection, was coughing and running a fever.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including heart
bypass surgery two years ago. He insists he has no major illnesses
and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term, but
whenever Yeltsin gets sick, there is speculation about his ability
to govern.
	   Primakov reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin has no plans to
resign or call early elections.
	   ``I think the president must serve his term in office to the
end,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to
Central Asia. He canceled most of his public engagements in
Uzbekistan, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling
remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.
	   Shortly after arriving in neighboring Kazakstan on Monday,
doctors ordered him to return home a day earlier than planned.

Education minister promises improvements to protesting students
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Education Minister Claude Allegre said Wednesday
the leftist government ``has heard'' protesting students who took
to the streets of France twice this week and will meet their
demands for better conditions.
	   High school students planned a third demonstration in Paris on
Thursday.
	   ``I think it is logical for the young, when there are needs,
when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are overcrowded,
to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said at the close
of the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   The government ``has heard'' the students ``and I'm doing what I
can to give this to them,'' he said.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, Allegre presented a plan to improve
conditions, in part by spreading teachers out more equitably around
the country. On Tuesday, he said the plan aims at ``putting a
teacher before every student.''
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin hailed the plan, saying
it would bring about ``very rapid improvements.''
	   It was presented as high school students mobilized for a third
demonstration Thursday, in Paris.
	   Up to 100,000 students, demanding smaller classes and better
equipment, took to the streets Tuesday around France.
	   Allegre promised that a plan to lighten the course load for high
school students would be presented in November.
	   Even some teachers were beginning to root for protesting
students. One of the largest teacher's unions called on Tuesday for
its members to show solidarity with their protesting students.

AIDS kills more than 6,000 Cambodians this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Some 6,600 people have died of AIDS
so far this year in Cambodia, the Asian nation with the highest
rate of HIV transmission, health workers said Wednesday.
	   ``If a bomb kills 70 people it is frightening, but what is more
frightening is that 50 to 70 people are quietly contracting HIV
each day,'' said Tia Phalla, deputy director of the Health
Ministry's HIV/AIDS control center.
	   Using figures obtained from blood banks, the center estimates
that 150,000 of Cambodia's 11 million people have HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, with 90 percent of the HIV infections caused by
sexual intercourse.
	   The Health Ministry's latest statistics show that more than
15,000 Cambodians have died of AIDS, with 6,600 succumbing so far
this year.
	   The Cambodian sex industry exploded after the arrival of a free
market economy and 20,000 well-paid United Nations peacekeepers in
1992, when elections were organized to end the country's
decades-old civil war.
	   But despite nationwide AIDS awareness programs, the use of
condoms has so far not caught on in the impoverished country.
	   ``We have failed to curb the epidemic through the HIV/AIDS
awareness programs. It's very hard to change people's behavior,''
Tia Phalla said.
	   The latest prevention strategy to be tried by the Health
Ministry is a program that has been successful in neighboring
Thailand, which also has a thriving sex industry.
	   A trial program has been approved by the government to force
customers at brothels in the seaside town of Sihanoukville to use
condoms.
	   Prostitutes will be instructed by health workers to require all
their customers to wear condoms. If men refuse to comply, sex
workers will be encouraged to report them to police.
	   If the trial is successful over the next two months, the Health
Ministry will slowly expand the program nationwide.
	   Approximately 20,000 women are employed in Cambodia's sex
industry, which Tia Phalla estimated is a dlrs 32 million annual
business.

Indian teacher wins Nobel for economics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST lead, RAISE reference to award's
recent tarnish, UPDATES with comment from Swedish sociologist. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, a scholar from India whose
work produced a new understanding of the catastrophes that plague
society's poorest people, on Wednesday won the Nobel Economics
Prize.
	   Sen (whose first name is pronounced Ah-MAR-tya) was awarded the
prestigious prize for his contributions to welfare economics, which
help explain the economic mechanisms underlying famines and
poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
	   Sen ``has restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of
vital economic problems,'' the citation said.
	   The 64-year-old economist joined Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge this year after teaching at Harvard University, among
other institutions. He has studied the Bangladesh famine of 1974
and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the countries of
the Sahara.
	   The economics prize has been tarnished by the controversy
surrounding last year's winners, Americans Robert Merton and Myron
Scholes, who were honored for their work on valuing risky
``derivatives'' investments such as stock options. Last month, the
hedge fund in which they were partners, Long-Term Capital
Management, nearly collapsed and needed a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout
from banks.
	   Sen works in development economics, the study of the welfare of
the world's poorest people. His best-known work, detailed in his
1981 book ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and
Deprivation,'' challenges the common view that the shortage of food
is the most important explanation of famine.
	   Looking at several catastrophes, Sen has shown that ``famines
have occurred even when the supply of food was not significantly
lower than during previous years'' without famines, the citation
said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined. Due to
these factors, the real incomes of agricultural workers declined so
much that they were disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes hard economic analysis and broader questions
about the best ways to determine whether poverty is increasing or
decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective
decision-making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of
sociology at the University of Stockholm. ``He cares about the
poorest in society.''
	   Sen's award highlights an underappreciated area of study, said
Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James and Associates, an
investment firm in St. Petersburg, Florida.
	   ``Developmental economics has never really gotten a whole lot of
attention in the academic world, and certainly the magnitude of the
problem and type of issues it deals with is obviously very
significant,'' Brown said.
	   The prize was worth about dlrs 963,000 at today's exchange rate.
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work.
	   The Long-Term Capital debacle inevitably tainted a prize that
many have criticized. It's not clear whether the theories of Merton
and Scholes were misapplied by the giant fund, which catered to
wealthy investors, or whether the theories themselves were faulty.
	   This honor is the only Nobel not established in the will of
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. It was
created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central bank.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The peace prize, the last in this year's series, is to be
announced Friday.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel.

 &UR; Eds: Clarifies title belts in lead

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis have both given
their verbal consent to put their respective title belts on the
line in a long-awaited world heavyweight unification fight.
	   All that is required for the battle for boxing's ultimate prize
to go ahead is the signatures of both fighters on a contract.
	   A deal for the fight was brokered by rival promoters Don King
and Panos Eliades and Lewis' manager Frank Maloney in London
earlier this week.
	   King has already said the fight will go ahead ``for sure'',
adding that if it doesn't, only the boxers can be to blame.
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF world heavyweight titlist, and Lewis,
the WBC world champion, are tentatively scheduled to fight in
February or March next year. The venue will almost certainly be Las
Vegas.
	   Holyfield, who is expected to earn dlrs 20 million to risk his
two title belts, said he wants to be the ``undisputed champion.''
	   ``I wanted to fight for the right reason and the right reason
has always been to be the very best and to be the undisputed
champion,'' he said.
	   ``Now that things are in place and it appears that this fight
can come off, then I look forward to it,'' he told Sky TV news late
Tuesday.
	   Eliades said Lewis would accept a dlrs 8 million payday for the
fight, noting that his earning potential would increase
dramatically if he wins the winner-take-all fight.
	   ``Lennox wants this fight more than any other fight. He's not
interested in the small fights,'' Eliades said.
	   ``Lennox has always been the one to sign in the past and then
with Evander for one reason or another, things have gone wrong.''
	   In April, Holyfield declined a dlrs 20 million offer from Home
Box Office cable network to fight Lewis.
	   But the major hurdle in the past, the battle between rival
American television broadcasters for the rights to the fight, was
erased Monday when King agreed to screen the fight on the HBO
network instead of Showtime, which screens his regular promotions.
	   While King is confident there will be no obstacles to the
championship bout, Eliades said it was not a done deal until both
boxers signed a contract.
	   The deal reportedly includes a clause for a return fight if
Holyfield loses. While the winner is also obliged to fight leading
WBA contender Henry Akinwande.
	   The promoters are billing the bout as the fight fans have been
waiting to see since 1992, when heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe
trashed the WBC title belt after failing to fight Lewis _ then a
challenger.

U.N. convoys in Kosovo restart after brief interruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS final grafs with Red Cross convoy. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed running aid
convoys Wednesday in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province after
staff were briefly evacuated earlier this week, a spokesman said.
	   But it is too early to assess whether the agreement by
Yugoslavia to halt its crackdown in the province will make refugees
more inclined to return home, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' Janowski
said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants has killed hundreds and left
300,000 or more refugees homeless.
	   UNHCR convoys were interrupted on Monday and Tuesday when United
Nations headquarters ordered its staff in the provincial capital
Pristina to be evacuated, Janowski said.
	   They returned last night to Pristina Tuesday after spending a
night in Skopje, Macedonia, he said.
	   The agency's access to refugees remains largely unchanged,
according to Janowski. ``Even before the agreement, we generally
had no major access problems.''
	   However, a ``large international presence'' of monitors and a
reduction in Serb forces is needed to give people the confidence to
return home, he said.
	   Also Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross ran
its first field trip outside Pristina since late September, when
one ICRC member was killed and three injured when their vehicle hit
a landmine.
	   The organization took 30 tons of supplies to the Mitrovica area,
deploying ``special security,'' ICRC spokesman Roland Sidler said.

Seized heroin shipment Australia's largest, police say

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court appearance, other details &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ In Australia's largest-ever seizure of
heroin, agents swept down Wednesday on traffickers off the east
coast, confiscated 900 pounds (400 kilograms) of the drug and
arrested 18 people, authorities said.
	   The raid by Australian state and national police and customs
officials culminated a 10-week international police operation,
breaking up a major trafficking ring, officials said.
	   On initial examination, the haul was up to 900 pounds (400
kilograms) of high-grade heroin worth up to 400 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 250 million), Federal Police chief Mick Palmer
said.
	   ``It is three times the complete seizures (in Australia) last
year, it is the largest seizure in Australia's history and it is up
there with some of the biggest seizures in other parts of the
world,'' he said.
	   Armed police moved in early Wednesday as the shipment was
brought ashore at a deserted beach near Port Macquarie, on New
South Wales state's mid-north coast.
	   Minutes later, police raided a 130-foot (40-meter) ship moored
25 nautical miles (46 kilometers) offshore that had unloaded the
shipment, and arrested the captain and members of the crew.
	   Television footage showed police aboard the freighter guarding
crew members, who were lying face down on the deck, their hands
handcuffed behind their backs.
	   Palmer said the heroin was believed to have come from Southeast
Asia's ``Golden Triangle'' _ where the borders of Thailand, Myanmar
and Laos converge. The ship had sailed from Southeast Asia, but
police did not disclose the owner or other details about it.
	   The action followed surveillance of a Hong Kong man who aroused
Australian police suspicions during an earlier visit to Sydney.
Australian authorities collaborated with Hong Kong police in
uncovering the massive import scheme.
	   Fifteen of those arrested appeared later amid heavy security in
Macquarie Local Court on drug importation charges. Three others who
were still aboard the ship were expected to face the court when it
arrived in Sydney on Thursday.
	   Those who appeared in court Wednesday, reported to be Chinese
and Indonesians ranging in age from 21 to 49, were remanded in
custody and ordered to appear with interpreters in a Sydney court
Friday.
	   Two women, believed to be wives of some of the men involved,
were detained after raids at several locations in Hong Kong,
Australian Associated Press reported from Beijing.
	   The previous largest haul of heroin in Australia was more than
265 pounds (120 kilograms) recovered from Darwin Harbor after being
thrown overboard from a Thai fishing boat in 1994.
	   Federal agent Ray Tinker said Wednesday's amount was enough for
20 million ``hits'' of heroin, which Justice Minister Amanda
Vanstone said was more than enough for every person in Australia.

Cohen: Saudi agrees to increase cooperation on Khobar bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has agreed ``to share
more information'' with the United States from its investigation
into a 1996 bombing that killed 19 U.S. troops, Defense Secretary
William Cohen said.
	   Cohen told a news conference late Tuesday that Saudi officials
were committed to exchanging information to combat terrorism, such
as the June 1996 attack on an American military complex in eastern
Saudi city of Khobar. He did not elaborate.
	   The kingdom is still investigating the bombing and has arrested
scores of people, but the investigation remains cloaked in secrecy.
	   U.S. officials have complained repeatedly about problems getting
information from the Saudis on the bombing case and about lack of
access to suspects.
	   Cohen left Saudi Arabia Wednesday after a six-nation Gulf tour
aimed at trying to convince allies to finance a regional missile
defense system.
	   Cohen told reporters Monday in Kuwait that America's Gulf allies
were receptive to the idea of a missile defense system to protect
against the threat of attacks by countries like Iran and Iraq.
	   Iran recently tested a long-range missile, and the United States
accuses Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions, of continuing efforts
to acquire missile technology that has a range longer than it is
permitted to have.
	   The United States wants allies to help fund the development of
antimissile systems or cooperate in future deployment, Cohen said.
	   During his Gulf tour, Cohen also visited Bahrain, Qatar, Oman
and the United Arab Emirates.

Armenian Orthodox church in Turkey elects new spiritual leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's Armenian Orthodox community
elected Mesrob Mutafyan as the new patriarch on Wednesday after his
sole rival withdrew from the race.
	   Mutafyan, 42, took the name of Mesrob II.
	   He replaces Karekin II, who died of cancer in March at the age
of 71 after eight years as the church's spiritual leader.
	   The election was delayed by the government, which reportedly
favored his rival, Archbishop Sahan Sivaciyan, 72. But Sivaciyan
withdrew just hours before the voting without giving a reason.
	   ``Sivaciyan made the right gesture as an experienced elder,''
Mutafyan said.
	   Mutafyan became the 84th Patriarch of Turkey's estimated 65,000
Armenian Orthodox believers. He got 74 votes from the 89-member
delegation of clerics and lay people.
	   The community, most of whom live in Istanbul, dissociates itself
from the Armenian diaspora, which wants Turkey to admit to the
massacre of millions of Armenians between 1915 and 1923. Turkey
denies genocide, insisting the victims died in a civil war.
	   Mesrob II, born Minas Mutafyan in Istanbul, studied sociology
and philosophy in the United States in 1977. He became a priest in
1979, and studied history and Biblical literature the same year in
Jerusalem. He became a bishop in 1986, and in 1988 studied
ecumenical theology in Italy.
	   He was ordained archbishop in 1992 and became Karekin's deputy
last year.

Primakov warns of `difficult' time ahead for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with more Primakov's quotes, the ruble
strengthening against the dollar; CORRECTS that the government is
spending dlrs 600 million, not 600 million rubles to create
emergency food reserves in graf 3. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday
that Russia was facing one of the ``most difficult and complex
periods in its history'' and there was no easy way out of the
current economic crisis.
	   Primakov's glum assessment was delivered in a speech to the
Federation Council, the upper chamber of parliament. He said the
government was preparing for hardships this winter and had recently
established an emergency food reserve.
	   The government has earmarked dlrs 600 million to build up the
reserve that would last for two weeks and cover the needs of a
third of Russia's population, Primakov said.
	   ``The population will have secure supplies of fruit and
vegetables,'' he said. But, he added, ``I must honestly say that we
have limited resources.''
	   No serious food shortages are expected, but the plan shows the
government is concerned that conditions could worsen.
	   Primakov has been in office for over a month, but his government
is still formulating an economic plan to revive the economy.
President Boris Yeltsin has said little about the problem, and most
of the burden in dealing with the economic turmoil appears to be
falling on Primakov.
	   He said his top priorities were to repay overdue wages,
restructure the banking system and revise the country's unwieldy
tax system.
	   ``Russia is now passing through one of the most difficult and
complex periods in its history,'' Primakov said. ``We must join
efforts of the government and regional leaders to get out of the
crisis.''
	   One of the biggest problems is unpaid wages to millions of
workers, many of them state employees. The central government says
in many cases it has allocated the money to regional officials,
only to see the funds diverted for other projects instead of paying
workers.
	   Primakov accused regional officials of turning a blind eye to
the misuse of government subsidies, and called on them to tighten
controls over how money is spent.
	   The billions of rubles (dollars) in unpaid wages and pensions
across Russia are ``a social time bomb placed under our state,''
Primakov said.
	   The Federation Council is made up of regional governors who have
substantial power in their home territories.
	   He also reiterated the government has no plans to ban the
circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies in Russia.
	   However, the Central Bank has tightened controls over the
currency market in an effort to shore up the embattled ruble.
	   The ruble rose sharply Wednesday to 13 a dollar, compared to 15
the previous day. Critics warned that attempts to manipulate the
rate may backfire and result in a sharp drop of the currency.
	   The ruble traded at around 6 to the dollar before the crisis hit
two months ago.
	   The government has promised to make public its plan for
overcoming the economic crisis by Oct. 20. However, the plan is
expected to focus on short-term solutions, rather than
comprehensive, long-term measures for restructuring the Russian
economy.
	   Primakov has also said the government's plans depend on getting
further installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
negotiated with the International Monetary Fund before the crisis
hit.
	   The IMF has frozen disbursement of the loan, saying it wants to
see not only the government's rescue plan, but signs that it has
been implemented.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma starts a
visit to Austria on Wednesday that will include Ukraine's second
summit with the European Union, where they plan to discuss nuclear
safety and EU aid.
	   Kuchma also will hold a summit with Austrian President Thomas
Klestil and Chancellor Viktor Klima and meet with Ukrainians
residing in Austria, said Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr Maidannyk.
	   The two sides are expected to sign a cooperation agreement
between the Ukrainian and Austrian chambers of commerce.
	   Maidannyk said Ukrainian-Austrian economic relations have become
more active recently, adding that Austrian investment in the former
Soviet republic rose by 50 percent in the first half of 1998 from
the same period last year.
	   On Friday, Kuchma will lead Ukraine's delegation to his
country's second summit with the European Union, which is also to
be held in Vienna.
	   The participants are to discuss nuclear safety, the planned
closure of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the EU's
technical and financial assistance to Ukraine, according to
Maidannyk.
	   Klima, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency,
also will attend the Ukraine-EU meeting, along with the president
of the European Commission, Jacques Santer.

Indian famine expert wins Nobel Economics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS grafs 11-12 to ADD comment on Scholes and Merton &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, whose work combining
economics and philosophy has brought new understanding of the
catastrophes that plague society's poorest people, on Wednesday won
the Nobel Economics Prize.
	   Sen, an Indian citizen who teaches at Britain's Trinity College
in Cambridge, was awarded the prestigious prize ``for his
contributions to welfare economics,'' which have helped in the
understanding of the economic mechanisms underlying famines and
poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in its
citation.
	   Sen, 64, who has taught both economics and philosophy, ``has
restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic
problems.''
	   He has studied the Bangladesh famine of 1974 and other
catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the countries of the Sahara.
Sen joined Trinity College this year after teaching at Harvard
University, among other institutions.
	   His best-known work, detailed in his 1981 book ``Poverty and
Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation.'' It challenges
the common view that the shortage of food is the most important
explanation of famine.
	   On the basis of studies of several catastrophes, he shows that
``famines have occurred even when the supply of food was not
significantly lower than during previous years'' without famines,
the citation said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined as one
of the crops could not be harvested. Due to these factors, the real
incomes of agricultural workers declined so much that this group
was disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes not only hard economic analysis, but broader
questions including whether the majority principle is the best way
to make decisions and how can it best be determined whether poverty
is increasing or decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective decision
making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of sociology at
the University of Stockholm.
	   ``He cares about the poorest in society, and if that is a
left-wing view, then yes, he is left-wing,'' Eriksson said.
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work. Last year's economics prize went Americans Robert
Merton and Myron Scholes for their work on how to value so-called
``derivatives'' such as stock options.
	   However, their image was tarnished last month when the hedge
fund in which they were partners failed, necessitating a dlrs 3.6
billion bailout.
	   ''They lost money, but this has nothing to do with the prize; it
has absolutely nothing to do with what they got the prize for,''
Torsten Persson, a prfessor at the Stockholm School of Economics
said Wednesday.
	   The economics prize was not established in Alfred Nobel's will
and was started in 1968. Creating the prize offended those who
believe Nobel's will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize was the fifth of the six Nobels to be given
this year, and the last one announced in Stockholm. The peace
prize, the last in this year's series, is to be announced on Friday
in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 963,000 at
Wednesday's exchange rate).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   The chemistry prize on Tuesday went to Walter Kohn and John A.
Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for advances
in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

Iran frees director of banned liberal newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The managing director of a banned newspaper
has been freed after four weeks in detention, the official Iranian
news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Hamid Reza Jalaipur of the liberal newspaper Tous was released
Tuesday night, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an
unidentified source as saying.
	   Jalaipur was arrested along with editor Mahmoud Shams when Tous
was outlawed on Sept. 16. The authorities accused the paper of
publishing articles detrimental to Iran's security.
	   The newspaper began with the name Jameah. It was closed in July
but reappeared shortly afterward under the title Tous.
	   Hard-liners in Iran's ruling clergy wanted to shut down Tous
because of its passivist stance over Iran's quarrel with the
Taliban government in Afghanistan. The newspaper called for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis provoked by the Taliban's
admission in September that its militiamen had killed eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist. Other newspapers and officials called
for a military strike against the Taliban.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six publications in
recent months and detained six journalists for allegedly publishing
lies.
	   The crackdown runs counter to the efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.
	   With Jalaipur's release, three Tous journalists remain in
detention.

Pernfors beats Cash, Masur lines up Borg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash was
beaten by Mikael Pernfors on home soil Wednesday as the seniors
tennis tour event opened in Sydney.
	   The big names, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe and Henri Leconte, had
the day off with byes into round two.
	   Pernfors, of Sweden, beat Australia's 1987 Wimbledon champion
2-6, 6-4, 10-7.
	   Australia's Wally Masur, making his debut in the seniors
singles, beat Argentina's Jose-Luis Clerc 6-3, 4-6, 10-8 to set up
a match with Borg, winner of 11 Grand Slam titles.
	   ``I played well and I must admit I wanted to have a chance to
play Borg,'' Masur said. ``I've never played him.''
	   Masur realizes he will be a villain if he manages to beat the
older Borg, because it would prevent a possible clash between the
Swede and old-time rival John McEnroe.
	   ``I know the promoters will pull my hair out if I beat him
because I know everyone would like to see a McEnroe-Borg
match-up,'' Masur said. ``I guess I'm in a no-win situation aren't
I?''
	   In the other match on opening day Guillermo Vilas trounced Mark
Edmondson 6-0, 6-2.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ China is replacing its senior representative on
the committee that has handled details of the transfer of Hong
Kong's sovereignty from Britain back to China, the Foreign Ministry
said Wednesday.
	   Wang Guisheng, 58, who took up the post after Hong Kong returned
to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, said after a meeting of the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group last month that the group's work
was mainly completed.
	   Unresolved issues include the resettlement of more than 1,000
Vietnamese refugees living in Hong Kong.
	   China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a replacement
for Wang would be announced soon. The ministry could not be reached
for comment.
	   Wang will take up an ambassadorial post in Europe, the
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Just days from marking the 20th anniversary of his
reign, Pope John Paul II held his 877th general audience Wednesday
in a sun-drenched St. Peter's Square.
	   The pontiff thanked the crowd for their prayers and good wishes.
``I trust greatly in the spiritual support of the people of God to
faithfully carry out my ministry,'' he told them.
	   The Vatican says that nearly 14 million people have attended the
general audiences since John Paul was elected pontiff on Oct. 16,
1978.
	   Wednesday's audience had a particularly festive air because of
the upcoming papal anniversary. The faithful applauded and cheered,
and musical groups prolonged their performances in honor of John
Paul's 20th.
	   On Tuesday night, the pope stunned the host of a TV special on
his pontificate by calling midway through the program to thank him.
	   Host Bruno Vespa nearly cried. ``Even journalists have souls,''
he exclaimed.
	   The anniversary is Friday and a special Mass in planned for
Sunday in St. Peter's Square.

Discussions begin in third round of peace talks

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Delegations began discussions Wednesday
in the third round of Burundi peace talks under a warning from
Tanzanian mediator Julius Nyerere that regional sanctions on the
central African nation would only be lifted if all the parties
agree on peace.
	   ``If you people ... can agree on a peace deal, than you'll have
given me a message to convey to leaders of the Great Lakes,'' the
former Tanzanian president told representatives at a ceremony
Tuesday evening. ``And I hope the sanctions will be lifted within a
very short period.''
	   The Burundian government delegation had reportedly been
contemplating a walkout if sanctions imposed by regional states
after Maj. Pierre Buyoya seized power in July 1996 were not lifted.
	   On Wednesday, an aide to Nyerere said the closed-door,
face-to-face talks began well, and he hoped things would continue
smoothly.
	   Aimed at ending years of political and ethnic conflict in
Burundi, the talks opened with discussions about democracy and good
governance, the first item on the four-point agenda adopted Monday.
	   Other items on the agenda included the adoption of general rules
of negotiation and the appointment of chairmen of committees that
will discuss the issues in the Burundi conflict.
	   Former Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure was named to head
the key peace and security committee after the Burundian government
rejected the other candidate, Nigerian Gen. Victor Mallu, who
headed the West African peace-keeping force in Liberia.
	   The first round of all-party talks opened in June and was
followed by another in July when a cease-fire more or less took
hold in most of the country.
	   At least 14 delegations representing the government, political
parties, members of civil society and government opponents are
taking part in the talks.
	   But the main Hutu rebel group, Forces for Defense of Democracy,
has not been invited. It is the armed wing of the Council for the
Defense of Democracy, which is represented by former Interior
Minister Leonard Nyangoma, and the key rebel group operating
against the minority Tutsi government in Burundi.
	   Buyoya, a retired military officer who had formerly served as
president between 1987 and 1993, has demanded that sanctions
imposed against his country be lifted. The president insists he has
complied with regional demands of a return to a constitutional
regime and holding talks with Hutu rebels.
	   Buyoya took power in 1996 from a weak coalition government that
had failed to put a halt to ethnic bloodshed that erupted in
October 1993 after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first
democratically elected president Hutu Melchior Ndadaye.
	   Majority Hutus initially retaliated against minority Tutsis, but
later the Tutsi-dominated army lashed back at the country's Hutu
population. At least 200,000 Burundians have died in the continuing
violence.

U.S. observers: Azerbaijani presidential election undemocratic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELCHIN TEIMURKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ American observers said Azerbaijan's
presidential election was undemocratic and the violations seemed
aimed at stacking the ballot box in favor of the president of this
oil-rich country, Geidar Aliev.
	   The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a
private watch-dog and educational group, reported ``serious flaws
in both the pre-election period and election-day activities.''
	   ``The election process fell short of standards for democratic
elections,'' it said in a statement released Tuesday.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
Council of Europe have made similar comments about the election
Sunday in this former Soviet republic on the Caspian Sea.
	   But all of the groups said further study was needed to determine
whether the fraud was significant enough to invalidate the election
outcome.
	   The National Democratic Institute said Azerbaijani observers
were intimated, ballot boxes were stuffed and that in some cases
government officials ran polling stations instead of election
commission members.
	   ``It was very disturbing that almost all of these (events)
seemed to operate in the same direction, to favor the incumbent
president,'' the institute said.
	   Aliev ran against five other candidates, but they were widely
perceived to be participating only to make the race seem
competitive.
	   The main opposition groups boycotted the election to protest
Aliev's control of the Central Electoral Commission, crackdown on
opposition rallies, and promotion of the president by the state
media.
	   Official results were not expected until Thursday. But Aliev
claimed victory Tuesday, saying that he received more than 75
percent of the votes. That exceeds the two-thirds majority a
candidate needs to win.
	   Aliev also lashed out at international observers for calling the
vote fraudulent.
	   ``The assessment by the OSCE and the Council of Europe, which
stated yesterday that the election failed to meet international
standards, could have been more objective,'' Aliev said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of
the turn in the events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to
continue work ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must knock on wood, but it appears there will be no
airstrikes.''
	   The six-country Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov was to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to
attend the meeting, said ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Ivanov sounded triumphant Wednesday.
	   ``One can say with a great degree of confidence that we have
averted a threat of a military operation in Yugoslavia,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted him as saying.
	   The Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe will meet in Vienna to approve the OSCE
mandate in Yugoslavia, Ivanov said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid
convoys Wednesday to ethnic Albanians refugees, many of whom are
still afraid to return home despite President Slobodan Milosevic's
agreement to end the Kosovo crackdown.
	   Also Wednesday, the advance party of what is expected to be a
2,000-member ``ground verification mission'' arrived in Kosovo from
neighboring Macedonia to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Britain's foreign secretary warned the Yugoslav leader again
Wednesday that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs down on
the agreement, reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, to
withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace talks with separatist
ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000 monitors into the troubled
Serb province to verify compliance.
	   Those steps are designed to end the seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian separatists, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 refugees homeless. NATO gave
Milosevic until Saturday morning to comply or face airstrikes.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday before Milosevic
bowed to international demands. U.N. officials said many refugees
were still hiding in the hills and forests, fearing Serb reprisals
if they go home.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' a U.N.
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   In order to build such confidence, the Holbrooke agreement
provides for about 2,000 international monitors to be stationed in
Kosovo. But the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the ``verification mission,'' has no pool
of monitors and must ask its 54 member governments to provide them.
	   OSCE officials say it could take weeks before the full
complement is in the province. OSCE expects to receive offers of
personnel by next week.
	   In the meantime, American, Canadian and European members of the
50-member Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission returned Wednesday to
form the advance party of the ground monitor force. Russian members
of the team are expected shortly, a diplomatic source said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The diplomatic observers had been working in Kosovo since July
but were evacuated last week for fear of Serb reprisals if NATO
attacked.
	   In the hils about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Kosovo,
some refugees said Wednesday that they don't trust Milosevic and
have no confidence in the ability of unarmed monitors to guarantee
their safety.
	   ``He is lying that they are withdrawing their forces,'' said a
56-year-old refugee, who gave his name only as Hasan. ``They are
here. There are tanks dug in the ground.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that
NATO would be watching closely for evidence of compliance and that
Milosevic should take alliance warnings seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The united consensus within NATO that we were ready to take
military action was there at the beginning of the week, is still
there and that decision is still on the table. We can reactivate
these plans any time we feel it is necessary to do so.''
	   Echoing the British official, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel said the world ``must remain watchful'' because of the
Yugoslav leader's record of breaking his promises.
	   In a step toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan
for a separate parliament in Kosovo. The plan, announced late
Tuesday, calls for local elections in the separatist province for
1999. According to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have their
own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them. It
also offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected
war criminals.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose independence for Kosovo fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, said
Holbrooke's agreement had calmed the situation but that the Kosovo
Albanian community remains under pressure.
	   ``I appeal to all, the United Nations, the European Union and
NATO to reach a consensus, to come together for action in Kosovo
and to protect the Kosovo people,'' Rugova told Germany's ARD
television Wednesday. ``We are under Serb domination.''
	   Despite the agreement with Holbrooke, it was clear that the
Yugoslav president has no intention of loosening his grip on power.
	   Late Tuesday, Serb police stormed the offices of independent
Belgrade newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas and closed them down
for allegedly violating a recent government decree that required
self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   The decrees, issued last week, banned reports on NATO threats,
military preparations or any other developments which could
allegedly alarm the populace.
	   ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and this must be
stopped,'' said Dnevni Telegraf's managing editor, Slavko Curuvija.
``Until now we could at least write about it. Now we can't even do
that.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Shots were fired at former Prime Minister Akezhan
Kazhegeldin of Kazakstan while he was riding his horse, but he was
not hurt, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Kazhegeldin had just issued a statement announcing he planned to
run for president of the Central Asian country in January. A
scheduled news conference Wednesday was postponed, Interfax said.
	   Two shots were fired at Kazhegeldin on Tuesday night while he
was riding near Almaty, Kazakstan's main city, Interfax said.
	   The Kazak Security Committee and Interior Ministry were
investigating, it said.
	   In his statement, Kazhegeldin said he was running because he
``cannot put up with the people's impoverishment, growing
unemployment and the danger of imminent catastrophe,'' Interfax
said.
	   Kazhegeldin resigned in 1997 for health reasons.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev's spokesman, Kairat Sarybayev,
accused Kazhegeldin of circulating reports about the attack to
boost his popularity rating before the elections, Interfax
reported.

China's top leaders end meeting with agreement to help farms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Leaders of China's ruling Communist Party ended a
three-day Central Committee meeting Wednesday with an agreement to
help the backward agricultural sector, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   The closed-door meeting concluded that China must strengthen its
farm economy and solve problems in water conservation and
environmental degradation, Xinhua said in a brief report.
	   The report only alluded to discussion of other topics, such as a
reassessment of embattled industrial, financial and housing reforms
that have been slowed by pressure from local officials and fears of
discontent.
	   The Central Committee called for developing the rural economy to
increase farmers' incomes, a move seen as crucial for stimulating
domestic demand to boost overall economic growth.
	   Incomes are lagging for the nearly 850 million Chinese who
depend on farming. The state grain system is collapsing under
billions of dollars of debt as market prices fall below
government-set purchasing prices.
	   Overpopulation and low incomes have pushed millions of Chinese
farmers to compete for dwindling jobs in the cities.
	   China's leaders worry that any rural unrest might undermine
their legitimacy as heirs to the 1949 peasant-based Communist
revolution. None of the current generation of leaders took part in
the revolution, but by focusing the Central Committee meeting on
agriculture they highlighted their links to the party's past and
its rural roots.
	   The Central Committee praised the party's achievements over the
past 20 years of reform and stressed it would stick to economic
policies already in place, Xinhua reported.
	   The Central Committee meeting falls near the 20th anniversary of
the path-breaking party gathering that marked the start of China's
economic reforms.
	   Last month, party Chairman and President Jiang Zemin visited the
much-heralded village in Anhui province that did away with the
collective agriculture of Mao Tse-tung's era and allowed households
to farm their own plots, setting a precedent for the reforms.
	   After the visit, Jiang spoke about the importance of
agricultural reforms. He said the original 15-year household land
contracts were to be reissued for 30 years, a process that has been
under way for four or more years.
	   He also called for more money to be spent on irrigation and
disseminating agricultural technology.

Kurds say Turkey is jamming satellite television programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Some 150 Turkish Kurds gathered outside
the European Parliament on Wednesday to protest against what they
said was Turkish interference in Kurdish satellite television
broadcasts.
	   The protesters stood outside the Parliament building in
Brussels, holding banners saying ``Stop terrorist signals!'' and
``Turkey: Hands off Med-TV.''
	   ``Since Oct. 9 the broadcasting of Med-TV was interrupted by
jamming. Technicians checked and said the disruptive signals were
generated in Turkey, probably from a military base,'' said Diler
Akrei, Med-TV's chief editor.
	   Med-TV is broadcast from Belgium and London to Europe, Africa
and the Middle East, the channel said in a statement.
	   ``We believe this agressive attack against our satellite
television is a violation of the freedom of the press and of
international agreements concerning the rights of the media,'' the
statement said.
	   Jaak Vandemeuleubroucke, a member of the European Parliament,
said the Parliament's commission for public liberties will look
into the allegations against Turkey.
	   ``The problem is to know whether Med-TV is disturbed or not.
There will certainly be a Parliament investigation,'' said
Vandemeulebroucke, a Belgian member of the parliament's Rainbow
Group.
	   Vandemeulebroucke said if the accusations are true, the
Parliament will deliver an official protest to the Turkish
government.

 &UR; Report: HIV test should be regular part of pregnancy care &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Testing for the AIDS virus should become a
routine part of pregnant women's prenatal care, a policy change
that could help more mothers-to-be get treatment that can protect
their babies from infection, a panel of medical experts told
Congress Wednesday.
	   The recommendation by the Institute of Medicine is sure to be
controversial.
	   The idea is for HIV testing to be just another one of the
battery of tests, such as the test for syphilis, that pregnant
women normally get, said the institute, which advises the federal
government.
	   ``The message to women is, this is a disease for which we can do
a great deal right now,'' said Dr. Marie McCormick of Harvard
University, who chaired the study. ``If you find you're positive,
there's a great deal we can do to keep you healthy and, more
importantly, to prevent transmission to your child.''
	   Under the recommendation, doctors would tell women they will
automatically be tested for HIV as part of regular prenatal care
unless they object. Women must be given a chance to refuse, the
report stressed.
	   Taking the drug AZT during pregnancy significantly cuts an
infected woman's chances of spreading the deadly virus to her baby.
The AZT discovery caused births of HIV-infected babies to plummet
43 percent between 1992 and 1996.
	   Current federal guidelines urge doctors to counsel all pregnant
women about HIV, including factors that increase risk of infection,
and ask them to be tested. But many doctors don't counsel their
patients, testifying before the institute that it is a burden.
	   In 1996, 1,600 babies were born with HIV. The government doesn't
have more recent figures, but says at least 432 babies were
diagnosed with full-blown AIDS last year.

For Sri Lankan village girl, it's more than winning gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Susantika Jayasinghe, who calls
herself a simple village girl who used to run barefoot through
rubber plantations, has had to overcome many challenges. The
forthcoming Asian games in Bangkok mean more to her than winning
gold.
	   ``It will be my resurrection. I will be rising again after
painful months,'' said 23-year-old Jayasinghe, who surprised the
world by finishing ahead of Merlene Ottey at the World Track
Championships in Athens last year.
	   Jayasinghe, whose father couldn't afford running shoes, is Sri
Lanka's most controversial athlete. She has gone through two doping
charges, but was cleared early this year.
	   She tested positive for Nandralone-19 when a random sample was
taken. She admitted taking a drug to control her menstrual cycle,
but denied that she ever had Nandralone-19.
	   Jayasinghe says she was set up by frustrated Sri Lankan sports
officials and government ministers after she resisted their amorous
advances. She also accused the sports ministry of trying to destroy
her career.
	   ``I would cry, cry and cry,'' said Jayasinghe on Wednesday,
sitting on a couch and looking at a photo of Lord Buddha in her
3-bedroom apartment in Colombo.
	   ``I visit temples and pray all the time requesting my God to
help me come out of the nightmare,'' she told The Associated Press.
	   ``I missed the Commonwealth Games as I did not have enough time
to prepare, but I am really looking forward to the Bangkok Games.
It will be my turn to prove that Susantika does not need drugs to
win medals,'' she said.
	   Jayasinghe plans to run for 100 and 200 meters events and may
take part in the 400 x 4 meters relay.
	   Ari Kannangara, the president of Sri Lanka's Amateur Athlete
Association, said Jayasinghe will compete in the Bangkok games.
``She will be very much there and we hope she wins at least two
golds,'' he said.
	   Sri Lanka plans to send a 100-strong contingent to the Asian
games.
	   Jayasinghe is the second Sri Lankan athlete to win a medal at a
big international meet in 49 years. Duncan White won a silver in
the 400 meter hurdles at the 1948 Olympics.

Chinese minister gets U.N. award for disaster prevention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Chinese government minister was to receive a
U.N. award Wednesday in recognition of China's efforts in reducing
the impact of this year's devastating floods, the United Nations
said.
	   Doji Cering, the civil defense minister, was awarded the
Sasakawa Disaster Prevention Award for his ``key role'' in setting
up China's disaster information and reduction plans, a U.N.
statement said.
	   Aid agency and U.N. officials have widely applauded China's
response to the flooding that occurred this summer.
	   The floods killed more than 3,000 people, but those experts say
many more would have died but for China's fast response to the
crisis.
	   ``We have won victory in combating the worst floods of the
century in China,'' Doji said at a news conference, adding that the
country is ``sincerely grateful'' for help it received from abroad.
	   He compared the death toll with a loss of some 30,000 lives in
disastrous flooding in 1954.
	   Of those who were killed in this year's floods, ``most of them
died in accidental situations,'' Doji said.
	   ``A good number of people who died lost their lives in the cause
of combating the floods'' or rescuing others, he said. Others had
been killed when they returned home to try to retrieve property, he
added.
	   Also honored Wednesday for his part in Chinese disaster response
is scientist Wang Ang-Sheng, a member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
	   The Sasakawa Award carries a prize of dlrs 50,000.
	   Created in 1986 by Ryoichi Sasakawa, a Japanese industrialist,
it is awarded annually for outstanding achievements in the field of
disaster prevention and preparedness.

Chinese official condemns Taiwan nuclear waste dump plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A visiting Chinese provincial official
spoke out Wednesday against a planned Taiwanese radioactive waste
dump he says could endanger his constituents, an evening newspaper
reported.
	   Zhang Jiakun, deputy governor of China's Fujian province, said
the proposed dump on Taiwanese-controlled Little Wuchiu Island
would threaten parts of Fujian that lie as little as 15 kilometers
(9 miles) away, the China Times Express reported.
	   Fishermen from the Wuchiu island group and Fujian should join
forces to fight against the dump, the paper quoted Zhang as saying.
	   Zhang arrived Tuesday at the head of a small delegation and is
calling on businessmen who have investments in Fujian. He is the
highest ranking local-level Chinese official to visit Taiwan since
1949, when Taiwan's ruling Nationalists fled the Communist takeover
on the mainland.
	   Beginning in 2003, Taiwan's state-owned power company plans to
store up to 1 million barrels of low-level radioactive waste at the
dump on the military and fishing outpost of Little Wuchiu.
	   But it faces stern opposition from the island group's 300
residents, and newspapers say local fishermen are discussing an
alliance with their Chinese neighbors to block the dump's
construction.
	   Taiwan Power Co. is carrying out environmental impact
assessments on the tiny island, and has promised 150 million Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.4 million) in compensation and subsidies to
island residents.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan parliament has postponed its
scheduled debate on whether to revoke the special status granted to
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi as part of the 1994 peace deal, state
radio RNA reported Wednesday.
	   The debate, initially scheduled for Friday, will now take place
on Oct. 20, RNA said.
	   The governing MPLA, which has a majority of seats in the
national assembly, wants Savimbi's special status revoked because
of his failure to comply with the peace deal which ended a
two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA has refused to hand over its central highland strongholds
to government control, and the government says Savimbi is keeping
an army hidden in the bush.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A total of 7,594,000 copies of
South Africa's Constitution have been distributed, Constitutional
Affairs Minister Valli Moosa said on Wednesday.
	   In a written reply to a question in Parliament, he said the
language distribution was 654,000 in Afrikaans, 346,120 in isiZulu,
237 in Sepedi, 125,360 in Setswana, 79,870 in Tshivenda, 479,870 in
isiXhosa, 36,730 in isiNdebele, 64,410 in isiSwati, 91,720 in
Xitsonga, 150,270 in Sesotho, and 5,328,220 in English.
	   The languages are the country's 11 official tongues.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Japan and Ghana have signed a dlrs 90
million loan and aid package to improve development infrastructure
in the West African country.
	   The dlrs 80 million loan component will be used to rehabilitate
sections of a highway linking Accra to Kumasi, a major regional
capital, Ghanaian Foreign Minister James Victor Gbeho announced
Tuesday.
	   The loan is to be paid back over 30 years, with a 10-year grace
period at the beginning.
	   The remaining money, a dlrs 10 million grant, would be used to
rebuild a major medical research unit and to improve irrigation
facilities, the minister said.
	   Japan's ambassador to Ghana Shosuke Ito, signed on behalf of his
country.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Reported cases of polio in Ghana dropped
significantly over the past decade, a senior health ministry
official announced.
	   Dr Samuel O. Sackey, head of the Health Ministry's Disease
Control Unit, credited the advance to aggressive campaigns against
the disease.
	   He said the number of cases had been dropping since 1988, when
114 were reported. There have been 33 cases reported so far this
year.
	   He spoke Tuesday at the inauguration of this year's official
polio immunization campaign.
	   ``We have whipped up the enthusiasm in surveillance with the
inception of National Immunization Days,'' Sackey said.
	   Under the project, two days are set aside each year to vaccinate
children who have missed their regular polio vaccines, and to
administer boosters to those on schedule.
	   The campaign comes under the World Health Organization's
initiative to eradicate polio worldwide by 2000.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - The army and the police have
dismantled four arms caches in central Mozambique, the Mozambique
News Agency, AIM, quoted the army as saying.
	   The caches were dismantled over the weekend by a team of experts
from the Mozambican Defence Force, in cooperation with the riot
police in Gorongosa district.
	   Most of areas of Gorongosa used to be in the hands of RENAMO,
the former rebel movement, during the civil war that ended in 1992.
	   Police called the operation routine, and said that seven other
caches had been dismantled recently.
	   Most of the caches contained quantities of heavy and light
weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles, and rounds of ammunitions
of various calibres and manufacture.
	   --
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ The Supreme Court gave
approval Wednesday for eight political parties and one civic
movement to take part in the country's Nov. 8 general election.
	   The race is expected to be dominated by the two major parties:
the MLSTP/PSD, led by former president Manuel Pinto da Costa, and
the Independent Democratic Alliance, founded by current President
Miguel Trovoada.
	   The six smaller parties and the Youth Movement for Development
have little cash for campaigning and are expected to gather few
votes.
	   Pinto da Costa became de facto president after the island
group's 1975 independence from Portugal and ran the country under a
single-party Marxist system.
	   Trovoada, Pinto da Costa's long-time political rival, was
elected president for a four-year term by an overwhelming margin in
the country's first democratric ballot in 1991.
	   Trovoada was reelected in the 1995 election, in which he again
defeated Pinto da Costa.
	   Campaigning likely will focus on the economy: About 65 percent
of the population live in abject poverty.
	   Recent oil discoveries have boosted hopes that the economy can
be revived.
	   The group of five volcanic islands just north of the equator,
about 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Gabon has a population of
about 100,000.

Malaysian prime minister plans five-day visit to Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad will leave Thursday for a five-day visit to Japan, where he
will address a number of seminars, a news report said.
	   Mahathir is expected to attend receptions given by Emperor
Akihito and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, the national news
agency Bernama reported Wednesday.
	   He is also scheduled to meet with bankers, businessmen and
editors from several major Japanese newspapers.
	   However, no official talks with Japanese government officials
have been scheduled.
	   Malaysia has been actively seeking yen-denominated loans from
Japan to help the country deal with its deepening economic
problems.
	   Of the dlrs 30 billion aid package for Southeast Asia that Tokyo
recently announced, dlrs 2 billion has been allotted for Malaysia,
embassy officials in Kuala Lumpur have said.
	   This will be Mahathir's first official visit outside Malaysia
since a political crisis erupted nearly two months ago after he
sacked his heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, from the posts of deputy
prime minister and finance minister.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Delegates from the former
staunchly pro-apartheid Dutch Reformed Church deliberated Wednesday
whether to desegregate by merging with a non-white sister church.
	   But _ in an echo of the racially divisive past _ a plea written
by the non-white church during the anti-apartheid struggle was
proving to be a stumbling block to a merger. The plea calls for
social justice and racial equality.
	   The mixed-race Uniting Reformed Church says it will only accept
its white counterpart if it approves the plea, called the
Confession of Belhar.
	   Four years after apartheid ended, the church that formed the
religious backbone of white minority rule appeared to be reluctant
to do that.
	   ``My hope and prayer is that it will go through,'' said delegate
Piet Meiring. ``But I doubt it.''
	   Some delegates said they felt they were being forced to sanction
a theologically unacceptable document rooted in outdated
anti-apartheid history.
	   Delegate Piet Strauss said he could in principle accept the
Confession of Belhar, but not as part of church doctrine.
	   Uniting Reformed Church leader James Buys said he suspected
white church members were objecting to accepting conditions for a
merger because of persistent racism, not fine theological points.
	   However, delegate Schalk van Wyk _ expressing a tone of
reconciliation _ urged the gathering to accept the Confession of
Belhar.
	   ``It makes it possible to take up the cross and follow Jesus and
listen to the pain of a lot of people,'' van Wyk said.
	   The delegates were to vote on the issue later Wednesday.

Ukraine's interior minister orders his senior subordinates to sell

cars &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's interior minister has ordered
some of his regional deputies to sell their office cars and use the
money to buy much-needed equipment for criminal investigations, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Yuriy Kravchenko ordered seven of the 25 regional Interior
Ministry heads _ the ones who own foreign cars _ to sell them
within 10 days, the daily Segodnya said.
	   ``I have long promised to take measures against senior officials
who ignore the science of crime detection and explain their
inactivity by a lack of money,'' Kravchenko said at a meeting of
regional ministry officials, according to Segodnya.
	   ``I know that all the officials I mentioned drive foreign-made
cars,'' Kravchenko added.
	   Kravchenko's initiative came in response to a complaint from one
of the participants in the gathering, who said that policemen fail
to uncover many crimes because they do not have enough professional
equipment.
	   Ukraine's government has taken other unorthodox steps recently
to push through reforms and raise budget revenues.
	   In August, tax authorities and police seized thousands of cars
from debtor companies, ordering the enterprises' chief executives
to sell them and surrender the money to the government.

Palestinian Securities Exchange faces possible collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Securities Exchange, once
hailed as a symbol of fledgling Palestinian independence, faces
collapse after only 20 months of operation, the managing director
said Wednesday.
	   Trading has dropped sharply since the start of the year because
investors have lost confidence and because the Palestinian
Authority has failed to pass the necessary regulations, said the
managing director, Safwan Bataineh, a Wall Street veteran and
former economic adviser to Jordanian prime ministers.
	   ``If this continues, the stock market will collapse because
companies are losing money,'' Bataineh told The Associated Press.
	   Bataineh said he submitted his resignation to the board of
directors last week in protest over the failure of the Palestinian
Authority to pass laws that would require companies to make their
financial information public.
	   Bataineh said the lack of movement in the peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians has also scared away business people
afraid to invest in an unstable area.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Finance
Ministry.
	   Bataineh said that daily trading was about dlrs 1 million at the
start of the year, and was now down to about dlrs 140,000.
	   In February 1997, the Palestinian stock market opened to a round
of applause from Palestinians hopeful it would bring enough foreign
investment to give their economy a boost. At that time, Bataineh
said the Palestinian economy could attract as much as dlrs 1
billion a year, if Middle East peacemaking is firmly on track.
	   The stock market held symbolic significance for Palestinians who
viewed it not only as a way to help their economy, but as another
signpost on the way to statehood.

Thailand commemorates 25th anniversary of pro-democracy uprising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thousands of Thais from all walks of
life gathered Wednesday at a Bangkok intersection to commemorate
the 25th anniversary of a student-led uprising that toppled a
military dictatorship.
	   A monument to 76 people killed during the revolt was inaugurated
at the spot, where some of the bloodiest confrontations occurred.
	   The 1973 popular uprising, sparked by discontent over repression
and corruption, ended more than two decades of dictatorial rule.
	   It succeeded when the commander of the army refused to send more
troops to put down the protests, and co-dictators Thanom
Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien flew into exile.
	   Relatives of those killed in 1973 carried pictures of the
victims to the memorial spot Wednesday as part of a religious
ceremony led by 25 Buddhist monks. About 600 students also marched
from Thammasat University, a traditional bastion of Thailand's
pro-democracy movement.
	   It was at Thammasat University in 1976 that protests against a
new rising tide of repression were bloodily suppressed in a
counterrevolution that restored limited military rule.
	   Political scars from the period remain to this day, even though
democracy has become more or less entrenched. Efforts to build a
memorial to the victims of 1973 were quashed time and time again by
conservative forces.
	   Last year, public and press criticism forced then-Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to rescind an order granting a military
pension to one of the figures who took part in trying to put down
the 1973 protests.
	   Chavalit had agreed to award a pension of 3,700 baht (then worth
dlrs 148) a month to former Col. Narong Kittikachorn. Narong had
been popularly dubbed one of the ``Three Tyrants,'' along with his
father, Field Marshal Thanom, and his father-in-law, Field Marshal
Praphas.
	   Narong was dismissed from the army after evidence emerged that
he sprayed a crowd of unarmed demonstrators with machine-gun fire
from a helicopter during the pro-democracy uprising. He was also
believed to have given the order for troops to fire on the crowds.
	   Chavalit said he was trying to heal old wounds in granting
Narong a pension and pointed out that the former colonel had never
been prosecuted for any crimes.
	   The student-led rebellion was the first popular uprising to
succeed against a dictatorial regime in Southeast Asia.
	   ``It changed the face of Thai politics from successive
dictatorial regimes into a democratic era,'' said Thirayuth
Boonmee, a sociology professor who as a student leader was one of
the key figures in the 1973 events. ``It also changed our social
structure from a people with submissiveness to power.''

Turkey launches reforestation project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel sowed acorns on
the grounds of the presidential palace Wednesday, launching an
ambitious project to combat deforestation and land erosion.
	   The seeds were the first of some 10 billion oak trees Turkey
hopes to plant in the next five years in its largest-ever
reforestation campaign. ``We are in pursuit of a green Turkey,''
Demirel said, appealing for donations.
	   Turkey loses an estimated 500 million tons of soil to erosion
every year, according to TEMA, a foundation to fight erosion. Its
forests, meanwhile, are being lost agriculture and construction.

Howard celebrated as hero; outlines agenda for second term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
received a standing ovation and three cheers from members of his
government when they met Wednesday for the first time since his
Oct. 3 election victory.
	   With vote counting continuing in a handful of electorates,
Howard's conservative coalition is sure of winning, but is expected
to have its majority of seats in Parliament cut from 44 before the
election to about a dozen.
	   Howard narrowly beat the main opposition Labor Party with a
campaign championing his government's economic performance and a
plan to reform the taxation system, including the introduction of a
new tax on all goods and services.
	   At the first meeting of all the parliamentary members of his
Liberal party, Howard said the victory had ``exploded the myth that
you can't take a bold reform agenda to the Australian public and
win.''
	   Later, at his first official news conference since the election,
Howard said reconciliation between white Australians and Aborigines
was a priority for his government's second term.
	   In his first term, Howard drew Aborigines' ire by passing laws
to restrict their ability to claim native title rights to land, and
for refusing to apologize on behalf of the nation for now-defunct
laws that allowed authorities to take Aboriginal children away from
their families on the basis of race.
	   Howard said Wednesday reconciliation was a two-way street. It
involved recognition of the place of indigenous people in
Australia's history and past unjust treatment of them.
	   ``But equally it carries with it an obligation on their part to
see themselves as part and parcel of a harmonious Australian
community,'' Howard said.
	   Howard also conceded that the right-wing populist party One
Nation had hurt the government at the election, drawing most of its
1.2 million votes from Howard's conservative coalition.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who is critical of Asian
immigration and advocates economic protectionism, lost her seat in
Parliament at the poll, despite the party attracting about 9
percent of the nation's 12 million votes.
	   ``There is still work to be done to get One Nation voters back
to the coalition,'' Howard said.

Indonesia convening debt talks with creditors and local companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Crisis-ridden Indonesia plans to
convene a meeting of about 300 foreign and domestic creditors next
month to discuss the rescheduling of debts burdening local
companies, senior economic minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said
Wednesday.
	   Ginandjar expects the Nov. 1-2 meeting in Jakarta to deliver
significant results.
	   He said he expected some debt reductions would be granted by
creditors ``so they don't have to resort to bankruptcy
proceedings.''
	   Indonesia enacted ambitious bankruptcy laws in August as an
alternative to settling corporate debt issues. More than 10
bankruptcy cases have been filed but only one company has been
declared bankrupt.
	   Ginandjar, however, said the government has always suggested
creditors and debtors avoid bankruptcy proceedings as a way of
settling debt problems.
	   Last month, the government laid down non-binding guidelines to
settle corporate domestic and offshore debt problems under the
so-called ``Jakarta Initiatives.''
	   The guidelines complement the agreements reached in June in
Frankfurt with international creditors, which allow Indonesian
companies to roll over their offshore debts by as long as eight
years.
	   In a meeting last week in Washington, however, the Jakarta
Initiatives failed to impress international creditors.

EU imposes dlrs 60.2 million fine on four British sugar companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Wednesday it
fined four British sugar companies a total 50.2 million European
currency units (dlrs 60.2 million) for violating EU rules on prixe
fixing.
	   The EU's executive Commission said it fined British Sugar 39.6
million ecu (dlrs 47.5 million) and Tate &AMP; Lyle 7 million ecu (dlrs
8.4 million).
	   Sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett were also found
guilty of violating EU price fixing rules and respectively fined
1.8 million ecu (dlrs 2.2 million), the Commission said in a
statement.
	   The four companies were fined because of their ``collaborative
strategy of higher pricing'' on the sugar market in Britain, the
statement said.
	   The infringements took place between 1986 and 1990. At the time,
the four companies represented about 90 percent of the entire white
granulated sugar market in Britain.
	   The EU's anti-trust authorities said they found evidence of
``numerous'' meetings between the four parties during the 1986-1990
period.
	   ``In an initial meeting between British Sugar and Tate &AMP; Lyle on
20 June 1986, the principles of the future anti-competitive conduct
were set. The merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett joined this
conduct before the end of 1986,'' the Commission said.

Schroeder schedules first trip abroad as chancellor, to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will
make his first foreign visit as head of the new German government
to Britain on Nov. 2, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Schroeder modeled his campaign on British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's, and his victory last month fueled a resurgence of Europe's
left already in power in France and Britain. He is to be sworn in
as chancellor on Oct. 27.
	   During the one-day visit, Schroeder will meet with Blair and
attend an annual meeting of the Confederation of British Industry,
an industrial organization representing 250,000 public and private
sector companies.
	   Schroeder, who has emphasized continuity in Germany's foreign
policy, made his first trip abroad just days after the election
victory _ a traditional journey to neighboring France to emphasize
the special relationship between the postwar allies. He also has
traveled to the United States, discussing the Kosovo crisis with
President Bill Clinton.

Top Thai health official transferred because of scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
ordered the transfer of the Health Ministry's highest ranking civil
servant to an inactive post pending investigation into an alleged
corruption scandal, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Public Health Permanent Secretary Prakrom Wuthipong was shifted
Monday to an inactive post in the prime minister's office, said the
official, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   The scandal came to light last month when an association of
rural doctors charged that officials at the ministry were forcing
state hospitals to buy supplies at inflated prices from designated
private suppliers.
	   Prakrom was quoted in the newspaper The Nation Wednesday as
saying the move was unfair because there was no evidence linking
him to any wrongdoing.
	   Two senior political appointees in the ministry _ the minister
and one of his deputies _ resigned earlier.
	   At a meeting of some 500 doctors and medical officials last
week, a senior official of the ministry's Communicable Disease
Control department and other doctors called for Prakrom's
resignation.
	   Some anti-corruption activists at the meeting charged that the
procurement scandal was continuing.

Yeltsin, suffering from cold, returns to work at the Kremlin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin returning home, more quotes, spokesman
says he still has temperature. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
work in the Kremlin for several hours on Wednesday, defying
doctors' orders to stay home and recover from a respiratory
infection.
	   Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, and planned other working meetings throughout the
day, Russian news agencies said.
	   ``The president feels well,'' Primakov said after the meeting,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. He is ``absolutely fit to
work,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Primakov said Yeltsin waved his hand ``when we reminded him that
he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said of his doctors:
``Don't listen to them.''
	   The start of the meeting was later shown on Russian television.
Yeltsin looked a little pale and tired, and walked stiffly, but he
was smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his ministers.
	   ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making a fuss about it,
he told Primakov.
	   Yeltsin returned home to his country residence outside Moscow
about 2:30 p.m., the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Tuesday that
doctors had ordered the president to stay in bed and that he would
not be in the office all week. He said Wednesday that Yeltsin was
still running a temperature.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from a visit to
Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from
an upper respiratory infection.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including heart
bypass surgery two years ago. He insists he has no major illnesses
and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term, but
whenever Yeltsin gets sick, there is speculation about his ability
to govern.
	   Primakov reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin has no plans to
resign or call early elections.
	   ``There is no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's
resignation,'' he said, according to Interfax. ``What happens to
the anti-crisis steps if the elections are held now?''
	   Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to
Central Asia. He canceled most of his public engagements in
Uzbekistan, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling
remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.
	   Shortly after arriving in neighboring Kazakstan on Monday,
doctors ordered him to return home a day earlier than planned.

German talks on easing citizenship for foreigners open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Talks start at 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats said Wednesday
they expect their new government to ease the nation's 85-year-old
citizenship law to promote the integration of foreigners.
	   Supporters see the changes as a way to make Germany a society
more tolerant of its 7 million foreigners, including 2 million
Turks. Most Turkish children born here have grown up virtually as
Germans, but they still feel excluded by the citizenship law.
	   Both the Social Democrats and their future governing partner,
the Greens, are calling for quicker naturalization and a birthright
to citizenship for German-born children of foreigners.
	   Differences on the details were being discussed in coalition
negotiations Wednesday, part of talks on setting government policy
before the new administration takes office at the end of the month.
	   ``I think we will agree on a sensible solution,'' said Otto
Schily, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's designated interior
minister.
	   At issue is modernizing a 1913 law that bases citizenship on
German blood ties, not place of birth. For example, ethnic Germans
from the former Soviet Union, whose forebearers left the homeland
generations ago, have an immediate right to a passport, while Turks
living in Germany must wait at least until age 15 to become
eligible. Current law requires Turks to give up their Turkish
passport.
	   The Social Democrats want to offer German-born foreign children
a birthright to citizenship if one of their parents was born in
Germany. The Greens want to go even further, naturalizing foreign
children if one of their parents is a permanent resident. They
agree on dual citizenship.
	   Germany began recruiting large numbers of Turkish workers in the
1960s to help fuel its postwar economic boom. In recent years, they
and their children have made headlines mainly as victims of
anti-foreigner violence, including a 1993 firebombing in which five
Turks died.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government, which was
voted out in Sept. 27 elections, refused to liberalize the
citizenship law, mainly because of pressure from its conservative
Bavarian coalition partner, the Christian Social Union.
	   But even some liberal members of Kohl's government had been
calling for changes in the law, which critics see as outdated and
nationalistic.

China leaving stars behind for Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Top Chinese table tennis players Deng Yaping and
Wang Tao will not compete at the Asian Games in Thailand, opening
the door for a new crop of players, an official newspaper said
Wednesday.
	   Of 10 Chinese players nominated for the December games, only
one, former world singles champion Kong Linghui, competed at the
last games in Hiroshima, Japan, the China Sports Daily said.
	   ``The lineup for this Asian Games is made up entirely of young
players,'' the newspaper said.
	   Apart from Kong, the team includes established players such as
Olympic men's singles champion Liu Guoliang, as well as four new
players: Wang Liqin, Yan Sen, Zhang Yong and Zhang Yining, the
newspaper said.
	   Head coach Cai Zhenhua said the lineup was announced to give
players time to prepare. Cai said the team was aiming for four to
five gold medals at Bangkok.
	   China won five table tennis golds at the 1994 games in
Hiroshima, in men's singles, women's doubles, mixed doubles,
women's team and men's team.
	   Wang took the men's crown, while Deng took the silver medal in
the women's singles and doubles. Deng, a three-time world titlist,
is regarded as the most successful woman player of modern times.
	   Cai said their omission from the Asian Games roster did not mean
they would not be used in future competitions, the report added.

Holbrooke fears world will wait too long to get ``verifiers'' on

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
expressed concern Wednesday that governments will move too slowly
in sending an international team to Kosovo to make sure Yugoslavia
complies with the deal to end the crisis there.
	   Envoys of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation meet Thursday at their Vienna headquarters to approve
the 2,000-member ``ground verification mission,'' part of the deal
Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The Yugoslav government is supposed to guarantee the safety of
the team members, who will not carry weapons. Their presence is
expected to convince thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees that it
is safe to return home.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network in New York, Holbrooke
said he was not worried about the safety of the team.
	   ``I'm worried that the international community will be too slow
in getting them there, that it will take them six months'' to
deploy, Holbrooke added.
	   He called on major governments to contact the OSCE as soon as
possible and offer personnel.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' _ both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground _
was a key concession in his talks with Holbrooke to defuse the
Kosovo crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   But the Vienna-based organization lacks a large permanent staff.
It will have to turn to its 54 member states, including the United
States, Russia, Canada and European Union countries, to provide
people with the proper training and skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said Tuesday. ``Over the coming weeks, we
hope to see the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, activated July 6 under an arrangement
worked out between Milosevic and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission _ Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans _ have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with first-hand reports
on the fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Yugoslav forces
and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees driven from their
homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
began returning to Kosovo on Wednesday from Macedonia, where they
were evacuated last week because of fears of reprisals by angry
Serbs if NATO launched air attacks.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians in Syria
demonstrated against Turkey on Wednesday, with a militant leader
threatening to the dig the graves of Turkish generals.
	   Leaders of eight radical Palestinian groups led a protest march
through the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, eight kilometers
(five miles) south of Damascus.
	   ``Syria will not be alone if war breaks out with Turkey, as the
Arab and Islamic nation will dig graves for the Turkish generals,''
said Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine _ General Command.
	   Turkish-Syrian relations deteriorated sharply in the past two
weeks after Ankara threatened military action over the alleged
presence of Turkish Kurd insurgent camps in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley,
where Syria stations troops.
	   Turkey demanded that Syria close the camps.
	   Syria denied the accusations, but Turkish Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin told reporters Tuesday that Syria appeared to have shut down
Kurdish camps in territory under its control. The announcement
indicated an easing of tension.
	   On Wednesday, demonstrators shouted anti-Turkish slogans and
accused Israel of instigating the crisis. Protesters burned an
Israeli flag and carried a banner reading, ``The Palestinian people
stand side-by-side with Syria to confront the Turkish-Zionist
alliance.''
	   Turkey and Israel announced last month they would hold naval
maneuvers later this year.
	   Also Wednesday, the European Union's special envoy to the Middle
East, Miguel Moratinos, held talks on the dispute with Turkey with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Damascus.
	   The eight Palestinian groups based in Damascus oppose the
agreements reached between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israel.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid
convoys Wednesday to ethnic Albanian refugees, many of whom are
still afraid to return home despite President Slobodan Milosevic's
agreement to end the Kosovo crackdown.
	   Also Wednesday, the advance party of what is expected to be a
2,000-member ``ground verification mission'' arrived in Kosovo from
neighboring Macedonia to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Britain's foreign secretary warned the Yugoslav leader again
that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs down on the
agreement, reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, to withdraw
forces from Kosovo, begin peace talks with separatist ethnic
Albanians and allow some 2,000 monitors into the troubled Serb
province to verify compliance.
	   Those steps are designed to end the seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian separatists, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left some 300,000 refugees homeless. NATO gave
Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply or face airstrikes.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday before Milosevic
bowed to international demands. U.N. officials said many refugees
were still hiding in the hills and forests, fearing Serb reprisals
if they go home.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' a U.N.
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   In order to build such confidence, the Holbrooke agreement
provides for about 2,000 international monitors to be stationed in
Kosovo. But the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the ``verification mission,'' has no pool
of monitors and must ask its 54 member governments to provide them.
	   OSCE officials say it could take weeks before the full
complement is in the province. OSCE expects to receive offers of
personnel by next week.
	   ``I'm not worried about their safety now,'' Holbrooke said in an
interview Wednesday with CNN. ``I'm worried that the international
community will be too slow in getting them there, that it will take
six months'' before the force is fully assembled, he said.
	   In the meantime, American, Canadian and European members of the
50-member Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission returned Wednesday to
form the advance party of the ground monitor force. Russian members
of the team are expected shortly, a diplomatic source said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The diplomatic observers had been working in Kosovo since July
but were evacuated last week for fear of Serb reprisals if NATO
attacked.
	   In the hills about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Kosovo,
some refugees said Wednesday that they don't trust Milosevic and
have no confidence in the ability of unarmed monitors to guarantee
their safety.
	   ``He is lying that they are withdrawing their forces,'' said a
56-year-old refugee, who gave his name only as Hasan. ``They are
here. There are tanks dug in the ground.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that NATO would be
watching closely for evidence of compliance and that Milosevic
should take alliance warnings seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``The united
consensus within NATO that we were ready to take military action
was there at the beginning of the week, is still there and that
decision is still on the table. We can reactivate these plans any
time we feel it is necessary to do so.''
	   Holbrooke echoed that. He said it's time now to focus on
compliance and not threats, ``but the bombers are ready, and if
necessary we'll return to that emergency phase, which is not quite
over.''
	   In a step toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan
for a separate parliament in Kosovo. The plan, announced late
Tuesday, calls for local elections in the separatist province for
1999. According to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have their
own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them. It
also offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except suspected
war criminals.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose independence for Kosovo fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, said
Holbrooke's agreement had calmed the situation but that the Kosovo
Albanian community remains under pressure.
	   ``I appeal to all, the United Nations, the European Union and
NATO to reach a consensus, to come together for action in Kosovo
and to protect the Kosovo people,'' Rugova told Germany's ARD
television Wednesday. ``We are under Serb domination.''

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan held their highest-level
meeting in five years Wednesday amid mixed signals that the
estranged rivals from the Chinese civil war were ready to resume
formal negotiations.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, was given a warm greeting
by his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, as they began what was
billed as an informal get-together at the city's historic Peace
Hotel.
	   Wang and Koo walked into the hotel's ballroom together, stood
side by side and shook hands before the camera. They exchanged
pleasantries that were inaudible due to the din of some 200 Taiwan
reporters observing the encounter.
	   Soon after arriving in Shanghai aboard a commercial flight, Koo
said he looked forward to his meeting with Wang as an opportunity
``build mutual trust.''
	   ``It is better to start talking sooner rather than later,'' he
said.
	   After the meeting, aides to both Wang and Koo said the talks had
proceeded in a ``peaceful atmosphere'' conducive to exchanging
views. While emphasizing the importance of the meeting, their
comments still evinced the divisiveness that has kept the two sides
far apart.
	   Koo's spokesman, Shi Hwei-yow, suggested that mainland China
should learn from Taiwan's experience with democratic and economic
progress. Wang's assistant, Tang Shubei, obliquely criticized
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui for suggesting China was divided
under two governments.
	   Going into the talks, Koo said he had set no preconditions.
	   The get-together billing _ something less than formal talks _
illustrates the distrust that has frustrated efforts to restart
negotiations Beijing broke off three years ago. Angered by Taiwan's
perceived drift away from eventual reunification, Beijing then
launched missiles and war games near the island, raising tensions
to their worst level since the height of the Cold War.
	   Wang, an 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, and Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and
senior figure in Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, head
government-backed organizations that handle mainland-island ties in
the absence of formal relations.
	   The elder statesmen held their first and last meeting in
Singapore in 1993, ushering in a brief period of cooperation.
Expectations were high that their second encounter would improve
the atmosphere, if not formally re-establish routine negotiations
between their offices.
	   After two days in Shanghai sightseeing, talking with Wang and
attending an opera with him, Koo will travel to Beijing to meet
President Jiang and top officials handling Taiwan affairs.
	   Beijing and Taipei have restated old negotiating positions.
China wants revived talks to focus on political issues leading to
reunification and has renewed a 3 1/2-year-old proposal that would
allow the island to keep its capitalist system and military as long
as it submits to Beijing's rule.
	   Taiwan has rejected that autonomy formula and said reunification
should wait until China is more democratic and prosperous. It also
has urged Beijing to recognize that the two sides are ruled
separately.
	   Ever since Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists off the mainland in 1949, China has viewed Taiwan as a
renegade province to be retaken by force if necessary.
	   Meanwhile, Taiwan wants talks to focus on practical issues, like
fishing disputes, to build confidence.
	   For the sake of the current talks, the two sides appeared to
have found ways around the dilemma. Koo indicated that Taiwan
expected political issues to arise during such talks. Tang, Wang's
spokesman, said that a ``political dialogue'' would include all
issues, including reunification, and virtually declared victory
after Wednesday's meeting.
	   ``We say political dialogue. Taiwan says constructive dialogue.
But the common point is everyone agrees to a dialogue,'' said Tang.
	   ``I can tell you this type of political dialogue has already
started.''
	   Economic and political pressures are edging both sides toward a
short-term accommodation.
	   Trade last year totaled dlrs 26.4 billion, and Taiwanese
businesses have invested dlrs 38 billion in the mainland over the
past decade. Airlines and shippers are establishing routes that
only thinly respect Taiwan's ban on direct contacts with China.
	   Better ties with China could help the Nationalists win business
community support in December's general elections.
	   China's President Jiang is believed to be under pressure from
the military and Communist Party hard-liners to get Taiwan to agree
to reunification.

Kyrgyz president allows limited land ownership

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyzstan will hold a referendum Saturday on
allowing private land ownership in the Central Asian nation, but no
sales of agricultural land will be allowed for five years, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   President Askar Akayev has also decreed that Kyrgyzstan's rural
residents, who use small land plots, will receive the land as their
property, the Interfax news agency reported. However, the plots _
or any other arable land _ cannot be sold to others for five years,
Akayev decreed.
	   The decree also bars non-Kyrgyz citizens and companies with
foreign participation from owning land in this former Soviet
republic.
	   The referendum Saturday is expected to result in constitutional
amendments to allow land ownership.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried to
assure Italian auto giant Fiat on Wednesday that Russia's economy
will remain open to foreign investment, a news agency reported.
	   ``You must know that Russia wants to be an open economy,''
Primakov told Fiat representatives, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``We will not shut ourselves off from the world. We want
cooperation with foreign partners.''
	   Fiat is involved in a joint venture with Russia's Gaz automaker,
and has said it does not intend to back down from the deal in spite
of a crippling financial crisis in Russia that has sent many
foreign investors into panic.
	   Fiat is ``important for the Russian as well as the Italian
economy,'' Primakov said. ``We are proceeding to a new stage of
relations and industrial cooperation.''

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ More than 73 people were killed when an
overloaded ferry sank in a river in the northern state of Kaduna, a
state-owned newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The boat capsized after being blown about by a storm on the
Katarma River near the village of Chikun, the Daily Times newspaper
said. It did not say when the incident occurred.
	   Local government officials said the death toll was believed to
be higher than 73, as some people who had initially survived the
incident had died later at an area hospital.
	   River ferries, often old, in complete disrepair and overcrowded,
ply the inland waters of Nigeria. Accidents are common. Last week,
57 people drowned when a ferry capsized on the northern Kaduna
River.

Impotency pill goes on sale in Italy, but few seem to want it
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The much-awaited potency pill Viagra has finally hit
the shelves in Italy _ but no one's rushing to snatch it up.
	   Pharmacies across Italy reported Wednesday that few, if any,
customers had purchased the blue pills on its first day of sales.
	   ``I think it's like everything else,'' said Giuliana Bedini,
owner of a Rome pharmacy. ``When it is illegal everyone wants it,
but once it is legal people become indifferent.''
	   A rush was predicted, in part because thousands of Italian men
had flocked to pharmacies in the tiny republic of San Marino, about
250 miles (400 kms) northeast of Rome, where the drug has been on
sale for months.
	   But Bedini said not a single customer had bought the drug from
her, although hundreds had called to ask if it was in stock. Some
pharmacists said potential customers may be embarassed, while
others may not have prescriptions yet.
	   Unlike its Italian counterparts, Vatican City's well-stocked
pharmacy will not sell Viagra. A Vatican spokeswoman suggested
there would be little demand from its clients.
	   The European Union gave the green light for Viagra on Sept. 15.

WWII German airman finally buried, more than five decades late
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ A German airman was buried
Wednesday, 56 years after his bomber crashed during a World War II
raid on Britain.
	   About 200 people, including representatives of 20 veterans'
groups, paid their respects at the morning service for Heinrich
Richter at Thornaby cemetery near Middlesbrough, 225 miles (360 km)
north of London.
	   Richter's Luftwaffe Dornier plunged to the ground and blew up in
January 1942 during an attack on an ironworks near Middlesbrough.
	   The bodies of tree of the four men in the plane were recovered
immediately and buried at Thornaby. Then, last year, a number of
human bones eventually identified as Richter's were found alongside
aircraft wreckage by workers laying drains.
	   Richter, 30, had been mistakenly identified as one of the three
men buried in the cemetery, and his name was inscribed on the
original headstone. The headstones now will be altered to include
the name of Hans Maneke, originally thought to be the missing man.
The others were Joachim Lennis and Rudolph Matern.
	   Pastor Walther Bindemann, the region's German clergyman,
conducted Wednesday's service in both English and German.
	   ``This is an occasion for reconciliation for our nations,'' he
said. ``There are still wounds to be healed, and people need to be
able to come together. ... If Richter was standing here today, he
would probably apologize for what he and his comrades did to the
British people, but they were only a small part of a larger cog.''
	   Among those paying their respects was British D-Day veteran John
Armstrong, 83, who saw action as a paratrooper with the 6th
Airborne Division.
	   ``He was only doing a job, the same as we were,'' Armstrong
said. ``Why should he not be afforded the same service as anyone
else?''

China's leading Communists agree agriculture needs boost
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, ADDS color from television footage and Xinhua report
on call for party unity, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's farmers need higher incomes and the
backward agricultural sector must be strengthened to keep the
national economy growing, top members of the Communist Party agreed
Wednesday at the end of a closed three-day meeting.
	   The Central Committee, made up of 333 of the most influential
members of the ruling Communist Party, said China must improve
agricultural technology, improve water works to avoid a repeat of
the summer's catastrophic floods, and reverse environmental
degradation, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The evening television news showed Central Committee members
seated at rows of desks facing a red curtain hung with the
Communist Party's hammer and cycle emblem.
	   The report only alluded to discussion of other topics, such as a
reassessment of embattled industrial, financial and housing reforms
that have been slowed by pressure from local officials and fears of
discontent.
	   The Central Committee declared this a crucial time for China's
overall reforms and urged all party members, especially
high-ranking ones, to unite to carry out the policies to promote
economic growth and stimulate domestic demand for China's products.
	   This country of 1.2 billion people, the world's most populous
country, depends heavily on its own huge domestic market for
stimulating overall economic growth. Higher incomes for farmers
would give them more spending power at a time when exports are
threatened by the Asian financial crisis.
	   But incomes are lagging for the 80 percent of the population
that depends on farming. The state grain system is collapsing under
billions of dollars of debt as market prices fall below
government-set purchasing prices.
	   The growth rate has fallen from 8.8 percent last year to 7
percent in the first half of this year. The government is aiming to
meet an 8 percent target for 1998.
	   In addition to calling for a ``stable increase'' in farm income,
the Central Committee also spelled out the need to protect social
stability in the countryside, Xinhua said.
	   China's leaders worry that any rural unrest might undermine
their legitimacy as heirs to the 1949 peasant-based Communist
revolution. None of the current generation of leaders took part in
the revolution, but by focusing the Central Committee meeting on
agriculture they highlighted their links to the party's past and
its rural roots.
	   The Central Committee praised the party's achievements over the
past 20 years of reform and stressed it would stick to economic
policies already in place, Xinhua reported.
	   Last month, party Chairman and President Jiang Zemin visited the
much-heralded village in Anhui province that first broke up the
communes of Mao Tse-tung's era and allowed households to farm their
own plots, a reform that soon spread nationwide.
	   In a recent speech about agriculture, Jiang reassured farmers
the original 15-year household land contracts were to be reissued
for 30 years, a process that has been under way for four or more
years.
	   He also called for more money to be spent on irrigation and
disseminating agricultural technology.

France says maintain pressure; prepares Contact Group meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Wednesday credited military pressure with
forcing the agreement on the Kosovo crisis and said it must be
maintained to ensure Yugoslavia complies.
	   ``The pressure paid off,'' Daniel Vaillant, the parliamentary
affairs minister, said after a weekly Cabinet meeting. But he also
said the allies must remain ``prudent and vigilant.''
	   The blunt comment, on the eve of another Contact Group meeting
on Yugoslavia in Paris, indicated France remained firmly behind the
NATO-led preparations for airstrikes if Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic hedges on the deal.
	   ``Thanks to the work of the Contact Group, thanks to the joint
action of a certain number of countries, including ours,'' he said,
``it seems Mr. Milosevic made commitments, even if they must be
taken with prudence.''
	   The Contact Group, which includes representatives from Europe,
the United States and Russia, were to meet Thursday in Paris.
	   The objective, the French Foreign Ministry said, was ``to
evaluate the results since the last group meeting,'' including the
accord between Milosevic and the group's emissary, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   Milosevic has agreed to pull forces from independence-minded
Kosovo province, begin peace talks with separatist ethnic Albanians
and allow some 2,000 monitors to verify compliance.
	   The group was also to discuss how the accord was being carried
out, and the ``respective roles'' of the United Nations, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and NATO, the
ministry said.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine was to host a news conference
after the meeting.

IMF executive says world economic motor still ticking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chief executive of the International
Monetary Fund said Wednesday there should be a slight improvement
in global economic fortunes next year spearheaded by Europe and the
United States.
	   Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, predicted world growth
of around 2.5 percent in 1999, creeping up from the recently
revised-down figure for this year of 2 percent.
	   Camdessus was in the Spanish capital to attend the fourth
meeting of the so-called Montevideo Circle, an informal gathering
of top ranking politicians and officials who annually hold a
behind-closed-door brainstorming session on Latin American issues.
	   The IMF chief told reporters that Europe and the United States _
``the two motors of the world economy'' _ were still going strong,
despite some slowdown in America and Great Britain.
	   He said Asia should be able to keep its economic head just above
water, avoiding negative growth next year.
	   Camdessus said the immediate task was to ensure that Latin
America weathered the financial storm that began in Thailand 15
months ago before spreading from Asia to precipitate Russia's
recent collapse.
	   ``It is a vital obligation to prevent the Latin domino from
falling,'' Camdessus said, praising Spain's recent offer to help
fund emergency credits to the region under threat from investor
flight.
	   He said he hoped other European countries with business
interests in Latin America _ such as Italy, France and Germany _
would follow the Spanish example.
	   The IMF and the Brazilian government are putting the final
touches to an emergency three-year-package that should be ratified
within weeks, Camdessus said. The package has been estimated to
total dlrs 30 billion.
	   ``Brazil will not collapse,'' he said, adding that Argentina and
Chile were among the keenest to see the IMF reach agreement with
their giant neighbor.
	   Less upbeat about Russia, Camdessus said the Fund was still
working toward a financing package, but that the government still
lacked a program. This, he said, would take time, and appealed to
governments to provide humanitarian aid in the interim.
	   The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling over $100
billion during what Camdessus called ``the most uncertain year
ever.''
	   He said the crisis has underlined the need for prevention, and
the transformation of the Fund's primary role away from that of
``the firefighter who arrives when the fire is already burning.''
	   Greater private sector involvement in the prevention and
resolution of future economic crisis would help, Camdessus said.
``Now, the private sector tends to run away and leave the work to
the governments,'' he said.
	   Camdessus also said he was aware of recent criticism of
excessive IMF secrecy, but he said his own efforts to open up the
Fund have been blocked by governments demanding discretion.
	   Camdessus said that those who viewed the crisis as a critique of
the Fund's promotion of world economic liberalization were
mistaken. The man who has headed the IMF for 12 years said that it
simply demonstrated the need to carry through liberalization
programs properly.

Is Israel's famed old warrior finally ready for peacemaking?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was a moment like so many in Ariel Sharon's
storied military career: He marched straight in and took charge.
	   Sharon _ aging ex-general, master political survivor, revered by
some as a war hero and reviled by others as a war criminal _
formally assumed control of Israel's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday,
a day before his departure for a crucial Mideast summit outside
Washington.
	   For the 70-year-old Sharon, it's a summit in more ways than one.
When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week named him as
foreign minister, it capped a long painful climb back from a decade
and a half of disgrace and political exile.
	   Meeting with top ministry officials _ and, briefly, with
reporters _ the burly, white-haired Sharon turned on a typical mix
of diplomatic formulations, unyielding doctrine and blunt-force
charm.
	   Asked about past encroachments on the powers of his new
ministry, he made a characteristic declaration.
	   ``I'm not the kind of man people give things to,'' he said in
his trademark trumpeting voice. ``I take them.''
	   Probably no other Israeli public figure arouses such conflicting
passions. To his partisans, Sharon is the daring, brilliant
tactician whose battlefield victories helped turn the tide of three
of Israel's wars, the only politician with the force and stature to
lead the rightist camp.
	   To detractors, he is a destroyer. The Israeli left despises him.
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat flatly describes him as a
war criminal.
	   Many Palestinians hold him responsible for Lebanese Christian
militiamen's 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, and
angrily recall his aggressive promotion of Jewish settlement growth
during a stint as housing minister.
	   Sharon returns the ill feeling: he has said publicly he won't
shake Yasser Arafat's hand, even in his post as Israel's principal
negotiator of peace with the Palestinians.
	   Many of Sharon's allies on the right reacted with dismay to his
appointment as foreign minister, considering him an opportunist who
betrayed principles to fulfill his own political ambitions. His
acceptance of the job, they believe, amounts to endorsement of a
land deal with the Palestinians, something they bitterly oppose.
	   Yitzhak Shamir, the hard-line former prime minister, accuses
Sharon of contradicting himself. ``He doesn't promise anything
which can truly change the situation for the better,'' he told
Israel radio.
	   Even Sharon's own boss doesn't much care for him. In the past,
Sharon never shied away from disparaging Netanyahu in public, and
the prime minister repaid him by relegating him to the
second-string post of infrastructure minister _ a big come-down for
a politician who had once hoped to be prime minister himself one
day.
	   Some observers believe Sharon's desire to rise above past
disgrace _ he had not held a leadership post for 15 years, since
being held indirectly responsible for the massacres at the Sabra
and Shatilla camps south of Beirut _ could be the key to his stance
at the summit and in months to come.
	   The word being used over and over again by commentators is
pragmatism. Sharon is viewed by friend and foe alike as hard-headed
and hard-nosed, unlikely to sign onto an accord unless he really
thought it would work on the ground.
	   And his background gives him greater credibility than anyone
else on questions of Israel's security, something on which any
accord will hinge.
	   A government official long acquainted with Sharon, speaking on
condition of anonymity, likened his potential role to that of the
late Moshe Dayan in the Camp David process _ ``the practical
general who understands this is the last chapter of his life, that
there are limits to power and the use of force in solving
disputes.''
	   His desire to become a statesman, the official suggested, could
strongly propel him toward unexpected compromise.
	   ``Sharon is a man of surprises, and not only on the
battlefield,'' commentator Avraham Tirosh wrote in the Maariv
newspaper. ``No one is able to assess what Sharon will really do.''

Mongolian president again rejects candidate for prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Prolonging Mongolia's political
crisis, the president on Wednesday again rejected Davaadorjiin
Ganbold's candidacy for prime minister.
	   President Natsagiin Bagabandi asked Mongolia's acting coalition
government to propose another prime ministerial candidate.
	   The president, a member of the formerly communist Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party, already had rejected Ganbold's
candidacy six times in August. The president turned down the
41-year-old Moscow-educated economist because Ganbold backed the
privatization of a state-owned bank.
	   The bank's privatization triggered the poor Asian nation's
political crisis four months ago, rendering its government
ineffective.
	   Opposition legislators claimed government politicians benefited
financially from the privatization, and boycotted parliament in
protest.
	   The boycott ended only with the July 24 resignation of acting
Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj after losing a no confidence
vote.
	   Since then, Elbegdorj and his ministers have remained in their
posts in an acting capacity, a role that observers say has led to
increased corruption and slowed legislation.
	   Opposition leader N. Enkhbayar accused the government of
deliberately prolonging the crisis.
	   ``They are just playing a game to stay in power longer as acting
ministers,'' he said.
	   Enkhbayar has called for the dissolution of parliament and for
early elections.
	   Apart from Ganbold, President Bagabandi has also rejected two
other nominations submitted by the ruling coalition.
	   A third candidate, Amarjargal, was approved by the president
only to lose a parliamentary election by one vote.

Ukrainian president meets with lawmakers to discuss government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Pustovoitenko in two final grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma asked a
group of non-affiliated lawmakers Wednesday to suggest candidates
for his embattled government.
	   ``The president is expecting proposals and candidacies to make
changes in the government,'' said Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr
Maidannyk.
	   He said Kuchma also was ready to consult with all factions in
the parliament over the composition of his Cabinet. About 25 of its
450 members are not affiliated with any party.
	   Kuchma's meeting with the lawmakers came one day after the
parliament, dominated by his leftist and centrist foes, failed to
muster enough votes to bring down the Cabinet of Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko over its handling of Ukraine's deep economic
crisis.
	   ``The results of the vote show that the government's efforts to
overcome the crisis are bringing certain positive results,'' Kuchma
said Wednesday, according to Maidannyk.
	   Kuchma, who has made such offers before, says he opposes
parliamentary attempts to bring down the entire government, which
he views as being motivated by political reasons rather than by the
Cabinet's alleged incompetence.
	   Maidannyk suggested that those lawmakers who abstained or voted
against the no-confidence motion might eventually form the basis
for a broad parliamentary majority.
	   If consensus is to emerge from the currently divided parliament,
Kuchma would entrust lawmakers with forming a new government,
Maidannyk said.
	   Pustovoitenko also said Wednesday that he has asked five
centrist and two leftist parliamentary factions, which voted
against the no-confidence motion Tuesday, to submit their proposals
for filling ``any posts'' in the government.
	   ``Those who deserve it will by all means get government posts,''
Pustovoitenko said.

Two dozen known hooligans already turned back; 2 arrested

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Twenty known hooligans were already on their
way back to England Wednesday and a dozen more English fans were
sobering up in jail ahead of the Euro 2000 qualifier between
Luxembourg and England late Wednesday.
	   About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high
alert throughout the day, outnumbered by some 2,500 English soccer
fans pouring into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy.
	   The last two visits of England here in 1977 and 1983 were marred
by crowd violence, when hooligans smashed up the Josy Barthel
national stadium then rampaged through the streets, demolishing
cars and storefronts.
	   On Tuesday, two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels
airport in neighboring Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because
their names were on police lists of known hooligans. Six were send
back to England, the rest would be expelled by the end of the day,
said Lt. Eric Froidmont of the Belgian gendarmes.
	   Early Wednesday, police in Luxembourg said they'd arrested about
a dozen drunken fans in the capital and on the border with Belgium.
Police spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd be released
after the game.
	   This year, English hooligans have already left a trail of
destruction wherever their team played during the World Cup in
France. There was violence again in Sweden last month, the last
time England played abroad.
	   In Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 people shoehorned in between
France, Belgium and Germany, police have warned shopkeepers in the
capital of possible violence and many planned to close their shops
early.
	   ``You can see there are fewer people in town, they've afraid to
come downtown,'' said Isilda Moreira, in her smart fashion store.
``We all know this lot are more aggressive than other supporters.
	   Moreira was keeping her store open as usual, but the next-door
greengrocers had the shutters down with and a handwritten sign in
the window ``Closed because of the soccer.''
	   England already lost its first Euro 2000 game in Sweden, and
played poorly in a scoreless draw at Wembley against Bulgaria on
Saturday. A slip-up against the amateurs from Luxembourg would have
a devastating effect.
	   Fears are the English fans could take it out on the town.
	   Police have long prepared for the encounter. Cooperation with
the border authorities in Belgium and France was beefed up and a
half dozen spotters from British police will accompany the fans.
	   After the match, the fans who came by train could have to sit
out the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport will be
available until the morning.

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Twenty known hooligans were already on their

sobering up in jail ahead of the Euro 2000 qualifier between

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 student protesters marched
through downtown Jakarta Wednesday, demanding that President B.J.
Habibie lower skyrocketing food prices or resign.
	   The group walked down the main street after police and troops
blocked them from marching to Parliament.
	   Inflation has pushed up the prices of many basic foods as
Indonesia endures it worst economic crisis in decades.
	   In a separate demonstration, another 30 students scuffled with
security officers outside the Defense Ministry. The demonstrators
were demanding that the armed forces investigate a string of
murders in eastern Java.
	   At least 153 people, many of them Muslim clerics or those
accused of practicing black magic, have been killed by mobs or
gangs in the past three months.
	   Many complain the armed forces haven't done enough to quell the
violence.
	   There were no reports of injuries or arrests following
Wednesday's protests, which caused long traffic jams.
	   Habibie took power from President Suharto in May after the
former leader ended 32 years of autocratic rule and resigned
following a wave of protests and riots.
	   ``Suharto has to be put on trial,'' students chanted Wednesday.
	   Since Suharto's departure, Habibie has promised to institute
democratic reforms and fix the ailing economy.
	   However, many say he is not doing enough to address Indonesia's
dire problems.
	   Student protests against his presidency have become almost a
daily event in Jakarta.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dozens of hungry bears facing a poor mushroom and
berry crop in northern Siberia have migrated south and killed at
least two people and 19 cattle this autumn, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   A 62-year-old man was mauled to death just outside a town in the
Novosibirsk region, and a 68-year-old woman from the same town was
attacked last month, forest officials said Wednesday, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The brown bears have attacked domestic animals, too, killing 19
cattle this season.
	   Police have arranged special hunting squads and are cruising the
area with a helicopter to look for the bears, the report said.

Troubled Philippine bank placed in receivership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine central bank officials
decided Wednesday to place the financially troubled Orient
Commercial Banking Corp. in receivership.
	   Orient Bank, one of the smallest of the country's commercial
banks, shut down in February due to heavy withdrawals triggered by
fears that its majority owner was in difficulty.
	   The Monetary Board, the central bank's policy-making body, said
the government would determine in three months whether the bank
could be rehabilitated.
	   The central bank said Orient Bank had 4.9 billion pesos (dlrs
114 million) in bad loans, mostly granted to members of the bank's
board of directors in violation of banking laws that limit the
amount of loans to directors.
	   Vicente Valdepenas Jr., a monetary board official, said the
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp., a government agency that
insures bank deposits, will act as Orient Bank's receiver.
	   Creditors, including the central bank, couldn't collect from
Orient Bank until it is known whether it can be reopened, said
Valdepenas. If not, the bank's assets would be liquidated to pay
off creditors.
	   The central bank provided emergency loans and overdrafts to
Orient Bank worth 3.36 billion pesos (dlrs 78 million) at the
height of the withdrawals.
	   The central bank said a rehabilitation plan submitted by Orient
Bank's majority owner, Jose Go, would still be considered.
	   Under the plan, a prospective investor, Hong Kong-based Goldland
Investment Co., and its local partners have pledged to initially
infuse 2.7 billion pesos (dlrs 62.8 million) in fresh capital by
Dec. 1 and another 1.8 billion pesos (dlrs 41.8 million) next year
to revive the bank, officials said.
	   Foreigners can own up to 60 percent of an existing bank.
	   Major Philippine banks were expected to weather the regional
financial storm because of their solid capital base and established
clients but a number of smaller banks could collapse due to the
tougher operating environment, analysts said.

	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ A German airman was buried
Wednesday, 56 years after his bomber crashed during a World War II
raid on Britain.
	   About 200 people, including representatives of 20 veterans'
groups, paid their respects at the morning service for Heinrich
Richter at Thornaby cemetery near Middlesbrough, 225 miles (360 km)
north of London.
	   Richter's Luftwaffe Dornier plunged to the ground and blew up in
January 1942 during an attack on an ironworks near Middlesbrough.
	   The bodies of three of the four men in the plane were recovered
immediately and buried at Thornaby. Then, last year, a number of
human bones eventually identified as Richter's were found alongside
aircraft wreckage by workers laying drains.

Central bank to tighten monitoring of Ugandan banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Reeling from the recent collapse of three
commericial banks, the Central Bank of Uganda is instituting
measures meant to more closely monitor the operations of financial
instituions, a bank official said Wednesday.
	   ``Bank of Uganda will impose tighter regulations on banks. The
new measures will be tough on the issue of collecting people's
money and lending it to them,'' said CBU executive director for
supervision Edward Mugwanya.
	   Mugwanya said the central bank will start auditing books of
commercial banks several times every year and will also put an end
to the practice of bank owners extending loans to themselves,
something which contributed to fall of one closed bank.
	   An audit of the International Credit Bank published by the
central bank indicated that 45 percent of the bank's total loan
portfolio of 4 billion shillings (dlrs 4 million) was in so-called
insider loans granted to management.
	   ``No interest was being charged on the insider loans, and they
were non-peerforming. This in itself was a breach of the statute,''
a statement from the central bank said. ``The bank was therefore
not being managed in the interests of its depositors.''
	   Uganda has 21 commercial banks, half of them foreign-owned. Many
have sprouted in recent years following a liberalization program
pushed by donors and international lending institutions.
	   ``The Central Bank of Uganda must ensure the safety of banking
institutions. Efforts must be made to ensure that the banking
sector is sound,'' CBU public relations director Walugembe Musoke
said at a joint news conference with Mugwanya.

U.N. tribunal to resume probe of alleged atrocities in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
investigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe of
alleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal official
said Wednesday.
	   Visas that were denied earlier by Yugoslav authorities have now
been issued, Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt told a press
briefing. He did not give details on how many investigators will
return or when.
	   Blewitt declined to speculate on the reason behind Belgrade's
change of heart, nor could he confirm that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has explicitly agreed to total compliance with
the U.N. court.
	   In a statement, Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United
States, the tribunal's president, welcomed ``in principle'' the
recent agreements aimed at averting military intervention. But
McDonald said she had not yet reviewed them to confirm that they
contained ``explicit provisions and mechanisms'' aimed at ensuring
Belgrade's compliance.
	   However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, speaking on NBC's
``Today'' program, said cooperation with the tribunal was indeed
part of the agreements with Milosevic.
	   ``We had a big argument about the war crimes tribunal,''
Holbrooke said. ``It is embedded in our agreement that he said he
will fully comply with the U.N. resolution and that calls for
(compliance).''
	   Holbrooke said Milosevic had agreed to a doubling of war crimes
tribunal staff in Belgrade and to letting them travel freely in
Kosovo, where the tribunal wants to look into reports of Serb
massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, was at
the United Nations on Wednesday to clarify the scope and impact of
the agreements as they relate to war crimes issues.
	   Blewitt said last week that Belgrade officials had suddenly
begun claiming that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to conduct
investigations in Kosovo.
	   The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993 to prosecute
crimes committed following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia,
has always maintained that it also has jurisdiction in the Kosovo
conflict.
	   Until recently, tribunal staff were allowed to carry out
investigations in the region, examining reports of atrocities by
both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``Our mandate is quite clear. It is not subject to negotiations
neither by President Milosevic nor Mr. Holbrooke,'' Blewitt said
emphatically.
	   McDonald repeatedly has chastised Belgrade for failing to
surrender indicted war suspects at large in Yugoslavia, in
particular the handover of three men accused of orchestrating the
killings of 260 unarmed people after the fall of Vukovar in 1991.
	   ``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to flout the law
and the will of the international community'' by refusing to turn
over indicted suspects, she said in her statement.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, a scholar from India whose
work produced a new understanding of the catastrophes that plague
society's poorest people, won the Nobel Economics Prize on
Wednesday.
	   Sen was awarded the prestigious prize for his contributions to
welfare economics, which help explain the economic mechanisms
underlying famines and poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said.
	   ``You cannot evaluate what's happening in an economy or a
society without looking at people who are on the down side and not
just those who are doing well and prospering,'' Sen said on CNBC
television.
	   Sen ``has restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of
vital economic problems,'' the Nobel citation said.
	   The 64-year-old economist joined Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge this year after teaching at Harvard University, among
other institutions. He has studied the Bangladesh famine of 1974
and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the countries of
the Sahara.
	   The award comes just a month after the image of last year's
winners, Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, was tarnished
by the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund in which they were
partners. Merton and Scholes were honored for their work on valuing
risky ``derivatives'' investments such as stock options.
	   Sen works in development economics, the study of the welfare of
the world's poorest people. His best-known work, detailed in his
1981 book ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and
Deprivation,'' challenges the common view that the shortage of food
is the most important explanation of famine.
	   Sen told the Press Trust of India news agency there were many
economists who had worked on this subject and ``it is a tragedy we
can't all share the award.''
	   Looking at several catastrophes, Sen has shown that ``famines
have occurred even when the supply of food was not significantly
lower than during previous years'' without famines, the citation
said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined. Due to
these factors, the real incomes of agricultural workers declined so
much that they were disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes hard economic analysis and broader questions
about the best ways to determine whether poverty is increasing or
decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective
decision-making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of
sociology at the University of Stockholm. ``He cares about the
poorest in society.''
	   Rakesh Mohan, director-general of India's National Council for
Applied Economic Research, praised Sen as ``an unusual economist
who has combined deep concern for human development with the very
fine work in technical economics.''
	   Sen's award highlights an underappreciated area of study, said
Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James and Associates, an
investment firm in St. Petersburg, Florida.
	   ``Developmental economics has never really gotten a whole lot of
attention in the academic world, and certainly the magnitude of the
problem and type of issues it deals with is obviously very
significant,'' Brown said.
	   The 7.6 million kronor prize was worth about dlrs 963,000 at
Wednesday's exchange rate.
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work.
	   Long-Term Capital Management, the fund in which Merton and
Scholes were partners, needed a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout from banks
after nearly failing. But despite the tarnish on their reputations,
Merton's and Scholes' award-winning theories were not faulty, said
Torsten Persson, a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics.
	   ``They lost money, but this has nothing to do with the prize,''
Persson said.
	   This honor is the only Nobel not established in the will of
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. It was
created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central bank.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The peace prize, the last in this year's series, is to be
announced Friday.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel.

Cop reportedly kills colleague in Ivory Coast, reports say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Police have arrested a police
officer who killed another officer as he lay injured after a
dispute with a taxi driver, news reports said Wednesday.
	   The Tuesday incident in the Yopougon neighborhood of Abidjan
sparked a rampage by the dead man's colleagues, who reportedly
smashed several taxis in revenge.
	   Police Chief Gen. Attoh Nanguy told Le Jour newspaper that the
dead police officer, Yacouba Coulibaly, died after Sgt. Alexis
Gohoun Gnapia shot him in cold blood in front of several witnesses.
	   The incident began when Coulibaly, dressed in civilian clothes,
allegedly tried to rob taxi driver Koumare Kassim _ who admitted
deliberately running him over with his car in defense. Kassim
called out for help as Coulibaly lay on the ground injured. Gnapia,
who was stepping off a nearby bus at the time, went directly to
Coulibaly and shot him four times.
	   Gnapia was immediately arrested and police were also holding the
taxi driver until investigations were complete, Nanguy said.
	   Later Tuesday, police arrested eleven officers charged with
vandalism after they attacked and smashed windshields of nine taxis
in the same neighborhood after hearing news of their colleague's
death.
	   ``They have been apprehended and will answer for their acts,''
Nanguy said.
	   Last month, Abidjan taxi and minibus drivers went on strike to
protest the killing of one of their colleagues, who was shot by a
policeman after he failed to stop at a checkpoint.
	   The strike turned violent after police clashed with striking cab
drivers, who claim at least five of their colleagues have been
killed by police in the last year.
	   The strike was called off after the government apologized for
the driver's death and said the officers had been arrested.
	   The government also promised to investigate police violence and
corruption, both of which are widespread in this West African
country.

Iran frees director of banned liberal newspaper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of release grafs 5-7; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The managing director of a banned newspaper
has been freed after four weeks in detention, the official Iranian
news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Hamid Reza Jalaipur of the liberal newspaper Tous was released
Tuesday night, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an
unidentified source as saying.
	   Jalaipur was arrested along with editor Mahmoud Shams when Tous
was outlawed on Sept. 16. The authorities accused the paper of
publishing articles detrimental to Iran's security.
	   The newspaper began with the name Jameah. It was closed in July
but reappeared shortly afterward under the title Tous.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered
Jalaipur's release, a press officer of the Islamic Revolutionary
Court told the agency.
	   Jalaipur's mother met Khamenei on Tuesday and appealed for her
son's release, the agency reported.
	   The press officer said the court would continue to investigate
charges against Jalaipur, which are presumed to concern an alleged
breach of national security.
	   Hard-liners in Iran's ruling clergy wanted to shut down Tous
because of its passivist stance over Iran's quarrel with the
Taliban government in Afghanistan. The newspaper called for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis provoked by the Taliban's
admission in September that its militiamen had killed eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist. Other newspapers and officials called
for a military strike against the Taliban.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Khamenei.
	   Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six publications in
recent months and detained six journalists for allegedly publishing
lies.
	   The crackdown runs counter to the efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.
	   With Jalaipur's release, three Tous journalists remain in
detention.

Voter registration in November for South Africa's elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's 25 million eligible
voters will have only three days to register for next year's
elections, the Independent Electoral Commission announced on
Wednesday.
	   Voting stations will be open for registration from Nov. 27
through Nov. 29, IEC President Johann Kriegler told reporters.
	   People could register as voters only in the district where they
ordinarily
	   reside and must cast their balots in the same district for the
1999 elections, Kriegler said.
	   A date for South Africa's second all-race elections has not been
set yet, but it is expected to be held around the middle of next
year.
	   President Nelson Mandela, who won the first all-race elections
in 1994 which marked the end of apartheid, plans to retire at the
end of his term. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is widely expected to
succeed him.

 &UR; NATO works on Kosovo air reconnaissance; Says Milosevic violates
peace deal &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance said Wednesday that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not meeting international
demands to restore peace in Kosovo.
	   Two days after it set the clock ticking toward airstrikes, NATO
worked on an air reconnaissance plan for Kosovo to verify if
Milosevic's respects a peace deal.
	   It stressed airstrikes remain on the books. The decision to
begin them, if necessary, on Saturday ``is still totally in effect.
NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted by Milosevic,'' said a
NATO official, who asked not to be named.
	   At a meeting of NATO ambassadors, it was agreed Milosevic must
yet show he is ending his crackdown against Kosovo Albanian
separatists.
	   Compliance with a deal to withdraw forces, begin peace talks
with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into Kosovo ``has
not yet been achieved,'' said the NATO official.
	   The official said Milosevic must withdraw forces, saying a
``number of units'' remain dug in, notably the ``notorious'' 36th
Special Police Unit. The official would not say how many troops are
in Kosovo except they ``far exceed'' the level predating the start
of the violence there in March.
	   On Thursday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe is expected to sign a deal in Belgrade providing for the
dispatch of 2,000 ``compliance verifiers.''
	   And NATO expects to sign a deal with Yugoslavia letting its
planes overfly Kosovo for reconnaissance purposes to back up the
OSCE mission.
	   Officials could not say when a NATO delegation will go to
Belgrade or who will head it.
	   The air reconnaissance plan is for Kosovo only. It is a
detailed, highly technical operational plan to make sure allied
planes have unhindered access to Serbian airspace.
	   Officials at NATO were keen to point out that airstrikes plans
remain active. ``The planes are arriving at their forward bases in
Italy,'' said one official. ``We'll be keeping up the military
pressure for some time to come.''
	   Under an agreement worked between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader must withdraw special troops
from Kosovo, allow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo, let
NATO reconnaissance planes overfly the province and sign a deal by
early November outlining future talks with the Kosovo Albanians.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia in the early hours of Tuesday morning by approving an
``activation order'' that formally placed hundreds of allied
warplanes under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley
K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.

Polish ex-communists win local election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The results in Sunday's national elections
brought modest gains to the opposition ex-communists, who now
control 42 percent of seats in city councils nationwide, according
to unofficial results released Wednesday.
	   The Solidarity bloc, which heads the national ruling coalition,
controls 37 percent of the seats. Solidarity's junior partner, the
centrist Freedom Union, lost support, winning just 10 percent of
the seats locally.
	   The Freedom Union, formed by disenchanted Solidarity leaders,
won 13 percent in the national election in September 1997, and the
local result could hurt leader Leszek Balcerowicz, the deputy
premier and finance minister. He is trying to push through an
ambitious tax reform.
	   The local vote was the first under a new administrative reform
that decreased the number of districts from 49 to 16. The results
show the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance won control of eight
provinces, while Solidarity has seven and the Freedom Union one,
the southern city of Wroclaw.
	   The unofficial results calculated voter turnout at a low 40
percent of the 28.6 million eligible voters.

EU imposes dlrs 60.2 million fine on four British sugar companies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British Sugar saying it will appeal the fine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Wednesday it
fined four British sugar companies a total 50.2 million European
currency units (dlrs 60.2 million) for violating EU rules on prixe
fixing.
	   The EU's executive Commission said it fined British Sugar 39.6
million ecu (dlrs 47.5 million) and Tate &AMP; Lyle 7 million ecu (dlrs
8.4 million).
	   Sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett were also found
guilty of violating EU price fixing rules and respectively fined
1.8 million ecu (dlrs 2.2 million), the Commission said in a
statement.
	   The four companies were fined because of their ``collaborative
strategy of higher pricing'' on the sugar market in Britain, the
statement said.
	   British Sugar said it will fight the EU ruling against it.
	   ``British Sugar will be appealing against this decision,'' the
company said in a statement.
	   The Commission says the infringements took place between 1986
and 1990. At the time, the four companies represented about 90
percent of the entire white granulated sugar market in Britain.
	   The EU's anti-trust authorities said they found evidence of
``numerous'' meetings between the four parties during the 1986-1990
period.
	   ``In an initial meeting between British Sugar and Tate &AMP; Lyle on
20 June 1986, the principles of the future anti-competitive conduct
were set. The merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett joined this
conduct before the end of 1986,'' the Commission said.

Thailand begins drug tests for upcoming Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Sports Authority of Thailand began
drug tests on local athletes Wednesday ahead of the 13th Asian
Games in Bangkok in December.
	   ``The team will test 50 athletes from 10 sports that are known
to lure athletes to use dope,'' Dr. Chaturaporn na Nakorn, head of
the Sports Science Center of Thailand, said Wednesday.
	   The testing is intended as a preventive measure to keep some 800
Thai athletes away from doping, said Chaturaporn. It will also
serve as a test run for procedures to be used during the games.
	   The Sports Authority of Thailand specifically requested that
1994 Olympic boxing gold medalist Somluck Khamsingh be tested, said
Chaturaporn.
	   No suspicions have been raised about Somluck. But ensuring that
he is drug-free now would avoid any possible embarrassment at the
games.
	   The inspection team will drop by training centers without
notifying athletes ahead of time, he added.
	   Test results will be submitted to the Olympic Committee of
Thailand, the body that makes the final decision on which athletes
will represent the country.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The painful economic and political changes that
have swept through Asian nations may benefit the region by leading
it into an era of renewed development and stability, officials said
Wednesday.
	   More than a year into Asia's most challenging economic turmoil
in decades, economists and government officials at a regional
economic conference said the crisis is probably far from over.
	   In presentations at the East Asia Economic Summit, they said the
Asian crisis has become a global emergency that threatens to send
more countries into recession.
	   ``We can no longer think of an Asian or emerging-market crisis,
but a global one,'' said Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Ian
Macfarlane.
	   Many also agreed on the need for a new global financial system
that would reduce the instability of current capital markets.
	   But already, political changes triggered by the crisis are
encouraging the creation of more efficient, democratic governments
that could be a ``bridge to another East Asian miracle,''
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.
	   ``When life was good, nobody was really questioning the
limitations on individual liberties, because these ... shortfalls
were offset by material benefits,'' he said.
	   Because of the economic downturn, there is now ``a growing
demand for popular participation in governance,'' he said. ``We've
seen this in a dramatic way in Indonesia.''
	   Demonstrations in Indonesia in May toppled Asia's longest-ruling
leader at the time, President Suharto, and set in motion reforms of
the country's economy.
	   Stanley Roth, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs, said political changes prompted by the crisis
have been ``stabilizing, not destabilizing.''
	   A new government in Thailand is ``the most efficient, the most
competent, the most influential, and the most effective high
government (there) in many, many years,'' he said.
	   As a result of the turmoil, South Korea also has adopted new
leadership that supports progressive economic and foreign policies,
Roth said.
	   Although Indonesia is still in the throes of social, economic
and political change, ``even there, I think we have the possibility
of a political transition ultimately resulting in greater stability
and hopefully better governance,'' he said.
	   Asia's economic woes have affected every aspect of the region's
societies, but politics is changing most dramatically, other
officials said.
	   By the beginning of the next century, issues never discussed
openly before, such as human rights, democracy and accountability
of governments, will be part of the political agenda, said
Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Thailand's deputy foreign minister.
	   The changes have not been limited to domestic affairs, Siazon
said.
	   He described recent public criticisms by Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie and Philippine President Joseph Estrada of the arrest
of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as a
watershed event for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
which has long espoused a policy of non-interference in the
domestic affairs of member countries.
	   ``This has never happened before in ASEAN,'' said Siazon, who
called it a ``positive sign'' promising greater, not lesser,
integration within the group.

US official: Kosovo agreement ``first step'' towards solution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More work is needed to consolidate the
solution found between NATO and Yugoslav authorities to avert
airstrikes over Kosovo, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia said
Wednesday.
	   ``To be sure, we have an agreement. But I want to emphasize that
this is a first step,'' said Christopher Hill after meeting with
Greek foreign minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   ``We have not yet arrived at a sustained peaceful solution in
Kosovo. We are very much committed to finding that solution,'' he
added.
	   Hill, who was in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on Tuesday as
part of the U.S. contact group on the Kosovo crisis, said a
``political framework between the Albanian side and the Serb side''
will be sought to ensure the agreement works.
	   Yugoslav authorities' acceptance of the presence of a
2,000-member ``ground verification mission'' will enable Western
observers to monitor adherence to the agreement, Hill noted.
	   ``It is absolutely essential that the Serbs comply with the
agreement they've reached with us and we'll be watching very
carefully to make sure that's the case,'' he said.
	   An agreement reached by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke with
Yugoslav authorities aims at ending the seven-month Serb crackdown
against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, an operation that
has killed hundreds and left up to 300,000 refugees homeless.
	   ``Unfortunately it seems that with the problems of the former
Yugoslavia, one must always reach the ultimate limit'' before a
solution can be found, Pangalos said.
	   NATO had to mobilize forces ready for airstrikes against
Yugoslavia before it agreed to international requests.
	   Ethnic Albanians also appear satisfied with this first step
towards a solution, Hill noted.
	   ``I think Albanians in Kosovo, like people anywhere, want peace,
and I think they see this agreement as the best opportunity for
peace,'' he said.
	   ``We hope all of this will create a momentum for peace,'' Hill
said, adding that he looks forward ``to the day when we can have a
Balkans that is completely at peace.''

Bookmaker accuses Akram, Malik in match fixing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to some lines. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A bookmaker told a judicial inquiry
Wednesday that top Pakistani cricketers including two former
captains _ Wasim Akram and Saleem Malik _ accepted bribes to throw
the matches.
	   ``I know these cricketers personally. . . They have links with
match fixers and take money to throw matches,'' bookmaker Raja
Aftab told a judicial inquiry.
	   Besides Akram and Malik, he also named batsman Ijaz Ahmed for
accepting bribes in his testimony before Justice Malik Qayuum.
	   A judicial inquiry is being held into accusations of bribery and
match fixing against several top players, identified by some of
their teammates and Australian cricketers.
	   Another bookmaker, Raja Zafar Iqbal, said in his testimony that
he knows at least three other bookies who had links with Akram.
	   The accused Pakistani players have denied the charge.
	   Earlier this month, Australian captain Mark Taylor and Mark
Waugh appeared before the tribunal to offer their testimony.
	   Waugh told the court he was offered thousands of dollars in 1994
by Malik, which he turned down.
	   But Pakistan fast bowler Waqar Younis denied in his testimony
that he had any knowledge that the matches were fixed.
	   After Younus repeatedly said ``I don't know'' in response to
successive questions put to him by the judge, the judge warned him
against lying.
	   ``Don't lie. If you tell a lie here you will be caught,'' Qayuum
told Younus at the end of his testimony. He didn't elaborate.

Australian keeper charged with abusing fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bosnich,
who two years ago was fined and reprimanded for making allegedly
anti-semitic gestures to Tottenham fans, was charged by the
Football Association Wednesday with abusing Everton supporters.
	   The F.A. charged the Australian goalkeeper with swearing at
Everton fans during a Premier League match at Goodison Park in
August.
	   Two off-duty police officers made the allegations to local
police, who investigated the incident and reported it to the F.A.
to handle.
	   If found guilty, Bosnich faces a suspension and fine.
	   Bosnich has requested a hearing but said he would not be
employing a lawyer. ``I have nothing to answer to,'' said the
'keeper, who has denied swearing at the Everton supporters.
	   Bosnich was embroiled in controversy in 1996 when he made a
Nazi-style salute during a match at Tottenham in north London.
	   Because Tottenham attracts many Jewish fans, critics suggested
the gesture may have been racially motivated. But Bosnich
apologized and said throughout it was never meant that way.

Jordanians demand release of prisoners from Syrian jails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The families of more than 700 Jordanians
detained in Syria for nearly three decades held a peaceful
demonstration Wednesday demanding their relatives' immediate
release.
	   ``Our sons in Syrian jails beg for world mercy,'' read placards
carried by the protesters outside the domed parliament building in
Amman, the Jordanian capital.
	   Emad Sharqawi, a spokesman for the families, said many of the
Jordanian prisoners had gone on hunger strike to protest their
continued detention in Syria's Palmyra and Maza jails.
	   He said he had no report on the state of their health.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the claim.
	   Sharqawi said the prisoners had been jailed without trial.
	   The Jorandian government says 700 Jordanians have been held in
Syrian jails since the early 1970s. Many detainees are of
Palestinian origin.
	   Damascus has never acknowledged that it is holding any Jordanian
prisoners.
	   Sharqawi said some of the detainees were affiliated with radical
Palestinian groups and Jordan's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood
Movement.
	   He said others had been members of the National Command of
Syria's ruling Baath Party. They were detained following the coup
that brought President Hafez Assad to power in 1971.
	   ``We urge the Jordanian parliament and government to intervene
with the international community and governments and parliaments
worldwide to secure the immediate and unconditional release of our
detainees in Syria,'' Sharqawi told The Associated Press after he
delivered a memorandum to Joranian lawmakers.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters Monday that
Jordan was trying to secure the release of the detainees. He
declined to provide any details.
	   Relations with Syria have been lukewarm since the 1994
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty. Damascus believes the treaty has
weakened its leverage in negotiating peace with Israel.

Netanyahu says stalemate could be broken at U.S. summit

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The upcoming Israeli-Palestinian summit in
the United States could break the stalemate in the Mideast peace
process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday.
	   ``I believe every person in the Israeli government and in the
Israeli people hopes this (summit) will succeed,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein is abroad.
	   Netanyahu returned home by helicopter afterward to fly to the
United States, where he is due to start intensive negotiations
Thursday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a resort outside
Washington.
	   ``It is very clear that if the Palestinians live up to their
commitments in all the fields _ but most of them touch on security
_ then we shall have the ability to conclude a successful agreement
for advancing the peace,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said the Hebron accord signed last year with the
Palestinians provided a mechanism for fighting terrorism, which has
imperiled not only Israeli security, but could also ``take root in
the Palestinian population.''
	   More than 400 students at the University of Jordan staged a
45-minute protest on the campus after the prime minister's
departure, chanting ``Netanyahu, coward, you are neither a human
nor an animal.''
	   The students, who also burnt an Israeli flag, were mostly
supporters of hard-line militant groups which oppose Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is hosting the four-day summit which
will discuss a longstanding U.S. proposal for Israeli troops to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has proposed
a modification in terms of which 3 percent of the land handed-over
will remain effectively under its control.
	   Arafat visited Jordan on Monday for similar consultations.
	   Standing next to Netanyahu, Hassan said Israel and the
Palestinians should move swiftly toward a final settlement with the
Palestinians so that Israel can conclude similar agreements with
Lebanon and Syria.
	   Jordan is pushing for a settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict, the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Jordan is the first since relations chilled
in September 1997 after a botched attempt by the Israeli secret
service to kill a Palestinian militant leader in Jordan.

Olympic bid leader named special Greek envoy

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The woman credited with leading Athens'
successful bid for the 2004 Olympics was appointed Wednesday as a
special envoy for the foreign ministry.
	   The post gives Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki another forum as a
globe-trotting emissary for Greece _ a role she tirelessly
performed in the long campaign to return the Olympics to Athens.
	   The first duty of her new post will take Ms.
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki to Kyoto, Japan, in November. She will head
the Greek delegation at a U.N.-sponsored conference on cultural
heritage preservation, said Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   Pangalos said that in the future the ministry will assign Ms.
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki to missions concerning culture and
athletics.
	   Ms. Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, 42, a lawyer and former conservative
parliament member, called the post ``an honor.''
	   Although her popularity soared after Greece was awarded the
Games in September 1997, Ms. Angelopoulos-Daskalaki had distanced
herself from the organizing committee. At the time, she said she
was reluctant to leave her home in London.
	   She most recently helped wage Greece's failed bid for a
non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council.

Holbrooke fears world will wait too long to get ``verifiers'' on
</HEADLINE>
the ground
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to CORRECT, expand Holbrooke quote &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
expressed concern Wednesday that governments will move too slowly
in sending an international team to Kosovo to make sure Yugoslavia
complies with the deal to end the crisis there.
	   Envoys of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation meet Thursday at their Vienna headquarters to approve
the 2,000-member ``ground verification mission,'' part of the deal
Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The Yugoslav government is supposed to guarantee the safety of
the team members, who will not carry weapons. Their presence is
expected to convince thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees that it
is safe to return home.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network in New York, Holbrooke
said he was not worried about the safety of the team.
	   ``I'm not worried about their safety right now,'' Holbrooke
said. ``I'm worried that the international community will be too
slow and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six
months to get there when we need them there in six days or at least
six weeks.''
	   He called on major governments and veterans of previous
international missions to contact the OSCE as soon as possible and
offer personnel.
	   During the Bosnian war, Bosnian Serbs took U.N. peacekeepers
hostage to ward off NATO air attacks. Holbrooke said this time, if
the safety of mission personnel was threatened, NATO had
undisclosed plans for getting them out.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' _ both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground _
was a key concession in his talks with Holbrooke to defuse the
Kosovo crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   But the Vienna-based organization lacks a large permanent staff.
It will have to turn to its 54 member states, including the United
States, Russia, Canada and European Union countries, to provide
people with the proper training and skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said Tuesday. ``Over the coming weeks, we
hope to see the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, activated July 6 under an arrangement
worked out between Milosevic and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission _ Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans _ have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with first-hand reports
on the fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Yugoslav forces
and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees driven from their
homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
began returning to Kosovo on Wednesday from Macedonia, where they
were evacuated last week because of fears of reprisals by angry
Serbs if NATO launched air attacks.

Mahathir leaving junior ministers in charge as he visits Japan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir leaving junior ministers in charge
during Japan trip &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Wednesday that junior Cabinet ministers will head the
government while he visits Japan for five days, the national news
agency reported.
	   Mahathir's trip to Japan beginning Thursday is his first outside
Malaysia since a political crisis erupted after he fired his heir
apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, from the posts of deputy prime minister
and finance minister.
	   Mahathir has refused to name a new deputy. At a party meeting
earlier this month, he said the decision will have to wait until
internal elections of the governing United Malays National
Organization party next year.
	   Jokingly, Mahathir said it would take him only six hours to fly
to Kuala Lumpur from Tokyo if necessary.
	   Meanwhile, he said, the junior finance minister, Mustapa
Mohamed, and two deputy home ministers _ Tajol Rosli Ghazali and
Ong Kah Ting _ would take charge.
	   ``The prime minister's routine duties can be carried out as
usual. In other matters, they can contact me all the time,'' he
told reporters.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and named himself finance
minister.
	   The two had differed on economic policy for months. But Mahathir
has said he fired Anwar because of his alleged immorality. Anwar is
in jail facing trial on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts.
	   In Japan, Mahathir is scheduled to address a number of seminars
and meet with bankers, businessmen and editors from several major
Japanese newspapers, the Bernama news agency said.
	   He is also expected to attend receptions given by Emperor
Akihito and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   However, no official talks with Japanese government officials
have been scheduled.
	   Malaysia has been actively seeking yen-denominated loans from
Japan to help the country deal with its deepening economic
problems.
	   Of the dlrs 30 billion aid package for Southeast Asia that Tokyo
recently announced, dlrs 2 billion has been allotted for Malaysia,
embassy officials in Kuala Lumpur have said.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Northwest Airlines DC-10 lost
several parts after takeoff from Amsterdam but continued on and
landed safely in Detroit, the U.S. carrier and KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines said Wednesday.
	   None of the 254 passengers and 12 crew members aboard Flight 49
was aware of Tuesday's mishap, said the airlines, which operated
the flight jointly under their partnership.
	   In a statement, they said the jet lost part of the cover on its
tail engine shortly after takeoff from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.
	   The parts landed in a farmer's field. The plane continued to
lose several other small parts which also landed on the ground, the
carriers said.
	   Neither the safety of the aircraft nor its performance was
affected, and the flight arrived in Detroit without a delay, the
statement said.
	   Minneapolis-based Northwest and KLM, which performs maintenance
on Northwest aircraft at Schiphol, were cooperating with the
Accident and Incident Investigation Bureau of the Netherlands
Aviation Safety Board, the carriers said.

Italian police arrest mobster on most-wanted list

	   ROME (AP) _ Police have arrested an Italian mobster on the
most-wanted list who is accused of ordering 13 slayings, news
reports said Wednesday.
	   Diego Santino Burzotta was arrested in Barcelona, Spain, on
Tuesday night, while having a drink in a bar, Italian news agencies
reported.
	   Spanish and Italian police had been tapping his telephone and
following Burzotta for 11 months, the reports said.
	   Burzotta, 38, had been on the run since March 1994. The ANSA
news agency said police believe Burzotta had been hiding in
Barcelona for at least two years.
	   He is a top boss of the Mafia clan in Mazara del Vallo, in
western Sicily. He was sentenced to 9 years in prison for criminal
association and is suspected of ordering as many as 13 killings. He
is also a prime suspect in the attempted assassination of a Palermo
police official, Rino Germana, in 1992.
	   Several fugitive mobsters have been captured in Spain recently,
including top Mafia boss Pasquale Cuntrera, in May.

Rich Hindus underwrite spiritual zone in Millennium Dome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prayers for sponsors for the spiritual zone in the
Millennium Dome, Britain's head-turning celebration of the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ, have been answered _ by a
family of rich Indian Hindus.
	   The brothers who head the Hinduja Foundation, a global empire
that includes oil and industrial interests, said Wednesday that
they will underwrite the cost of the Spirit Zone, a primarily
Christian section, up to 12 million pounds (dlrs 20.5 million).
	   It is among 14 lifestyle zones in the dome, now rising alongside
the River Thames at Greenwich, south London.
	   Srichand Hinduja, one of four brothers who head the foundation,
which has offices in London, Geneva, Bombay and New York, said the
family believed in multicultural understanding.
	   ``So we feel that we should _ business people and politicians _
focus on multicultural understanding to remove all these
difficulties and to respect one another,'' he said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``We are all human beings.''
	   The Hindujas, originally from Bombay and onetime generous
contributors to Britain's Conservative Party, already have dipped
into their huge fortune to build a Hindu temple in Neasden, north
London.
	   Dome organizers acknowledge problems in getting sponsors _ but
none more so than for the Spirit Zone which, unlike other zones
with themes such as communication, leisure or national identity,
has scant commercial benefit.
	   Thanks to the Hindujas, the New Millennium Experience Co. can
proceed with building and equipping the zone.
	   On Wednesday, the company would say only that it was having
talks with four organizations and was confident the spirit zone
``will secure the necessary funding.''
	   In August, managing director Liam Kane told reporters, ``I say a
prayer every night that the next day I will find a sponsor for the
Spirit Zone.''

on motion to ask Yeltsin to resign. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
work in the Kremlin for several hours on Wednesday, defying
doctors' orders to stay home and recover from a respiratory
infection.
	   The upper house of parliament, meanwhile, fell just 11 votes
short of approving a motion asking Yeltsin to resign because of his
social welfare policies. The motion said the policies were
``unsatisfactory and in contradiction to the interests of the
majority of the country's citizens.''
	   The vote in the Federation Council, which is made up of regional
leaders, was 79 to 18 in favor of the motion, the Interfax news
agency reported. However, the motion did not pass because it
required 90 votes, which is a simple majority in the upper chamber.
	   The motion carries no legal weight, but it reflected growing
anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that is generally supportive of
the president.

Ex-communists gain in final German election tally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The former East German communists gained an
unexpected additional seat in parliament Wednesday in the final
tally of Germany's Sept. 27 election.
	   One seat was taken away from the Free Democrats, junior partner
in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing government coalition, after
errors and irregularities in earlier, unofficial results were
corrected, federal election commissioner Johann Hahlen said.
	   The vote's overall outcome _ a victory for the left that ended
Kohl's 16 years of conservative rule _ was unchanged.
	   Moving up into parliament for the ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialism is Heinrich Fink, a former dean of Humboldt
University in east Berlin who allegedly was an informer for former
East Germany's dreaded secret police, the Stasi.
	   Fink, who ran in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania, has denied the charge.
	   In the new parliament convening Oct. 26, Social Democratic
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder and his future coalition
partner, the Greens party, have a 21-seat majority.
	   The Social Democrats have 298 seats; Kohl's Christian Democrats,
198; their Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union, 47 seats; the
Greens, 47; the Free Democrats, 43, and the Democratic Socialists,
36.

Education minister promises improvements to protesting students
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Education Minister Claude Allegre said Wednesday
the leftist government ``has heard'' protesting students who took
to the streets of France twice this week and is working to meet
their demands for better conditions.
	   Meanwhile Paris police braced for a new protest march on
Thursday, warning store owners along the route to lock up and
ordering students to stay in line.
	   ``I think it is logical for the young, when there are needs,
when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are overcrowded,
to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said at the close
of the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   The government ``has heard'' the students ``and I'm doing what I
can to give this to them,'' he said.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, Allegre presented his plan to spread
teachers out more equitably around the country, a decree that
bypasses the parliamentary process. On Tuesday, he said the plan
aims at ``putting a teacher in front of every student.''
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself a former
education minister, hailed the plan, saying it would bring about
``very rapid improvements.''
	   It was presented as high school students mobilized for their
third demonstration Thursday.
	   Paris police headquarters asked students to scrupulously respect
the march route -- from Place de la Nation, in eastern Paris, to
the Education Ministry on the Left Bank. Police advised residents
to park their cars elsewhere and told store owners along the route
they'd best lock up to avoid pillaging and property damage.
	   Some 10,000 students marched Monday to demand smaller classes
and better resources. But ``uncontrollable elements did not
hesitate to damage property,'' police said, noting that 13 people
had been detained.
	   Allegre promised that a plan to lighten the course load for high
school students would be presented in November.
	   Elsewhere, there were signs the students had a sympathetic ear.
	   Some 450 high students managed to collect 6,000 francs (dlrs
1,090) from drivers on the A-64 highway in Muret, 30 kms (nearly 20
miles) from Toulouse, police there said. The money is to pay their
transport to Toulouse on Thursday for a new demonstration.
	   Even some teachers were beginning to root for protesting
students. One of the largest teacher's unions called on Tuesday for
its members to show solidarity with their protesting students.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ An American company will help revamp a
major Bulgarian thermal power plant , with outlays estimated at
dlrs 400 million, the state newsagency BTA reported.
	   Entergy Power Group, based in Irvine, California, is to
reconstruct the Maritza-Iztok-3 power station near Stara Zagora,
some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Sofia, in a joint
venture with Bulgaria's National Electric Company.
	   No details of the venture were released.
	   The project includes implementation of enviroment-friendly
technology that will phase out sulfur dioxide emissions from the
plant, BTA said.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian and American officials said
Wednesday that the two countries have resolved their dispute over
increasing exports of Egyptian cotton knits, which was know here as
``the T-shirt problem.''
	   Egyptian Trade Minister Ahmed Guweili told reporters that
Washington has approved a deal that will allow Egypt ``to borrow 10
percent of its quota for 1999'' to expand sales this year.
	   He said this would ``avoid the bottleneck'' caused when heavy
demand by U.S. importers for Egyptian knits exceeded this year's
quota.
	   Asked if this meant there would be reduced sales next year, he
said ``perhaps, but we have time to adjust.''
	   The American ambassador to Egypt, Daniel Kurtzer, termed it ``a
mutually satisfying conclusion of negotiations.''
	   Neither official could provide exact figures on revised export
levels. They spoke at the opening of a U.S.-sponsored conference to
encourage American investment in private-sector projects in Egypt.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Lack of concentrated feed, medicine and
vaccines have led to the collapse of Iraq's poultry industry, a
U.N. study revealed.
	   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said that of 26
state-owned farms, only 12 were partially operational. Most of the
8,000 private farms were idle.
	   The report said that current poultry production was estimated to
be 10-15 percent of the 1990 level.
	   Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, prompting the United Nations to
impose punitive trade sanctions on the country.
	   Annual per capita consumption of eggs fell from 85 to 10 between
1990 and 1997, the study said.
	   Annual consumption of chicken meat shrank from 12.5 kilograms
(27.5 lbs) per person to 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lbs) during the same
period.
	   The Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with the FAO has
started a major survey of the poultry industry to calculate the
funds required for its rehabilitation, the report said.
	   It said Iraq intended to channel part of the dlrs 250 million
allocated for the agricultural sector under the current phase of
the oil-for-food program to revamp its poultry farms.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government has asked a foreign
consortium to oversee the restructuring of the debt-ridden national
airline, Royal Jordanian, an official said on Wednesday.
	   A study by U.S., British and French specialists will cost dlrs 2
million and be financed by the World Bank, said the airline's
chairman, Walid Asfour.
	   The survey would evaluate the airline's assets and recommend
ways to manage its debt, which is estimated at 700 Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 985.9 million), he said.
	   ``We also want to set up a debt-free subsidiary and eventually
sell off a large stake, between 40 and 60 percent of the new
entity, to a strategic partner,'' Asfour said.
	   Under the agreement with the consortium, two entities will be
formed, one to handle aviation affairs and the other to manage
duty-free shops, engineering, maintenance and catering services.
	   The consortium includes Banque Paribas of France, a U.S.
consulting agency, and Cifford, Chance, Line and Partners of
Britain.
	   The government has pledged to privatize Royal Jordanian, which
has a fleet of 15 aircraft.
	   ____
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Representatives of more than 100 American
companies are attending a two-day conference here to look into
investing in Egyptian power, transport, water and chemical
projects.
	   The ``Egypt Opportunities '98'' conference, sponsored by the
U.S. Trade and Development Agency, aims at putting American
investors in touch with Egyptian entrepreneurs.
	   Organizers said that 50 Egyptian projects _ with combined
capital requirements of dlrs 10 billion _ were to be profiled at
sessions that began Wednesday.
	   ``This conference should be seen as an unmistakable sign that
Egypt is open for business,'' said Joseph Grandmaison, director of
the trade agency.
	   Egypt's trade minister, Ahmed Guweili, said Egypt was moving to
establish itself as a good base for inter-regional trading. He
noted that the country last June joined the main African trading
union and is a key participant in the Arab League's free trade
agreement.
	   ``Egypt is at the heart ... between Europe, Africa and the
Middle East,'' Guweili said. ``We are trying to exploit our
location.''
	   Officials from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas
Private Investment Corp., which underwrite and insure trade
projects, also are participating in the conference.

Russian parliamentary delegation leaves for Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian upper house of parliament appealing for
ban on use of force against Yugoslavia. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of
the turn of events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to
continue working ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must knock on wood, but it appears there will be no
airstrikes.''
	   The six-country Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov was to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to
attend the meeting, said ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Ivanov sounded triumphant Wednesday.
	   ``One can say with a great degree of confidence that we have
averted a threat of a military operation in Yugoslavia,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted him as saying.
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation, meanwhile, left for Kosovo
to get a first-hand look at what is happening in the southern Serb
province and examine sites that could be targeted by NATO
airstrikes.
	   Neighboring Belarus also sent a government delegation to
Belgrade on Wednesday to discuss military aid to Yugoslavia.
Russia's parliament speaker has called on its Slavic neighbors to
help Yugoslavia, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has
promised military support _ though no soldiers.
	   The upper house of Russia's parliament, the Federation Council,
unanimously adopted a resolution ``calling on all parliaments of
the world, and the world community _ especially NATO members _ not
to allow military intervention in Yugoslavia's internal conflict.''
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, also drafted a
resolution Wednesday denouncing the ``NATO threat to unleash a war
against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia.'' The draft, to be
finalized later Wednesday, stated that airstrikes against Serbia
would hurt NATO's relations with Russia and fuel tensions in
Europe.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov also told a British parliamentary
delegation Wednesday that if NATO goes ahead with its plans for
military action, Russia may revoke its agreement on friendship and
cooperation with the alliance.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.

Australia's Lehmann to miss second test with groin injury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia suffered a major setback
Wednesday when Darren Lehmann was ruled out of the second test
against Pakistan with a groin injury.
	   The left-handed South Australian batsmen sustained the injury
during the tourists' warm-up game in Rawalpindi, where he scored
century in each innings.
	   ``(Darren) Lehmann is out for tomorrow (Thursday),'' skipper
Mark Taylor said. Lehmann scored 98 in Australia's 99-run victory
over Pakistan in the first test at Rawalpindi and continued his
prolific form when he hammered 103 in the first innings against
Rawalpindi.
	   Lehmann was retired after injuring his groin in the second
innings after scoring 100.
	   ``Obviously it's a great blow to lose a man in form,'' Taylor
said. ``But I think we have other batsmen like Ricky Ponting in the
side to replace him.''
	   The Australian skipper said that the wicket prepared at the
Arbab Niaz Stadium in Peshawar looked hard and bouncy.
	   ``It looks a bit like a Sydney-type wicket with some grass on it
and it looks like a pretty good test wicket to me,'' he said.
	   Taylor, whose team has taken a 1-0 lead over Pakistan in the
three-test series, is cautious going into the second test.
	   ``We have won the first test, but it really means nothing. Every
game has it's separate value. It's good that we are 1-0 up but we
should not be complacent,'' he said. ``There are still two tests to
go and Pakistan has a chance to bounce back.''
	   Pakistan has some good memories at Arbab Niaz. It won its
previous two test matches there by an innings. They beat Sri Lanka
in 1995-96 season and last year outclassed a Courtney Walsh-led
West Indies.
	   But the home team faces a number of problems to keep its hopes
alive against Australia. It dropped Aaqib Javed, Waqar Younis,
Muhammad Wasim and Muhammad Hussain after the Rawalpindi debacle.
	   They also are beset with injuries.
	   Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed is nursing a knee injury. Paceman
Shoaib Akhtar twisted his ankle during Wednesday's net practice and
paceman Wasim Akram did not train because of a sore throat and
slight fever.
	   ``We will have to wait and see. Wasim, Mushtaq and Shoaib all
are having a bit of problems. We will see tomorrow how many of them
could be fit for the next five days,'' Aamir Sohail said.
	   ``I know we are up against a very talented test side in the
world. We have learned from our first test mistakes and hope not to
repeat them here,'' said Sohail.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Teams
	   Australia: Mark Taylor, Michael Slater, Steve Waugh, Mark Waugh,
Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn

be named).

Holbrooke fears world will wait too long to get ``verifiers'' to
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
expressed concern Wednesday that governments will move too slowly
to send international monitors to Kosovo to make sure Yugoslavia
complies with the deal to end the conflict in the secessionist
province.
	   Envoys of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation meet Thursday at their Vienna headquarters to approve
the 2,000-member ``ground verification mission,'' part of the deal
Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The Yugoslav government is supposed to guarantee the safety of
the team members, who will not carry weapons. Their presence is
expected to ensure thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees that it is
safe to return home. Ethnic Albanians are the vast majority in the
province in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In an interview with the U.S. television network CNN, Holbrooke
said he was not worried about the safety of the team.
	   ``I'm not worried about their safety right now,'' Holbrooke said
in New York. ``I'm worried that the international community will be
too slow and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six
months to get there when we need them there in six days or at least
six weeks.''
	   He urged major governments and veterans of previous
international missions to contact the OSCE as soon as possible and
offer personnel.
	   During the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war, Bosnian Serbs took U.N.
peacekeepers hostage to ward off NATO air attacks. Holbrooke said
this time, if the safety of mission personnel was threatened, NATO
had undisclosed plans for getting them out.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' _ both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground _
was a key concession in his talks with Holbrooke to defuse the
Kosovo crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   But the Vienna-based organization lacks a large permanent staff.
It will have to turn to its 54 member states, including the United
States, Russia, Canada and European Union countries, to provide
people with the proper training and skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said Tuesday. ``Over the coming weeks, we
hope to see the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, activated July 6 under an arrangement
worked out between Milosevic and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission _ Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans _ have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with firsthand reports
on the fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Yugoslav forces
and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees driven from their
homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
began returning to Kosovo on Wednesday from Macedonia, where they
were evacuated last week because of fears of reprisals by angry
Serbs if NATO launched air attacks.

From army to presidency, Lahoud brings hope and new style
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ When Emile Lahoud was appointed army
commander during Lebanon's civil war, he had no office, no command
and little power.
	   Nine years later, Lebanon's divided army is now united and in
charge of national security, discipline has been restored and
Lahoud's command is undisputed.
	   That spirit of getting things done is what Lebanese fed up with
corrupt politicians hope Lahoud will bring to his presidency in the
next six years. He is virtually certain to be elected head of state
by Parliament on Thursday, making him Lebanon's 11th president
since independence from France in 1943.
	   ``We need a white revolution, an uprising ... we need someone to
put an end to those wolves who tore apart the nation,'' wrote
Gibran Tueini, general manager of the leading independent newspaper
An-Nahar.
	   ``You can be the hero of this uprising,'' Tueini told Lahoud in
an editorial this week.
	   The 62-year-old army chief is often described as clean-handed
and decent.
	   Lahoud also has the essential backing of Syria, which maintains
30,000 troops in Lebanon and holds sway over its weaker neighbor.
	   Except for a few dissenters _ who worry about a military man as
president _ politicians and religious leaders of all colors have
shown uncommon unity in endorsing Lahoud.
	   He is a Maronite Catholic, the sect that traditionally fills the
presidency. The son of an army general, he hails from a prominent
family that has produced Cabinet ministers and legislators.
	   Lahoud was born in 1936 in Baabdat, a mountain resort. He became
a naval lieutenant in 1959 after studies in Britain, commanded
small boats in Lebanon's tiny navy and later had training at U.S.
naval bases.
	   Since the navy falls under the army in Lebanon, he was appointed
army commander with a change in rank from admiral to general in
1989.
	   But he could not fill his office because the previous commander,
Gen. Michel Aoun, refused to give up control of the Defense
Ministry and waged disastrous military campaigns against Syrian
control of Lebanon.
	   Lahoud, like outgoing President Elias Hrawi, sided with a Syrian
offensive in October 1990 that ended the 15-year civil war between
Muslims and Christians by defeating Aoun, who is now in exile in
France.
	   After taking command, he brought together the remnants of the
army, ended the practice of organizing brigades by religion and
worked to keep the 55,000-strong military _ more than twice its
1990 size _ free of political meddling.
	   ``I have drawn a long line between the past and the present,''
he was quoted as telling troops under his command. ``I do not
recognize that past, and the future starts from today.''
	   The army has coordinated more closely with Syria and taken a
greater _ though still limited _ role in facing Israeli occupation
forces in southern Lebanon.
	   In Lahoud's presidency, little is expected to change in foreign
policy, which is set by Syria.
	   But the public wants him to reform the government as he did the
army. Christians, who lost power in the postwar years, hope he can
restore a Muslim-Christian balance _ although he is said to resent
the sectarian-based division of power in Lebanon.

Kruger National Park announces crackdown on violators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKUKUZA, South Africa (AP) _ Kruger National Park on Wednesday
said it was cracking down on visitors who litter, feed animals,
speed or leave their cars.
	   Violators would be fined up to 1,500 rand (dlrs 250) or face
possible prison terms.
	   The crackdown came after ``numerous complaints from our regular
visitors,'' park management said.
	   Traffic officers, game rangers and plain-clothed security
personnel would be on the lookout. Prison terms were not specified.
	   ``Reckless behaviour endangers the animals and has a negative
impact on the environment and to our other visitors' enjoyment,''
management said.
	   The park, which covers 21,497 square kilometers (8,598 square
miles) or an area the size of Israel, is one of South Africa's main
tourist sites and attracts some 700,000 visitors a year.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid
convoys Wednesday to ethnic Albanians refugees, many of whom were
still afraid to return home despite President Slobodan Milosevic's
agreement to end the Kosovo crackdown.
	   Meanwhile, those preparing to set up a 2,000-member ``ground
verification mission'' arrived in Kosovo from neighboring Macedonia
to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   Britain's foreign secretary warned the Yugoslav leader Wednesday
that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs down on the
agreement to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace talks with
separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the monitors into the
troubled Serb province to verify compliance.
	   Those steps are designed to end the seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian separatists, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 people homeless. NATO gave
Milosevic until Saturday morning (0500 GMT) to comply or face
airstrikes.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency said it resumed aid convoys,
which were suspended Monday before Milosevic bowed to international
demands. U.N. officials said many refugees were still hiding in the
hills and forests, fearing Serb reprisals if they go home.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' said U.N.
spokesman Kris Janowski. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   In order to build such confidence, the agreement reached this
week with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke provides about 2,000
international monitors to be stationed in Kosovo. But the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
responsible for the mission, must ask its 54 member governments to
provide the monitors.
	   OSCE officials say it could take weeks before all the monitors
are in the province.
	   ``I'm not worried about their safety now,'' Holbrooke said in an
interview Wednesday with CNN. ``I'm worried that the international
community will be too slow in getting them there, that it will take
six months'' before the force is fully assembled.
	   Holbrooke said the Russians, who had opposed NATO airstrikes,
also have agreed to participate in aerial monitoring.
	   In the meantime, U.S., Canadian and European diplomats returned
Wednesday to begin forming the ground monitor force. The observers
had been working in Kosovo since July but were evacuated last week
for fear of Serb reprisals if NATO attacked.
	   Also, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo authorized American officials
to return to the Serb-held half of Bosnia Wednesday.
	   In the hills about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Kosovo,
some refugees said Wednesday that they don't trust Milosevic and
have no confidence in the ability of unarmed monitors to guarantee
their safety.
	   ``He is lying that they are withdrawing their forces,'' said a
56-year-old refugee, who gave his name only as Hasan. ``They are
here. There are tanks dug in the ground.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday warned that
NATO would be watching closely for evidence of compliance.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook said in a BBC radio interview. ``The united consensus
within NATO that we were ready to take military action was there at
the beginning of the week, is still there and that decision is
still on the table. We can reactivate these plans any time we feel
it is necessary to do so.''
	   Holbrooke said it's time to focus on compliance and not threats,
``but the bombers are ready, and if necessary we'll return to that
emergency phase, which is not quite over.''
	   In a step toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan
for a separate parliament in Kosovo. The plan, announced late
Tuesday, calls for local elections in 1999 in the separatist
province. According to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have
their own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them.
And it offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters not suspected
of war crimes.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose independence for Kosovo,
fearing it could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.

EU imposes dlrs 60.2 million fine on four British sugar companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union fined four British
sugar companies a total of dlrs 60.2 million for violating EU rules
on price fixing.
	   The EU's executive Commission announced Wednesday it imposed
fines of dlrs 47.5 million against British Sugar and dlrs 8.4
million against Tate and Lyle.
	   Sugar merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett were also found
guilty of violating EU price fixing rules and were each fined dlrs
2.2 million.
	   The four companies were fined because of their ``collaborative
strategy of higher pricing'' on the sugar market in Britain, a
commission statement said.
	   British Sugar said it will appeal the EU ruling.
	   The Commission says the infringements took place between 1986
and 1990. At the time, the four companies represented about 90
percent of the entire white granulated sugar market in Britain.
	   The EU's anti-trust authorities said they found evidence of
``numerous'' meetings between the four parties from 1986-1990.
	   The commission said in a statement that British Sugar and Tate &AMP;
Lyle first met on June 20, 1986 where ``the principles of the
future anti-competitive conduct were set.
	   ``The merchants Napier Brown and James Budgett joined this
conduct before the end of 1986,'' the commission said.

Two men get life sentences for child rape in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two men have been sentenced to life in
prison for child rape in separate cases in southern Vietnam, court
officials said Wednesday.
	   Vinh Long provincial Judge Nguyen Huu Tuan said Nguyen Van Inh,
58, was convicted of repeatedly raping his second wife's
12-year-old daughter. He has 15 days to appeal.
	   The assaults reportedly began in February 1997 and continued
until Inh fled in December to avoid arrest, Tuan said, adding that
the girl gave birth in April. Inh was arrested in neighboring An
Giang province in May.
	   Meanwhile, a court in Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday sentenced
41-year-old Nguyen Duy Dung to life imprisonment for raping the
4-year-old daughter of his neighbor.
	   Dung was arrested in March, four months after the rape, when the
victim's family reported the incident to police.
	   Child rape has been on the rise in Vietnam despite toughened
penalties for the crime.

Foreign minister: Japan can't `smash' North Korea into halting
</HEADLINE>
nuclear program &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign minister Masahiko Komura said Wednesday
that Japan must negotiate with North Korea to stop its nuclear
development because it can't ``smash'' its communist neighbor into
halting the work, Kyodo News reported.
	   Komura was replying to a question in a parliamentary committee
by an opposition legislator who said North Korea is refusing to
halt missile development and Japan thus has no reason to join in
aid for that nation.
	   The aid would go to building nuclear reactors for the North
under an agreement that Pyongyang in turn would agree to shut down
its own nuclear program, suspected of developing weapons. Japan,
the United States and South Korea had joined in the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization, which plans to build the
reactors.
	   But Japan has delayed its dlrs 1 billion contribution toward the
dlrs 4.6 billion project because of a North Korean rocket test
across Japanese territory on Aug. 31.
	   Kyodo News quoted Komura as saying that ``to have North Korea
stop its nuclear development, we should negotiate or smash.
	   ``But Japan does not have the means or power to smash. We must
expect talks in the KEDO negotiations,'' it quoted Komura as
saying.
	   An official of the lower house's committee on foreign affairs,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Komura's use of the
word ``smash,'' but declined to discuss the statement further.
	   In a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
New York last month, Komura said Japan still supports the KEDO
agreement, but fears that handing over the dlrs 1 billion now will
signal to North Korea that its aggressive military actions don't
have consequences.

Is Israel's famed old warrior finally ready for peacemaking?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was a moment like so many in Ariel Sharon's
storied military career: He marched straight in and took charge.
	   Sharon _ aging ex-general, master political survivor, revered by
some as a war hero and reviled by others as a war criminal _
formally assumed control of Israel's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday,
a day before his departure for a crucial Mideast summit outside
Washington.
	   For the 70-year-old Sharon, it's a summit in more ways than one.
When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week named him as
foreign minister, it capped a long painful climb back from a decade
and a half of disgrace and political exile.
	   Meeting with top ministry officials _ and, briefly, with
reporters _ the burly, white-haired Sharon turned on a typical mix
of diplomatic formulations, unyielding doctrine and blunt-force
charm.
	   Asked about past encroachments on the powers of his new
ministry, he made a characteristic declaration.
	   ``I'm not the kind of man people give things to,'' he said in
his trademark trumpeting voice. ``I take them.''
	   Probably no other Israeli public figure arouses such conflicting
passions. To his partisans, Sharon is the daring, brilliant
tactician whose battlefield victories helped turn the tide of three
of Israel's wars, the only politician with the force and stature to
lead the rightist camp.
	   To detractors, he is a destroyer. The Israeli left despises him.
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat flatly describes him as a
war criminal.
	   Many Palestinians hold him responsible for Lebanese Christian
militiamen's 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, and
angrily recall his aggressive promotion of Jewish settlement growth
during a stint as housing minister.
	   Sharon returns the ill feeling: he has said publicly he won't
shake Yasser Arafat's hand, even in his post as Israel's principal
negotiator of peace with the Palestinians.
	   Many of Sharon's allies on the right reacted with dismay to his
appointment as foreign minister, considering him an opportunist who
betrayed principles to fulfill his own political ambitions. His
acceptance of the job, they believe, amounts to endorsement of a
land deal with the Palestinians, something they bitterly oppose.
	   Yitzhak Shamir, the hard-line former prime minister, accuses
Sharon of contradicting himself. ``He doesn't promise anything
which can truly change the situation for the better,'' he told
Israel radio.
	   Even Sharon's own boss doesn't much care for him. In the past,
Sharon never shied away from disparaging Netanyahu in public, and
the prime minister repaid him by relegating him to the
second-string post of infrastructure minister _ a big come-down for
a politician who had once hoped to be prime minister himself one
day.
	   Some observers believe Sharon's desire to rise above past
disgrace _ he had not held a leadership post for 15 years, since
being held indirectly responsible for the massacres at the Sabra
and Shatilla camps south of Beirut _ could be the key to his stance
at the summit and in months to come.
	   The word being used over and over again by commentators is
pragmatism. Sharon is viewed by friend and foe alike as hard-headed
and hard-nosed, unlikely to sign onto an accord unless he really
thought it would work on the ground.
	   And his background gives him greater credibility than anyone
else on questions of Israel's security, something on which any
accord will hinge.
	   A government official long acquainted with Sharon, speaking on
condition of anonymity, likened his potential role to that of the
late Moshe Dayan in the Camp David process _ ``the practical
general who understands this is the last chapter of his life, that
there are limits to power and the use of force in solving
disputes.''
	   His desire to become a statesman, the official suggested, could
strongly propel him toward unexpected compromise.
	   ``Sharon is a man of surprises, and not only on the
battlefield,'' commentator Avraham Tirosh wrote in the Maariv
newspaper. ``No one is able to assess what Sharon will really do.''

Tyson training quietly in Phoenix, but does get out and about
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Mike Tyson bought toys, ogled near-naked women
and took a run on a university track while awaiting a Nevada
Athletic Commission decision whether to allow him to resume boxing.
	   A psychiatric report prepared for the Nevada Athletic Commission
and released Tuesday in Las Vegas concluded that although he has a
``constellation of neurobehavioral deficits,'' he is mentally fit
to return to the ring.
	   Tyson's license was suspended after he bit Evander Holyfield's
ears during their June 1997 heavyweight championship fight.
	   Tyson, meanwhile, secluded himself Tuesday at Madison Square
Garden Gym near downtown Phoenix, where he has been training for
about two weeks, according to The Tribune, a newspaper serving
suburban Phoenix.
	   ``He just wants to focus,'' a man tending the locked door told
The Tribune.
	   Richard Rodriguez, who runs the gym, said it's an honor to have
Tyson there, but would say little else, explaining that's the way
Tyson's handlers want it.
	   Despite the secrecy practiced by Tyson's entourage, the boxer
has been around the metro Phoenix area quite a bit recently.
	   On Saturday, Tyson attended a wedding at Rodriguez's gym and
autographed a bunch of Stetson hats, The Tribune said.
	   ``The Mexican people there just mobbed him,'' Rodriguez said.
``They loved him.''
	   Later Saturday, he and three bodyguards spent five hours at
Babe's Cabaret, a topless dancing lounge in Scottsdale, employees
told the newspaper.
	   During Friday night excursions, he bought X-Men comic book
action figures at a Scottsdale toy store after visiting Arizona
State University in neighboring Tempe.
	   ``Apparently he was running around the track and trying to pick
up women on the (campus) mall,'' said Keith Jennings, a university
spokesman.

Forbes rains praise on Netanyahu during Israel visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Multimillionaire Steve Forbes, who is ``leaning
toward'' running for U.S. president in 2000, is emerging as one of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leading fans.
	   Netanyahu's tough diplomacy in the peace talks with the
Palestinians and plans to liberalize the Israeli economy are
creating the ideal climate for foreign investment, Forbes told The
Associated Press in an interview Wednesday.
	   Forbes, who lost a 1996 bid for president, is leading a U.S.
business delegation on a three-day visit to Israel. Sitting at a
conference table cluttered with papers, he took a break from
back-to-back meetings, including talks with Netanyahu.
	   Forbes said Netanyahu should not soften his positions during
this week's Mideast peace summit near Washington.
	   Forbes said he believed that as a result of Netanyahu's tough
stand so far, the Palestinians are more likely to meet Israeli
security demands.
	   ``I think the government's unwillingness to be brow-beaten by
outside forces into making undue concessions is bearing fruit
now,'' Forbes said.
	   ``When people are more concerned about raising capital to start
a business or paying a mortgage than blowing up one's neighbor,
that is a better foundation for peace,'' Forbes said, playing with
his red tie.
	   ``That means Israel cannot make one-sided concessions because
that just feeds the intransigence of the other side,'' he added.
	   Netanyahu had invited Forbes, along with U.S. cosmetics magnate
Ron Lauder, to attend Israel's ``Jubilee Business Summit.'' Forbes
will deliver a speech on Thursday.
	   Forbes said that in meetings with Trade Minister Natan Sharansky
and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, he advocated further
economic liberalizations. Netanyahu has said he hoped to privatize
dozens of state-run companies during his term.
	   Forbes said he is ``leaning toward'' seeking the Republican
nomination for president but will not make a decision until early
next year after consultations with his family.
	   The publisher brushed concern that foreign investment in Israel
will slow down significantly due to a two-year logjam in the peace
process.
	   Forbes said that Netanyahu needs to ``do the peace process right
rather than rush into it'' and to cut taxes across the board to
keep investors coming.

Japanese government now expects no recovery for three years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS; UPDATES with bankruptcy report in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With advisers warning that Japan's economy needs 10
trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion) in new stimulus just to break even,
a senior official conceded Wednesday that recovery may take a year
longer than expected.
	   Meanwhile, the bad news continued to roll in as a research
agency reported that the debt left behind by a rising number of
bankruptcies in September reached a postwar high of 3 trillion yen
(dlrs 25 billion).
	   ``We think the economy will recover in two or three years,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was quoted as saying by Kyodo
News agency.
	   Until now, the government had said a turnaround would take one
or two years.
	   This is the second time in recent days that Tokyo has played
down hopes for a quick end to Japan's deepest recession since World
War II.
	   Last week, the government revised downward its economic forecast
for the fiscal year ending March 31, predicting an 1.8 percent
contraction instead of the previously forecast growth of 1.9
percent.
	   Nonaka's dour prediction came as an advisory economic panel to
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi urged the government to inject
trillions of yen (billions of dollars) into the country's
debt-laden banks and approve the additional stimulus spending.
	   Acknowledging the severe state of the economy, the Economic
Strategy Council report said the money was needed to stabilize the
financial system and bring the economy to the zero-growth level.
	   The stimulus spending should include both public works spending
and reductions in corporate and income taxes, the panel said.
	   That would come in addition to more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 50
billion) in corporate and income tax cuts that the government has
already promised by next fiscal year.
	   Also Wednesday, the newspaper Sankei reported that a government
panel was expected to conclude that the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. is insolvent after its recent inspection of the
bank.
	   Nonaka, however, played down the story, saying that he had
received no such report. The LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders,
has been rumored to be on the verge of collapse since summer.
	   Corporate bankruptcies rose 17.9 percent from the same month
last year to 1,518 cases, private credit research agency Teikoku
Databank Ltd. said.
	   The major reason for September's surge in bankruptcy debt was
the massive failure of Japan Leasing Corp., a financial affiliate
of LTCB.

Montgomerie wants change in World Match Play format
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA, WATER, England (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie wants some
changes in the format of the World Match Play Championship.
	   The four seeded players in the 12-man field get a bye in
Thursday's 36-hole first round. That means they face only three
rounds of 36 holes daily to win the title instead of four rounds
for the rest of the field.
	   For the sixth time in seven appearances, Montgomerie is unseeded
over the 7,006-yard layout on the West Course at the Wentworth
Club.
	   ``In the last 10 years... there have been two winners from
non-seeded players (Corey Pavin and Vijay Singh),'' Montgomerie
said. ``I'm a great believer _ and I'll say it again _ this
tournament should be 16 or eight. Twelve doesn't work out that
well.''
	   Montgomerie, leading the European money list and trying to win
the title for the sixth straight year, faces Thomas Bjorn in the
first round. He's won two of his last three tournaments and, of his
four wins this season, one came at Wentworth in May in the Volvo
PGA Championship.
	   He also won the Andersen Consulting event in January _ also a
match-play format.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SINGH OUT: &LR;  Defending champion Vijay Singh _ seeded No. 1 ahead
of Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Mark O'Meara _ agrees with
Montgomerie. A bye is a big plus.
	   ``On this course, four days of 36 holes is very hard,'' he said.
``You're going to feel your legs on Saturday and Sunday. No matter
how fit you are, you're going to feel it.''
	   Singh, second on the U.S. money list to David Duval (trailing by
dlrs 699,410) doubts he'll catch up.
	   ``I am second, but a long way behind Duval,'' he said. ``To
catch him is a tall order. I probably have to win the next two
weeks to be No. 1. When it comes that close, it's a goal to go
for.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BRING ON TIGER: &LR;  The winner of Thursday's Darren Clarke-Ian
Woosnam match gets Woods in the quarterfinal. ``That would be
something to relish,'' said Westwood.
	   Woods, playing the event for the first time, is sure to swell
the galleries at this tight, tree-lined course just an hour's drive
southwest of London.
	   ``I think Tiger will do well,'' said Montgomerie. ``He's the
best player in the world, he's the favorite in every tournament he
tees up in.
	   ``I think him playing here has added an awful lot to this
tournament, an awful lot,'' Montgomerie added. ``To have Tiger
Woods in any tournament adds to it, but especially here in Britain
in a world championship event. Fabulous, I'm sure the crowds will
see that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: &LR;  Ian Woosnam, a late replacement for Bernhard Langer
(chronic neck injury), is making his 12th appearance with wins in
1987 and 1990. Woods, Bjorn, Patrik Sjoland and Lee Westwood are
making their first appearances.
	   This is the 35th World Match Play. Arnold Palmer won the first
in 1964 and Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros hold the record for
the most titles (five).
	   The new sponsor this year is Cisco Systems. It replaces Toyota's
seven-year sponsorship.

Iran frees director of banned liberal newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The managing director of a banned newspaper
in Iran has been freed after four weeks in detention, the official
Iranian news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Hamid Reza Jalaipur of the liberal newspaper Tous was released
Tuesday night, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an
unidentified source as saying.
	   Jalaipur was arrested along with editor Mahmoud Shams when Tous
was outlawed on Sept. 16. The authorities accused the paper of
publishing articles detrimental to Iran's security.
	   The newspaper, originally named Jameah, was closed in July but
reappeared under the title Tous.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered
Jalaipur's release, a press officer of the Islamic Revolutionary
Court told the agency.
	   Jalaipur's mother met Khamenei on Tuesday and appealed for her
son's release, the agency reported.
	   The press officer said the court would continue to investigate
charges against Jalaipur. The charges are presumed to concern an
alleged breach of national security.
	   Hard-liners in Iran's ruling clergy wanted to shut down Tous
because of its pacifist stance in Iran's quarrel with the Taliban
government in Afghanistan, whose militiamen killed eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist. The newspaper urged a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, while other newspapers and officials called
for a military strike against the Taliban.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Khamenei.
	   Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six publications in
recent months and detained six journalists for allegedly publishing
lies.
	   The crackdown runs counter to the efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.
	   With Jalaipur's release, three Tous journalists remain in
detention.

British government to tighten surrogacy laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Wednesday that it will seek to
tighten the laws that limit payments to surrogate mothers to make
them easier to enforce.
	   Currently, surrogate mothers may legally be paid only for
maternity expenses and compensation for loss of wages. But an
independent government-commissioned report said some women were
pocketing as much as 15,000 pounds (dlrs 25,500) for being
surrogates.
	   Legislation is necessary to clarify what surrogate mothers may
be paid for, the report said. It also recommended that surrogacy
agencies in Britain be registered with the Department of Health and
governed by a new code of practice.
	   ``We can't ban surrogacy, as for many couples it may be the only
way they can have the baby they long for,'' Health Minister Tessa
Jowell said. ``But it is a process fraught with risks for the
commissioning couple, the surrogate mother, children in her family
and, of course, the baby, whose welfare must be central to all our
concerns.''
	   It is estimated that between 50 and 100 surrogate babies are
born every year through agency and private arrangements, officials
said.
	   Margaret Brazier _ a director of the Institute of Medicine, Law
and Bioethics at Manchester University, who led the research team
that compiled the report _ said the current law was too vague, with
expenses covering too wide a spectrum.
	   Brazier's team recommended that only ``genuine'' expenses be
allowed, covering areas such as loss of earnings, maternity costs
and expenditures on healthy food.
	   Kim Cotton, Britain's first surrogate mother, who was paid 6,500
(dlrs 11,000) in 1985 to have a baby for an infertile couple, said
she was disappointed in the report.
	   ``In an ideal world, fertility treatments and surrogacy would be
free, but it's not an ideal world,'' said Cotton, who founded an
organization supporting surrogacy deals. ``Some couples want to pay
a surrogate, and many of these women want to be paid. How can you
possibly regulate and police such an expenses system?''
	   The government said surrogacy agencies that do not comply with
the new code of practice would be prosecuted, but that surrogate
mothers and commissioning couples would not.
	   There still should be no compulsion for a surrogate mother to
give up the child she has borne for a commissioning couple, the
report said.

Rebel army commander reinstated in Papua New Guinea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Former army commander
Jerry Singirok has been reinstated as commander of Papua New
Guinea's defense forces, Prime Minister Bill Skate announced
Wednesday.
	   Brig. Gen. Singirok was dismissed as army commander after
leading an army revolt in March 1997 to expel mercenaries hired by
the former government of Sir Julius Chan to end the 10-year-old
secessionist conflict on Bougainville island.
	   Skate said his Cabinet had decided to re-appoint Singirok as
commander of the defense forces, replacing Brig. Gen. Leo Nuia.
	   ``This decision is in the best interest of Papua New Guinea as a
nation and is especially important at the time when confidence and
morale within the defense force has dropped to a point of critical
concern,'' Skate said.
	   Skate told reporters later he did not have confidence in Nuia
and could not work with him.
	   In its report last month, an inquiry into the Chan government's
contract with mercenary company Sandline International exonerated
Singirok of trying to overthrow the Chan government.
	   But the inquiry also found that Singirok had accepted 31,000
British pounds (dlrs 52,700) in payments from British-based
military supply company J and S Franklin while he was defense force
commander from November 1995 to March 1997.
	   The inquiry said the payments ``amounted to bribes, financial
inducements or secret commissions.''

Top suspect in custody pleads innocent to new war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Croat leader accused
of instigating the widespread persecution and killings of at least
100 Bosnian Muslims pleaded innocent to new war crimes charges
Wednesday.
	   Dario Kordic, the most senior war crimes suspect in U.N.
custody, entered innocent pleas to a broadened Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal indictment which includes nine new counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity, bringing the total charges against him
from 13 to 22.
	   Nattily dressed in a dark suit and yellow tie, Kordic, 37,
initially was indicted in 1995 along with four other defendants
suspected in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims in the Lasva
Valley between 1991 and 1994.
	   Their alleged crimes were committed on such a large and
widespread scale that the Bosnian Muslim civilian population ``was
substantially reduced and relocated,'' read the indictment.
	   Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said the amended indictment was
necessary since the original indictment was issued almost three
years ago. Since then, new evidence and witnesses have emerged. A
few planned witnesses have also dropped out.
	   ``The basic allegations and charges are the same,'' said
Blewitt, adding it was a matter of ``refining the document.''
	   Named in the same indictment is Mario Cerkez, 39, a Bosnian
Croat military commander, who also pleaded innocent Wednesday to 12
new counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He now faces
22 counts, up from the initial 10.
	   ``Absolutely not guilty,'' a defiant Cerkez said as each count
against him was read.
	   Both men pleaded innocent in their initial arraignments in
October 1997. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   The amended indictment, extends the period covered by the
initial indictment and describes in great detail the power and
authority of both defendants.
	   It also recounts extensively an alleged campaign of terror in
which men, women and children were beaten, sexually assaulted and
killed and their homes and mosques torched, shelled or dynamited.
	   In many cases, the victims were asleep and the attacks carried
out under cover of darkness, prosecutors allege.
	   ``At least 100 defenseless Bosnian Muslim civilians, including
women, children, the elderly and the infirm, were killed and many
wounded or harmed in their homes or yards,'' the indictment reads.
	   According to the indictment, Kordic was an influential
politician who became the vice president of the former Bosnian
Croat state of Herceg-Bosna.
	   He was an ``integral and important figure in the whole
campaign,'' read the amended indictment.
	   Cerkez was the commander of the Croatian Defense Council
brigade, based in the central Bosnian city of Vitez, which was
actively involved in the wide-scale persecution, according to the
indictment.
	   Prosecutors say not only are they individually responsible for
the alleged crimes, but they are also culpable for the actions of
their subordinates.
	   Two other defendants in the Lasva Valley indictment, Bosnian
Croat Gen. Tihomir Blaskic and prison commander Zlatko Aleksovski,
are already standing trial separately before the tribunal.

Robson: Gazza's treatment is for stress and depression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Alcohol was a contributing factor
but Paul Gascoigne's treatment in a specialist clinic was mainly
for ``stresses and depression'', his team manager, Bryan Robson,
said Wednesday.
	   The Middlesbrough manager said Gascoigne would be out of action
for a indefinite period and made an appeal Wednesday for the
embattled former England star to be allowed to undergo
rehabilitation in privacy.
	   ``I have spent all weekend with Paul and I know what he's been
through,'' Robson said.
	   ``I know how helpful the doctors and consultants are and he's in
the best possible hands. Paul took it on himself, with my help, to
go into hospital and take on treatment.
	   ``Alcohol is part of it, but I think what people have got to
realize is that Paul has had a lot of stresses, a bit of depression
and personal problems which he's found difficult to cope with.''
	   Gascoigne's admission to the clinic in Roehampton, south-west of
London, has dominated the British media. The national tabloids
reported the 31-year-old had checked himself into the ``drying
out'' clinic over the weekend after another drunken bender.
	   Gazza was involved in a spate of alcohol-related incidents last
week which culminated in his admission to the clinic.
	   He reportedly returned from a Middlesbrough team trip to Ireland
and was found drunk and sobbing at a train station. Earlier he
allegedly crashed the team bus and reportedly ran naked through the
club's training facility.
	   Gazza has been followed by controversy since he was axed from
the England national team by Glenn Hoddle on the eve of the France
'98 World Cup for being ``unfit''.
	   His axing followed reports of his drunken behavior in nightclubs
in England and Spain in the leadup to tournament.
	   The England manager later slated Gascoigne in a World Cup book,
revealing how the player went beserk and smashed up a hotel room
when he was given the news of his axing.
	   In the meantime, one of his closest friends died after a night
out with Gascoigne and his stormy two-year marriage ended when his
wife Sheryl was granted a ``quickie'' divorce on the grounds of
what was described as his unreasonable behavior.
	   Robson said Gascoigne had been finding it difficult to cope with
recent strains in his personal life. ``It all came to a head on
Friday when he felt he needed help,'' the Middlesbrough manager
said.
	   ``I think it's been a build up over the last six-month period _
the high media spotlight he's been in,'' Robson said.
	   He said Gascoigne's recovery time was ``indefinite'' and he
would not be pressured by Middlesbrough into an early return to
soccer.

Paris gets first new subway line in 60 years

	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris gets its first new subway line in more than
60 years Thursday, a high-speed, fully automated line that will
shuttle commuters from southeast Paris to the center.
	   The 6.1 billion franc (dlrs 1.1 billion) Meteor line, to be
inaugurated Thursday by President Jacques Chirac, will connect the
Tolbiac-Massena area on the Left Bank with the Madeleine, the
bustling Right Bank business district, in less than 10 minutes.
	   Until now, that commute could take up to 45 minutes.
	   The new line, the city's 14th, is the first to provide direct
transportation to residents of the eastern half of the 13th
arrondissement, or district.
	   It stops at the new National Library on the Avenue de France
before crossing the Seine and stopping at the Bercy Sports Stadium,
the Gare de Lyon and Chatelet, where commuters can change to other
lines.
	   It is the lynchpin of a vast urban renewal project overhauling
the long-neglected, blue-collar neighborhood in southeastern Paris.
	   Subway traffic will be regulated by computers _ there will be no
drivers on the line _ to allow a rapid flow at rush hour. The
individual cars are open-ended, for reasons of passenger comfort
and safety.
	   The cars will hold up to 122 passengers and can travel up to 40
kilometers per hour (25 mph).
	   Unlike most stations in the Paris metro, the new stations are
light and airy, and each one has its own distinctive design.
	   Walls at the National Library stop, for example, are decorated
with a quotation from the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, ``The sun
is young every day.''
	   Extra-wide escalators and stairways take commuters down more
than 18 meters (54 feet) below ground. Long corridors and dark,
remote corners have been eliminated to increase security.
	   In 1999, Meteor will hook up to the RER line C, one of four
high-speed suburban lines cutting through the city.

Education minister promises improvements to protesting students

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Education Minister Claude Allegre said Wednesday
the leftist government ``has heard'' protesting students who took
to the streets of France twice this week and is working to meet
their demands for better conditions.
	   Meanwhile Paris police braced for a new protest march on
Thursday, warning store owners along the route to lock up and
ordering students to stay in line.
	   ``I think it is logical for the young, when there are needs,
when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are overcrowded,
to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said at the close
of the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   The government ``has heard'' the students ``and I'm doing what I
can to give this to them,'' he said.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, Allegre presented his plan to spread
teachers out more equitably around the country, a decree that
bypasses the parliamentary process. On Tuesday, he said the plan
aims at ``putting a teacher in front of every student.''
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself a former
education minister, hailed the plan, saying it would bring about
``very rapid improvements.''
	   It was presented as high school students mobilized for their
third demonstration Thursday.
	   Paris police headquarters asked students to scrupulously respect
the march route -- from Place de la Nation, in eastern Paris, to
the Education Ministry on the Left Bank. Police advised residents
to park their cars elsewhere and told store owners along the route
they'd best lock up to avoid pillaging and property damage.
	   Some 10,000 students marched Monday to demand smaller classes
and better resources. But ``uncontrollable elements did not
hesitate to damage property,'' police said, noting that 13 people
had been detained.
	   Allegre promised that a plan to lighten the course load for high
school students would be presented in November.
	   Elsewhere, there were signs the students had a sympathetic ear.
	   Some 450 high students managed to collect 6,000 francs (dlrs
1,090) from drivers on the A-64 highway in Muret, 30 kms (nearly 20
miles) from Toulouse, police there said. The money is to pay their
transport to Toulouse on Thursday for a new demonstration.
	   Even some teachers were beginning to root for protesting
students. One of the largest teacher's unions called on Tuesday for
its members to show solidarity with their protesting students.

Australia's central bank says international financial system needs
</HEADLINE>
changes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The crisis in financial markets that has spread
around the world has shown that changes must be made to the
international financial system, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor
Ian MacFarlane said Wednesday.
	   He said greater openness and burden-sharing with the private
sector are needed to rectify what many observers now say is a
``basically unstable'' system.
	   In a speech to the East Asia Economic Summit in Singapore, he
noted that the currencies of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia
fell sharply at the start of Asia's currency crisis as short-term
lenders ``knew that if they could get their money out fast enough
they would minimize currency losses and loan losses.''
	   ``Something clearly has to be done in terms of managing the
crisis to reduce the incentives for everyone to try to be the first
one out of the door,'' MacFarlane said. He said that could involve
debt rollovers, reschedulings and, in extreme cases, debt-to-equity
swaps.
	   MacFarlane recommended a pre-established system involving
cooperation between the host country, private lenders and the
International Monetary Fund. The conditions for withdrawing capital
should be specified in loan documentation, he said.
	   That would increase the cost of borrowing by emerging-market
countries, but is preferable to the ``excessive lending followed by
capital flight that we have seen over the past few years,'' he
said.
	   MacFarlane said that over the past five years it became too
cheap for emerging-market economies to borrow, and too much
borrowing was done.
	   He said the spread of the Asian crisis shows that contagion is a
much stronger force than was formerly thought. He described
contagion as an essentially irrational force that tars large groups
of countries with the same brush, and causes fear to overrule
reason.
	   The experience has also shown it was incorrect to believe the
root cause of the turmoil in Asia was inadequacy of financial
infrastructures and governance in some formerly rapidly growing
Asian countries, he said.
	   MacFarlane warned it will not be easy to implement changes to
the international financial system because there are still big
differences of opinion about how serious the problem is.

Palestinian Securities Exchange faces possible collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Securities Exchange, once
hailed as a symbol of fledgling Palestinian independence, faces
collapse after only 20 months of operation, the managing director
said Wednesday.
	   Trading has dropped sharply since the start of the year because
investors have lost confidence and because the Palestinian
Authority has failed to pass the necessary regulations, said the
managing director, Safwan Bataineh, a Wall Street veteran and
former economic adviser to Jordanian prime ministers.
	   ``If this continues, the stock market will collapse because
companies are losing money,'' Bataineh told The Associated Press.
	   Bataineh said he submitted his resignation to the board of
directors last week in protest over the failure of the Palestinian
Authority to pass laws that would require companies to make their
financial information public.
	   Bataineh said the lack of movement in the peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians has also scared away business people
afraid to invest in an unstable area.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Finance
Ministry.
	   Bataineh said that daily trading was about dlrs 1 million at the
start of the year, and was now down to about dlrs 140,000.
	   In February 1997, the Palestinian stock market opened to a round
of applause from Palestinians hopeful it would bring enough foreign
investment to give their economy a boost. At that time, Bataineh
said the Palestinian economy could attract as much as dlrs 1
billion a year, if Middle East peacemaking is firmly on track.
	   The stock market held symbolic significance for Palestinians who
viewed it not only as a way to help their economy, but as another
signpost on the way to statehood.

British hostages in Chechnya alive, Chechen president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Three Britons and a New Zealander taken
hostage in Chechnya are alive but Chechen authorities do not know
where they are being held, a Polish official said Wednesday.
	   The four employees of British Telecom were in Chechnya
installing a cellular telephone system and were taken hostage Oct.
3 after a gang shoot-out with their bodyguards.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has described the telecom
workers as ``unwise'' because authorities were not notified of
their presence in the republic, said Mariusz Kaminski, a Polish
parliament member.
	   According to Kaminski, Maskhadov said he had information
indicating the hostages were alive, but their whereabouts was
unknown. He said the president didn't elaborate on the information
he had.
	   Kaminski, who helped organize Maskhadov's five-day visit to
Poland this week to attend a human rights conference, said crime in
Chechnya is ``fanned from the outside by enemies of independent
Chechnya.''
	   The hostages were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers who had been held for 14
months.
	   The British Embassy in Moscow has identified the four men as
Peter William Kennedy, Darren Eamonn Hickey, and Rudolf
Franz-Joseph Petschi, and New Zealander Stanley Frederick James
Shaw.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but
during his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in
kidnapping and other crime.
	   The conference, organized by the upper house of parliament,
hosts some 600 human rights activists from 40 countries, including
expelled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng and former Soviet
dissident Sergei Kovalyov.
	   On Tuesday, Maskhadov discussed economic cooperation with the
leader of the Solidarity bloc, Marian Krzaklewski.
	   Krzaklewski said the president of the break-away republic was
interested in investment of Polish companies in Chechnya and Polish
experience in transition from state socialism to a free market.
	   He said Russia should not object to possible Chechen economic
cooperation with other countries because it was allowed by a peace
treaty signed with the republic.
	   No country has recognized Chechnya's claims of independence, and
Russia still considers it a semi-autonomous Russian republic.

Russians in Far East fall ill from forest-fire smoke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Smoke from forest fires raging in the Russian Far
East gathered over large cities Wednesday, and scores of people
sought medical help after breathing high concentrations of carbon
monoxide, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Children in the Khabarovsk region have fainted in schools. A
local highway has been closed to traffic because of high smoke
levels. Local airline flights have been canceled. Residents have
been advised to stay indoors as much as possible and close windows
tightly, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The United Nations also sounded the alarm, saying that the fires
may threaten several of the region's endangered species, including
the Amur tiger, of which fewer than 500 are believed to exist.
	   The massive output of carbon dioxide and heat may also lead to
global warming and other climatic changes, said a report issued
Tuesday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs.
	   On Wednesday, the levels of carbon monoxide exceeded the maximum
permissible concentration in the region's largest cities _
Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur _ and several smaller towns of
the Khabarovsk region, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   In the past few weeks, levels of carbon monoxide have
occasionally reached 24 times the norm, the United Nations said in
the report published Tuesday.
	   Economic damage from the fires is estimated at 400 million
rubles (dlrs 25.5 million), the U.N. report said. Some 79.2 million
rubles (dlrs 5 million) have been spent on fire-fighting.
	   Firefighters have been unable to control the blazes because of
severe funding shortages and an unusually dry summer. The fires may
burn until snow or rain extinguishes them, officials said.

Yemen executes convicted murderer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man convicted of murder was publicly
executed in southern Yemen, the daily Al-Thawra reported Wednesday.
	   Khaled Mohammad Saleh was shot to death by firing squad in the
southern province of Ibb on Tuesday.
	   He was convicted of murdering Ali bin Ali al-Saadi and Ali
Mohammad Saleh, the Arabic-language paper said. It gave no details
or say what the motive was.
	   The victims' families, court officials and a crowd of onlookers
witnessed the execution in a public square, the paper said.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, imposes the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example and are
usually carried out by firing squad.

Radio-activity: EU tightens controls on eastern European mushrooms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission said Wednesday
it will step up controls on imports of mushrooms from eastern
Europe as many of them have been found to be radio-actively
contaminated.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive branch, said Austria, Germany
and France reported last month the arrival on their territory of
mushrooms containing levels of radioactivity in excess of
maximum-permitted levels in the EU.
	   These shipments came from Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Belarus
and Ukraine, but all eastern European countries are liable to send
contaminated mushrooms, EU spokesman Augustin Janssens said.
	   He said the contamination is a direct result of the 1986
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine, which polluted
the soil.
	   The Commission urged the exporting countries to carry out
``rigorous controls'' of their exports to the EU. If they fail to
do so, they could face ``severe restrictions'' on their exports to
the 15-nation bloc.
	   In the meantime, there will be specific entry points for the
mushroom imports from eastern Europe into the EU to make controls
easier.
	   The EU imposed tight rules on eastern European mushrooms shortly
after the Chernobyl accident. At the time, it set a figure for the
maximum permitted concentration of radioactivity in the mushrooms.

Morocco releases 28 political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP)_ Dozens of political prisoners were freed
from Moroccan prisons overnight, a day after the government pledged
their release, a judicial source said Wednesday.
	   Twenty-eight prisoners were released in total _ 17 from a prison
in Casablanca, eight from Kinitra, two from Fez and one from
Benslimane, the source, based in Kinitra, said on condition of
anonymity.
	   At a news conference Monday, Driss Dahak, president of Morocco's
official human rights council, had announced that 28 remaining
political prisoners would soon be freed by royal pardon, without
specifying a date.
	   Neither the state-run television station nor the official press
agency announced the releases Tuesday night, as is usually done
when prisoners are freed by royal pardon.
	   Though the government kept its promise of releasing 28
prisoners, the Moroccan Association for Human Rights believes that
other political prisoners are still in jail, said Abdelilah
Benabdeslam, a member of the group's central office.
	   ``They spoke of 28 prisoners, but ... we believe that there are
36,'' said Benabdeslam, who himself was a political prisoner.
	   This week the government admitted for the first time that 56 of
the 112 political opponents missing since the 1960s were dead. The
announcement came without elaboration, angering many family members
and human rights groups.
	   For years, Morocco was known to maintain secret detention
centers in Rabat and Casablanca, as well as an internment camp in
the south. Most of those detained were leftists, though many
members of the military were arrested after a foiled coup in 1972.

Comments by Japanese official fan economic unease
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nonaka reversing earlier statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With advisers warning that Japan's economy needs 10
trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion) in new stimulus just to break even,
a senior official added to unease Wednesday by saying recovery may
take longer than expected.
	   Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka later backtracked to say a
turnaround will take one or two years, as the government had
previously said.
	   Meanwhile, the bad news continued to roll in as a research
agency reported that the debt left behind by a rising number of
bankruptcies in September reached a postwar high of 3 trillion yen
(dlrs 25 billion).
	   ``We think the economy will recover in two or three years,''
Nonaka was initially quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency.
	   The agency later quoted him as telling reporters he had meant to
say ``a year or two.''
	   Tokyo has already played down hopes for a quick end to Japan's
deepest recession since World War II.
	   Last week, the government revised downward its economic forecast
for the fiscal year ending March 31, predicting an 1.8 percent
contraction instead of the previously forecast growth of 1.9
percent.
	   An advisory economic panel to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi urged
the government to inject trillions of yen (billions of dollars)
into the country's debt-laden banks and approve the additional
stimulus spending.
	   Acknowledging the severe state of the economy, the Economic
Strategy Council report said the money was needed to stabilize the
financial system and bring the economy to the zero-growth level.
	   The stimulus spending should include both public works spending
and reductions in corporate and income taxes, the panel said.
	   That would come in addition to more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 50
billion) in corporate and income tax cuts that the government has
already promised by next fiscal year.
	   Also Wednesday, the newspaper Sankei reported that a government
panel was expected to conclude that the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. is insolvent after its recent inspection of the
bank.
	   Nonaka, however, played down the story, saying that he had
received no such report. The LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders,
has been rumored to be on the verge of collapse since summer.
	   Corporate bankruptcies rose 17.9 percent from the same month
last year to 1,518 cases, private credit research agency Teikoku
Databank Ltd. said.
	   The major reason for September's surge in bankruptcy debt was
the massive failure of Japan Leasing Corp., a financial affiliate
of LTCB.

	   ANOGIA, Greece (AP) _ Rebellion runs through the bloodline of
this village high in the mountains of Crete.
	   Some myths place Anogia near the birthplace of Zeus, who
dethroned his father to rule over the ancient gods. More recently,
the village has been burned three times by occupiers.
	   Now its residents are standing up to what they see as a new
threat: merging the community with its hated rival.
	   Waving guns and shouting their defiance, villagers refused for a
second time Wednesday to hold elections held in the rest of the
country for new mayors and regional governors.
	   Old men with handlebar moustaches and in traditional Cretan
dress of black shirts, boots and headcloths blocked authorities
from setting up ballot boxes. A similar protest Sunday _ election
day in the rest of the nation _ forced a postponement of the vote.
Election authorities have not decided if they will try a third time
for a vote.
	   The residents of Anogia are furious at demands to consolidate
their municipality with the smaller neighboring village of Zoniana
as part of a government program to streamline local government.
	   The merger has reignited a clan battle that has seen a string of
murders and scores of attacks over the years. Although the
animosity is strong, the roots of the feuds are vague. Some people
say it stems from some collaboration with Nazi occupiers. Others
say the bad blood reaches back even further.
	   Other towns around Greece also boycotted or disrupted Sunday
voting over the unpopular municipal unification plan. But the
epicenter of discontent is Anogia, a village of 3,000 people about
25 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Iraklion.
	   Anogia residents claim the merger will end its status as one of
the five Greek towns especially honored for resistance against the
Nazis during World War II.
	   ``We believe union with the other village will dilute our
historic identity,'' said Myron Fassoulas, head of the village
protest committee.
	   What appears to be a surreal dispute to the rest of Greece is
deadly serious on Psiloriti, also known Mount Ida, where some myths
say Zeus was born and raised.
	   Many Cretan village men still carry guns. Authorities, fearing
for their own safety, generally stay out of feuds.
	   Traditional violence _ once based mostly on family honor _ has
worsened due to the island's illicit drug trade and the thousands
of guns flooding in from Albania.
	   Burly young men in thick beards and wearing camouflage hunting
gear joined Wednesday's protest. One let off a few rounds from his
machine gun.
	   ``We have no riches,'' said one older man, who just gave his
name as Kleanthis. ``What we have is this, the honor left to us by
our fathers. We will defend it. We are all willing to take up our
guns. We are all in agreement, even the young children.''
	   Anogia was burned to the ground twice by the Turks during the
19th century uprising against the Ottoman Empire. In 1944, Anogia
was razed by the Nazis, who also shot scores of men.
	   Many of the elders who survived the massacre still hold a strong
influence over its young men, who continue the traditions of guns
and vendettas.
	   A gun battle broke out earlier this month between the villages
over grazing ground boundaries, followed by tit-for-tat shootings
this week. So far, no one has been killed in the latest skirmishes.
	   But the elders who normally step in to calm tempers are now too
angry themselves.
	   In Zoniana, residents were at first willing to go along with the
merger. But they turned against it after Anogia objected.
	   In Sunday's elections, Zoniana voters cast ballots for other
regional seats but abstained from choosing a mayor for the merged
municipality. One person cast a mayoral vote, but they believe it
was an old woman who marked it by mistake.
	   ``We must not join even if it means having to die,'' said
Zoniana's community head, Costas Papasyris.

	   SAN REMO, Italy (AP) _ Overnight leader Tommi Makinen guided his
Mitsubishi to a narrow victory in the San Remo Rally despite a
cautious third leg Wednesday, keeping alive his chances for a
repeat world title.
	   The Finn saw his comfortable time advantage shrink during the
day's 329.16 kilometers (204.08 miles), including six special
stages, into this riviera resort, but held on to beat runner-up
Piero Liatti, an Italian with the Subaru team, by 15.08 seconds.
	   Mikanen's total time for the three legs was 4 hours, 34 minutes,
34.5 seconds.
	   The victory, worth 10 points in the season standings, gave him
48, just two behind leader Carlos Sainz of Spain. The Toyota driver
finished fourth in San Remo, 1:31.9 off the pace. He was just 1.7
seconds behind third-place finisher Colin McRae.
	   There are two rallies left on 13-event calendar, in Australia
Nov. 5-8 and Britain's RAC Nov. 21-24

Twenty known hooligans already turned back; dozen arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Twenty known hooligans already were on their
way back to England Wednesday and a dozen more English fans were
arrested prior to the kickoff of the Euro 2000 qualifier between
Luxembourg and England.
	   About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high
alert throughout the day, outnumbered by about 2,500 English soccer
fans pouring into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy.
	   The last two visits of England in 1977 and 1983 were marred by
crowd violence, when unruly mobs damaged Josy Barthel national
stadium then rampaged through the streets, demolishing cars and
storefronts.
	   On Tuesday, two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels
airport in neighboring Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because
their names were on police lists of known hooligans. Six were send
back to England, the rest were to be expelled by the end of the
day, Lt. Eric Froidmont of the Belgian gendarmes said.
	   Early Wednesday, police in Luxembourg said they'd arrested about
a dozen drunken fans in the capital and on the border with Belgium.
Police spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd be released
after the game.
	   So far this year, a trail of destruction has followed the
English team. In France, riots with locals, particularly North
African youths in the port city of Marseille, erupted during the
World Cup. Violence again marred England's European qualifier with
Sweden in Stockholm last month when the Swedes won 2-1 and fans
began tearing apart a section of Rasunda Stadium.
	   In Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 fitted between France,
Belgium and Germany, police have warned shopkeepers in the capital
of possible violence and many planned to close their shops early.
	   ``You can see there are fewer people in town, they've afraid to
come downtown,'' said Isilda Moreira in her smart fashion store.
``We all know this lot are more aggressive than other supporters.''
	   Moreira was keeping her store open as usual, but the next-door
grocers had the shutters down with and a handwritten sign in the
window ``Closed because of the soccer.''
	   England already is 0-1-1 in European qualifying and another
disappointment against the amateurs from Luxembourg would have a
devastating effect.
	   Fears are the English fans could take it out on the town.
	   Police have long prepared for the encounter. Cooperation with
the border authorities in Belgium and France was increased and a
half dozen spotters from British police will accompany the fans.
	   After the match, the fans who came by train could have to sit
out the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport will be
available until the morning.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A plea for racial equality written
during South Africa's apartheid struggle has become a stumbling
block for a merger between a major white church and its nonwhite
counterpart.
	   Delegates from the Dutch Reformed Church, which once told its
members that the Bible ordained white minority rule, deliberated
Wednesday whether to desegregate by merging with a nonwhite sister
church.
	   The mixed-race Uniting Reformed Church says it will only accept
its white counterpart if it approves a plea, called the Confession
of Belhar, that calls for social justice and racial equality.
	   The church that formed the religious backbone of white minority
rule appeared reluctant to do that.
	   ``My hope and prayer is that it will go through,'' said delegate
Piet Meiring. ``But I doubt it.''
	   Some delegates said they felt they were being forced to sanction
a theologically unacceptable document rooted in outdated
anti-apartheid history. Delegate Piet Strauss said he could accept
the Confession of Belhar, but not as part of church doctrine.
	   Uniting Reformed Church leader James Buys said he suspected
racism kept white church members from accepting the merger
conditions.
	   Delegate Schalk van Wyk urged the gathering to approve the
Confession of Belhar.
	   ``It makes it possible to take up the cross and follow Jesus and
listen to the pain of a lot of people,'' van Wyk said.
	   The delegates were to vote on the issue later Wednesday.
	   Outgoing Dutch Reformed Church leader Freek Swanepoel told The
Associated Press his church should accept the Confession of Belhar
``because it came out of the heart of Christians.''
	   On Tuesday, nearly all 400 delegates at the white church's
national meeting, held once every four years, approved a resolution
denouncing apartheid as ``sinful.''
	   By adopting the resolution, the Dutch Reformed Church
reactivated its membership in the 75 million strong World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, comprised of reformed and Presbyterian
churches. The world body had suspended the Dutch Reformed Church's
membership in 1982 because it violated teachings of the Bible.
	   Starting in 1982, the 1.5 million member white church, the main
religious denomination of Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers,
gradually renounced its hard-line position but kept separate
branches for blacks, mixed-race and Indian congregants.
	   In 1994, when apartheid ended with the country's first all-race
elections, the black and mixed-race branches merged to become the
1.5 million member Uniting Reformed Church.

Primakov warns of `difficult' time ahead for Russia

Bank proposing to increase gold reserves in new three final grafs.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday
that Russia was facing one of the ``most difficult and complex
periods in its history'' and there was no easy way out of the
current economic crisis.
	   Primakov's glum assessment was delivered in a speech to the
Federation Council, the upper chamber of parliament. He said the
government was preparing for hardship this winter and had recently
established an emergency food reserve.
	   The government has earmarked dlrs 600 million to build up a
reserve that could last for two weeks and cover the needs of a
third of Russia's population, Primakov said. The food would be
primarily for ``special consumers'' and ``certain regions,'' an
apparent reference to poorly-fed soldiers and isolated communities.
	   ``The population will have secure supplies of fruits and
vegetables,'' Primakov said. But, he added, ``I must honestly say
that we have limited resources.''
	   No serious food shortages are expected, but the plan shows the
government is concerned that conditions could worsen.
	   Primakov, who has been in office for more than a month, said his
top priorities were to repay overdue wages, restructure the banking
system and revise the country's unwieldy tax system.
	   ``Russia is now passing through one of the most difficult and
complex periods in its history,'' Primakov said. ``We must combine
the efforts of the government and regional leaders to get out of
the crisis.''
	   One of the biggest problems is unpaid wages to millions of
workers, many of them state employees. The central government says
in many cases it has allocated the money to regional officials,
only to see the funds diverted for other uses.
	   Primakov accused regional officials of turning a blind eye to
the misuse of government subsidies, and called on them to tighten
controls over how money is spent.
	   The billions of rubles (dollars) in unpaid wages and pensions
across Russia are ``a social time bomb placed under our state,''
Primakov said.
	   The Federation Council is made up of regional governors who have
substantial power in their home territories.
	   Primakov also reiterated that the government has no plans to ban
the circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies in
Russia.
	   However, the Central Bank has tightened controls over the
currency market in an effort to shore up the embattled ruble.
	   The ruble rose sharply Wednesday to 13 to the dollar, compared
to 15 the previous day. Analysts said that the Russian commercial
banks had pushed the rate up by selling dollars in an effort to
limit their losses on contracts concluded with foreigners before
the crisis hit two months ago, when the ruble traded at around 6 to
the dollar.
	   Some Cabinet officials have said the government will have to
print money to solve its debts if the foreign aid doesn't come _ a
move certain to trigger high inflation.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko voiced skepticism
Wednesday about the government's ability to meet its plan of
raising 70 billion rubles (dlrs 5.4 billion) in revenues in the
fourth quarter of 1998. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov also
sounded pessimistic, saying the sharp drop in imports would make it
harder for the government to collect the planned amount of taxes.
	   Gerashchenko said that the Central Bank may build up its gold
reserves to back a boost in the money supply.

Swiss beef up security at barracks set aside for refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities on Wednesday assigned
private security guards to barracks earmarked to house refugees,
mainly from Kosovo, after a device exploded overnight at one of the
centers.
	   The explosion at the empty barracks in Bronschhofen, eastern
Switzerland, caused no injuries and little damage.
	   But authorities announced that Bronschhofen and two similar
centers set aside to receive some 470 refugees will be given extra
security with immediate effect.
	   Justice Minister Arnold Koller described the attack as an ``act
of cowardice.'' There was no information on any claim of
responsibility.
	   The centers, due to open next week, are intended to relieve
Switzerland's existing refugee centers.
	   Some 26,000 people applied for asylum in Switzerland in the
first nine months of this year. More than 40 percent of them were
from the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid
convoys Wednesday to ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo, but many
remained afraid to return home and NATO said Slobodan Milosevic
hadn't yet carried through on his agreement to end the crackdown.
	   Also Wednesday, the advance party of what is expected to be a
2,000-member ``ground verification mission'' arrived in Kosovo from
neighboring Macedonia to make sure Milosevic honors the agreement.
	   At NATO, an official said a number of Yugoslav units remain dug
in in Kosovo and must be withdrawn, including a ``notorious''
special police unit. He declined to say how many troops remain in
the province but said they ``far exceed'' the level required by
NATO.
	   ``NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted by Milosevic,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other officials
noted that NATO planes were arriving at forward bases in Italy.
	   Britain's foreign secretary warned the Yugoslav leader again
that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs down on the
agreement, reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, to withdraw
forces from Kosovo, begin peace talks with separatist ethnic
Albanians and allow some 2,000 monitors into the troubled Serb
province to verify compliance.
	   Those steps are designed to end the seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian separatists, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left some 300,000 refugees homeless. NATO gave
Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply or face airstrikes.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday before Milosevic
bowed to international demands. U.N. officials said many refugees
were still hiding in the hills and forests, fearing Serb reprisals
if they go home.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' a U.N.
spokesman, Kris Janowski, said. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   In order to build such confidence, the Holbrooke agreement
provides for about 2,000 international monitors to be stationed in
Kosovo. But the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the ``verification mission,'' has no pool
of monitors and must ask its 54 member governments to provide them.
	   OSCE officials say it could take weeks before the full
complement is in the province. OSCE expects to receive offers of
personnel by next week.
	   ``I'm not worried about their safety right now,'' Holbrooke said
in an interview Wednesday with CNN. ``I'm worried that the
international community will be too slow and leisurely in getting
them there, and they'll take six months to get there when we need
them there in six days or at least six weeks.''
	   In the meantime, American, Canadian and European members of the
50-member Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission returned Wednesday to
form the advance party of the ground monitor force. Russian members
of the team are expected shortly, a diplomatic source said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The diplomatic observers had been working in Kosovo since July
but were evacuated last week for fear of Serb reprisals if NATO
attacked.
	   In the hills about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
Pristina, some refugees said Wednesday that they don't trust
Milosevic and have no confidence in the ability of unarmed monitors
to guarantee their safety.

Outgoing government welcomes Kosovo agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The outgoing government on Wednesday
welcomed an agreement easing the threat of airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, but warned that the western allies were prepared to act
with force if Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic breaks the deal.
	   ``The threat of military action still stands,'' said government
spokesman Otto Hauser.
	   With Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's approval, the outgoing
Cabinet on Monday approved deployment of 14 Tornado fighters to
participate in any NATO attack aimed at forcing Milosevic to
withdraw weapons from Kosovo province.
	   The old parliament meets Friday to vote on German participation
in any NATO strikes.
	   Milosevic has until then to meet terms of an agreement reached
with international negotiators: withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin
peace talks with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow armed
monitors to verify compliance.
	   The deal also includes aerial surveillance. The Foreign Ministry
said it had not been decided if German planes would participate in
that mission.

Indian teacher wins Nobel for economics

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, a scholar from India whose
work produced a new understanding of the catastrophes that plague
society's poorest people, won the Nobel Economics Prize on
Wednesday.
	   Sen (whose first name is pronounced Ah-MAR-tya) was awarded the
prestigious prize for his contributions to welfare economics, which
help explain the economic mechanisms underlying famines and
poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
	   ``I was surprised and quite pleased when I got the call,'' Sen,
64, said in New York. ``But I was even more pleased when they told
me the subject matter was welfare economics, a field I have long
been very involved in. I am pleased that they gave recognition to
that subject.''
	   Sen ``has restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of
vital economic problems,'' the Nobel citation said.
	   The 64-year-old economist joined Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge this year after teaching at Harvard University, among
other institutions. He has studied the Bangladesh famine of 1974
and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the countries of
the Sahara.
	   The award comes just a month after the image of last year's
winners, Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, was tarnished
by the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund in which they were
partners. Merton and Scholes were honored for their work on valuing
risky ``derivatives'' investments such as stock options.
	   Sen works in development economics, the study of the welfare of
the world's poorest people. His best-known work, detailed in his
1981 book ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and
Deprivation,'' challenges the common view that the shortage of food
is the most important explanation of famine.
	   Sen downplayed his Nobel achievement, saying there were many
others who deserved the prize and he wished he could share it with
them. Sen was in New York to attend a memorial service Thursday for
Mahbub ul Haq, a former finance minister of India.
	   Looking at several catastrophes, Sen has shown that ``famines
have occurred even when the supply of food was not significantly
lower than during previous years'' without famines, the citation
said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined. Due to
these factors, the real incomes of agricultural workers declined so
much that they were disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes hard economic analysis and broader questions
about the best ways to determine whether poverty is increasing or
decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective
decision-making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of
sociology at the University of Stockholm. ``He cares about the
poorest in society.''
	   Rakesh Mohan, director-general of India's National Council for
Applied Economic Research, praised Sen as ``an unusual economist
who has combined deep concern for human development with the very
fine work in technical economics.''
	   The prize was worth about dlrs 963,000 at the current exchange
rate.
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work.
	   Long-Term Capital Management, the fund in which Merton and
Scholes were partners, needed a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout from banks
after nearly failing. But despite the tarnish on their reputations,
Merton's and Scholes' award-winning theories were not faulty, said
Torsten Persson, a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics.
	   ``They lost money, but this has nothing to do with the prize,''
Persson said.
	   This honor is the only Nobel not established in the will of
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. It was
created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central bank.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The peace prize, the last in this year's series, is to be
announced Friday.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel.

NATO says Milosevic violating peace deal in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance said Wednesday that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not meeting international
demands to restore peace in Kosovo needed to stave off airstrikes.
	   One day after setting the clock ticking, NATO ambassadors agreed
that Milosevic must still show he is ending his crackdown against
Kosovo Albanian separatists by Saturday morning (0500 GMT).
	   The decision to begin punishing strikes, if necessary, ``is
still totally in effect. NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted
by Milosevic,'' said a NATO official, who asked not to be
identified.
	   Compliance with a deal to withdraw forces, begin peace talks
with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into Kosovo ``has
not yet been achieved,'' said the NATO official.
	   Under an agreement worked between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader must withdraw special troops
from Kosovo, allow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo, let
NATO reconnaissance planes fly over the province and sign a deal by
early November outlining future talks with the Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, who are the vast majority in the Serb province.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
expected to sign a deal Thursday in Belgrade to dispatch 2,000
``compliance verifiers.'' NATO was also working on an agreeement
with Yugoslavia for reconnaissance flights over Kosovo to back up
the OSCE ground verification mission.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia early Tuesday by approving an ``activation order'' that
formally placed hundreds of allied warplanes under the command of
the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.
	   The NATO official said Milosevic must withdraw forces, saying a
``number of units'' remain dug in, notably the ``notorious'' 36th
Special Police Unit. The official would not say how many troops are
in Kosovo except they ``far exceed'' the level predating the start
of the violence there in March.
	   NATO officials were keen to point out Wednesday that airstrikes
plans remain active. ``The planes are arriving at their forward
bases in Italy,'' said one official. ``We'll be keeping up the
military pressure for some time to come.''

Parliament fails to pass amendments limiting Yeltsin's powers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament failed Wednesday to gather enough votes
for several Communist-proposed constitutional amendments that would
sharply limit President Boris Yeltsin's powers.
	   The amendments would give the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, control over the appointments and dismissals of key
ministers and security officials and strengthen the parliament's
control over the use of armed forces on Russian territory.
	   Under the current constitution, parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, has the right to approve a prime minister but doesn't
have any say over other Cabinet appointments. Parliament also has
few levers to influence the government's course, including policies
on the use of military force.
	   The proposed amendments received between 190 and 244 votes in
support _ still far short of the required two-thirds majority of
300 votes needed to pass constitutional amendments.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Constitutional Court on Thursday was to
begin considering parliament's inquiry into whether Yeltsin can run
for a third presidential term in 2000, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Russia's Constitution appears to rule that out. But Yeltsin's
aides argue that because his first term began before the
constitution was passed, it should not count toward the two-term
limit.
	   Yeltsin has said he does not plan to run, but parliamentary
opposition wants the court to formally rule on the issue.

IMF executive says world economic motor still ticking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chief executive of the International
Monetary Fund said Wednesday there should be a slight improvement
in global economic fortunes next year spearheaded by Europe and the
United States.
	   Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, predicted world growth
of around 2.5 percent in 1999, creeping up from the recently
revised-down figure for this year of 2 percent.
	   Camdessus was in the Spanish capital to attend the fourth
meeting of the so-called Montevideo Circle, an informal gathering
of top ranking politicians and officials who annually hold a
behind-closed-door brainstorming session on Latin American issues.
	   The IMF chief told reporters that Europe and the United States _
``the two motors of the world economy'' _ were still going strong,
despite some slowdown in America and Great Britain.
	   He said Asia should be able to keep its economic head just above
water, avoiding negative growth next year.
	   Camdessus said the immediate task was to ensure that Latin
America weathered the financial storm that began in Thailand 15
months ago before spreading from Asia to precipitate Russia's
recent collapse.
	   ``It is a vital obligation to prevent the Latin domino from
falling,'' Camdessus said, praising Spain's recent offer to help
fund emergency credits to the region under threat from investor
flight.
	   He said he hoped other European countries with business
interests in Latin America _ such as Italy, France and Germany _
would follow the Spanish example.
	   The IMF and the Brazilian government are putting the final
touches to an emergency three-year package that should be ratified
within weeks, Camdessus said. The package has been estimated to
total dlrs 30 billion.
	   ``Brazil will not collapse,'' he said, adding that Argentina and
Chile were among the keenest to see the IMF reach agreement with
their giant neighbor.
	   Less upbeat about Russia, Camdessus said the Fund was still
working toward a financing package, but that the government still
lacked a program. This, he said, would take time, and appealed to
governments to provide humanitarian aid in the interim.
	   The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling over dlrs 100
billion during what Camdessus called ``the most uncertain year
ever.''
	   He said the crisis has underlined the need for prevention, and
the transformation of the Fund's primary role away from that of
``the firefighter who arrives when the fire is already burning.''
	   Greater private sector involvement in the prevention and
resolution of future economic crisis would help, Camdessus said.
``Now, the private sector tends to run away and leave the work to
the governments,'' he said.
	   Camdessus also said he was aware of recent criticism of
excessive IMF secrecy, but he said his own efforts to open up the
Fund have been blocked by governments demanding discretion.
	   Camdessus said that those who viewed the crisis as a critique of
the Fund's promotion of world economic liberalization were
mistaken. The man who has headed the IMF for 12 years said that it
simply demonstrated the need to carry through liberalization
programs properly.

Netanyahu says he is ready to go `a long way' toward agreement

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday he would go ``a long way'' toward negotiating an
agreement on a West Bank troop pullback a day after declaring there
was no chance for such a deal.
	   Netanyahu made the conflicting statements to different audiences
before a make-or-break Mideast summit with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat at a secluded resort near Washington.
	   After a meeting Wednesday with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in
Amman, Netanyahu said that if Israel's security demands are met,
``we will be willing to go a long way, even very long'' toward a
peace agreement.
	   However, Tuesday evening, in response to the killing of an
Israeli man in a shooting attack blamed on Palestinian militants,
Netanyahu appeared very pessimistic.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   In Amman, more than 400 students at the University of Jordan
held a protest Wednesday after the prime minister's departure,
chanting ``Netanyahu, coward, you are neither a human nor an
animal.''
	   Later Wednesday, Jewish settlers planned a large protest outside
Netanyahu's Jerusalem home.
	   Opponents of a withdrawal deal have become increasingly vocal,
threatening to topple the government and field a challenger to
Netanyahu in the next elections if he signs off on a pullback deal
with the Palestinians.
	   Even two Netanyahu allies in the Cabinet who support a
land-for-peace deal in principle urged the prime minister Wednesday
not to attend the Washington summit.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and Science Minister Silvan
Shalom said Israel would come under intense pressure to make
concessions.
	   ``When so many issues still haven't been concluded, we will be
in a very difficult situation,'' Sharansky said.
	   Israel's new foreign minister, hard-liner Ariel Sharon, said
Israel would stand up to pressure and would not close a deal unless
the Palestinians made good on their security commitments.
	   ``We expect that the government will be sufficiently resolute
and its delegation will be sufficiently strong to insist on the
fulfillment of the commitments,'' Sharon said in a brief
question-and-answer session.
	   Netanyahu has cited nine conditions the Palestinians must
fulfill before he will go ahead with a withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians must arrest suspected Islamic militants,
cooperate with Israel on security matters, reduce their police
force by several thousand, confiscate illegal weapons, extradite
prisoners sought by Israel and annul sections of the PLO charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have noted that an understanding on security
matters was negotiated by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials
last year, and that it was Netanyahu who rejected the deal. The
United States has been trying to work out a new arrangement.
	   One of the sticking points is that the Palestinians demand
reciprocity, saying that if they are to disarm Islamic militants,
then Israel must confiscate the weapons of Jewish extremists.

Milosevic tours quake-struck region of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day after announcing he had agreed
to demands to stop his crackdown in Kosovo, President Slobodan
Milosevic toured a quake-struck region of central Serbia on
Wednesday.
	   ``All this has to be demolished, everything I see here,''
Milosevic said as he pointed toward cracks on several houses in the
Valjevo region, which has been hit by a series of moderate
earthquakes since Sept. 30.
	   State-run TV footage showed a man telling Milosevic: ``You have
defended our Serbia, thank you for coming,'' apparently referring
to his agreement with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke which the Serbs
say averted NATO intervention.
	   Serbia's state-run media carried Wednesday an avalanche of
telegrams of support to Milosevic, praising his ``wise and peaceful
policies.'' The campaign is apparently intended to portray
Milosevic as the real defender of Serb interests.
	   ``Milosevic has not knelt down or bent his spine,'' in the talks
with Holbrooke, the state-run Borba newspaper said.
	   The quake, measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, shook the central
Serbian region on Sept. 30, causing panic but no injuries.
	   It prompted initial fears that NATO was following through on
threats to bomb Yugoslavia for its crackdown on majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. A TV program carried an ``expert'' saying
``the Americans must be behind the quakes'' to punish the Serbs.
	   During the tour, Milosevic was accompanied by top Yugoslav
officials, including the defense and interior ministers.

New German foreign policy team signals continuity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DETLEF RUDEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is
likely to tap two career diplomats with high-profile experience in
the Balkans for key foreign policy posts, sources said Wednesday.
	   Schroeder has pledged continuity in Germany's foreign policy,
and the postings would strengthen his hand before handing the
foreign ministry over to his junior coalition partner, the Greens.
	   He reportedly has chosen Michael Steiner, who served as the
deputy international representative for rebuilding postwar Bosnia,
as his top foreign policy aide in the chancellery.
	   Wolfgang Ischinger, a foreign ministry troubleshooter who helped
negotiate the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia and is Germany's
envoy in Kosovo diplomacy, is in line to move up to deputy
secretary of state.
	   Sources close to Schroeder, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the appointments were likely but not yet official.
	   Schroeder's foreign minister is expected to be Joschka Fischer,
a prominent Green who renounces the party's pacifist past.
	   Steiner, 48, says Germany should take more responsibility on the
world stage. Currently ambassador to the Czech Republic, he is
still upset that outgoing Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel failed to
push him as top civilian envoy for Bosnia when the post opened last
year.
	   ``We finally have to grow up,'' he was quoted as saying in the
newspaper Die Zeit. ``This job wouldn't have hurt Germany.''
	   Ischinger, 52, attended Harvard and Fletcher law schools. The
foreign ministry's political director, he is a familiar figure for
Germany's Western allies and Moscow.
	   Both he and Steiner served under Germany's longtime foreign
minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose tenure spanned governments
of the left and right before he stepped down in 1992.

British parliamentary speaker: Russia will always be a great
</HEADLINE>
nation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Britain is prepared to join the world community in
helping Russia make the transition to a functioning market economy,
the speaker of the British House of Commons said Wednesday.
	   In a meeting with Russia's lower house of parliament, speaker
Betty Boothroyd said she cannot advise Russians on how to solve
their economic problems, but said Great Britain was ready to help,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Saying that Russia is creating ``ways of dealing with challenges
to democracy,'' Boothroyd praised Russia as a ``great nation'' that
has a great ability to overcome incredible adversity, Interfax
said.
	   Boothroyd also met separately with Duma Speaker Gennady
Seleznyov, who reiterated Russia's warning that any agreements with
NATO might be dissolved if the alliance launches airstrikes against
Yugoslavia over the crisis in Kosovo province, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The two speakers also discussed differences between their two
parliamentary bodies. Seleznyov told Boothroyd that the balance of
power between the Russian president and the parliament must be
adjusted.
	   Russia's constitution gives the president wide-ranging power,
while the Duma has relatively little authority.

India agrees to two patent treaties, ends isolation in field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comment from patent expert,
RECASTS graf 11 to CLARIFY India's practice with pharmaceuticals. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India has agreed to abide by two key
treaties protecting inventors' patents, a major move by a nation
that for years had flouted international norms on intellectual
property.
	   The decision was welcomed by patent lawyers, India's trading
partners and the United Nations alike. ``It's a very significant
step for India because for so long it has refused to conform to
world standards on patent law,'' Jeffery Paul Kushan, a top U.S.
patent expert, said Wednesday.
	   The signing is particularly noteworthy coming amid the
increasingly vocal debate over biopiracy _ what many developing
nations and indigenous groups consider the theft of their
innovations by companies that use patent laws to gain exclusive
rights over their resources.
	   India has claimed biopiracy in a current case involving a patent
granted to a U.S. company for rice similar to India's famous
Basmati grain.
	   India agreed to abide by the Paris Convention for the Protection
of Industrial Property and the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the U.N.
patent agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization said
Tuesday.
	   Both treaties will be binding on India as of Dec. 7.
	   The two treaties are considered the main accords regarding
international protection of intellectual property. The Paris
Convention lays down the basic principles governing protection of
patents, trademarks and industrial designs.
	   The Patent Cooperation Treaty makes it possible to fill out a
single application for a patent that will be then considered in
several countries, reducing costs and paperwork.
	   Patents allow inventors to exclude all others from making, using
or selling their invention for a specified period of time.
Inventors can get a patent if they can prove that their product is
useful, new and isn't obvious.
	   India had for years resisted the growing trend of worldwide
patent protection that came along with the global economy, where a
bottle of aspirin in a New Delhi drug store was as likely to be
imported as it was to be locally made.
	   India's patent laws were particularly lax regarding
pharmaceuticals, meaning local companies could sell generic drugs
before the time specified in the patent of the name-brand drug.
While enabling Indians to buy cheaper drugs, the policy drove away
foreign investment.
	   India's signing on to the treaties is ``very encouraging because
it necessitates patent reform,'' of its laws, said Kushan, a
special counsel in the Washington law firm Powell, Goldstein,
Frazier and Murphy, who has served with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and the U.S. Trade Representative in Geneva.
	   The New Delhi government apparently began to change its view
toward the need for patent protection last year, when it
successfully overturned a U.S. patent obtained by American
scientists for using turmeric as a wound healer.
	   Indian scientists, armed with ancient medicinal texts, argued to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the patent didn't meet
the ``novelty'' requirement because Indians had long used turmeric
to heal wounds.
	   India has also been faced with another patent issue that
surfaced earlier this year. An Alvin, Texas-based company, RiceTec
Inc., received a patent to produce and market a long-grain rice
called Texmati, which is similar to Basmati, an aromatic rice grown
in parts of India and Pakistan.
	   Claiming a case of biopiracy, India has argued that the
exclusive rights that the patent confers would hurt vital Indian
rice exports.
	   There are now 151 countries which adhere to the Paris Convention
and 98 countries which have signed the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

Poll shows Palestinian support for attacks against Israel rising
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian support for armed attacks against
Israel is one the rise and while confidence in the peace process
remains high, a majority believe agreement is far from reach,
according to a survey released Wednesday.
	   The results come a day before a Mideast peace summit between the
leaders of Israel and Palestinians aimed at ending months of
stalemate and completing agreement on an Israeli troop pullback
from the West Bank.
	   The poll was conducted by The Center for Palestine Research and
Studies, which conducts similar public opinion polls every three
months among Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Fifty-one percent of the Palestinian public questioned said they
support acts of violence against Israel, up 7 percent from August.
	   However, a majority of Palestinians still back the peace
process. Sixty-six percent of those polled said they support peace
with Israel, while 30 percent opposed. And 49 percent said they now
believe that the peace process would lead to Palestinian statehood,
compared to 37 percent in August.
	   The sharpest drop came regarding public support for a unilateral
declaration of statehood _ something which Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat is considering for May 1999 in the absence of
progress in peace talks.
	   Forty-five percent said they would support the move, down from
58 percent in June. The center attributes the decline to Israeli
threats of collective punishment such as closure or annexation of
more land and uncertainty over how the Palestinian leadership would
handle such a crisis.
	   Still, 61 percent of those surveyed said they do not believe
that both sides are capable of reaching agreement over the
conflict's major issues such as Jerusalem, permanent borders and
Jewish settlements. That's an increase of 9 percent in the past 18
months.
	   The poll was conducted door-to-door between October 8-10 and has
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

Unrepentant serial rapist released from Spanish jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A man who refused to join a rehabilitation
program for sex offenders while serving a sentence for 29 rapes was
released from jail Wednesday.
	   Francisco Lopez Maillo had served 14 years and eight months of
his 592-year accumulative sentence when he left a jail in the
northeastern city of Barcelona early Wednesday for an unknown
destination.
	   Lopez knocked years off his sentence by working in the prison
kitchen and participating in activities such as playing football,
but refused to participate in a rehabilitation program for sex
offenders, prison officials told TVE national television.
	   ``I leave it up to each woman to decide whether to forgive me,''
Lopez said in an earlier interview with TVE in which he showed few
signs of remorse.
	   The release of an apparently unrepentant serial rapist prompted
calls for the law to be changed to oblige prisoners to accept
psychological therapy.
	   Government spokeswoman for social affairs, Amalia Gomez, also
said she favored harsher sentences for such cases.
	   As a released prisoner, Lopez is entitled to a stipend of 80,000
pesetas (dlrs 570) per month for 18 months, as well as help with
finding housing and work.

Guatemalan immigrants swept away by river on way to United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Twenty Guatemalans making their way toward
Los Angeles were swept away by a swollen river in southern Mexico.
At least four drowned, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Two of the immigrants were rescued Tuesday from the Playa River
near the town of Las Choapas, 340 miles (550 kms) southeast of
Mexico City, Notimex said, citing state police officials.
	   Rescuers were searching for the other 14 Guatemalans, and it was
unclear whether they made it across the river safely or were washed
away as well.
	   The two rescued people said the immigrants didn't know one
another, and had paid dlrs 2,000 each to a smuggler who promised to
take them from Malacatan, on Guatemala's western border, to Los
Angeles, according to Notimex.
	   Heavy rains have caused flooding across southern and central
Mexico in recent weeks.

 &UR; OSCE ready to send observers, technical mission ``soon'' to Kosovo
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Yugoslav government and Albanians
in Kosovo are willing to allow international observers into the
region, which will be ready to leave ``as soon as possible,'' the
chairman of a 54-nation security group said Wednesday.
	   ``I have a commitment from the Yugoslav foreign minister and
representatives of the Albanians that they are prepared to accept
the agreement,'' said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
who chairs the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   ``The 2,000-member team is ready to go as soon as possible,''
Geremek said, but declined to speculate when that would be. He
added that a technical advance force would leave ``immediately''
after the agreement was signed.
	   In an interview Wednesday, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said he
was worried that governments will move too slowly to send monitors
to Kosovo to make sure Yugoslavia complies with a deal to end the
conflict in the secessionist province.
	   Geremek plans to attend an OSCE meeting Thursday in Vienna,
Austria, to approve the Kosovo verification mission, which is part
of the deal Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   On Friday, he will join a meeting of the Contact Group in Paris,
before flying to Belgrade for meetings with Yugoslav
representatives and Ibrahim Rugova, the Albanian leader in Kosovo.
	   Geremek said that the mission will have ``many technical
problems,'' but declined to specify them. The verification team
will comprise ``unarmed lawyers and other civilians,'' he said.
	   ``I do not see a reason for excluding representatives of the
military but they will have a civilian role; they will be
civilians,'' Geremek told a news conference.
	   ``This mission will have to verify ... also military problems;
the withdrawal of the Serbian army from Kosovo, and verification of
such things should be done in a competent way so there can be some
members of the military but ... without arms,'' he said.
	   The OSCE was set up following a conference of European
countries, the United States and Canada that produced the Helsinki
Final Act in 1975 _ a key document signed by western and Communist
countries.
	   The agreement, considered a landmark in efforts to ease Cold War
tensions in Europe, established the basic principles governing the
behavior of governments toward their citizens and each other.
	   The Kosovo mission is the OSCE's ``greatest challenge to date,''
Geremek said.
	   ``For the first time in its history, the OSCE will send a
verification mission (to a crisis area),'' he said. ``It's a
question of the future of the OSCE.''
	   ``I think that by this action (Kosovo mission), the organization
that was born during the Cold War can prove that it is able to work
in quite a new situation and can be efficient in working for
peace,'' Geremek said.

British farmers furious over invading French market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAUNTON, England (AP) _ Furious local farmers have demanded an
apology over plans to stage a three-day market featuring French
traders in a busy town center.
	   More than 20 French merchants from Normandy and Brittany have
been invited to sell their produce beginning Thursday at the event
in Taunton, Somerset, 135 miles (215 kms) southwest of London.
	   The market has angered local farmers, who blame imported food
from Europe for the crisis in British agriculture.
	   One of the organizers, Jenny Hoyle of Taunton's Town Center
Partnership, conceded Wednesday that the timing was ``a little
crass'' considering the recent hard times for farmers, but said the
event was planned nine months ago and could not be canceled.
	   The French traders are expected to sell cheese and cider _ both
traditional Somerset produce _ along with bread, wine, jams and
pate.
	   ``At a time when agriculture is going through its worst slump
for over 60 years, and with imported food at the very heart of the
problem, to provide this platform for a group of our major
competitors amounts to insensitivity bordering on insult,'' said
Anthony Gibson, southwest regional director for the National
Farmers Union.
	   Gibson denied reports, however, that farmers were planning to
demonstrate at the market.

Defying censorship, two Serbian dailies banned

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Right after cutting a deal with U.S.
negotiators to end the Kosovo crisis, President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a major crackdown on his Serb opponents by silencing two
independent Belgrade dailies.
	   Serbian police stormed the offices of Dnevni Telegraf and Danas,
both critical of Milosevic's government, and shut them down for
allegedly violating a recent government decree that required
self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   ``Serbia is heading toward complete dictatorship and this must
be stopped,'' the manager and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf,
Slavko Curuvija, told The Associated Press. He said up to now his
paper could write about such a danger, ``now we can't even do
that.''
	   Curuvija said that just as international pressure seems to ease,
Milosevic's regime is seeking to eliminate prominent opponents at
home, ``to suppress the last free voices.''
	   Dnevni Telegraf's popular columnist Aleksandar Tijanic, known
for his lucid and cynical commentaries often targeting the
government, said, ``This is not only about two papers, not only the
struggle to keep publishing, this is a clash between two Serbias.''
	   ``One is a xenophobic, conservative, anti-European Serbia,''
Tijanic said, referring to Milosevic's policies, ``and the other is
liberal, democratic, open to the world. This is the beginning of an
internal cold war,'' Tijanic told reporters Wednesday.
	   Last week, the Serbian government run by Milosevic's leftists
and ultranationalists, issued a decree punishing companies,
institutions and individuals who act contrary to the government's
view of patriotic behavior.
	   Open to interpretation and misuse, the decree was presented as
necessary at a time of NATO threats of intervention in Kosovo where
government forces fought against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Milosevic's authorities claim the Kosovo crisis and the
resulting NATO threats were made worse by reports by foreign and
independent media in Serbia. The decree made it a taboo to report
on the threats, military preparations or other developments which,
allegedly, could cause alarm among Serbians.
	   The decree also banned radio news programs in Serbian language
produced abroad - by the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, BBC
and others _ and retransmitted locally in FM waves.
	   Ironically, the latest of Milosevic's many crackdowns on
independent media came hours after he announced that the NATO
threat was off due to an agreement he reached with U.S. negotiators
on Kosovo.
	   Dnevni Telegraf, with a circulation of 80,000, mocked the
restrictive decree, publishing regularly the developments under
notes saying ``We have not reported this:'' or ``Respecting the
decree, we are not saying that:.''
	   Reporters, editors and other staff in the two dailies tried to
argue with about a dozen law enforcement officers, who eventually
pushed them out, preventing them from updating their homepage
(www.dtelegraf.co.yu).
	   ``This is a barbaric act, an act of sheer violence,'' Nikola
Barovic, a lawyer for Danas daily.
	   On Saturday, the authorities shut down Belgrade's, Index Radio,
citing its lack of broadcast license.
	   Index and other members of the Association of Independent
Electronic Media have for years been denied licenses by the
authorities who thus have the leverage to easily shut down any of
them when they become critical of the authorities.
	   On Wednesday, ANEM initiated a legal process to prove that the
decree was unconstitutional.
	   ``There is a realistic danger that the authorities will soon
shut down all independent media,'' read the ANEM statement.
	   Also on Wednesday, the independent Nasa Borba daily published a
warning it received from Serbia's Information Ministry saying it
would shut down the paper for allegedly violating the notorious
decree. The paper ignored a specific order from the ministry not to
publish the warning.

Schneider traded to Rangers for Karpovtsev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ American defenseman Mathieu Schneider was traded
to the New York Rangers by the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday for
Russian defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev and a fourth-round 1999
draft pick.
	   Schneider, much traveled restricted free agent without a
contract, did not attend training camp and missed the Leafs' first
two games of the North American National Hockey League's season,
which began Friday. Last season, his ninth in the NHL, Schneider
scored 11 goals assisted on 26 and had 44 minutes in penalties in
76 games.
	   The 29-year-old Schneider had been seeking dlrs 3.3 million a
year from the Maple Leafs, who had countered with dlrs 2.8 million.
He made dlrs 2.5 million last season.
	   Karpovtsev, 28, is in his fifth NHL season since leaving Dynamo
of Moscow. He had nine goals, 29 assists and 59 minutes in
penalties in 77 games last season.

Slovene defense minister under pressure to step down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) -- Slovenia's defense minister came
under pressure Wednesday to resign for accepting an apartment which
was reserved for members of the uniformed armed services.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek asked Defense Minister Alojz Krapez
on Wednesday to submit his resignation.
	   Drnovsek, who governs in a coalition along with the Slovene
Peoples Party of Marjan Podobnik, has also come under fire for
shying away from action to unravel an earlier financial scandal
involving members of his coalition partners.
	   Fearing the swirling allegations of impropriety and corruption
may cause the government to crumble and prompt new elections, it
was expected Krapex would announce his decision in a few days.

Ailing minister to reportedly return to duties next year

	   PARIS (AP) _ Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who
spent a week in a coma after suffering an allergic reaction to
anesthesia, should recover fully and be able to return to his
duties next year, a source close to the minister said Wednesday.
	   Chevenement will be able to leave the Val de Grace military
hospital by the end of the month, after two months of treatment
there, according to the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. For weeks, he was kept on a respirator and dialysis.
	   The 59-year-old Chevenement, who suffered cardiac arrest before
undergoing gall bladder surgery Sept. 2, now reads, telephones
friends and walks in the hospital park, the source said, adding
that he has been given permission for an evening leave from the
hospital.
	   The Interior Ministry, which has provided occasional updates on
Chevenement's progress, did not immediately confirm the Wednesday
report, widely cited by the French media.
	   The minister suffered an allergic shock minutes after doctors
administered anesthesia which contained curare, a muscle relaxant
that is known to cause an allergic reaction in some patients.
	   Chevenement, a key figure in the French Cabinet, has held
several ministry portfolios, including industry, education and
defense. He resigned as defense minister in 1991 to protest
France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   The Interior Ministry is responsible for the nation's police and
security forces.
	   Chevenement's post has been held in the interum by Jean-Jack
Queyranne, minister of overseas territories.

Asian crisis hits Hong Kong's exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis has severely dampened
demand for exports from Hong Kong, but U.S. and European markets
will help the territory's trade revive, the local trade council
said Wednesday.
	   ``Although prospects for Hong Kong's exports continue to be
clouded by the Asian financial turmoil, the U.S. economy is
basically in good shape,'' the Trade Development Council's Edward
Leung said in a statement.
	   The U.S. and European Union economies' moderate growth will
provide Hong Kong exports ``with the much needed vitality,'' the
statement said.
	   China will also provide a stable market for the territory's
exports, the statement said.
	   Re-exports and domestic exports fell by 2.8 percent in the first
half of this year. Hong Kong re-exports many goods from mainland
China.
	   Exports of services fell by 13.3 percent in the first quarter.
The forecast drop in exports of services for the full year would be
the first annual decline since Hong Kong began compiling such
statistics in 1961, the statement said.
	   Hong Kong trade has suffered from the devaluation of other Asian
currencies, and their lessened buying power, and the subsequent
waning regional demand for the territory's exports. The Hong Kong
dollar is the only fully convertible currency that has not been
devalued since the Asian financial crisis unfolded last July.

Indian teacher wins Nobel for economics

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh comment from Sen. &QL;

 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Amartya Sen, a scholar from India whose
work produced a new understanding of the catastrophes that plague
society's poorest people, won the Nobel Economics Prize on
Wednesday.
	   Sen was awarded the prestigious prize for his contributions to
welfare economics, which help explain the economic mechanisms
underlying famines and poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said.
	   ``I was surprised and quite pleased when I got the call,'' Sen,
64, said in New York. ``But I was even more pleased when they told
me the subject matter was welfare economics, a field I have long
been very involved in. I am pleased that they gave recognition to
that subject.''
	   Sen ``has restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of
vital economic problems,'' the Nobel citation said.
	   The 64-year-old economist joined Britain's Trinity College in
Cambridge this year after teaching at Harvard University, among
other institutions. He has studied the Bangladesh famine of 1974
and other catastrophes in India, Bangladesh and the countries of
the Sahara.
	   The award comes just a month after the image of last year's
winners, Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, was tarnished
by the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund in which they were
partners. Merton and Scholes were honored for their work on valuing
risky ``derivatives'' investments such as stock options.
	   Sen works in development economics, the study of the welfare of
the world's poorest people. His best-known work, detailed in his
1981 book ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and
Deprivation,'' challenges the common view that the shortage of food
is the most important explanation of famine.
	   Sen downplayed his Nobel achievement, saying there were many
others who deserved the prize and he wished he could share it with
them. Sen was in New York to attend a memorial service Thursday for
Mahbub ul Haq, a former finance minister of India.
	   Looking at several catastrophes, Sen has shown that ``famines
have occurred even when the supply of food was not significantly
lower than during previous years'' without famines, the citation
said.
	   Part of his explanation of the 1974 Bangladesh famine is that
flooding throughout the country significantly raised food prices,
while work opportunities for agricultural workers declined. Due to
these factors, the real incomes of agricultural workers declined so
much that they were disproportionately stricken by starvation.
	   His work undertakes hard economic analysis and broader questions
about the best ways to determine whether poverty is increasing or
decreasing.
	   ``Sen's research has practical use in every collective
decision-making process,'' said Robert Eriksson, professor of
sociology at the University of Stockholm. ``He cares about the
poorest in society.''
	   Rakesh Mohan, director-general of India's National Council for
Applied Economic Research, praised Sen as ``an unusual economist
who has combined deep concern for human development with the very
fine work in technical economics.''
	   Sen's award highlights an underappreciated area of study, said
Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James and Associates, an
investment firm in St. Petersburg, Florida.
	   ``Developmental economics has never really gotten a whole lot of
attention in the academic world, and certainly the magnitude of the
problem and type of issues it deals with is obviously very
significant,'' Brown said.
	   The 7.6 million kronor prize was worth about dlrs 963,000 at
Wednesday's exchange rate.
	   It is the second year in a row that the prize has gone to work
with a clear connection to day-to-day lives, rather than to highly
theoretical work.
	   Long-Term Capital Management, the fund in which Merton and
Scholes were partners, needed a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout from banks
after nearly failing. But despite the tarnish on their reputations,
Merton's and Scholes' award-winning theories were not faulty, said
Torsten Persson, a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics.
	   ``They lost money, but this has nothing to do with the prize,''
Persson said.
	   This honor is the only Nobel not established in the will of
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. It was
created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central bank.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The peace prize, the last in this year's series, is to be
announced Friday.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel.

Top suspect in custody pleads innocent to new war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Croat leader accused
of instigating the slayings of at least 100 Muslims in central
Bosnia pleaded innocent Wednesday to new war crimes charges.
	   Dario Kordic, the most senior leader in U.N. custody, entered
innocent pleas to a broadened Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
indictment which includes nine new counts of war crimes and crimes
against humanity, bringing the total charges against him from 13 to
22.
	   Kordic, 37, initially was indicted in 1995 along with four other
defendants suspected in slayings of Bosnian Muslims in the Lasva
Valley between 1991 and 1994.
	   Their alleged crimes were committed on such a widespread scale
that the Bosnian Muslim civilian population ``was substantially
reduced and relocated,'' the indictment said.
	   Named in the same indictment is Mario Cerkez, 39, a Bosnian
Croat military commander, who also pleaded innocent Wednesday to 12
new counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He now faces
22 counts, up from the initial 10.
	   ``Absolutely not guilty,'' a defiant Cerkez said as each count
against him was read.
	   If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The men had denied the charges at their initial arraignment in 1997
as well.
	   The amended indictment recounts an alleged campaign of terror in
which men, women and children were beaten, sexually assaulted and
killed and their homes. Mosques were set on fire, shelled or
dynamited.
	   ``At least 100 defenseless Bosnian Muslim civilians, including
women, children, the elderly and the infirm, were killed and many
wounded or harmed in their homes or yards,'' the indictment said.
	   According to the indictment, Kordic was an influential
politician who became the vice president of the former Bosnian
Croat state of Herceg-Bosna.
	   He was an ``integral and important figure in the whole
campaign,'' the amended indictment said.
	   Cerkez was the commander of the Croatian Defense Council
brigade, based in the central Bosnian city of Vitez, which was
actively involved in the widespread persecution, according to the
indictment.
	   Prosecutors say not only are they individually responsible for
the alleged crimes, but they are also culpable for the actions of
their subordinates.
	   Two other defendants in the Lasva Valley indictment, Bosnian
Croat Gen. Tihomir Blaskic and prison commander Zlatko Aleksovski,
are already standing trial separately before the tribunal.

Iwata surges ahead in professional Japan League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ First-stage winner Jubilo Iwata beat Cerezo Osaka
3-0 Wednesday and took a marginal lead in the second stage
standings on goal difference in the 18-team Japanese professional
soccer league.
	   Masashi Nakayama, a World Cup forward and the Japan League's top
scorer, sent in his 28th goal of the season and set up another for
Iwata.
	   Iwata now is 8-2, standing ahead of the Urawa Reds and Kashima
Antlers on goal difference, although all three have 24 points from
10 games.
	   Spanish midfielder Aitor Beguiristain netted an injury-time
winner as Urawa edged Consadole Sapporo 2-1.
	   Atsushi Yanagisawa, who scored a hat trick as a substitute in
Saturday's JOMO Cup match, struck a 48th minute equalizer for
Kashima against Gamba Osaka before Bismarck and Akira Narahashi
added goals to give the visitors a 3-1 victory.
	   Brazilian forward Fernando Oliva scored an extra-time goal that
gave Shimizu S-Pulse a 4-3 victory over the Yokohama Marinos. With
the defeat, Yokohama was knocked off the top spot.

German diplomat becomes new head to the regional Bosnian office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ German diplomat Richard
Ellerkmann on Wednesday became the new head of the regional Office
of the High Representative Carlos Westendorp, the chief European
mediator, in Mostar, replacing a British diplomat, Sir Martin
Garrod.
	   ``I will do my best to follow his policy and his spirit,''
Ellerkmann said during a ceremony in the still divided southwestern
city, adding that ``it will be a difficult assignment.''
	   Mostar has been divided between Muslims and Croats ever since
they fought a year-long war starting in 1993 and despite an
agreement they signed in Washington in 1994 about the establishment
of a Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Bosnian Croats apparently have never given up the idea of a
mini-state of their own they fought for in order to secede and join
neighboring Croatia.
	   Sir Martin spent more than four years serving sucessfuly in
different positions in Mostar, trying to help with the
implementation of the peace process.
	   Ellerkmann has been transferred to a new position after serving
in Bosnia as a high-ranking official of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

It's in the dictionary; now Thatcher handbag seeks an archive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some say the Imperial War Museum might be the best
place. But if Margaret Thatcher's handbag _ emblem of her
formidable tenure as prime minister _ is going into an archive, it
will be at Cambridge's Churchill College, already home to 1,000
boxes of her papers.
	   But not right now, the college says. And, when the times comes,
just one handbag will be getting a permanent place in history.
	   ``If there are a great deal of handbags, we're obviously not the
place,'' Judith Etherton, archivist of the Thatcher papers at the
Churchill Archive Center, said Wednesday. ``We're not the Victoria
and Albert Museum, we're an archive.''
	   The Thatcher Foundation, set up to promote the former prime
minister's right-wing policies, suggested _ with Lady Thatcher's
approval _ that the archive take some Thatcherabilia, including
handbags, gowns and formal gifts during her 1979-90 tenure.
	   ``Lady Thatcher thought it would be rather symbolic given it is
so associated with her,'' Mark Worthington, spokesman for the
Thatcher Foundation, said of the handbag. ``The Churchill thought
about it, but rightly said to us they are just not equipped.''
	   Lady Thatcher's handbags _ usually medium-sized and black, and
always carried Queen Elizabeth II-style on the forearm _ became a
familiar sight in capitals around the world.
	   From it, she produced one-sheet policy documents in the middle
of talks on subjects ranging from nuclear missiles to European
Union farm subsidies.
	   Armed with it, she also ended _ or blighted _ the careers of
fellow government ministers.
	   It all prompted the Oxford English Dictionary to record an
entry: ``To handbag, transitive verb (of a woman politician), treat
(a person, idea etc.) ruthlessly or insensitively.''
	   Most of the Churchill archive is taken up with documents that
belonged to World War II leader Winston Churchill, with about
one-third taken up by Thatcher papers.
	   The archive is seeking to raise 4.6 million pounds (dlrs 7.8
million) for an extension.

France torpedoes investment liberalization talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RELEDES to show that French move torpedoes talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Wednesday
effectively torpedoed a controversial plan to negotiate
liberalizing international investment, saying France will skip
long-delayed talks next week. He called for a different venue.
	   Negotiations were due to resume next Tuesday at the Paris
headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Talks had been stalled for six months, chiefly at the
insistence of the French, while a new basis for an accord could be
hammered out behind the scenes.
	   Jospin told lawmakers the talks on the Multilateral Agreement on
Investment (MAI) should be shifted to the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization, as Canada has suggested.
	   ``France will not resume negotiations in the framework of the
OECD on Oct. 20,'' Jospin told the National Assembly, referring to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
	   ``We want that negotiations be able to resume on a totally new
basis and in the framework associating all actors, meaning all
countries, including the developing ones,'' the Socialist prime
minister told lawmakers during a question-and-answer session at the
National Assembly.
	   There was no immediate comment from the OECD, which groups 29 of
the world's leading industrialized nations.
	   In April, trade and finance ministers from OECD nations shelved
for six months the negotiations on regulating the multi
billion-dollar flows of foreign direct investment. The talks,
backed by the United States, are to resume Oct. 20.
	   France has criticized the negotiations for a so-called
Multilateral Agreement on Investment or MAI.
	   Paris sees it as threatening its artistic, cultural and
audiovisual industries, which many in France feel already suffer
from too much American influence.
	   The French, in turn, wanted Washington to move toward
eliminating laws that call for imposing sanctions on countries for
investing in Cuba, Iran and Libya.

Status of Milosevic's promises under NATO deadline in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The status Wednesday of promises that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic must back up with evidence of compliance by
NATO's Saturday deadline _ or face the renewed threat of airstrikes
for his Kosovo crackdown:
	   _ IMMEDIATE HALT TO KOSOVO HOSTILITIES: No fighting has been
reported this week in the southern Serbian province.
	   _ WITHDRAWAL OF FORCES AND HEAVY ARMAMENTS TO LEVELS BEFORE THE
CRACKDOWN BEGAN FEB. 28 IN THE SERBIAN PROVINCE: NATO officials say
a number of units remain in the province, including the 36th
Special Police Unit. NATO officials would not say how many troops
are in Kosovo except they ``far exceed'' the acceptable level.
	   _ MOVE TO BEGIN SERIOUS TALKS WITH ETHNIC ALBANIANS ON
SELF-RULE. The government has announced local elections in the
majority Albanian province for 1999 as well as tentative plans for
reorganization of the police. But no firm date has been set for the
start of talks with the Albanians.
	   _ HELP RETURN REFUGEES TO THEIR HOMES. The United Nations and
International Committee of the Red Cross say many refugees are
afraid to return home for fear of reprisals.
	   _ ALLOW UNHINDERED WORK BY HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS. The U.N.
refugee agency and others resumed aid convoys which they themselves
suspended Monday for fear of Serb attacks if NATO launched
airstrikes.
	   _ COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL. U.N. war
crimes investigators have now received Yugoslav visas and plan to
return shortly to Kosovo.
	   _ ALLOW A 2,000-MEMBER INTERNATIONAL MONITORING FORCE INTO
KOSOVO TO MAKE SURE MILOSEVIC HONORS HIS AGREEMENTS. The mission's
advance party arrived from neighboring Macedonia, but U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke is worried it could take months for countries to
assemble the force.

No hints, as usual, from secretive Nobel Peace Prize committee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The tightlipped Nobel Peace Prize committee
doesn't give clues, which leaves Nobel watchers grasping anything
that even hints of being a hint about who will win the coveted
prize on Friday.
	   Guesses include someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace
process, or a human rights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of
the U.N. Human Rights Charter, or Czech President Vaclav Havel on
the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or U.S.
peace mediator Richard Holbrooke.
	   Although the committee made its decision before Holbrooke
achieved an apparent breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis, it meets
just before announcing the prize and could make changes.
	   Others mentioned in the speculation are the Doctors Without
Borders humanitarian group, the children's peace movement in
Columbia and even the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda and the
former Yugoslavia.
	   Geir Lundestad, the nonvoting secretary of the five-member
Norwegian Nobel Committee, watches the frantic and sometimes
fractured reasoning behind the news media's guesses every year.
	   ``Sometimes it's a little amusing, but sometimes there is so
much speculation about one or two people who then don't get the
prize, that I feel a little bad for them,'' Lundestad said
Wednesday.
	   Last year, American Jody Williams and her International Campaign
to Ban Landmines at the top of the media's guess list and, in fact,
won. Two years earlier, however, the winners _ Joseph Rotblat and
the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs _ weren't even
mentioned in speculation.
	   All Lundestad would say about this year's prize is that there
were a record 139 nominations; includes a cash award of 7.6 million
Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000); and will be presented in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of its benefactor, Alfred
Nobel of Sweden.
	   Beyond that, those attempting to guess the winner are left to
their own devices.
	   For example, the announcement that an Irish musical group, the
Cranberries, would perform at the traditional Nobel Peace Concert
in December led to a frenzy of speculation that the Nobel Laureate
had to be involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.
	   Honoring the Northern Ireland effort would be keeping with the
committee's tradition of using the prize's prestige to push a
peace, human rights or democratization effort. And Ireland's
peacemakers, especially Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Ulster
Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume, are widely
believed to be in contention for this year's prize.
	   ``But that anyone would believe that we would reveal the
nationality of the winner by picking artists for the concert amazes
me,'' said Lundestad. ``Most of the performers are Norwegian so, by
that logic, the winner would have to be Norwegian.''
	   Even if there was a nationality glitch in planning the concert,
it wouldn't say much. Another potential laureate, Mary Robinson as
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, is also Irish. Many
believe this year's prize could honor her office or another human
rights activist on the U.N. charter's anniversary.
	   The committee might also honor two anniversaries at once with a
prize to Havel, the Czech president. Havel is noted as a human
rights activist, and this is 30th anniversary of the Praque Spring
democracy movement that was crushed by a Soviet invasion.
	   Since peace is a key human right, the winner could be someone
like Holbrooke for brokering the 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the
Bosnia war and his other Balkan efforts, former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter for his globe-trotting peace efforts or U.S. mediator
George Mitchell for brokering April's peace accords for northern
Ireland.
	   Others mentioned include Kurdish activist Leyla Zana, who is
jailed in Turkey, Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng,
the Salavation Army, Pope John Paul II, Sister Helen Prejean, the
author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' for her campaign against the death
penalty and Mexico's bishop of San Cristobel de las Casas, Samuel
Ruiz Garcia, for his campaign on behalf of the country's Chiapas
Indians.
	   The secretive Nobel committee, which allows no notes to leave
the room during its five or six meetings a year, refuses to even
say who is nominated. It is proud of being tightlipped.
	   ``There are only six of us who know the name of the winner. Not
even the staff knows. We ought to be able to keep it secret,'' said
Lundestad.

Ballesteros and Olazabal split in team event
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN PAGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Between 1987 and 1993 Severiano
Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal were the greatest double-act
the Ryder Cup has seen.
	   The two Spaniards won 11 and tied two of 15 matches played
together in four editions of the tournament.
	   But injury sidelined Olazabal in 1995 and although Ballesteros
triumphed in 1997 it was as the inspired cheer-leading captain of
the European squad in Valderrama, not as a player.
	   Now it looks like they might never link up again.
	   At this week's dlrs 595,000 Novotel Perrier Pairs - which begins
Thursday over the 6,316 meter (6,909 yard) par-71 course at the
Medoc Golf Club just outside Bordeaux - Ballesteros lines up with
compatriot Miguel Angel Jimenez, while Olazabal forms another
all-Spanish duo with Domingo Hospital in the 34-team event.
	   The in-form Jimenez, a recent winner of the Lancome Trophy in
Paris, served as Ballesteros' assistant in the Ryder Cup.
	   ``During the Ryder Cup, Miguel asked me to play Bordeaux with
him,'' Ballesteros said. ``That's the only reason. Things change.''
	   They have changed drastically for Ballesteros, mired in a
three-year winless slump that has seen him drop out of the world's
top-200 and currently occupy the 116th slot in Europe.
	   ``It's hard to come back,'' the 41-year-old Spanish star
admitted. ``But I like the challenge.''
	   Ballesteros looks forward to applauding compatriot Sergio
Garcia, the 18 year-old amateur prodigy, in next year's Ryder Cup,
which will be held in September in Brookline, Massachusettes.
	   Garcia turns pro after next April's Masters tournament, having
missed the first 17 qualifying tournaments for the Ryder Cup.
	   ``But there's no question he can make it,'' Ballesteros said on
Wednesday.
	   Garcia is paired here with the 18 year-old South African amateur
hope Trevor Immelman, who has also qualified for Augusta by
capturing the U.S. Public Links Championship.

New Estonian foreign minister appointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonian President Lennart Meri has
appointed Raul Malk, most recently ambassador to Great Britain, as
the country's new foreign minister.
	   The 46-year-old career diplomat replaces Toomas Ilves, who
resigned last month to devote more time to campaigning for next
January's national elections.
	   Malk was to be sworn in before parliament Wednesday evening.
	   Under the new foreign minister, there should be no major shift
in Estonian foreign policy, which has made membership in the
European Union and NATO a high priority.
	   But Malk, who has also served as one of Estonia's main
negotiators with Moscow, may try to focus on Russian relations more
than his predecessor.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has
tapped a diplomat with high-profile experience in Bosnia as his top
foreign policy aide, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Sources said another career diplomat active in Balkans policy
will be named to a key foreign ministry post.
	   Schroeder has pledged continuity in Germany's foreign policy,
and the postings would strengthen his hand before handing the
foreign ministry over to his junior coalition partner, the Greens.
	   Michael Steiner, who served as the deputy international
representative for rebuilding postwar Bosnia, will become his
foreign policy aide in the chancellery, said a spokesman for Lower
Saxony state, where Schroeder is the outgoing governor.
	   Sources close to Schroeder, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Wolfgang Ischinger, Germany's envoy in Kosovo diplomacy, was
likely to move up to deputy foreign minister.
	   Ischinger, currently the ministry's top troubleshooter, also
helped negotiate the 1995 Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Philip Mosima finished ahead of
four-time world cross country champion Paul Tergat for a Kenyan 1-2
in the 6-kilometer Belgrade Race Through History Wednesday with
Million Wolde of Ethiopia third.
	   Mosima, who was world junior cross country champion in 1993 and
'94, clocked 17 minutes 02 seconds with his countryman one second
slower. Wolde's time was 17:05 with another Kenyan, Josephat
Machuka, 13 seconds further behind.
	   The threat of NATO military intervention because of the ethnic
warfare in its southern Kosovo province depleted the number of
expected international participants to only 11. With only three
Yugoslav runners, the total was 14.
	   The race was named Belgrade's Race Through History as the track
was entirely within Belgrade's ancient fortress, the original and
historic heart of the Serbian capital.

Alleged mafia boss in Germany jailed for four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An alleged Italian mafia viceroy in
the German town of Baden-Baden was sentenced to four years in jail
Wednesday for weapons offenses, escaping a heavier sentence for
instigating murder.
	   A reason for the lighter sentence was the unreliability of the
testimony by a key states witness, said Judge Guenther Hartweck.
	   ``You can't rely on somebody who went on record with his
testimony as if it were something out of a serial novel,'' the
judge said.
	   Sabatino Ciccerelli's arrest in September 1997 and subsequent
trial caused a stir after a states witness alleged the accused was
a leading mafia member and viceroy in Germany for Italian mafia
leader Toto Riina, a reputed ``boss of bosses.''
	   Ciccarelli, 59, was charged with contracting another Italian in
the spring of 1995 to obtain a weapon with a silencer and
ammunition in Belgium. The evidence for the weapons charge was
gathered from two years of phone taps by German investigators.
	   The weapon was intended for use by two Naples natives in
southern Germany, to kill another Italian suspected by Ciccarelli
of being a police informant, prosecutors said. The plan was
thwarted when the man who obtained the weapon was arrested.
	   In the other case, prosecutors said Ciccarelli contacted another
Italian to kill a fellow countryman, but the plot was thwarted when
the Italian informed federal police.
	   Judge Hartweck said he believed there had been ``a concrete plan
to do something with the weapon,'' but it couldn't be proven that
Ciccarelli planned to kill anyone with it.
	   Security surrounding the eight-day trial was tight in this
southern German spa town, with armed police patrolling the court
building and conducting body searches. State prosecutor Juergen
Gremmelmaier, an investigator and Ciccarelli himself had all
received death threats.

Yeltsin, suffering from cold, returns to work at the Kremlin
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Weakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris
Yeltsin defied doctors' orders and quashed rumors he is seriously
ill by showing up unexpectedly at the Kremlin on Wednesday.
	   Still, his appearance didn't silence the growing number of calls
for his resignation. Hours after he returned to work, the generally
pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell just 11 votes short of
passing a motion urging him to step down over his social welfare
policies.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a respiratory infection that forced him to cut
short his first foreign visit in months on Monday.
	   Whenever Yeltsin falls ill, speculation arises about his ability
to govern. This time, however, the prospect of him leaving office
has aroused less panic, since he has largely faded from the
limelight in recent months and left his government to grapple with
Russia's economic crisis.
	   ``There will be no turmoil if Yeltsin leaves the political
arena. The government is already in charge, (Prime Minister
Yevgeny) Primakov is strong enough and has the support of the
security services,'' said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow
office of the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation.
	   ``Everyone knows Yeltsin is ailing and is politically
weakened,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart
bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists he has no major illnesses
and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term.
	   ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making a fuss about it,
he joked with Primakov during a meeting Wednesday.
	   In the Kremlin, Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with
Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, Russian news agencies said.
	   Yeltsin looked wan and tired and walked stiffly, but he was
smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his ministers. The
start of the meeting was shown on Russian television.
	   Primakov said afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively
``when we reminded him that he should stay in bed during his
illness'' and said of his doctors: ``Don't listen to them.''
	   The upper house of parliament was busy voting on a motion saying
he should resign. The vote in the Federation Council, which is made
up of regional leaders, was 79 to 18 in favor, Russian news
agencies reported. It did not pass because it required a simple
majority of 90 votes.
	   The motion carries no legal weight, but it reflects growing
anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that has generally supported
him.
	   The prime minister reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin has no
plans to resign or call early elections.
	   ``There is no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's
resignation,'' Primakov said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``What happens to the anti-crisis steps if elections are
held now?''
	   Yeltsin's resignation is highly unlikely. If he were to step
down or die, Primakov would take power and elections would have to
be held within three months.
	   Many Russians view Yeltsin with increasing pity.
	   ``I feel for him. He's clearly not a healthy person,'' film
director Vladimir Khotinenko was quoted as saying by the daily
Kommersant. ``It's time for him to step aside.''
	   Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his
spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be in the
office all week.
	   Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to
Central Asia on Sunday and Monday. He canceled most of his public
engagements, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling
remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.

EU says future jobs depend greatly on services sector growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Wednesday the
15 EU countries should follow the example of the United States by
developing their services sectors to create more jobs.
	   In a draft report on employment rates in the Union, the EU
executive Commission noted that 39.2 percent of the EU's working
age population is employed in services. In the United States, the
figure is 54.2 percent.
	   ``The gap in employment between Europe and the US is not in
agriculture, manufacturing, or the public sector, but in the
services sector,'' the Commission report said.
	   It said the difference in employment rates is particularly
marked in three sectors: communal services, business services and
distribution, hotels and restaurants.
	   The report noted that 20 years ago, employment rates in the
United States and Europe were similar. But in 1997, ``the spread
was 14 percentage points, equivalent to some 34 million jobs.''
	   The Commission released three draft reports assessing efforts
the 15 EU countries have made over the past year to adopt EU
guidelines on employment.
	   These guidelines were mapped out last November at an EU summit
where leaders pledged to cut red tape, lower taxes to help
businesses create new jobs and expand vocational training for the
EU's 18 million unemployed.
	   The guidelines adopted at the Luxembourg summit carried no
sanctions but the 15 EU countries were supposed to present annual,
so-called action plans to show they were keeping to their promises.
	   ``The efforts made by the 15 EU countries have surpassed our
expectations,'' Commission President Jacques Santer told a news
conference.
	   The EU leaders first reported on their efforts to implement the
EU guidelines six months after Luxembourg at a summit in Cardiff,
Wales. The three Commission reports presented Wednesday will go to
the next EU summit in Vienna in December.

U.N. tribunal to resume probe of alleged atrocities in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
investigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe of
alleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal official
said Wednesday.
	   Visas that were denied earlier by Yugoslav authorities have now
been issued, Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said. He did not give
details on how many investigators will return or when.
	   Blewitt declined to speculate on the reason behind Belgrade's
change of heart, nor could he confirm that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has explicitly agreed to total compliance with
the U.N. court.
	   In a statement, Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United
States, the tribunal's president, welcomed ``in principle'' recent
agreements aimed at averting military intervention. But McDonald
said she had not yet reviewed them to confirm that they contained
``explicit provisions and mechanisms'' aimed at ensuring Belgrade's
compliance.
	   However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, speaking in New York on
NBC's ``Today'' program, said cooperation with the tribunal was
indeed part of the agreements with Milosevic.
	   ``We had a big argument about the war crimes tribunal,''
Holbrooke said. ``It is embedded in our agreement that he said he
will fully comply with the U.N. resolution and that calls for
(compliance).''
	   Holbrooke said Milosevic had agreed to a doubling of war crimes
tribunal staff in Belgrade and to letting them travel freely in
Kosovo, where the tribunal wants to look into reports of Serb
massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, was at
the United Nations on Wednesday to clarify the scope and impact of
the agreements as they relate to war crimes issues.
	   Blewitt said last week that Belgrade officials had suddenly
begun claiming that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to conduct
investigations in Kosovo.
	   The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993 to prosecute
crimes committed following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia,
has always maintained that it also has jurisdiction in the Kosovo
conflict.
	   McDonald repeatedly has chastised Belgrade for failing to
surrender indicted war suspects at large in Yugoslavia, in
particular the handover of three men accused of orchestrating the
killings of 260 unarmed people after the fall of Vukovar in 1991.
	   ``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to flout the law
and the will of the international community'' by refusing to turn
over indicted suspects, she said in her statement.

Tudjman appoints new defense minister and top adviser
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Former army chief of staff Gen. Pavao
Miljavac was appointed defense minister Wednesday to succeed
recently resigned Andrija Hebrang, a presidential statement said.
	   Ivica Kostovic, a deputy premier, was promoted to chief of
President Franjo Tudjman's bureau, replacing Hrvoje Sarinic, who
has also stepped down.
	   The sudden reshuffle comes amid a growing crisis within
Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, which is rankled by an
internal power struggle between nationalists and reformers.
	   Hebrang resigned unexpectedly Monday in a demonstration against
resistance from hard-liners thwarting implementation of reforms he
designed for the Defense Ministry. The Croatian army has yet to
adapt to a postwar state following Croatia's war with rebel Serbs.
	   Hebrang, who vowed to reorganize the army along NATO standards,
enjoyed the support of international officials in his endeavor.
	   Sarinic, who has been a loyal presidential aid since the
authoritarian leader rose to power in 1991, also broke ties with
Tudjman in a sign of protest against growing right-wing tendencies
within the party.
	   Gen. Pavao Miljavac is the first minister to have risen from
army ranks to hold the nation's top military post. It is unclear
whether he will continue Hebrang's reforms.
	   Ivica Kostovic, a mild-spoken phsycian, was expected to add some
balance to the government.
	   Nationalists, who nevertheless seemed to have tipped the scales
in their favor with the new moves, are suspicious of pro-western
ideas, while the reformers are more open toward integration into
European economic and political structures.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after he was targeted by gunfire,
Kazakstan's former premier was charged with a misdemeanor
Wednesday, his spokesman said. Aides believe both incidents were
attempts by the government to block him from running in the
upcoming presidential election.
	   Akezhan Kazhegeldin had just announced his plans to run for
president of the Central Asian country in January. An official
statement was expected Wednesday, but Kazhegeldin was shot at while
riding his horse Tuesday night.
	   Kazhegeldin, who was not hurt, went ahead with the official
announcement that he intended to run. Hours later, he was detained
by police, his spokesman said.
	   ``The assassination attempt was a warning, at least _ but he
made the announcement anyway,'' Kazhegeldin's spokesman Igor
Poberezhkin told The Associated Press.
	   ``The misdemeanor charge is clearly connected with the
announcement. The government's actions are so transparent. It
didn't even wait until another day,'' Poberezhkin said.
	   Kazhegeldin has been charged with ``participation in the
activities of an unregistered public association'' for attending a
founding meeting of the Movement for a Fair Election earlier this
month, the spokesman said. He was released from detention after the
charges were filed.
	   ``The charge itself is absurd ... no normal country has it,''
Poberezhkin said. ``But a public association cannot be registered
before it has even been founded.''
	   If convicted, Kazhegeldin would be blocked from running for
president in the former Soviet republic, Poberezhkin said. The
trial is scheduled for Thursday.
	   In his statement, Kazhegeldin said he was running because he
``cannot put up with the people's impoverishment, growing
unemployment and the danger of imminent catastrophe,'' the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Kazhegeldin resigned in 1997 for health reasons.
	   Meanwhile, President Nursultan Nazarbayev's spokesman, Kairat
Sarybayev, accused Kazhegeldin of circulating reports about the
attack to boost his popularity before the elections, Interfax
reported.
	   Two shots were fired at Kazhegeldin on Tuesday night while he
was riding near Almaty, Kazakstan's main city.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Right after cutting a deal with U.S.
negotiators to end the Kosovo crisis, President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a major crackdown on his Serb opponents by silencing two
independent Belgrade dailies.
	   Serbian police late Tuesday stormed the offices of Dnevni

shut them down for allegedly violating a recent government decree

Prince Charles complains over tabloid story about son's haircut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles, ever protective of his motherless
sons, will complain to a press watchdog over a tabloid newspaper
report Wednesday that Prince Harry had to have a close marine-style
haircut after an attempt to emulate a favorite soccer star's crop
went wrong.
	   Charles' office said he will write to the self-regulatory Press
Complaints Commission about the front-page story in The Mirror,
which said 14-year-old Harry and his classmates at prestigious Eton
College had tried to copy soccer player Michael Owen's short
haircut.
	   For effect, The Mirror published computer-generated images of
how ''Harry the skinhead'' might look. He is third in line to the
throne after his father and brother William, 16.
	   Sandy Henney, Charles' spokeswoman, said the story and pictures
``raise a general issue about the extent to which individual news
stories about Prince William and Prince Harry cumulatively
constitute an intrusion into their privacy.''
	   ``It is a matter of considerable concern to the Prince of Wales,
who will be raising the matter with the chairman of the Press
Complaints Commission and industry's Code of Practice Committee,''
which has drawn up rules on good practice, she said.
	   Mirror editor Piers Morgan said the newspaper had informed
Charles' office on Tuesday afternoon that it intended to publish
the story, and it ''never once raised any concerns with us that it
might be invading Harry's privacy.''
	   ``Indeed, they agreed with our belief that it was both amusing
and harmless and provided us with official confirmation,'' he said.
	   Since the death 14 months ago of Princess Diana in a Paris car
crash with photographers in pursuit, most British newspapers have
adhered to a request from the royal family to leave the young
princes alone.
	   Morgan said in the last year the Mirror ''has rejected countless
stories about both Prince William and Prince Harry ... as we have
no wish to cause either boy any upset by running invasive or
intrusive stories about their private lives.''

Russia to build emergency food reserves for winter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with additional Primakov quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government has created a dlrs 600 million
emergency food reserve to help the country through one of the
``most difficult and complex periods in its history,'' Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   A two-month old economic crisis has not caused food shortages,
and no serious problems are anticipated. But with food imports
falling sharply, and the grain harvest likely to be the smallest in
40 years, the government wants insurance against the vagaries of
the Russian winter.
	   ``The population will have secure supplies of fruit and
vegetables,'' Primakov told the upper house of parliament, the
Federation Council. But, he added, ``I must honestly say that we
have limited resources.''
	   The government has earmarked dlrs 600 million to stock up on
reserves that would last for two weeks and cover the needs of a
third of Russia's population, Primakov said.
	   The supplies would be primarily for ``special consumers'' and
``certain regions'' that Primakov did not name. However, it seemed
to be a reference to soldiers, who are poorly fed, and isolated
northern communities.
	   In a wide-ranging speech, Primakov's gave a gloomy assessment of
Russia's economic and social conditions, and said there was no easy
way out of the current crunch.
	   ``Russia is now passing through one of the most difficult and
complex periods in its history,'' Primakov said. ``We must join
efforts of the government and regional leaders to get out of the
crisis.''
	   Primakov has been in office for over a month, but his government
is still concocting a plan to revive Russia's rapidly contracting
economy.
	   Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin shook off the effects of a
cold and met with Primakov in the Kremlin on Wednesday. But the
president has said little about the country's recent troubles and
most of the burden for fixing the economy has fallen on Primakov.
	   The prime minister told the Federation Council that his top
priorities were to repay overdue wages owed to millions of workers,
restructure a banking system that has been crippled by the crisis,
and revamp an unwieldy tax system that is widely circumvented.
	   The government will help some of the larger banks, but will not
try to save all 1,500 of the country's banks.
	   ``Banks that are of great significance to the national economy,
but are not very viable at present, will receive assistance from
the government to survive,'' Primakov said. ``The banks that are
absolutely not viable will not survive.''
	   Primakov's government has started paying off overdue wages. But
it's facing an old problem _ government money allocated to regional
officials often disappears before its reaches the workers. Primakov
accused regional officials of turning a blind eye to such abuses.
	   The billions of rubles (dollars) in unpaid wages and pensions
across Russia are ``a social time bomb placed under our state,''
Primakov said.
	   The Federation Council, where Primakov spoke, is made up of
regional governors who have substantial power in their home
territories.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian ruble rose sharply Wednesday to 13 a
dollar, compared to 15 the previous day. Analysts said they
expected the ruble's resurgence to be short-lived and warned that
attempts to manipulate the rate may backfire and result in a sharp
drop of the currency.
	   The ruble traded at around 6 to the dollar before the crisis hit
two months ago.

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonian President Lennart Meri has
appointed Raul Malk, most recently ambassador to Great Britain, as
the country's new foreign minister.
	   The 46-year-old career diplomat replaces Toomas Ilves, who
resigned last month to devote more time to campaigning for national
elections in March..
	   Malk was to be sworn in before parliament Wednesday evening.
	   Under the new foreign minister, there should be no major shift
in Estonian foreign policy, which has made membership in the
European Union and NATO a high priority.
	   But Malk, who has also served as one of Estonia's main
negotiators with Moscow, may try to focus on Russian relations more
than his predecessor.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of
the turn of events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to
continue working ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must knock on wood, but it appears there will be no
airstrikes.''
	   The six-country Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov was to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to
attend the meeting, said ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Ivanov sounded triumphant Wednesday.
	   ``One can say with a great degree of confidence that we have
averted a threat of a military operation in Yugoslavia,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted him as saying.
	   Ivanov, who also met with Yeltsin on Wednesday, said the
president has instructed his officials to take ``the most active
part'' in the activities of the Kosovo mission of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation, meanwhile, left for Kosovo
to get a first-hand look at what is happening in the southern Serb
province and examine sites that could be targeted by NATO
airstrikes.
	   Neighboring Belarus also sent a government delegation to
Belgrade on Wednesday to discuss military aid to Yugoslavia.
Russia's parliament speaker has called on its Slavic neighbors to
help Yugoslavia, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has
promised military support _ though no soldiers.
	   The upper house of Russia's parliament, the Federation Council,
unanimously adopted a resolution ``calling on all parliaments of
the world, and the world community _ especially NATO members _ not
to allow military intervention in Yugoslavia's internal conflict.''
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, unanimously
approved a resolution Wednesday denouncing the ``NATO threat to
unleash a war against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   The Duma said it would view airstrikes against Serbia as ``an
act of aggression that would bear exceptionally severe consequences
for the world and for security in Europe.'' The resolution also
urged Yeltsin to consider military cooperation with Yugoslavia and
``correct'' Russia's position toward NATO.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov told a British parliamentary
delegation Wednesday that if NATO goes ahead with its plans for
military action, Russia may revoke its agreement on friendship and
cooperation with the alliance.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russians and Serbs are allies, both
being Slavic peoples that practice the Orthodox Christian religion.

Tens of thousands honor Orthodox saint who helped the poor 900
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people gathered
at a church in northeast Romania Wednesday to honor Saint
Parascheva, an 11th century Orthodox saint who offered sustenance
to the poor.
	   People lined up for hours to kiss a silver box said to hold
Parascheva's bones. She was known for feeding and clothing the poor
and offering shelter to the homeless.
	   Many people in impoverished Romania, where the average national
salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 125), feel the need to pray to her.
	   To mark the day, authorities in the city of Iasi set up tents
and provided traditional Romanian minced meat rolled in vine leaves
to feed a total of 2,500 people on what was a local holiday.
Overall, some 20,000 people were in Iasi for the celebration
broadcast live on television.
	   Government ministers and lawmakers from Bucharest also attended
a service in the city, some 325 kilometers (200 miles) northeast of
Bucharest.
	   Parascheva has been revered for the past 900 years.
	   Almost 90 percent of Romanians belong to the Orthodox Church.
Romanians are mystical people and faithfully honor saints' days and
religious feasts.

Reclusive Taliban leader promises to release all Iranian prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In an attempt to defuse tensions with
neighboring Iran, Afghanistan's reclusive Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar promised Wednesday to release ``all Iranian nationals
which are still in Afghanistan.''
	   An estimated 50 Iranians are believed to be in custody since
being captured when the Taliban overran the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
	   During the bloody takeover of its opponents' stronghold,
renegade Taliban troops killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist, launching a dangerous standoff along the border.
	   Omar made the promise to U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi
during negotiations that lasted more than three hours in the
Taliban's stronghold of Kandahar.
	   The Iranian leader also agreed to a meeting with Iran, which
Brahimi said ``needs to take place urgently.''
	   While the venue is not set, both Iran and the Taliban appear
willing to meet either in Saudi Arabia, where the Organization of
Islamic Conference is based, or at U.N. offices in New York, Geneva
or Vienna.
	   ``I really believe we do have a good bases to start to defuse
the tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the
Taliban,'' Brahimi said.
	   Brahimi is the first envoy of the U.N. secretary-general to meet
face-to-face with Omar, the man who has undisputed control over the
hard-line Taliban movement, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   In a statement upon his return from Kandahar to Pakistan,
Brahimi said: ``I think we covered a lot of ground''.
	   An exception was made to the U.N. travel ban on Afghanistan to
let Brahimi go to Kandahar to try to defuse the tensions on the
Afghan border with Iran, where more than 270,000 Iranian troops are
deployed and backed up by hundreds of tanks and scores of fighter
jets.
	   The United Nations pulled its international staff out of
Afghanistan on Aug. 21 after an Italian U.N. worker was killed and
a second worker wounded in apparent retaliation for the U.S.
missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   According to Brahimi Omar condemned the killing of the Iranian
diplomats and vowed to find the culprits, who ``will receive their
just retribution.''
	   In Taliban-ruled territory convicted murderers are publicly
executed, the hands of thieves are amputated and violators of
lesser crimes are publicly beaten.
	   The punishments, the Taliban say are in line with Islamic
teachings.
	   According to Brahimi, Omar ``sincerely regretted the deaths of
the diplomats sympathizing with the families of victims. Because of
his own experience and the experience of all Afghans he understands
very well their feelings.''
	   After 20 years of relentless fighting, Brahimi said there is not
an Afghan family that has not suffered a death.
	   The former ambassador of Algeria said upon his arrival in
Kandahar earlier Wednesday he was taken ``to a very sad place''
where several fresh graves were visible and ``many bodies'' were
waiting to be buried.
	   He said the sight, one he would not soon forget, only reinforces
the urgency of a peaceful end to the bloodletting devastating
Afghanistan and dividing its people.

Border deaths reported: two in Kosovo, one in Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two separate border incidents
claimed the lives of three ethnic Albanians, two in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province and one in neighboring Macedonia, media
reported Wednesday.
	   Two men died in a landmine explosion Tuesday night at the
Albanian border with Serbia's strife-torn Kosovo province, the
ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said.
	   The accident reportedly occurred near Ponosevac. The border
region had been mined by the Yugoslav army, the Center also said.
	   Another ethnic Albanian was killed in a separate incident
Tuesday, this one at the Macedonian-Albanian border, said
Macedonia's defense ministry.
	   The ministry said the incident occurred near Banjiste after five
smugglers attempted to illegally cross into Albania with a stolen
vehicle.
	   A border patrol ordered the vehicle to halt but the smugglers
disobeyed the instructions and shooting ensued, killing the ethnic
Albanian from Macedonia.
	   The rest of the group escaped into Albania.

Angola's former foes said to be fighting in northern region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan army said Wednesday it killed
93 soldiers of the former rebel movement UNITA in clashes in the
north of the country, further demonstrating the weakness of the
country's four-year-old peace pact.
	   UNITA, however, denied there had been fighting between the two
sides and claimed the government had sent its forces on ``a
manhunt'' against UNITA supporters in the area.
	   Both sides' claims underline the prevailing mutual hostility as
the United Nations struggles to prevent the 1994 peace pact, which
ended a two-decade civil war, from collapsing.
	   The deputy commander of government forces in province, Tome
Neto, said his troops killed the UNITA soldiers during fighting
near the city of Uije on Tuesday.
	   UNITA secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato said there was no
combat between the former foes.
	   ``It's a manhunt, not war,'' Lukamba Gato said by telephone from
UNITA's central highland stronghold Bailundo.
	   Government forces killed or jailed anyone who said they were
loyal to UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, Lukamba Gato alleged.
	   The U.N. spokesman in Luanda said he had no information about
fighting in Uije province.
	   ``It's very difficult to cross-check'' the reports of fighting,
spokesman Hamadoun Toure said. ``There are no independent sources
of information.''
	   The U.N. over the past four years has scaled down its peace
monitoring force in the huge southwest African nation from 7,000 to
just 800.
	   The Security Council is to decide Thursday on Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's proposal to extend the U.N. mandate in Angola to
April.
	   UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland strongholds to
the government, claiming government troops and police have
committed human rights abuses in areas already handed over.
	   The government claims UNITA has kept a guerrilla army hidden in
the bush in contravention of the peace accord.

Honduran hotels ask government to stop Indian protest at Mayan
</HEADLINE>
ruins &QL; 
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ About 1,000 Indians have been
blocking the entrances to the Copan ruins to demand a share of the
tourist attraction's revenue, and hotel owners on Wednesday asked
the president to intervene.
	   An estimated 200,000 tourists visit the Copan Archaeological
Park every year to see the Mayan ruins 100 miles (180 kilometers)
west of Tegucigalpa, the capital. In 1980, the United Nations
declared it a protected historical site.
	   The park takes in dlrs 800,000 a year from tourism, and the
Chorti Indians who have shut the park for four days say they
deserve 25 percent of that income.
	   They also are demanding the punishment of the killers of 43 of
their leaders in the past six years. Authorities say the killings
are carried out by soldiers hired by landowners, who are trying to
take over Indian territory, but none of the crimes has been
punished.
	   The Honduran Hotel Association said the protest is causing great
losses to at least 26 hotels, and on Wednesday asked President
Carlos Flores Facusse to find a quick solution.
	   ``Many reservations from tourists in the United States, Japan,
Germany and Argentina have been canceled because of the Indian
protest,'' said the association's president, Anastasius Anastasius.
	   ``I have asked the president to intervene as soon as possible in
this case so that tourists are no longer bothered ... and I expect
an official decision very soon.''
	   The government refused to comment.
	   About 600,000 of Honduras' 6.1 million people are Indian. Most
of them live in extreme poverty.

Al Pacino filming scenes of upcoming film in Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The dusty streets of Arab towns in Israel have
became the latest of several locations where Oscar-winner Al Pacino
is filming scenes for his upcoming film.
	   The star of ``The Godfather,'' trilogy spent Tuesday and
Wednesday shooting scenes for the film, ``Man of the People,''
where his character, a ``60 Minutes'' producer, interviews a leader
of the Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, the daily
Yediot Ahronot reported.
	   When plans for filming in Lebanon fell through, predominately
Arab towns in Israel were chosen instead, including Umm al-Fahm,
the site of violent clashes last month between Israeli police and
Arabs involving a land dispute.
	   Scenes for the film have also been shot in several locations
around the United States.

Labor offers to form coalition to take power in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After a half-century as the major solo force
in Norwegian politics, the country's largest party, Labor, on
Wednesday offered to form its first postwar coalition if the
current minority government falls.
	   `The Labor Party has never done that in the postwar period, but
this is a special situation,'' Labor leader Thorbjorn Jagland, who
resigned as prime minister a year ago. Jagland said such a
coalition was the only way to form a strong government with a
virtually deadlocked parliament.
	   Labor has ruled Norway for most of the past 50 years, and is
largely responsible for building the country's cradle-to-grave
welfare state. Jagland did not say when he might make a bid for
power, or what parties he would consider as partners.
	   A three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne
Bondevik formed a government a year ago after Jagland and his party
resigned following a disappointing national election.
	   Bondevik's government has sought support from both the right and
left political wings. However, early talks on its proposed 1999
national were deadlocked, and many analysts say the coalition, with
just 42 seats in the 165-member parliament, could fall over its
economic plan.
	   ``Labor does not believe Norway can be managed in this way,''
said Jagland about the uncertain parliamentary backing for the
current government. He said Labor this autumn would present ``a
stabilization program'' for the country.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil export, has been stung by
low oil prices, the global economic crisis and fears that a
six-year economic boom was on the verge of a downturn and possible
recession.
	   A coalition would need 83 seats in parliament to form a majority
government. Labor has 65, or 18 short of a majority. Its
traditional, the Socialist Left, has nine seats, meaning that at
least one more of the seven parties in parliament would have to
join a majority government.

Romanian parliament votes to allow NATO to use its airspace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Amid noisy protests by nationalists,
Romania's parliament on Wednesday voted to allow NATO use the
country's airspace in emergency situations if the alliance launches
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   ``We cannot join NATO by being arm in arm with Milosevic,''
Defense Minister Victor Babiuc told a joint session of the
Parliament, which approved the decision by a 244-160 vote.
	   NATO asked last week to use Romania's airspace as it was
considering airstrikes to force Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic to agree to end a crackdown against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province.
	   Parliament's vote confirmed a decision by the Supreme Defense
Council, which said the army would not participate in any NATO
military action against its neighbor Yugoslavia.
	   ``Romania has never intended and does not intend to get involved
militarily in the conflict,'' Babiuc said, adding that Romania's
position does not violate the two countries' bilateral treaty
because ``no act of aggression is included.''
	   Romania was torn between traditional friendship with Serbia and
its aspirations to join NATO and many people are concerned that
fighting may spill over into Romania.
	   Parliament also said that Romania would send humanitarian aid to
the province including medical assistance, shelters for refugees,
home builders and peace keeping ts.
	   Most lawmakers said that their vote was motivated by the
upcoming winter and the plight of the refugees.
	   ``We cannot let 250,000 homeless people hiding in the woods and
mountains in the middle of the frost,'' said Deputy Ludovic
Rackoczi of the Hungarian Democratic Union.
	   Nationalists claimed the conflict in Kosovo is an external
matter and NATO should look at other trouble spots.
	   ``Why does NATO not handle conflicts in Northern Ireland or the
racist tensions in the United States?'' said Corneliu Vadim Tudor,
the extremist leader of the Greater Romania Party.
	   Romania and Yugoslavia have a common land and water border of
550 kilometers (344 miles).

Researchers stress need for autopsies after disturbing cancer
</HEADLINE>

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ At a time when autopsies are on the decline, a
10-year study of the procedure at one U.S. hospital revealed a
significant number of cancers that had not been found during the
patients' lives, researchers reported today.
	   The researchers said their findings, reported in The Journal of
the American Medical Association, confirm the importance of the
autopsy in an age when the procedure has been declining in use.
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Elizabeth C. Burton of Louisiana
State University Medical Center's Department of Pathology in New
Orleans, found a discrepancy of 44 percent when they reviewed 1,105
cases.
	   The researchers found that 100 patients autopsied at the Medical
Center of Louisiana at New Orleans had developed 111 undiagnosed or
misdiagnosed cancers. Worse was the finding that cancer was the
immediate cause of death for 57 of the 100 patients.
	   The hospital is a large teaching facility encompassing two
medical schools, Louisiana State University and Tulane University
schools of medicine.
	   The researchers noted that the Medical Center of Louisiana
serves a mainly indigent population, so malignancies might have
been masked by other, more acute problems when the patients were
treated.
	   The usefulness of autopsies is a subject of much debate with
some saying it is an unnecessary diagnostic tool because of
advancing technology, the study noted.
	   ``Despite technological advances, the number of inaccurate
clinical diagnoses (attributed to both malignancies and all other
causes) remains alarmingly high,'' the researchers wrote.
	   They concluded that, instead of abandoning the autopsy, ``we
should recognize its importance in our understanding of disease.''
	   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. George D. Lundberg, the
journal's editor, expressed concern about the continual decline of
autopsy rates.
	   According to the study, autopsy rates have fallen from an
estimated 50 percent in the 1960s to an average of 10 percent today
in teaching hospitals. In community-based hospitals, the rate is as
low as 5 percent, they said.
	   ``The autopsy is not dead, but it slumbers deeply. ... It is not
exactly a conspiracy of silence or necessarily a massive
intentional cover-up, but it is a movement with millions of
players, all in complicity for widely varying reasons with the
final result of 'do not bother me with the truth' on the sickest
patients _ the ones who die,'' Lundberg wrote.

Albanian refugees, distrusting Milosevic, in no hurry to return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKS, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Although Yugoslavia's president promised
to end his brutal crackdown in Kosovo, ethnic Albanian refugees
driven from their homes by Serb bullets don't believe him.
	   ``He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!'' Hajdin Mehmeti shouted
Wednesday. The refugees' distrust of President Slobodan Milosevic
has kept them from returning home.
	   Mehmeti, 70, is an ethnic Albanian refugee in this hamlet on a
mud road deep in the forested hills about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northwest of Pristina, capital of the beleaguered Kosovo province
of Serbia.
	   The near-universal belief that Milosevic can't be trusted is one
of the principal reasons why Mehmeti and hundreds of thousands like
him are in no hurry to move back to their shattered villages and
homes to take up new lives in the aftermath of the deal struck
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   There are other reasons, of course. Many have no homes to return
to. Only charred remains, or shells of houses with no roofs, or
gutted, looted, windowless structures unfit for human habitation.
	   The agreement in Belgrade calls for withdrawal of significant
numbers of special police forces and army troops from Kosovo, the
poor southern province of Serbia and for monitoring by about 2,000
unarmed civilians under the auspices of the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Serbia is the dominant of the two remaining states in the
Yugoslav federation.
	   Many refugees simply shake their heads at the prospect of
unarmed monitors keeping the peace in this land of deep hatreds, a
land where the role of the police is not to protect the people but
to serve the interests of the state.
	   ``I don't think the plan will work,'' said Maher Shpati, 24,
sitting on the cement floor of a partially finished house with a
roomful of relatives, a pan of potatoes simmering on an iron stove.
The owner of the house has fled.
	   Mehmeti agreed on the need for force.
	   ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say whatever
people want to hear,'' said Mehmeti. ``One hundred times he has
lied.''
	   ``We trust in you,'' he said, embracing an American visitor.
``But in him? Never!''
	   All over Kosovo, people are saying the same thing. Nobody feels
safe as long as the fearsome Serb special police in their blue
camouflage uniforms are patrolling the towns and villages of the
province.
	   ``There are police based in our village, so we can't go back,''
said Isa Veliqi, 36, living with seven members of his family in a
shed behind a destroyed farmhouse. ``If the observers come, maybe
we can really go home.''
	   But, unarmed observers?
	   The idea leaves some people speechless.
	   ``I don't know what they are going to do here without guns,''
said Shpati.
	   The Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, a small force that came
here in July to monitor refugees, security and freedom of movement,
but which pulled out on Monday when NATO bombing looked imminent,
has returned. KDOM, as it's called, is made up of an American,
European Union and Russian units.
	   The KDOM observers are now spearheading the OSCE mission, and
eventually will be absorbed by it, a Western diplomat said. The
question now is how fast can this thing get going.
	   It will take weeks to recruit, train and deploy large numbers of
people in the field. And today's chill autumn winds in Kosovo will
be freezing soon. Thousands of people living with little more than
sheets of plastic to keep out the elements simply don't have weeks
to wait. They need help now.
	   It is difficult to verify whether or not Milosevic is keeping
his word about withdrawing police and troops. The police presence
did not appear diminished on Wednesday, as officials at NATO
headquarters noted, and no convoys of withdrawing forces were seen.
	   The Belgrade agreement allows the West to conduct aerial
reconnaissance flights, but they, too, offer small comfort to a
refugee faced with a police pistol or automatic weapon.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday
that he is optimistic about upcoming talks in the United States
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a further Israeli
withdrawal from occupied lands.
	   ''I am optimistic because of the energy and the time that have
been invested by President Clinton,'' Arafat said following an
hour-long meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   'I personally believe this is a window of opportunity.''
	   Clinton is pushing Arafat and Netanyahu to conclude an agreement
on an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Arafat said he was not discouraged by the new prominence in the
Israeli delegation of the hawkish former general Ariel Sharon,
recently appointed foreign minister. ''Don't forget that Sharon
took part with (late prime minister) Menachem Begin of the
withdrawal from the Sinai after the Camp David Agreement,'' Arafat
said.

Meciar party's attempt to form a new government is bound to fail,
</HEADLINE>
official says &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The attempt of Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar's party to form a strong coalition government
likely will fail, Jan Smerek, the official appointed to undertake
the effort, said Wednesday.
	   Smerek met with representatives of the opposition Party of the
Democratic Left for negotiations about forming a joint government.
But the reformed Communists _ the only party that did not rule out
cooperation with Meciar's party _ signalled afterward this was
unthinkable.
	   ``We want to form the future government, but not with Meciar's
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, or with the (rightist) Slovak
National Party,'' said Pavol Kanis, vice chairman of the Party of
the Democratic Left.
	   Smerek, Meciar's candidate for prime minister, admitted he was a
pragmatist and had no illusions. ``This attempt to form a
govenrment will ... end before the first session of Parliament on
Oct. 29,'' he told reporters.
	   The Party of the Democratic left became the key party after the
Sept. 25-26 parliamentary elections in which Meciar's party gained
the most seats, but not enough by far to form a government with a
solid majority in Parliament.
	   The opposition parties opposed to Meciar, who earlier this month
said he would not serve as a new government chief, gained a
combined 93 seats, but without the Party of the Democratic Left
they would not hold a sufficiently broad majority to enact
constitutional changes.
	   Meanwhile new discord appeared in opposition ranks.
	   The Hungarian Coalition Party, which represents 550,000 ethnic
Hungarians living in Slovakia, and the Party of Civil Understanding
are unhappy with the role assigned to them by the bigger opposition
parties in the new government.
	   Both parties were asking for two ministerial posts as well as a
deputy premiership each. But a document reportedly drafted by the
two bigger parties gives them a minor role.

Woods, O'Meara fighting damp, dank British weather
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA, WATER, England (AP) _ The damp, dank British weather
is getting to Tiger Woods and his buddy Mark O'Meara.
	   As two of the four seeded players, they have byes when the
12-man World Match Play Championship starts Thursday at the
Wentworth Club south of London. Good thing, since they're both on
antibiotics and praying that rain abates _ as predicted _ for their
quarterfinals Friday.
	   Woods picked up the bug in Scotland last week at the Dunhill
Cup, and O'Meara was fighting the flu and sinus problems when he
arrived at St. Andrews from Florida.
	   Like top-seeded Vijay Singh (defending champion) and Ernie Els,
the three-time champion here, the Thursday bye is valuable in a
grinding event that calls for 36 holes daily.
	   ``Eight rounds in four days is a lot of golf on this kind of
golf course where it's wet and soft,'' Woods said. ``Only playing
six rounds is a distinct advantage, no doubt about it.''
	   In the first round, Steve Stricker faces Patrik Sjoland, Colin
Montgomerie plays Thomas Bjorn, Lee Westwood is up against Stuart
Appleby and Darren Clarke plays Ian Woosnam.
	   Woods, sniffling and clearing his throat, suggested Wednesday he
plays well when he feels bad. And he still managed to crack a joke.
	   ``I had the flu at Disney (1996) with a 102 degree fever and I
shot 66 to win the tournament,'' he said. ``When I got home my
fever was 104.2.
	   ``Anybody who is sick usually plays well,'' he added. ``You
conserve yourself a little bit better, you expect less of yourself.
When you're sick, you often see guys with their best rounds.''
	   Then he turned to a reporter and dead-panned, ``I'm not that
pleased. Better you had it than me.''
	   O'Meara, despite a daily regime of six or seven vitamins begun
18 months ago, has broken down in Britain.
	   ``It's no big deal,'' he said. ``It's really the first time I
haven't felt well in a year and a half.''
	   ``Tiger's got the potential here, but he's got his work cut out
if he wants to win this _ just like everybody else.'
	   Woods, the No.-1 ranked player in the world (a rating based on
stroke play) is also tough in match play. And he's sure to draw
large galleries from nearby London.
	   ``I consider myself up there in match play with some other guys
like Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), obviously,'' said Woods, who is
playing this event _ and the 7,006-yard tree-line West Course at
Wentworth _ for the first time.
	   ``I do consider myself a good match-play player with my history
of winning six USGA titles. That's not too bad.''
	   ``I like the one-on-one, the head-to-head,'' he added. ``In
professional golf you don't get this chance very often. There are
only a couple per year where you go head-to-head in match play.''
	   Wentworth's tree-line, narrow fairways _ made longer by recent
rains _ should favor straight hitters. And the soft, flat greens
should lend themselves to U.S.-style target golf, a 100-percent
turn from last week's links golf at St. Andrews.
	   Els is again a favorite, although he said his game ``isn't quite
where it was last year.'' The smooth-swinging South African won
three straight ('94, '95, '96) and lost to Singh in last year's
final.
	   ``I've been in the finals four straight times and I don't want
to let go,'' he said. ``I've had a good run on this course and in
this tournament.''
	   Els will face either Westwood or Appleby in the quarterfinals
with Woods looming in the semifinals _ if Woods can get by Clarke
or two-time winner Woosnam in the quarters.
	   Would he relish a Woods-Els match? ``No, not really,'' said Els.
``I wouldn't say I'm running scared or anything, but he's a very
good match player and tough to beat.''
	   In the other bracket, Singh will face either Stricker or Sjoland
in the quarterfinals with O'Meara getting the Montgomerie-Bjorn
winner.

Feminine and Softer at Givenchy and all Over Town

	   PARIS (AP) - Smart. feminine and sexy, Alexander McQueen's
offering for Givenchy's spring ready-to-wear had plenty of bare
backs and skin to titillate.
	   But it was softer than some of his past offerings, as the
keynote was girlish and feminine in most recent collections.
	   Though Givenchy was shown Wednesday in a somber sports arena on
the edge of Paris, there was little sporty to cheer about. The
nearest to that was some of those excellent Savile Row-style
trouser suits, in soft grays, blues, the occasional hazy patterns
on a kind of panne velvet.
	   Shoulders are nicely toned down from the knife-like levels of
before, and overall even tailored suits looked feminine.
	   Givenchy fans wanting originality can look for dresses with
sling-draped details, plastron blouses with sleeve garters over
ruffles, plus black satin short skirts, some pedal-pushers in
satiny fabrics.
	   Softening up throughout, McQueen had plenty of slinky gowns with
draped cowl backs, bare backs, and one amazing sparkly strapless
pleated sheath presumably held up by magic - stand-out with no
shaping at the bust.
	   The swimsuit in two sequined black diamonds covering essentials
was a steamy stunner, but you'd have to be perfection to wear it.
	   Little bare-backed lurex-sparkle sheaths looked great for a
disco, and the geometrics embroidered in bold swaths on both
tailored trouser suits and short sheath dresses were winners for
this collection.
	   Stella McCartney's collection for Chloe, shown at the Paris
Stock Exchange, was fun, young, funky at times, and very feminine.
	   Dad Paul McCartney was there cheering in the front row, in one
of his first big public sorties since Linda died last summer.
Stella devoted the collection to her mother.
	   Stella toned down her strumpet look of last time, into trumpet
or tulip skirts, daintily stepping down the runway in satiny, crepe
de chine fabric blends, and airbrushed patterns of vines and
florals on pastel, ruffled or lace-edged skirts and tops.
	   McCartney still is into lingerie lines, with a few of the
corselets she brought out in Chloe debut a year ago. The funky side
of things was in air-brushed loud sunset and nature scenes on
slithery or stretchy t-shirt styles, strapless dresses and a few
pantsuits.
	   Raffia weaves make a great background from some of the bolero
jackets and capes, plus raffia weaves as couture-style embroidery.
	   McCartney 's excellent trouser suits in seersucker featured a
few worn with a waistcoat-like jacket - good in whites and
yellow-gold.
	   Feminine, light clothes are drifting down all runways, not least
at Emanuel Ungaro, who did them in very haute luxe style.
	   Summery was the mood as he carpeted a Louvre Carrousel theater
in grass. And outfits looked both ethereal and down to earth, from
the gray crochet-knit sweaters over light grayish pants with wispy
flower and garland prints to the many print chiffon long dresses
with their soft destructured jackets.
	   ``I loved it,'' said actress Marisa Berenson, sitting in the
audience next to Anouk Aimee. ``Light, easy, wearable and so
contemporary.''
	   Yves Saint Laurent's show was by his studio workers, awaiting
the debut of American Alber Elbaz next March.
	   But it had some good old classic touches, from the great wide
blue-gray pants and white jacket with a t-shirt and turban to the
gray glen plaid trouser suit with a vest-jacket.
	   Quality is right up there with the best of YSL's own classics,
not only in t|$ident will host a huge party to celebrate Saint Laurent's forty
years in the business at the famed Moulin Rouge in Pigalle.

Defying censorship, Milosevic bans two dailies

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Right after cutting a deal with U.S.
negotiators to end the Kosovo crisis, President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a major crackdown on his Serb opponents by silencing two
independent Belgrade dailies.
	   Serbian police late Tuesday stormed the offices of Dnevni
Telegraf and Danas, both critical of Milosevic's government, and
shut them down for allegedly violating a recent government decree
that required self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   ``Serbia is heading toward complete dictatorship and this must
be stopped,'' the manager and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf,
Slavko Curuvija, told The Associated Press. He said up to now his
paper could write about such a danger and ``now we can't even do
that.''
	   Curuvija said that just as international pressure seems to ease,
Milosevic's regime is seeking to eliminate prominent opponents at
home, ``to suppress the last free voices.''
	   Dnevni Telegraf's popular columnist Aleksandar Tijanic, known
for his lucid and cynical commentaries often targeting the
government, said, ``This is not only about two papers, not only the
struggle to keep publishing, this is a clash between two Serbias.''
	   ``One is a xenophobic, conservative, anti-European Serbia,''
Tijanic said, referring to Milosevic's policies, ``and the other is
liberal, democratic, open to the world. This is the beginning of an
internal cold war,'' Tijanic said Wednesday.
	   In Vienna, the International Press Institute XXX condemned the
move against the two newspapers as a violation of the U.N.
Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
	   Last week, the Serbian government issued a decree punishing
companies, institutions and individuals who act contrary to the
government's view of patriotic behavior.
	   Open to interpretation and misuse, the decree was presented as
necessary at a time of NATO threats of intervention in Kosovo where
government forces fought against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Milosevic's authorities claim the Kosovo crisis and the
resulting NATO threats were made worse by reports by foreign and
independent media in Serbia. The decree made it a taboo to report
on the threats, military preparations or other developments which,
allegedly, could cause alarm among Serbians.
	   The decree also banned Serbian-language radio news programs
produced abroad _ by the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, BBC
and others _ and transmitted locally.
	   The latest of Milosevic's many crackdowns on independent media
came hours after he announced that the NATO threat was off due to
an agreement he reached with U.S. negotiators on Kosovo.
	   Dnevni Telegraf, with a circulation of 80,000, mocked the
restrictive decree, regularly reporting developments with notes
that ``We have not reported this: ...'' or ``Respecting the decree,
we are not saying that ... .''
	   Reporters, editors and other staff in the two dailies tried to
argue with about a dozen law enforcement officers, who eventually
pushed them out, preventing them from updating their homepage
(www.dtelegraf.co.yu).
	   On Saturday, the authorities shut down Belgrade's, Index Radio,
citing its lack of broadcast license.
	   Also on Wednesday, the independent Nasa Borba daily _ ignoring
an order _ published a warning it received from Serbia's
Information Ministry saying it would shut down the paper for
allegedly violating the notorious decree.

Inter Milan ready to give up on defender once touted as star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale was set to ship Salvatore
Fresi back to fellow Serie A club Salernitana, a Milan team
spokesman said Wednesday, effectively giving up on a player once
touted as the Italian national team's sweeper of the future.
	   Fresi, 25, has appeared in just one league game for Inter this
season, his fourth with the team since it acquired him from
Salernitana in 1995.
	   He starred on Italy's Under-21 team, appearing 20 times and
helping the side win two European Championships. He has never
managed to crack the lineup with the main team, though he has been
called up three separate times.

Local favorite Chang crashes out in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Unseeded German Michael Kohlmann overcame a
first-set loss to stun American Michael Chang 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 on
Wednesday, robbing the Singapore Open of its biggest draw and a
favorite of the locals.
	   Despite claiming the Heineken Open in Shanghai, China, on
Monday, the loss to Kohlmann was the second consecutive year Chang
has been eliminated in the first round in Singapore, a
predominantly ethnic Chinese city-state.
	   ``A loss is a loss no matter when it is but this is incredibly
frustrating,'' said Chang, who has fallen to 25th in ATP Tour
rankings. ``I don't know why I've been struggling in Singapore for
the last couple of years.''
	   Chang added that he was tired because of his tournament title on
Monday, when he beat Goran Ivanisevic in the final.
	   Ivanisevic, also participating in Singapore, cruised through his
preliminary round match against Steve Campbell of the United
States, taking just 45 minutes to win 6-2, 6-1.
	   The 13th-ranked Croatian aced his young American opponent 11
times.
	   In second-round play, also on Wednesday, Australian teen-ager
Lleyton Hewitt outlasted Justin Gimelstob of the United States 6-7
(6-8), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) in a 2 1-2-hour marathon.

NATO says Yugoslav president not complying with Kosovo agreement

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The NATO alliance said Wednesday
that Slobodan Milosevic was not meeting international demands to
restore peace in Kosovo, and several officials warned the Yugoslav
leader that airstrikes were still possible.
	   NATO expects to sign a deal Friday with Yugoslavia that would
let NATO reconnaissance planes fly over the troubled Serb province
and monitor whether Milosevic is complying with his agreement to
end the Kosovo crackdown. Other officials noted that NATO planes
were arriving at bases in Italy.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned the Yugoslav
president Wednesday that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs
down on the agreement to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace
talks with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the monitors into
Kosovo to verify compliance.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said it's time to focus on
compliance and not threats, ``but the bombers are ready, and if
necessary we'll return to that emergency phase, which is not quite
over.''
	   Those steps are designed to end the seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian separatists, an operation that has killed
hundreds and left up to 300,000 people homeless. NATO gave
Milosevic until Saturday morning (0500 GMT) to comply or face
airstrikes.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency said it resumed aid convoys,
which were suspended Monday before Milosevic bowed to international
demands. U.N. officials said many refugees were still hiding in the
hills and forests, fearing Serb reprisals if they go home.
	   ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' said U.N.
spokesman Kris Janowski. ``And that needs to be allayed.''
	   In order to build such confidence, the agreement reached this
week with Holbrooke provides about 2,000 international monitors to
be stationed in Kosovo. But the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is responsible for the mission, must
ask its 54 member governments to provide the monitors.
	   OSCE officials said it could take weeks before all 2,000 are in
the province.
	   ``I'm worried that the international community will be too slow
and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six months to
get there when we need them there in six days or at least six
weeks,'' Holbrooke told the U.S. television network CNN.
	   Holbrooke said the Russians, who had opposed NATO airstrikes,
also have agreed to participate in aerial monitoring.
	   In the meantime, American, Canadian and European diplomats
returned Wednesday to begin forming the ground monitor force. The
diplomats had been working as observers in Kosovo since July but
were evacuated last week for fear of Serb reprisals if NATO
attacked.
	   Also, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo authorized American officials
to return to the Serb-held half of Bosnia.
	   In the hills about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of
Pristina, some refugees said Wednesday that they don't trust
Milosevic and have no confidence in the ability of unarmed monitors
to guarantee their safety.
	   ``He is lying that they are withdrawing their forces,'' said a
56-year-old refugee, who gave his name only as Hasan. ``They are
here. There are tanks dug in the ground.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   In a step toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan
for a separate parliament in Kosovo. The plan, announced late
Tuesday, includes local elections in 1999 in the separatist
province. According to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have
their own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   The government also said elections in Kosovo would be held
within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe them.
And it offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters not suspected
of war crimes.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose independence for Kosovo,
fearing it could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   In Moscow, the upper house of Russia's parliament adopted a
resolution Wednesday urging ``the world community _ especially NATO
members _ not to allow military intervention in Yugoslavia's
internal conflict.'' The lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
also drafted a resolution denouncing the ``NATO threat to unleash a
war'' against Yugoslavia.
	   Meanwhile, Romania's parliament voted to let NATO use the
country's airspace in emergency situations if the alliance launches
airstrikes.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
expressed concern Wednesday that governments will move too slowly
to send international monitors to Kosovo to make sure Yugoslavia
complies with the deal to end the conflict in the secessionist
province.
	   Envoys of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation meet Thursday at their Vienna headquarters to approve
the 2,000-member ``ground verification mission,'' part of the deal
Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The Yugoslav government is supposed to guarantee the safety of
the team members, who will not carry weapons. Their presence is
expected to ensure thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees that it is
safe to return home. Ethnic Albanians are the vast majority in the
province in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In an interview with the U.S. television network CNN, Holbrooke
said he was not worried about the safety of the team.
	   ``I'm not worried about their safety right now,'' Holbrooke said
in New York. ``I'm worried that the international community will be
too slow and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six
months to get there when we need them there in six days or at least
six weeks.''
	   He urged major governments and veterans of previous
international missions to contact the OSCE as soon as possible and
offer personnel.
	   In Stockholm, the OSCE's chairman indicated that there would be
no lengthy delays.
	   ``The 2,000-member team is ready to go as soon as possible,''
said the chairman, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek. He
declined to speculate when that would be, but added that a
technical advance force would leave ``immediately'' after the
agreement was signed.

Latvia, Kyrgyzstan cleared to join WTO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Latvia and Kyrgyzstan are set to become the first
former Soviet republics to join the World Trade Organization after
members on Wednesday approved their entry.
	   The trade body's general council gave the final green light for
the two to join. Their parliaments now have to ratify the terms of
entry agreed with the WTO.
	   Kyrgyzstan has agreed to reduce import tariffs on goods
including some energy products, chemicals and paper.
	   It also committed itself to open international and long-distance
telephone services to foreign suppliers by Jan. 1, 2003, and to
lift a 49 percent equity limit for foreigners in insurance
companies by January 2002.
	   Latvia also agreed to open telephone services to outside
suppliers by 2003.
	   Kyrgyzstan first applied for membership in 1996. Latvia applied
to join the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, in 1993.
	   The accession of Latvia and Kyrgyzstan will enlarge the WTO to
134 members. Some 30 further countries have WTO applications under
consideration.

Amid calls for higher taxes, oil production to be lower in 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Crude oil production in Russia will be down
overall this year by more than five million metric tons (35 million
barrels), though oil exports are significantly up so far in 1998, a
government official said Wednesday.
	   Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov told Russian
parliamentary deputies that the country's oil output will fall to
292 million metric tons (2 billion barrels) in 1998, a 1.9 percent
drop from last year, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Oil output is likely to continue its downward slide next year.
Russia could produce 270 million metric tons (1.8 billion barrels)
in 1999 _ a 10 percent drop from the 1997 level, Generalov said.
	   He attributed the predicted drop to sinking oil prices on the
world market.
	   At the same time, however, oil exports have soared by 10 percent
to 84.7 million metric tons (580 million barrels) in the first
eight months of the year because oil companies are desperate for
hard currency in the wake of Russia's financial crisis and the
devaluation of the ruble, Generalov said.
	   At the same meeting, Finance Ministry Mikhail Zadornov defended
his plan to increase taxes on the oil industry, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``We face a choice of implementing targeted taxes on those who
can pay, or switching on the printing presses, which would spark
inflation,'' Zadornov said.
	   He has proposed levying a tax of ten European currency units
(dlrs 11) per ton on all oil exports. Oil companies should be able
to pay because they profited from the devaluation of Russia's
ruble, Zadornov said.
	   But Fuel and Energy Minister Generalov called for a simpler
overall taxation system and more government support for the oil
industry.
	   With capital investment in the oil industry stopped and wage
arrears to oil workers totaling 3.7 billion rubles (dlrs 230
million), the government should create a more streamlined taxation
system by getting rid of some taxes, Generalov said.
	   Because of Russia's financial crisis, the oil industry will
probably let go between 100,000 and 150,000 people at some point,
mostly in the country's north, he said.

	   PARIS (AP) - Smart, feminine and sexy, Alexander McQueen's
offering for Givenchy's spring ready-to-wear had plenty of bare
backs and skin to titillate.
	   But it was softer than some of his past offerings, as the
keynote was girlish and feminine.
	   Though Givenchy was shown Wednesday in a somber sports arena on
the edge of Paris, there was little sporty to cheer about. The
nearest to that was some of those excellent Savile Row-style
trouser suits, in soft grays, blues, the occasional hazy patterns
on a kind of panne velvet.
	   Shoulders are nicely toned down from the knife-like levels of
before, and overall even tailored suits looked feminine.
	   Givenchy fans wanting originality can look for dresses with
sling-draped details, plastron blouses with sleeve garters over
ruffles, plus black satin short skirts, some pedal-pushers in
satiny fabrics.
	   Softening up throughout, McQueen had plenty of slinky gowns with
draped cowl backs, bare backs, and one amazing sparkly strapless
pleated sheath presumably held up by magic - stand-out with no
shaping at the bust.
	   The swimsuit in two sequined black diamonds covering essentials
was a steamy stunner, but you'd have to be perfection to wear it.
	   Little bare-backed lurex-sparkle sheaths looked great for a
disco, and the geometrics embroidered in bold swaths on both
tailored trouser suits and short sheath dresses were winners for
this collection.
	   Stella McCartney's collection for Chloe, shown at the Paris
Stock Exchange, was fun, young, funky at times, and very feminine.
	   Dad Paul McCartney was there cheering in the front row, in one
of his first big public sorties since Linda died last summer.
Stella devoted the collection to her mother.
	   Stella toned down her strumpet look of last time, into trumpet
or tulip skirts, daintily stepping down the runway in satiny, crepe
de chine fabric blends, and airbrushed patterns of vines and
florals on pastel, ruffled or lace-edged skirts and tops.
	   McCartney still is into lingerie lines, with a few of the
corselets she brought out in Chloe debut a year ago. The funky side
of things was in air-brushed loud sunset and nature scenes on
slithery or stretchy t-shirt styles, strapless dresses and a few
pantsuits.
	   Raffia weaves make a great background from some of the bolero
jackets and capes, plus raffia weaves as couture-style embroidery.
	   McCartney 's excellent trouser suits in seersucker featured a
few worn with a waistcoat-like jacket - good in whites and
yellow-gold.
	   Feminine, light clothes are drifting down all runways, not least
at Emanuel Ungaro, who did them in very haute luxe style.
	   Summery was the mood as he carpeted a Louvre Carrousel theater
in grass. And outfits looked both ethereal and down to earth, from
the gray crochet-knit sweaters over light grayish pants with wispy
flower and garland prints to the many print chiffon long dresses
with their soft destructured jackets.
	   ``I loved it,'' said actress Marisa Berenson, sitting in the
audience next to Anouk Aimee. ``Light, easy, wearable and so
contemporary.''
	   Yves Saint Laurent's show was by his studio workers, awaiting
the debut of American Alber Elbaz next March.
	   But it had some good old classic touches, from the great wide
blue-gray pants and white jacket with a t-shirt and turban to the
gray glen plaid trouser suit with a vest-jacket.
	   Quality is right up there with the best of YSL's own classics,
not only in the draped satin evening dresses but the terrific
safari looks, in squarish or belted jackets, pants and skirts, and
in one fabulous near-couture tuxedo coat-dress.
	   Yves Saint Laurent himself and his friend and company president
will host a huge party to celebrate Saint Laurent's forty years in
the business at the famed Moulin Rouge in Pigalle.

Hungarian parliament approves NATO request
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's parliament approved NATO's
request Wednesday for use of its airspace in case airstrikes are
needed to enforce the U.S.-brokered agreement on the cessation of
hostilities in the Serbian Kosovo province .
	   After six hours of bickering, the measure allowing overflights
by reconnaissance, fighter, and transport planes and helicopters
was approved by 260 votes in favor, 11 against, and six abstentions
in the 386-seat parliament.
	   One hundred and nine deputies were away, mostly on the campaign
trail,with municipal elections taking place Sunday.
	   The ultra-right, nationalist Hungarian Truth and Life Party of
Istvan Csurka voted against the motion.
	   The Hungarian national assembly had supported a similar NATO
request at the time of the Bosnian war.
	   Much of the debate centered on NATO guarantees in case Hungary
became a target of Serbian reprisals.
	   On Tuesday, the media center of the the Hungarian base of the
peace force in Bosnia had to be evacuated after receiving a bomb
threat, according to a U.S. Armu statement released Wednesday.
	   Several deputies from southern Hungary, where the base is
located, echoed their constituents' fears.
	   The mayor of Szeged, a big town only a few kilometers (miles)
from the Serbian border, said he had been urged by citizens to draw
up a plan to evacuate the town.

Moscow mayor considers coalition with Communists, Yavlinsky
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of Russia's Communist party expressed
hope Wednesday of forming an alliance with Moscow's powerful mayor
to solve Russia's financial problems, a proposition Yuri Luzhkov
said he would consider.
	   Mayor Luzhkov also said he would seek a meeting with prominent
reform-minded lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Luzhkov, Yavlinsky and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
are probable candidates for Russia's 2000 presidential elections.
Luzhkov's popularity seems to be growing, and many demonstrators at
nationwide rallies Oct. 7 called for him to become Russia's next
leader.
	   Luzhkov said he was ``declaring a policy aiming for
consolidation rather than splitting society.''
	   Speaking to journalists Wednesday, Zyuganov called Luzhkov ``a
respected and learned person,'' according to Interfax. The
Communists will ``continue to work toward aligning with the Moscow
mayor to pull the country out of the crisis,'' Zyuganov said.
	   He said the key to solving Russia's financial troubles lies in
finding agreements between all left-leaning political parties.
	   Zyuganov indicated he was still not willing to compromise with
some of his sworn enemies, including Yeltsin, former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Anatoly Chubais, the architect of Russia's
failed privatization drive in the early 1990's.
	   Luzhkov said that ``under certain conditions'' he might
cooperate with the Communists, but only without ``ruthless movement
to the left,'' Interfax said.
	   Other possible presidential candidates include regional governor
Alexander Lebed and Russian parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov.

U.N. once again condemns U.S. embargo on Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRUCE STANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ For the seventh year in a row, the General
Assembly on Wednesday condemned the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba
and called by an overwhelming margin for Washington to end its
sanctions.
	   A total of 157 of the assembly's members voted in favor of a
non-binding resolution calling for the United States to repeal the
embargo it imposed after Communists seized power in the island
nation in 1959.
	   Only two countries voted in favor of the sanctions _ the United
States and Israel. Twelve others abstained.
	   The vote followed appeals by representatives from Cuba and
several other countries, including three that also are subjected to
American sanctions _ Libya, Myanmar and Iraq. Also speaking against
the embargo were representatives of Vietnam and Laos, communist
countries that until recently endured U.S. sanctions.
	   ``Blind and deaf, the United States of America continues to
ignore the demands made by this Assembly during six successive
years to put an end to its long, harsh and merciless economic,
commercial and financial war against Cuba,'' Cuba's foreign
minister, Roberto Robaina, said in a speech to assembly members
before the vote.
	   Last year, 143 U.N. member states supported a similar
resolution. Seventeen states abstained, and only Israel and the
former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan voted with the United States
against it.
	   In 1996, a similar resolution was approved 137-3 with 25
abstentions.
	   Robaina called the embargo ``a vile medieval cudgel'' that has
caused immeasurable suffering by depriving Cubans of badly needed
food, medicine, and development funds.
	   The Helms-Burton Act, which became law in 1996, has intensified
Cuba's hardship, he said. Under the law, Americans can sue foreign
companies that operate on property seized by the Cuban government.
	   Speaking in support of the resolution, a Russian representative,
Yuri Isakov, criticized the U.S. sanctions as ``evidence of an
outdated mentality of the era of bloc confrontation.''
	   Khaled S.H. Al-Hitti, a minister in Iraq's U.N. mission, slammed
the embargo as ``harmful and unjustifiable'' and said more than
half the world's population is subjected to some form of American
sanctions.
	   U.N. sanctions have barred Iraq from selling its most crucial
commodity, oil, on the open market since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Ghana's ambassador, Jacob Wilmot, saw an apparent paradox in an
economic embargo imposed by the world's biggest supporter of free
trade.
	   And Austria, speaking for the European Union, said it has seen
some improvement in freedom of religion and other human rights in
Cuba.
	   ``It is not our policy to bring about change by coercive
measures,'' said Hans Peter Manz, minister at the Austrian mission.
	   However, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh defended the
sanctions as ``an important foreign policy tool ... aimed at
promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.''
	   Citing Cuba's detention of dozens of dissidents during the past
year, Burleigh said, ``Cuba continues to trample on the fundamental
freedoms of its people, the rights and principles enshrined in the
U.N. charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''
	   The United States has found itself increasingly isolated on the
issue. Investors from Mexico, Canada and Italy have ignored the
embargo, and growing numbers of American executives and religious
leaders have called for Washington to end it.

Russian border guards thwart attempt to smuggle drugs from NKorea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with drug seizure in Samara. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards thwarted an attempt to
smuggle drugs into the country from North Korea, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said Wednesday.
	   In a separate case, police seized 40 kilos (88 pounds) of
heroin, hashish and raw opium hidden in a truck trailer and
arrested six members of a Tajik drug trafficking gang.
	   The drugs were worth more than dlrs 1 million, according to
officials in the Samara region, about 900 kilometers (550 miles)
southeast of Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Guards at the North Korean border found 200 grams (seven ounces)
of hashish in a ceiling compartment on a train coming from North
Korea on Tuesday.
	   The train on the Tumanggang-Hasan railway was stopped at the
Hasan border crossing in Russia's Far East, ITAR-Tass said, quoting
the Pacific Regional Department of the Federal Border Service.
	   It said this was the first case of attempted drug smuggling from
North Korea this year.
	   Meanwhile, customs officials using sniffer dogs found rare
metals hidden in sacks full of cedar nuts in a truck headed to
China, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Officials seized 11 sacks filled with dark granules believed to
contain barium or palladium, and 12 sacks containing yellow powder
thought to be antimony.
	   Each sacked weighed about 80 kilograms (176 pounds), ITAR-Tass
said, quoting the press service of the Far Eastern Customs
Department.
	   Less than 24 hours earlier, a truck carrying 915 kilograms
(2,017 pounds) of titanium to China was also seized, ITAR-Tass
said.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ With pleasantries and a few barbed
comments typical of their long estrangement, rivals China and
Taiwan held their highest level meeting in five years Wednesday and
edged closer to resuming ruptured talks.
	   Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan _ elder statesmen charged with
shepherding Taiwan-China ties in the absence of formal channels _
hugged, smiled and said the lapse since their first and only
meeting in Singapore in 1993 gave them much to talk about.
	   After their hourlong discussion in the gilded Sino-Deco ballroom
of Shanghai's historic Peace Hotel, aides said the two
octogenarians noted that the ``peaceful atmosphere'' was conducive
to frank talks. But the two then restated divisive positions. Koo
urged communist-run China to learn from Taiwan's robust democracy.
Wang demanded ambitious negotiations to tackle reunification.
	   The dynamics _ part amicable, part intractable _ underscore the
distrust that pervades relations between the two sides, heirs to a
seven-decade civil war between Mao Tse-tung's communists and Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists.
	   When Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui traveled to the United States
in 1995, Beijing took it as a sign he was reneging on eventual
reunification. It canceled the lower-level dialogue Koo and Wang
started and launched test-missiles and war games near Taiwan,
straining relations to their tensest since the height of the Cold
War.
	   Success this time around seems to depend on whether just meeting
amid disagreement is enough to end the impasse.
	   ``No matter what they talk about or what achievements they will
make, it is an important step,'' said Su Ge, an expert on
China-Taiwan relations at Beijing's Foreign Affairs College whose
recent book Wang has given to visiting Taiwanese politicians.
``After all the ups and downs, after the lowest point in bilateral
relations, the two sides are together.''
	   After sightseeing around Shanghai, Koo will chat again Thursday
with Wang and then attend an opera together. In a further
indication of China's hopes for the visit, Koo will meet with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin over the weekend in Beijing.
	   Ever since China signaled a softer approach toward Taiwan in
January, negotiators failed in two rounds of talks to come up with
an agenda for Wang and Koo and billed the visit as a get-together,
less than formal negotiations. Taipei has balked at Beijing's
insistence on political talks to pave the way for reunification.
Instead, Taiwan wants negotiations on practical matters like
fishing disputes to build up confidence.
	   Shortly after arriving Wednesday in Shanghai, Koo said he had no
preconditions and saw his talks with Wang as an opportunity ``build
mutual trust.''
	   ``It is better to start talking sooner rather than later,'' Koo
said.
	   But Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and ruling Nationalist
Party elder, then reiterated that practical matters must be dealt
with. He marveled to Wang, the 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and
mentor to Chinese President Jiang, at the city's development but
noted that the Taiwanese investors contributing to the boom have
urgent concerns over taxes and personal safety.
	   Briefing reporters on the meeting, Tang Shubei, who runs the
Beijing-backed association Wang heads, however said talks on
political, not procedural issues, were the only way ahead. But he
then defined it broadly.
	   ``We say `political dialogue.' Taiwan says `constructive
dialogue.' But the common point is everyone agrees to a dialogue,''
said Tang.
	   ``I can tell you this type of political dialogue has already
started.''
	   Tang was hardly accommodating. He indirectly criticized Taiwan
President Lee for suggesting that Taipei and Beijing be treated as
equal governments of a divided China. ``There is only one China and
Taiwan is a part of it,'' Tang said.
	   In Taiwan, Foreign Minister Jason Hu accused China of pressing
its relentless campaign to try to isolate the island by attempting
to woo its last 27 diplomatic allies.

German Railway and workers agree to extend jobs protection plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with details, reaction. ADDS that three
unions part of the agreement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's railworkers unions hailed an agreement
Wednesday with the German railway to secure 260,000 existing jobs
as a victory for a negotiation model championed by Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder.
	   After haggling for more than a year, the German railway,
Deutsche Bahn, and three railworkers unions agreed to extend until
the end of 2002 a plan guaranteeing workers their jobs. It was set
to expire at the end of this year.
	   The agreement was reached through a consensus model similar to
one Schroeder has pledged to promote on the national level to help
fight Germany's unemployment rate, stuck above 10 percent.
	   Schroeder wants to create jobs by bringing together employers,
union representatives and politicians to find ways to cut labor
costs while extending job security to those with work.
	   The job protection agreement was reached by railway officials
and union representatives alone, differing from traditional labor
talks by creating an atmosphere of cooperation and consensus.
	   After a year of unsuccessful negotiations, railworkers union
vice president, Norbert Hansen, credited a change of climate
brought by the election of a new center-left government for the
deal.
	   ``This is a signal for political change in Germany,'' Hansen
said.
	   Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig said the agreement was a
model for other industries.
	   Although the unions had sought job-security guarantees without
conditions, Ludewig said the agreement requires the unions to seek
more flexibility and mobility from employees.
	   If that is not achieved, Ludewig said, the agreement has a
loophole stating it is only valid as long as all sides are working
toward increased flexibility.
	   The railway, for example, wants the freedom to transfer service
employees, and specifically the ability to annually move up to
3,000 employees working in eastern Germany to jobs in the west,
Ludewig said.
	   The railway is in the middle of a reform started after West
Germany's Bundesbahn merged with the former East Germany's
Reichsbahn, creating Deutsche Bahn AG. The reform aims at making
the state-run railroad free of government subsidies by 2002, the
same period covered by the job-security agreement.
	   ``We must be self-sufficient by the end of 2002,'' Ludewig said.
``On that we all agree.''
	   Despite the extended job protection, the railway expects to cut
back some 20,000 jobs this year through voluntary severance
agreements. Union vice president Hansen said 100,000 jobs could be
cut by 2002.

Prodi's coalition-building blocked by small party insisting he
</HEADLINE>
openly court its support &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Toppled Premier Romano Prodi was having a tough time
Wednesday trying to piece together a new government for Italy,
unwilling to give in to a small centrist party that was demanding
he openly appeal for its support.
	   Prodi showed no stomach for the demands of Francesco Cossiga's
party, which also was insisting that Prodi give it a say in any
Cabinet selections and acknowledge that his old governing majority
no longer existed.
	   ``It's not over, but it's extremely difficult,'' Prodi said
after a day of talks with Cossiga's party and his own.
	   Cossiga's party's 29 votes in the Chamber of Deputies could make
the difference between governing and not governing for Prodi, whose
2 1/2-year-old center-left coalition collapsed Friday when it lost
a vote of confidence in the lower house by a single vote.
	   Anxious to end the turmoil, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked
Prodi on Tuesday to try to form a new government. To do that, Prodi
needs to show he can once again command a majority of votes in
Parliament.
	   Far-left ally Armando Cossutta suggested Prodi might be able to
do that even without the centrist party's support, just by picking
up the last few dozen votes he needs here and there.
	   Prodi has been adamant he would do no under-the-table deals to
form a new government; Italian TV has repeatedly aired a clip of
him pounding his fist in the air and shouting, ``No! No!'' at the
very thought.
	   Prodi's government was Italy's second-longest-serving of 55
since World War II. Scalfaro asked him to stay on as acting premier
for now, but the shakeup means that little actual governing is
getting done, with action on the budget and other top issues on
hold.

Czech Republic beats Estonia 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEPLICE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Patrik Berger converted two free
kicks to lead the Czech Republic to a comfortable 4-1 victory over
Estonia in a Group 9 Euro 2000 qualifier Wednesday.
	   Opening the score in the 8th minute, Pavel Nedved sprinted
through the Estonian defense with ease to put the Czechs 1-0 ahead
from close distance on a pass from Vratislav Lokvenc.
	   Berger added the second goal in the 21st minute, sending a
spectacular curved shot from a 25-meter free kick to the upper
right corner of Estonia's goalkeeper Mart Poom.
	   In the 41st minute, Berger duplicated his success from the same
situation, this time beating Poom inside the left post to give the
Czechs a 3-0 lead.
	   Lokvenc sealed the Czech victory in the 45th minute chipping the
ball over a helpless Poom from close range on a pass from Jiri
Nemec.
	   The Czech team, runner-up in the 1996 European championship,
slowed down the pace in the second half, cruising to an expected
victory over underdog Estonia.
	   Argo Arbeiter scored Estonia's only goal in the 90th minute,
beating the Czech team's offside trap in a solo effort.
	   The match was played in front of 15,000 spectators on a rainy
evening in Teplice, 90 kilometers (65 miles) north of Prague.
	   The Czechs now lead Group 9 with nine points from three matches
ahead of Scotland.

Kosovo Albanians, Bangladeshis caught at Hungarian borders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A group of 34 Kosovo Albanians and 42
Bangladeshis were detained by border guards in two separate
incidents, the state news agency MTI reported Wednesday.
	   The Kosovo Albanians, 29 men and five women, were caught when
they tried to illegally cross from Hungary into Austria.
	   They planned to travel to their relatives in Germany and
England, sold their homes in Yugoslavia, and spent all their money
on the trip, they said.
	   The Bangladeshis were found in a van in Balatonlelle, 130
kilometers (85 miles) southwest of Budapest.
	   They told border guards that they left their country because of
the civil war there, and plan to go back when the situation allows.
	   Both groups are in border guards' custody.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Right after cutting a deal with U.S.
negotiators to end the Kosovo crisis, President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a major crackdown on his Serb opponents by silencing two
independent Belgrade dailies.
	   Serbian police late Tuesday stormed the offices of Dnevni
Telegraf and Danas, both critical of Milosevic's government, and
shut them down for allegedly violating a recent government decree
that required self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
	   ``Serbia is heading toward complete dictatorship and this must
be stopped,'' the manager and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf,
Slavko Curuvija, told The Associated Press. He said up to now his
paper could write about such a danger and ``now we can't even do
that.''
	   Curuvija said that just as international pressure seems to ease,
Milosevic's regime is seeking to eliminate prominent opponents at
home, ``to suppress the last free voices.''
	   Dnevni Telegraf's popular columnist Aleksandar Tijanic, known
for his lucid and cynical commentaries often targeting the
government, said, ``This is not only about two papers, not only the
struggle to keep publishing, this is a clash between two Serbias.''
	   ``One is a xenophobic, conservative, anti-European Serbia,''
Tijanic said, referring to Milosevic's policies, ``and the other is
liberal, democratic, open to the world. This is the beginning of an
internal cold war,'' Tijanic said Wednesday.
	   The Vienna-based International Press Institute, a private agency
that monitors press freedom worldwide, condemned the move against
the two newspapers as a violation of the U.N. Universal Declaration
on Human Rights.

Reclusive Taliban leader promises to release all Iranian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

Iranians being held in Kandahar. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's reclusive Taliban
leader attempted to defuse tensions with neighboring Iran on
Wednesday, promising to release all Iranians still in the country.
	   Mullah Mohammed Omar's promise was made to U.N. special envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi, who ventured into the Taliban's stronghold of
Kandahar on Wednesday and spent over three hours in negotiations
with Omar.
	   An estimated 50 Iranians are believed to be in custody in
southern Kandahar, captured in August when the Taliban overran the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Radio Shariat said 25
Iranians were being held captive.
	   During the bloody takeover of its opponents' northern
headquarters, renegade Taliban troops killed eight Iranian
diplomats and an Iranian journalist, launching Iran and the Taliban
on a dangerous standoff along the border.
	   Brahimi also extracted a promise from Omar to meet with Iran _a
meeting the U.N. envoy said ``needs to take place urgently.''
	   Brahimi is the first U.N. envoy to meet face-to-face with Omar,
the man who has undisputed control over the hard-line Taliban
movement, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Brahimi was exempted from a U.N. ban on travel to Afghanistan to
try to defuse the tensions on the Afghan border with Iran, where
more than 270,000 Iranian troops are deployed and backed up by
hundreds of tanks and scores of fighter jets.
	   The United Nations pulled all its international staff out of
Afghanistan on Aug. 21, after an Italian U.N. worker was killed and
a second worker wounded in apparent retaliation for the U.S.
missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   Omar promised to send a Taliban delegation to Islamabad to meet
U.N. officials to ``create conditions that will allow the United
Nations to return to Afghanistan,'' Brahimi said.
	   Omar also condemned the killing of the Iranian diplomats and
vowed to find the culprits, who ``will receive their just
retribution,'' he said.
	   In the two-thirds of the country it controls, the Taliban
imposed its own strict version of Islamic law. Convicted murderers
are publicly executed, the hands of thieves are amputated and
violators of lesser crimes are publicly beaten.
	   In the lengthy meeting with Omar, Brahimi also said the Taliban
leader reiterated his position that Saudi millionaire Osama Bin
Laden was a guest ``not just of the Taliban, but of all the Afghan
people.''
	   Bin Laden is accused by Washington of masterminding the deadly
bombings of two U.S. embassies in east Africa in August.

U.N. once again condemns U.S. embargo on Cuba

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ For the seventh year in a row, the General
Assembly on Wednesday condemned the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba
and called by an overwhelming margin for Washington to end its
sanctions.
	   A total of 157 of the assembly's members voted in favor of a
non-binding resolution calling for the United States to repeal the
embargo it imposed after Communists seized power in the island
nation in 1959.
	   Only two countries voted in favor of the sanctions _ the United
States and Israel. Twelve others abstained.
	   The vote followed appeals by representatives from Cuba and
several other countries, including three that also are subjected to
American sanctions _ Libya, Myanmar and Iraq. Also speaking against
the embargo were representatives of Vietnam and Laos, communist
countries that until recently endured U.S. sanctions.
	   ``Blind and deaf, the United States of America continues to
ignore the demands made by this Assembly during six successive
years to put an end to its long, harsh and merciless economic,
commercial and financial war against Cuba,'' Cuba's foreign
minister, Roberto Robaina, said in a speech to assembly members
before the vote.
	   Last year, 143 U.N. member states supported a similar
resolution. Seventeen states abstained, and only Israel and the
former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan voted with the United States
against it.
	   In 1996, a similar resolution was approved 137-3 with 25
abstentions.
	   Robaina called the embargo ``a vile medieval cudgel'' that has
caused immeasurable suffering by depriving Cubans of badly needed
food, medicine, and development funds.
	   The Helms-Burton Act, which became law in 1996, has intensified
Cuba's hardship, he said. The law is designed to discourage foreign
investment in Cuba by punishing foreign companies investing in
property confiscated from Americans after Castro's takeover.
	   Speaking in support of the resolution, a Russian representative,
Yuri Isakov, criticized the U.S. sanctions as ``evidence of an
outdated mentality of the era of bloc confrontation.''
	   Khaled S.H. Al-Hitti, a minister in Iraq's U.N. mission, slammed
the embargo as ``harmful and unjustifiable.''
	   U.N. sanctions have barred Iraq from selling its most crucial
commodity, oil, on the open market since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Ghana's ambassador, Jacob Wilmot, saw an apparent paradox in an
economic embargo imposed by the world's biggest supporter of free
trade.
	   And Austria, speaking for the European Union, said it has seen
some improvement in freedom of religion and other human rights in
Cuba.
	   ``It is not our policy to bring about change by coercive
measures,'' said Hans Peter Manz, minister at the Austrian mission.
	   However, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh defended the
sanctions as ``an important foreign policy tool ... aimed at
promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.''
	   Citing Cuba's detention of dozens of dissidents during the past
year, Burleigh said, ``Cuba continues to trample on the fundamental
freedoms of its people, the rights and principles enshrined in the
U.N. charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''
	   The United States has found itself increasingly isolated on the
issue. Investors from Mexico, Canada and Italy have ignored the
embargo, and growing numbers of American executives and religious
leaders have called for Washington to end it.

	   ROME (AP) _ Toppled Premier Romano Prodi was having a tough time
Wednesday trying to piece together a new government for Italy,
unwilling to give in to a small centrist party that was demanding
he openly appeal for its support.
	   Prodi showed no stomach for the demands of Francesco Cossiga's
party, which also was insisting that Prodi give it a say in any
Cabinet selections and acknowledge that his old governing majority
no longer existed.
	   ``It's not over, but it's extremely difficult,'' Prodi said
after a day of talks with Cossiga's party and his own.
	   Cossiga's party's 29 votes in the Chamber of Deputies could make
the difference between governing and not governing for Prodi, whose
2 1/2-year-old center-left coalition collapsed Friday when it lost
a vote of confidence in the lower house by a single vote.
	   Anxious to end the turmoil, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked
Prodi on Tuesday to try to form a new government. To do that, Prodi
needs to show he can once again command a majority of votes in
Parliament.
	   Far-left ally Armando Cossutta suggested Prodi might be able to
do that even without the centrist party's support, just by picking
up the last few dozen votes he needs here and there.
	   Prodi has been adamant he would do no under-the-table deals to
form a new government; Italian TV has repeatedly aired a clip of
him pounding his fist in the air and shouting, ``No! No!'' at the
very thought.
	   Prodi's government was Italy's second-longest-serving of 55
since World War II. Scalfaro asked him to stay on as acting premier
for now, but the shakeup means that little actual governing is
getting done, with action on the budget and other top issues on
hold.

	   ROME (AP) _ Fifty big, colorful oil paintings highlight a Joan
Miro exhibit on display in Rome starting Nov. 5.
	   Presented Wednesday, the exhibit also features 40 artworks,
including sculptures, collages and engravings of the Catalan
artist.
	   The works were created during the 1960s and 1970s, Miro's most
extreme and pessimistic years. They are on loan from private
collections and museums, including Madrid's Reina Sofia Museum and
the ``Successio Miro'' in Palma de Maiorca, where Miro died in
1983.
	   The exhibit ``Joan Miro: The Transgression'' runs through Feb.
21 at Museo del Risorgimento.

Blueblood Lords talk themselves out of a job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Denying it was replaying old class wars, Britain's
Labor Party government on Wednesday told hereditary peers in the
unelected House of Lords that it is time to say ``thank you and
good-bye.''
	   Scions of ancient, aristocratic families and life peers _ mostly
ex-members of the House of Commons given retirement titles by prime
ministers _ packed the chamber for the two-day debate on Prime
Minister Tony Blair's plan to strip hereditary members of the right
to vote.
	   A handful of diehard blue-bloods among the ranks of Conservative
Party supporters who dominate Britain's uniquely composed upper
chamber, have vowed to go down fighting. They could delay
government legislation in a scorched earth policy before their
voting rights are removed by the overwhelmingly Labor House of
Commons.
	   Other Tory aristocrats, backed by some Tory and Labor life
peers, argue that Labor should do nothing until it comes up with an
alternative for a new upper chamber. Simply removing the hereditary
peers will leave Blair with enormous extra patronage to pack
political cronies into a slimmed down Lords consisting of lifetime
members only.
	   Baroness Jay, a Laborite recently given a title and the
government's leader in the Lords, acknowledged critics' charges
that Labor was pursuing ``a throwback to the old battles of the
class war, a policy based on a bitter mixture of personal malice
and envy.''
	   ``But it is my belief that the most thoughtful among the
hereditary peers, of all political persuasions, know that the time
has come to say: `thank you and good-bye','' said Baroness Jay.
	   She said a commission would be appointed to suggest a new type
of chamber _ possibly partly appointed, partly elected.
	   The Tory leader, Lord Cranborne, son of the 6th Marquess of
Salisbury, heir to 17th century titles and scion of a family
involved for centuries in politics, said once the government had
got rid of hereditary peers' voting rights, it would have no
incentive to devise a new type of chamber.
	   ``An entirely nominated chamber is really no more legitimate
than a hereditary one _ perhaps less so, because its members owe
their presence to the living rather than the safely dead,'' said
Cranborne, 52.
	   Blair plans to introduce a bill in December to remove the voting
rights _ part of Labor's winning platform at national elections in
May 1997. Aristocrats would keep their titles and property.
	   Rebel Lords could hamper the bill by long debates, and adding
amendments. But even so, it appears certain to be passed by early
2000 _ well before there is agreement on a reformed upper house.
	   Hereditary peers _ there are 633 compared with 507 life peers _
are overwhelmingly Conservative, giving the Tories a built-in
majority in the Lords, although many never attend.
	   However,, the Lords _ their powers whittled down over the
centuries _ can only delay legislation for up to a year.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl invited his
ministers to one last meal together Wednesday night following their
final Cabinet meeting.
	   No major items or decisions were on the agenda for the final
meeting, which was only scheduled to last half an hour, said Kohl
spokesman Otto Hauser.
	   It was the 585th Cabinet session called by Kohl in 16 years as
chancellor. Many of those meetings were followed by a private
dinner at the chancellor's bungalow in Bonn.
	   Discretion was also the order of the day for the farewell meal.
Hauser said had no idea what was being served.

	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Pakistani gunfire killed an Indian woman
working on her farm the Jammu-Kashmir state, where a rocket fired
by separatist militants later killed two policemen in a residential
complex, officials said.
	   The attacks occurred as India and Pakistan prepared for
Thursday's opening of talks on divided Kashmir, the Himalayan
territory over which they have been fighting for 50 years.
	   Kamala Devi was hit in the chest by machine-gun fire in the
state's Maljodha village and died on way to the hospital, a
spokesman of the Border Security Force said. Another man was
injured, he said.
	   The rocket badly damaged two apartments in Surankot, a town in
the Poonch district, 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Jammu,
killing two officers and wounding eight others, said K. Rajendra, a
deputy inspector-general of police. He blamed the attack on Muslim
insurgents.
	   On the outskirts of Surankot town, rebels ambushed a police
patrol, killing one officer and wounding two others in an exchange
of gunfire. The six-member patrol belonged to the anti-militant
wing of Jammu-Kashmir state police.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the militant
groups fighting for an independent Kashmir or a choice to join
Pakistan, an Islamic state. Jammu-Kashmir is the only Muslim
majority state in a predominantly Hindu India.
	   Pakistan denies the Indian charge and says it only lends moral
and diplomatic support to the militants in Kashmir.

Six injured when train jumps rails in Wales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABERCYNON, Wales (AP) _ A passenger train jumped the rails in
south Wales Wednesday, injuring six people on board and damaging
track and disrupting service.
	   Track operator Railtrack said it was not immediately clear what
caused the two-carriage train to leave the rails shortly after 11
a.m. (1000 GMT) just north of Abercynon station, 140 miles (220
kms) west of London. It was traveling at low speed between the
towns of Merthyr and Penarth with about 30 people on board,
Railtrack said.
	   Passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries while
train operator Cardiff Railway Company cleared the wreckage.
	   A Railtrack spokeswoman said repairs were not likely to be
completed until Thursday. Until then, buses are carrying passengers
along this stretch of the journey.

Reports: 1,200 workers protest in central China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Xinhua report on labor
disputes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 1,200 factory workers blocked a major road
in one Chinese city and 200 laid-off workers sat on another road in
another city in twin protests highlighting China's increasing labor
problems, a human rights group reported Wednesday.
	   The 1,200 workers in Shiyan, in central Hubei province,
protested outside government offices Monday after a local company
went bust, taking their investments in it, the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   In Wuhan, capital of Hubei, the 200 laid-off workers, holding
placards reading ``We want to eat,'' staged a sit-in on a major
road Wednesday to protest a decision to halve their unemployment
payments to 100 yuan (dlrs 12) a month, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center said.
	   Labor disputes are on the rise as China weans state enterprises
from bank loans and subsidies and forces them to compete in free
markets. Bankrupt companies are laying off workers by the millions,
often with little or no compensation.
	   The official Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday that labor
disputes _ from salary disagreements to strikes _ had soared in
southern Guangdong province from 927 in 1995 to 1,504 in 1997.
	   Xinhua, citing a Guangdong newspaper report, attributed much of
the rise to the impact of Asia's financial crisis on foreign-funded
and export-oriented businesses. It said 740,000 work days were lost
last year because of strikes and accused some foreign owners of
fleeing China, ``leaving behind some cheap equipment and tremendous
problems of calming down strikers.''
	   In Shiyan, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said the city
government called in hundreds of police to break up Monday's
protest, who detained 10 demonstrators.
	   A Shiyan government official, Xiong Juguo, denied there was a
protest Monday, but said an automobile accident near the
government's offices drew a crowd of 100 to 200 people and blocked
traffic for a few minutes.
	   People dispersed of their own accord, he said. ``We have not
heard of such a large demonstration,'' he said.
	   The Information Center said the protesters were among factory
workers citywide who put 10 million yuan (dlrs 1.2 million) in a
local company offering high interest rates; the company applied for
bankruptcy in June.
	   Workers who invested in the firm already appealed repeatedly to
local authorities to recover their money, but received no reply.
	   A spokesman for the police in Wuhan denied that Wednesday's
protest had taken place.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ American defenseman Mathieu Schneider was traded
to the New York Rangers by the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday for
Russian defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev and a fourth-round 1999
draft pick.
	   Schneider, much traveled restricted free agent without a
contract, did not attend training camp and missed the Leafs' first
two games of the North American National Hockey League's season,
which began Friday. Last season, his ninth in the NHL, Schneider
scored 11 goals assisted on 26 and had 44 minutes in penalties in
76 games.
	   The 29-year-old Schneider had been seeking dlrs 3.3 million a
year from the Maple Leafs, who had countered with dlrs 2.8 million.
He made dlrs 2.5 million last season.
	   Karpovtsev, 28, is in his fifth NHL season after playing for
Moscow Dynamo. His best season was 1996-97 when he had nine goals,
29 assists and 59 minutes in penalties in 77 games.
	   Last season, he scored three goals and had seven assists while
collecting 38 penalty minutes.

New German coalition sets landmark steps to integrate foreigners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with agreement on new citizenship law, drug policy &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's future government partners agreed
Wednesday to modernize the nation's 85-year-old citizenship law, a
landmark project to promote the integration of foreigners.
	   Supporters see the changes as a way to make Germany a society
more tolerant of its 7 million foreigners, including 2 million
Turks. Most Turkish children born here have grown up virtually as
Germans, but they still feel excluded by the citizenship law.
	   Social Democrats and their junior partner, the Greens, said they
intend to give automatic citizenship to German-born children of
foreigners for the first time, if one of their parents has been
living in Germany since age 14.
	   Both sides also agreed on allowing dual citizenship _ an
important gesture to Germany's large Turkish population _ and
shortening foreigners' eligibility for naturalization to eight
years from 15.
	   ``It is a clear signal for integration,'' said Greens negotiator
Kerstin Mueller, a domestic policy expert. ``This government will
recognize that Germany is a country of immigrants.''
	   The language took direct aim at outgoing Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's government, which repeatedly insisted that Germany is not a
country of immigrants.
	   The proposed changes will scrap the principle of a 1913 law that
bases citizenship on German blood ties, not place of birth.
	   For example, ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union
currently have an immediate rights to a passport even though their
forebears left the homeland generations ago. But Turks living in
Germany must wait until they are teenagers to even apply for
citizenship. Current law requires Turks to give up their Turkish
passport, which many are reluctant to do.
	   The agreement followed tough bargaining in which the Greens gave
up more liberal goals. They had called for naturalizing foreign
children simply if one of their parents is a permanent resident.
	   ``Finding a compromise was not easy,'' Mueller said.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government, which was
voted out in Sept. 27 elections after 16 years, refused to
liberalize the citizenship law, mainly because of pressure from its
conservative Bavarian coalition partner, the Christian Social
Union.
	   But even some liberal members of the old government had been
calling for changes in the law, which critics see as outdated and
nationalistic.
	   Germany began recruiting large numbers of Turkish workers in the
1960s to help fuel its postwar economic boom. In recent years, they
and their children have made headlines mainly as victims of
anti-foreigner violence, including a 1993 firebombing in which five
Turks died.
	   Both parties also announced agreements to:
	   _promote controlled distribution of heroin to long-term addicts
to fight drug-related crime.
	   _step up the fight against petty crime, such as shoplifting.
	   _draft a law to combat discrimination against foreigners.

Electrical stimulation shows promise as Parkinson's treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONCORD, New Hampshire (AP) _ Electrical stimulation of the
brain can greatly improve the ability of Parkinson's disease
patients to perform everyday tasks, a study found.
	   In many people with advanced Parkinsonism, a progressive disease
of the nervous system, the standard drug, levodopa, helps only some
of the time.
	   Patients alternate between periods of severe disease _ when they
suffer from tremors, rigid limbs and inability to move _ and
periods of relief.
	   French researchers found that with electrical stimulation to a
part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus, patients saw a 60
percent improvement in their motor skills and ability to perform
daily tasks during the periods when the medication was not working.
	   When the medication was working, electrical stimulation improved
symptoms slightly and helped decrease the jerky movements that are
a side effect of the drug. The average dosage of levodopa was cut
in half, and other drugs were also reduced or eliminated.
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine. It involved 24 patients ages 48 to 64.

Benetton's Turkish licensee suspends deals over child-labor

allegations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Stung by reports that Benetton clothing
was being made by Turkish children, the clothier's Turkish licensee
said Wednesday it had suspended all acquisitions from manufacturers
that could not prove a child-free labor policy.
	   A textile worker's group has claimed that a Bogazici Ready Wear
contractor in Istanbul employs children ages 9 to 13 and pays them
less than $90 a month to make outfits under the name of the
Italian-based clothing manufacturer and retailer.
	   Benetton expressed shock at the claims, saying it makes its
business partners pledge in writing that they will follow labor
laws.
	   On Thursday, representatives of the Benetton group and Italian
trade unions are expected to inspect Turkish textile factories
where the label's clothes are made.
	   Cem Boyner, president of Bogazici Ready Wear, Benetton's Turkish
licensee, told reporters that his company had ``stopped its trade
relations with the mentioned producer and retrieved all raw
material from it.''
	   Bogazici said it also had suspended business deals with other
producers that have been unable to certify that they did not use
child labor.
	   An estimated one-third of Turkey's children between 6- and 14
years old work, according to the United Nations. Most work in
domestic labor, many in small industries, and thousands work in the
streets.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The NATO alliance said Wednesday
that Slobodan Milosevic was not meeting international demands to
restore peace in Kosovo, and several officials warned the Yugoslav
leader that airstrikes were still possible.
	   NATO expects to sign a deal Friday with Yugoslavia that would
let NATO reconnaissance planes fly over the troubled Serb province
and monitor whether Milosevic is complying with his agreement to
end the Kosovo crackdown. Other officials noted that NATO planes
were arriving at bases in Italy.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned the Yugoslav
president Wednesday that NATO is prepared to use force if he backs
down on the agreement to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace
talks with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the monitors into
Kosovo to verify compliance.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said it's time to focus on
compliance and not threats, ``but the bombers are ready, and if
necessary we'll return to that emergency phase, which is not quite
over.''
	   At a meeting of NATO ambassadors, it was agreed that Milosevic
has yet to show he is ending his crackdown against Kosovo Albanian
separatists, a NATO official said on condition of anonymity.
	   A number of Yugoslav forces remain dug in, including a Serb
police unit. The official would not say how many troops are in
Kosovo except they far exceed the level predating the start of the
violence there in March.
	   The agreement is designed to end the seven-month crackdown in
Kosovo, an operation that has killed hundreds and left up to
300,000 people homeless. NATO gave Milosevic until Saturday morning
(0500 GMT) to comply or face airstrikes.

Parliament blocks government efforts to draw foreign loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's leftist-dominated legislature on
Wednesday turned down a government bill that would have allowed it
to draw more foreign loans this year without asking permission from
lawmakers.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat parliament voted 213-23 to reject the
draft law, which would have raised the amount of foreign loans the
government is allowed to seek in 1998 for financing the budget
deficit and paying off foreign debt to dlrs 4.4 billion, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The report did not say how much Ukraine's cash-strapped
government already has borrowed this year, but the proposed sum was
more than three times higher than the borrowing limits set in the
1998 budget.
	   Parliament's decision came just a day after Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko called on lawmakers to cooperate in leading
Ukraine out of its persisting economic crisis.
	   The government is desperately trying to avert an economic
collapse triggered by turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   Pustovoitenko said the fragile stability maintained in Ukraine's
financial market in the past few weeks has not yet become
``irreversible'', adding that quick parliamentary approval of the
government's anti-crisis measures was necessary to prevent further
economic deterioration.
	   The country already has suffered badly from the crisis in
Russia. Inflation has soared and the national hryvna currency lost
more than 50 percent of its value in September alone.

Heart disease risk in middle age predicts health costs later

<TEXT>
	   CONCORD, New Hampshire (AP) _ People with a low risk of heart
disease in middle age need far less hospital care for any reason
when they get old, a study found.
	   The greater the number of heart disease risk factors in middle
age, the higher the Medicare spending on hospital services an
average of 23 years later, according to the study by researchers at
Northwestern University Medical School.
	   Medicare is a federal-state health care insurance program for
the elderly.
	   The risk factors for heart disease are high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, smoking, a previous heart attack, diabetes or an
abnormal heartbeat.
	   The study found that women at low risk for heart disease in
middle age cost Medicare less than half as much as women with at
least one risk factor. Men with no risk factors cost Medicare
one-third less than men with at least one risk factor.
	   Most of the Medicare savings were associated with the three risk
factors that can be prevented or controlled: smoking, high
cholesterol and high blood pressure.
	   Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol and getting people to
quit smoking are ``key not only to mitigating the epidemic of
coronary heart disease ... but also to containing health care
expenditures and possibly improving the quality of life in the
later years,'' the researchers concluded.
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Rutgers University researcher
Louise Russell said the study does not prove that reducing heart
disease risks will lower overall health care costs because the
researchers did not look at the cost of prevention: prescription
drugs that control cholesterol and blood pressure, and
kick-the-tobacco-habit programs.
	   However, Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart
Association, said other studies have shown that drugs and other
lifestyle changes that control cholesterol or blood pressure are
cheap compared with the cost of even one heart attack.
	   Fuster said the study's findings are important because the U.S.
population is aging rapidly and the Medicare system faces an
unprecedented burden. The heart association helped pay for the
study.
	   The Northwestern researchers, led by Dr. Martha Daviglus, looked
at 7,039 men and 6,757 women. All were evaluated for heart disease
risk factors from 1967 to 1973, when they were age 40 to 64. The
researchers then looked at Medicare spending for each person from
1984 to 1994.

Friends, colleagues of new Nobel laureate welcome economics prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction from winner's mother; government economist &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian friends and colleagues of the
Nobel prize winner for economics praised Amartya Sen on Wednesday
for bringing ethics to economics as he grappled with issues of
hunger and poverty in his native country.
	   Sen's 87-year-old mother, Ameeta Sen, said she was skeptical
when her son first called her with the news because he had been a
candidate many times before. ``I told him I'll believe it when I
see the papers'' from the Nobel committee, she said from her home
in the university town of Shanti Niketan, in the eastern Indian
state of West Bengal.
	   ``He is a fantastically brilliant and versatile man,'' said
Badal Mukherjee, director of the Delhi School of Economics, where
Sen taught for eight years until 1971. ``We are delighted with the
news. We all thought it was long overdue.''
	   Pranab Sen, a relative of the Trinity College professor and a
member of India's Planning Commission, said the Nobel laureate had
made fundamental contributions to economics and to Indian society.
	   ``He started bringing ethics into economics in a big way.
Earlier, ethics was mainly handled by philosophers. What he did was
to bring it into mainline economics,'' said the Indian government
official.
	   Sen's mother said her son might not have achieved what he did if
he had not fallen ill as a college student. When doctors
recommended treatment abroad, Sen went to England and resumed his
studies at Cambridge.
	   ``He had a knack for economics at a very young age,'' she told
The Associated Press.
	   Rakesh Mohan, director-general of state-run National Council for
Applied Economic Research, praised Sen as ``an unusual economist
who has combined deep concern for human development with the very
fine work in technical economics. His work in economic theory has
been of the highest order and as good as the best in the field.''
	   Other Nobel winners from India include Bengali language poet and
novelist Rabindranath Tagore who won the literature prize in 1913;
physicist C.V. Raman in 1930; Hargobind Khorana, who won the 1968
prize in medicine; and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Raman's nephew
who won the physics prize in 1983.
	   Mother Teresa, the ethnic Albanian who adopted Indian
citizenship, won the peace prize in 1979. The Dalai Lama, the
exiled Tibetan leader who resides in India, won the peace prize a
decade later.

Russian man sentenced for embezzling money in coal scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian man was sentenced to four years in
prison for stealing 4 million rubles (dlrs 250,000) intended for
coal mines in southern Siberia, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Vladimir Danilov, claiming he represented a non-existent
research institute in Vladivostok in the Russian Far East,
concluded a contract for the delivery of 60,000 tons (66,000 short
tons) of coal from a mine in Leninsk-Kuznetsky to a local power
plant, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The coal was delivered, but the money went to Danilov. The
report did not say when the theft took place.
	   Dozens of other criminal cases involving coal scams are under
investigation in the Kemerovo region, the heart of the coal-rich
Kuzbass, about 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) east of Moscow,
ITAR-Tass said.

Yeltsin orders stop to give-away of shares in oil company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin intervened Wednesday to
stop the controversial give-away of shares in a
government-controlled oil company, and to punish those responsible
for the transaction.
	   Yeltsin ordered Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to take measures
to return 51 percent of OAO Purneftegaz, which had been taken from
the state-owned oil company NK Rosneft, the president's office said
in a statement.
	   Rosneft lost its stake in Purneftegaz earlier this year after it
failed to pay off a loan and overdue fines of about 40 million
rubles (dlrs 6.6 million) to Russian commercial bank Mapo. The bank
held the Purneftegaz shares as collateral.
	   Purneftegaz was Rosneft's single largest oil-producing company,
so the loss made Rosneft practically worthless.
	   Rosneft's current management said the company could have paid
off the loan, but didn't. They said former managers of Rosneft
appeared to have arranged the default and were benefiting from it.
	   The president's office said late Wednesday that Yeltsin ordered
Primakov to take steps to return the shares and find the guilty
parties within two weeks.
	   Yeltsin also ordered Primakov to come up with measures to
protect state property during trusteeship and sale of shares of
companies in which the government holds an interest.
	   Yeltsin gave Primakov a month to come up with the measures.
	   The Russian government had planned to raise more than dlrs 1.6
billion by selling a 75 percent stake in Rosneft. It was forced to
cancel the sale in part because of doubts over the ownership of
Purneftegaz.

Refugee convoys return, but NATO, Albanians skeptical about
</HEADLINE>
agreement

official, refugee, Russian premier &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Counting down toward its Kosovo
deadline, NATO warned Wednesday that Slobodan Milosevic isn't doing
what he must to avoid airstrikes and ethnic Albanian refugees
voiced reluctance to return home out of fear of Serb forces.
	   Even as the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys, skepticism
was widespread that the Yugoslav president will meet international
demands and refrain from further hostilities toward ethnic
Albanians.
	   Demonstrating that it's not taking him at his word, NATO
positioned warplanes at bases in Italy for possible air attacks on
Serbia.
	   ``NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted by Milosevic,'' said
an official at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We'll be keeping up the military pressure for some time to
come.''
	   Milosevic reluctantly agreed Monday to the demands of world
leaders determined to halt his seven-month offensive against
separatist ethnic Albanians and fearful of tragedy involving tens
of thousands of refugees still living in the open as winter
approaches.
	   But even before the agreed-to force of 2,000 international
monitors to check on his compliance is assembled, it's clear
Milosevic has still not met at least one key demand: withdrawing
his forces to levels before the crackdown in the Serbian province
began Feb. 28.
	   The 16 NATO members have given Milosevic until Saturday to
comply fully or face the renewed threat of airstrikes.
	   The official in Brussels said a number of Yugoslav units remain
dug in in Kosovo and must be withdrawn, including what he called
one ``notorious'' special police unit from Nis, Serbia. He declined
to say how many troops remain in the province but said they ``far
exceed'' the level required by NATO.
	   The advance party of the ``ground verification mission'' _ the
final concession by Milosevic needed to seal an agreement after
over a week of intense negotiations with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke _ arrived in Kosovo from neighboring Macedonia on
Wednesday. The several dozen Americans, Canadians and Europeans had
been evacuated Monday.
	   But the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the monitoring mission, says it may take
weeks to recruit the needed personnel from its 54 member nations.
	   ``I'm worried that the international community will be too slow
and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six months to
get there when we need them there in six days or at least six
weeks,'' Holbrooke said in an interview with CNN.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday for fear of Serb
attacks if NATO launched airstrikes.
	   Many refugees are still in hiding in Kosovo, fearing reprisals
from Serb special police who have torched their villages and been
accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just rebel fighters
fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say whatever
people want to hear,'' said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee
in the forested hamlet of Baks, northwest of Pristina. ``One
hundred times he has lied.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that NATO would be
watching closely for evidence of compliance and that Milosevic
should take alliance warnings seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told BBC radio. ``The united consensus within NATO
that we were ready to take military action was there at the
beginning of the week, is still there and that decision is still on
the table. We can reactivate these plans any time we feel it is
necessary to do so.''
	   In addition to withdrawing forces, allowing the monitoring force
and helping refugees return, Milosevic must show serious efforts
toward restoring the autonomy he stripped from Kosovo in 1989.
	   The Serb government took a step toward that late Tuesday,
outlining a plan for a separate parliament and saying Kosovo
Albanians would have their own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   Milosevic has portrayed his handling of the Kosovo crisis as a
victory. On Wednesday similar success claims were made in Moscow,
Belgrade's major ally, which led international opposition to use of
force against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told Russian lawmakers. ``We must knock on wood,
but it appears there will be no airstrikes.''

Unrepentant serial rapist released from Spanish jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A man who refused to join a rehabilitation
program for sex offenders while serving a sentence for 29 rapes was
released from jail Wednesday.
	   Francisco Lopez Maillo had served 14 years and eight months of
his 592-year accumulative sentence when he left a jail in the
northeastern city of Barcelona early Wednesday for an unknown
destination.
	   Lopez knocked years off his sentence by working in the prison
kitchen and participating in activities such as playing football,
but refused to participate in a rehabilitation program for sex
offenders, prison officials told TVE national television.
	   ``I leave it up to each woman to decide whether to forgive me,''
Lopez said in an earlier interview with TVE in which he showed few
signs of remorse.
	   The release of an apparently unrepentant serial rapist prompted
calls for the law to be changed to oblige prisoners to accept
psychological therapy.
	   Government spokeswoman for social affairs, Amalia Gomez, also
said she favored harsher sentences for such cases.
	   As a released prisoner, Lopez is entitled to a stipend of 80,000
pesetas (dlrs 570) per month for 18 months, as well as help with
finding housing and work.

Twenty known hooligans already turned back; 25 arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detentions; police sealing roads around
stadium &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Twenty known hooligans were already headed
back to England Wednesday and two-dozen more English fans were
sobering up in jail ahead of the Euro 2000 qualifier between
Luxembourg and England.
	   About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high
alert throughout the day, outnumbered by some 2,500 English soccer
fans who poured into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy.
	   The last two visits of England here in 1977 and 1983 were marred
by crowd violence, when hooligans smashed up the Josy Barthel
national stadium and then rampaged through the streets, demolishing
cars and storefronts.
	   On Tuesday, two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels
airport in neighboring Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because
their names were on police lists of known hooligans. Six were sent
back to England, the rest would be expelled by the end of the day,
said Lt. Eric Froidmont of the Belgian gendarmes.
	   Before the match, police in Luxembourg said they had arrested 25
drunken fans in the capital and on the border with Belgium. Police
spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd be released after the
game.
	   Police sealed off streets around the stadium, and were only
letting ticket holders past their barriers. Lindenlaub said there
was no major trouble before the game.
	   This year, English hooligans have already left a trail of
destruction wherever their team played during the World Cup in
France. There was violence again in Sweden last month, the last
time England played abroad.
	   In Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 people shoehorned in between
France, Belgium and Germany, police have warned shopkeepers in the
capital of possible violence and many planned to close their shops
early.
	   ``You can see there are fewer people in town, they've afraid to
come downtown,'' said Isilda Moreira, in her smart fashion store.
``We all know this lot are more aggressive than other supporters.
	   Moreira was keeping her store open as usual, but the next-door
greengrocers had the shutters down with and a handwritten sign in
the window ``Closed because of the soccer.''
	   England already lost its first Euro 2000 game in Sweden, and
played poorly in a scoreless draw at Wembley against Bulgaria on
Saturday. A slip-up against the amateurs from Luxembourg could
provoke the English fans to take it out on the town.
	   Police have long prepared for the encounter. Cooperation with
the border authorities in Belgium and France was beefed up and a
half dozen spotters from British police will accompany the fans.
	   After the match, the fans who came by train could have to sit
out the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport will be
available until the morning.

Greece beats Georgia 3-0 in European Championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With three first half goals Greece beat
Georgia 3-0 Wednesday in a Group 2 qualifying game for the 2000
European Championships.
	   It was Greece's first win in its effort to reach the final
rounds of the competition. In the opening match, Greece drew 2-2
against Slovenia at home.
	   Playing on a wet pitch before 7,000 spectators at the Athens
Olympic stadium, Greece pushed from the start, scoring two goals in
three minutes.
	   Nikos Lymberopoulos centered from the right, Georgian goalie
Nika Togonidze dived to save, but last season's European top scorer
Nikos Machlas who plays for the Dutch team Vitesse, stole the ball
to give Greece the lead in the 12th minute.
	   Three minutes later, Lymberopoulos made it 2-0 off a pass from
Theodoros Zagorakis.
	   The visitors came close to scoring in the 16th, but Gocha
Dzhamarauli's shot from three meters (yards) went wide.
	   Georgia pressed to narrow the difference, but it was Greece
which scored again with a header by Marinos Ouzounidis off a free
kick from Costas Frantzeskos in the 36th.
	   The Georgians became more aggressive after the rest period, but
they never threatened goaltender Ilias Atmatzidis. Instead, the
Greeks missed two scoring opportunities when Georgian players made
line saves.
	   In addition, Togonidze flew to make a spectacular save to a shot
by Frantzeskos.
	   Lineups:
	   Greece: Ilias Atmatzidis, Marinos Ouzounidis, Ilias Poursanidis,
Yiannis Kalitzakis, Theodoros Zagorakis, Costas Frantzeskos, Nikos
Dabitzas, Dimitris Markos, Grigoris Georgatos, Nikos Machlas, Nikos
Limberopoulos,
	   Georgia: Nika Togonidze, Nakhi Kaladze, Michail Kavelashvili,
Murtaz Shella, Gela Sheikiladze, Michail Kavelashvili, Georgy
Nemsadze, Gocha Dzhamarauli, Temur Ketsbaya, Georgy Kinkladze,

Five Israeli Arabs confess to setting forest fires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Five Arab youths confessed to starting some of
the forest fires that ravaged several communities this week, in
revenge for police aggression against Arab demonstrators during a
recent land dispute, an official said Wednesday.
	   The fires began Sunday in northern Israel and spread through the
Carmel mountains destroying dozens of homes and large tracts of
land. Officials had suspected that some of the fires were started
deliberately, while others were caused by careless picnickers,
police said.
	   Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said that the five
youths were residents of the Wadi Ara area, where the fires were
started. It is also the same area where some 70 people were wounded
in two-day long clashes recently between Arab residents and Israeli
troops over a land dispute. The clashes shocked the country and
further strained relations between Israel's Jews and its Arab
minority.

1999 state budget rejected by Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Parliament narrowly
rejected Wednesday the 1999 state budget presented by the minority
government of Premier Milos Zeman, the CTK news agency reported.
	   Deputies in the 200-seat chamber voted 101-97 to reject the
draft budget in the first reading. Two deputies did not take part
in the vote or weren't present.
	   The draft, featuring a dlrs 1 billion deficit with planned
revenues around dlrs 21 billion, was blasted by the center-right
three-party opposition led by Parliament speaker Vaclav Klaus.
	   Speaking shortly after the vote, Zeman said his Cabinet would
submit another draft in 30 days as stipulated by the constitution,
private TV Prima said.
	   Zeman's center-left Social Democrats won the country's early
election in June 1998 but failed to form a majority coalition
government.
	   They will need to reach an agreement with Klaus to assure the
budget's passage.
	   Such an accord is very likely due to a stability pact signed
between Zeman and Klaus after the election.

OSCE head postpones Caucasus trip because of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe has postponed a visit to Georgia, Armenia and
Azerbaijan because of the conflict in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, who is also Poland's foreign minister, was to
visit the three Caucasus Mountains nations Thursday through Sunday.
He will instead probably travel there in November, the ITAR-Tass
and Interfax news agencies reported.
	   His visits to the former Soviet republics were to include
discussions about Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled enclave
within Azerbaijan over which the two countries fought a war.
	   Geremek has been active in negotiations to prevent NATO
airstrikes on Kosovo.

No hints, as usual, from secretive Nobel Peace Prize committee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Colombia in graf 4 and Salvation Army in
graf 16 &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The tightlipped Nobel Peace Prize committee
doesn't give clues, which leaves Nobel watchers grasping anything
that even hints of being a hint about who will win the coveted
prize on Friday.
	   Guesses include someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace
process, or a human rights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of
the U.N. Human Rights Charter, or Czech President Vaclav Havel on
the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or U.S.
peace mediator Richard Holbrooke.
	   Although the committee made its decision before Holbrooke
achieved an apparent breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis, it meets
just before announcing the prize and could make changes.
	   Others mentioned in the speculation are the Doctors Without
Borders humanitarian group, the children's peace movement in
Colombia and even the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda and the
former Yugoslavia.
	   Geir Lundestad, the nonvoting secretary of the five-member
Norwegian Nobel Committee, watches the frantic and sometimes
fractured reasoning behind the news media's guesses every year.
	   ``Sometimes it's a little amusing, but sometimes there is so
much speculation about one or two people who then don't get the
prize, that I feel a little bad for them,'' Lundestad said
Wednesday.
	   Last year, American Jody Williams and her International Campaign
to Ban Landmines at the top of the media's guess list and, in fact,
won. Two years earlier, however, the winners _ Joseph Rotblat and
the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs _ weren't even
mentioned in speculation.
	   All Lundestad would say about this year's prize is that there
were a record 139 nominations; includes a cash award of 7.6 million
Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000); and will be presented in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of its benefactor, Alfred
Nobel of Sweden.
	   Beyond that, those attempting to guess the winner are left to
their own devices.
	   For example, the announcement that an Irish musical group, the
Cranberries, would perform at the traditional Nobel Peace Concert
in December led to a frenzy of speculation that the Nobel Laureate
had to be involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.
	   Honoring the Northern Ireland effort would be keeping with the
committee's tradition of using the prize's prestige to push a
peace, human rights or democratization effort. And Ireland's
peacemakers, especially Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Ulster
Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume, are widely
believed to be in contention for this year's prize.
	   ``But that anyone would believe that we would reveal the
nationality of the winner by picking artists for the concert amazes
me,'' said Lundestad. ``Most of the performers are Norwegian so, by
that logic, the winner would have to be Norwegian.''
	   Even if there was a nationality glitch in planning the concert,
it wouldn't say much. Another potential laureate, Mary Robinson as
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, is also Irish. Many
believe this year's prize could honor her office or another human
rights activist on the U.N. charter's anniversary.
	   The committee might also honor two anniversaries at once with a
prize to Havel, the Czech president. Havel is noted as a human
rights activist, and this is 30th anniversary of the Praque Spring
democracy movement that was crushed by a Soviet invasion.
	   Since peace is a key human right, the winner could be someone
like Holbrooke for brokering the 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the
Bosnia war and his other Balkan efforts, former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter for his globe-trotting peace efforts or U.S. mediator
George Mitchell for brokering April's peace accords for northern
Ireland.
	   Others mentioned include Kurdish activist Leyla Zana, who is
jailed in Turkey, Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng,
the Salvation Army, Pope John Paul II, Sister Helen Prejean, the
author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' for her campaign against the death
penalty and Mexico's bishop of San Cristobel de las Casas, Samuel
Ruiz Garcia, for his campaign on behalf of the country's Chiapas
Indians.

Rafter beats Black to keep up chase for No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Patrick Rafter kept up the chase for the
No. 1 ranking by beating Byron Black 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in the first
round of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tournament Wednesday.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, is No. 2 and has a chance of
replacing Pete Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the
coming weeks.
	   While Rafter advanced, third-seed Carlos Moya, the French Open
champion, was upset by Bohdan Ulihrach, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Eighth-seeded Tim Henman advanced by beating Magnus Gustafsson
6-3, 6-4.
	   Rafter used one break of serve to win the first set.
	   In the second, Rafter fought back from a break down and saved
four set points to hold serve for 6-6. The Australian used his
powerful serve-and-volley game to win the tiebreaker.
	   Rafter leads the tour with six titles this year.
	   Henman, coming off back-to-back titles in Tashkent and Basel,
celebrated his 18th win in the last 21 matches despite fighting a
cold at the start of the week.
	   The Briton is on pace to reach the eight-man ATP Tour World
Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Moya blew a 4-1 lead in the first set and two set points in the
tiebreaker. In the second, he fought back from a 4-1 deficit, but
double-faulted to give Ulihrach the match.

Report: Ukraine's 1998 grain harvest to drop significantly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine will collect much less grain this
year than last, the Agriculture Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The country's grain harvest is expected to total 28 million tons
(30.8 million short tons), which is 21.1 percent down from last
year's harvest of 35.7 million tons (39.3 million short tons), the
ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   State agricultural officials have downgraded their grain harvest
forecasts several times over the previous month due to recent
droughts and heavy rainstorms that in the summer have swept over
most of Ukraine. The country is the largest grain producer in the
former Soviet Union.
	   The lower harvest is not likely to affect the country's domestic
consumption, since it is still far above the amount of grain
Ukraine needs annually.

Nicaraguan soldiers guard ancient city uncovered in jungle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FILADELFO ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's president said Wednesday
that he had sent soldiers to guard a lost Indian city discovered by
a filmmaker in a southeastern jungle.
	   A team of Nicaraguan scientists set out Wednesday for the remote
site, and President Arnoldo Aleman said another team including
scientists from New Orleans' Tulane University would follow. It is
near the Costa Rican border, 150 miles (250 kilometers) southeast
of the capital, Managua.
	   If the two-square-mile (five-square-kilometer) site is proven to
be a lost Chibcha Indian city, as archaeologists believe, Aleman
said it ``would be of great touristic benefit to the country. It
must be protected.''
	   The site was discovered early this month by a Costa Rican
documentary filmmaker, Jose Cortes. It includes more than 10 rock
piles that are believed to be tombs and could contain gold jewelry,
archaeologists said.
	   Archaeologists disagreed about the find.
	   Nicaraguan archaeologist Jose Espinoza said the discovery could
be the city of Cariay, described by Christopher Columbus during his
fourth trip to the New World. Espinoza said Columbus wrote about
the city to Queen Isabel in a June 7, 1503 letter.
	   According to the letter, it was five leagues (14.5 kilometers)
upstream along the San Juan River from the Caribbean Sea, which
matches the site's location. Columbus said the Chibcha Indians
there were great gold artisans _ better than the Aztecs, Mayas or
Incas.
	   Another Nicaraguan archaeologist, Jaime Incer, disagreed.
	   ``It's very premature to make statements,'' he said, ``But I
think it appears to be the city of Yari or Yare, which the Spanish
capital Diego de Machuca described in 1539.''
	   He said the remains of the city of Cariay are located in
present-day Costa Rica.

Russian parliamentary delegation leaves for Kosovo

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested
Wednesday that Russia helped bring about the apparent breakthrough
in the Kosovo crisis by threatening to break relations with NATO.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Primakov told the
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.
	   ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on Kosovo,
we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider our
orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now
working.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of
the turn of events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to
continue working ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations and allow international observers into the troubled
province.
	   ``Today the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said.
``We must knock on wood, but it appears there will be no
airstrikes.''
	   The six-country Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov departed for Paris on Wednesday evening to
attend the meeting.

Brezhnev's grandson founds new communist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The grandson of late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev
made his political debut Wednesday, as general secretary of a new
communist party he founded to oppose those who ``gave up'' the
Soviet Union.
	   Andrei Brezhnev, 37, said his All-Russia Communist
Socio-Political Movement already had 5,000 members and would take
part in parliamentary and presidential elections. He did not
indicate whether he intends to run for president.
	   Brezhnev, who graduated from the prestigious State Institute for
International Relations and worked for the Soviet Foreign Trade
Ministry, said Wednesday his party would not cooperate with other
movements, including the powerful Communist Party.
	   ``We are strong enough, and plan to work independently,'' he
said in comments broadcast by Russia's ORT television.
	   He also said: ``In our movement there will be no place for those
who were beside (Mikhail) Gorbachev or followed his instructions in
the regions, or for those who gave up power to (Boris) Yeltsin in
1991 without a struggle.''
	   Gorbachev was the last president of the Soviet Union, which
collapsed in 1991.
	   In announcing the new party, Brezhnev recalled a childhood
conversation with his grandfather.
	   Leonid Brezhnev, then general secretary of the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union, asked, ``What do you want to be when you grow
up?''
	   His grandson replied, ``General secretary.''
	   ``What do we need another one for?'' the elder Brezhnev replied.

Belated recognition for contraversial Jewish rescuer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ One of the most controversial Jews of
the Holocaust was remembered Wednesday when a plaque was unveiled
in memory of Rezsoe Kasztner.
	   In his own lifetime - and since - he was praised by many Jews
and hated by even more.
	   He was called the ``Hungarian Wallenberg,'' a reference to Raoul
Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who became a savior of Hungarian
Jews and is believed to have been abducted by the Soviets from
Hungary. But Kasztner was also called a traitor and Nazi
collaborator.
	   Kasztner was born in 1906 and saved the lives of thousands of
fellow Jews from the Holocaust.
	   ``He did the same as Wallenberg, but without the diplomatic
immunity Wallenberg enjoyed,'' Tamas Devecseri, a survivor, saved
by Kasztner, said at the unveiling of the memorial plaque at the
house where he lived during the war.
	   Kasztner was a founder of the Jewish Aid and Rescue Committee in
1942, designed to aid Polish Jews who took refuge in Hungary after
their country was occupied by the Nazis.
	   When in 1944 the Nazis invaded Hungary and the deportation of
one million Hungarian Jews started, Kasztner, with disregard for
his own personal safety, boldly started wrangling with the Germans
about lives for money.
	   He went as far as to negotiate with Adolf Eichman, Hitler's
henchman, who was in charge of the ``final solution'' in Hungary,
at the Gestapo headquarters in Budapest.
	   However, his opponents could never forgive him for having
negotiated with the ``devil,'' as Eichman was called by the Jews.
	   There are undocumented charges of collaboration, and the issue
was a major controversy in Hungarian Jewish circles and in Israel.
	   Kasztner's biggest deal with the Nazis was that they allowed a
train full of Jews, mostly renowned thinkers, artists and rabbis,
to leave Hungary for Switzerland in the last and worst months of
the war.
	   `There are things in life that can't be done well, only badly or
worse,'' another Kasztner survivor, Gyoergy Rozsa said, referring
to the charges that Kasztner differentiated among the Jews, and
saved only the wealthy.
	   ``For this operation he needed money, much money, and
unavoidably there were people whose money he took, but who were
left out of his rescue work,'' he added.
	   Kasztner paid bitterly for this controversy. He survived the
Holocaust, but not the peace that followed.
	   He moved to Israel after the war, where he was killed in 1957 by
a fanatic Jew exacting revenge for Kasztner's alleged
collaboration.

No hints, as usual, from secretive Nobel Peace Prize committee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Members of the Nobel Peace Prize committee
don't hint, so Nobel watchers must grasp for clues about who will
win the coveted prize on Friday.
	   For example, the announcement that the Cranberries, an Irish
band, will perform at the Nobel Peace Concert in December has led
to speculation that the Nobel Laureate will be someone involved in
the Northern Ireland peace process.
	   Other watchers point to the 30th anniversary of the Prague
Spring democracy movement, which was crushed by a Soviet invasion,
and theorize that the committee may use the occasion to honor Czech
President Vaclav Havel, the human rights activist.
	   They say the human rights activist angle also works in Havel's
favor because this year is the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Human
Rights Charter.
	   Another possibility is U.S. peace mediator Richard Holbrooke.
The committee made its decision before he achieved an apparent
breakthrough in ethnic crisis in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, but
it meets just before announcing the prize and could make a dramatic
change.
	   Others include the Doctors Without Borders humanitarian group,
the children's peace movement in Colombia and even the U.N. War
Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   Geir Lundestad, the nonvoting secretary of the five-member
Norwegian Nobel Committee, watches the sometimes tortured reasoning
behind the news media's guesses every year.
	   ``Sometimes it's a little amusing, but sometimes there is so
much speculation about one or two people who then don't get the
prize, that I feel a little bad for them,'' Lundestad said
Wednesday.
	   Last year's winner, American Jody Williams and her International
Campaign to Ban Landmines was at the top of the media's guess list.
But the winners in 1995 _ Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash Conference
on Science and World Affairs _ weren't even mentioned in the
speculation.
	   All Lundestad would say about this year's prize is that there
were a record 139 nominations; includes a cash award of 7.6 million
Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000); and will be presented in Oslo on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of its benefactor, Alfred
Nobel of Sweden.
	   Honoring the Northern Ireland effort would be keeping with the
committee's tradition of using the prize's prestige to push a
peace, human rights or democratization effort. And Ireland's
peacemakers, especially Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Ulster
Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume, are widely
believed to be in contention for this year's prize.
	   ``But that anyone would believe that we would reveal the
nationality of the winner by picking artists for the concert amazes
me,'' said Lundestad. ``Most of the performers are Norwegian so, by
that logic, the winner would have to be Norwegian.''
	   But even if the nationality of the concert performers counted,
it wouldn't necessary mean the committee must be looking at the
Northern Ireland peace effort. Another potential laureate, Mary
Robinson as U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, is also Irish.
Many believe this year's prize could honor her office or another
human rights activist on the U.N. charter's anniversary.
	   Others mentioned include Kurdish activist Leyla Zana, who is
jailed in Turkey, Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng,
the Salvation Army, Pope John Paul II, Sister Helen Prejean, the
author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' for her campaign against the death
penalty and Mexico's bishop of San Cristobel de las Casas, Samuel
Ruiz Garcia, for his campaign on behalf of the country's Chiapas
Indians.
	   The secretive Nobel committee, which allows no notes to leave
the room during its five or six meetings a year, refuses to even
say who is nominated.
	   ``There are only six of us who know the name of the winner. Not
even the staff knows. We ought to be able to keep it secret,'' said
Lundestad.

Fight over economics ministry continues in Schroeder camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The computer entrepreneur Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder wants as his economics minister reportedly has
said he won't take the job if the Finance Ministry poaches some of
his duties.
	   Jost Stollmann sent a letter to Schroeder complaining about the
power grab by designated Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine,
according to Thursday's editions of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, a
Munich-based newspaper.
	   Lafontaine has proposed that he also take over European affairs
from the economics ministry, giving him the same responsibility for
broad economic policy his colleagues in Britain and France have.
	   This would give Lafontaine unprecedented clout to set German
economic and financial policies.
	   Stollmann rejected Lafontaine's call to hand over some of the
ministry's authorities on Tuesday. But as a non-party member,
Stollmann will have a hard time defending his future ministry's
prerogatives from Lafontaine, who also chairs the Social Democratic
party.
	   Lafontaine's more interventionist economic views are thought to
contrast broadly with Stollmann's market-oriented ideas. Stollmann
can depend on Schroeder's support, but Lafontaine enjoys
considerable party backing.

Researchers: Gamma bursts, supernovas may be linked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Astronomers believe they have solved one of
the universe's biggest mysteries and figured out the source of at
least some of the gamma ray bursts that bombard Earth's atmosphere
from time to time.
	   These cosmic flashes may come from the explosion of dying stars
called supernovas.
	   Gamma ray bursts, high-energy flashes of light that can be seen
only from space, have befuddled scientists ever since they were
discovered just over 25 years ago. Such bursts occur, on average,
once a day in the observable universe.
	   A new window on the phenomenon opened April 25, when a burst of
gamma rays occurred at about the same time and near the most
unusual supernova ever observed.
	   In Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, researchers at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the supernova
may have generated the gamma ray burst by ejecting a stream of
material at close to the speed of light.
	   ``I think we've found the missing link between the two greatest
explosions in the universe: a supernova and a gamma ray burst,''
said Stan Woosley, chairman of astronomy and astrophysics at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. ``It tells us the engine
that makes this supernova is also capable of making the gamma ray
burst.''
	   Since U.S. spy satellites first detected gamma ray bursts,
scientists have tried to explain them as products of colliding
neutron stars that coalesce into a black hole or as the result of a
massive black hole swallowing a neutron star.
	   A neutron star is the collapsed core left after a star explodes.
Neutron stars release energy by spewing light, radio waves and
particles.
	   The gamma ray findings are forcing scientists to re-examine
their ideas about supernovas, which are important because they seed
the galaxies with the iron, oxygen and carbon essential to life.
	   It's believed that most gamma ray bursts occur billions of
light-years away from Earth, but the April burst was just 140
million light-years away, and was much weaker than the distant
ones. It was the first one ever observed in connection with a
supernova.
	   Gamma ray bursts have higher energy than all other forms of
radiation, but that energy never affects Earth's surface because it
gets absorbed by the atmosphere. One such burst, detected on Dec.
14, 1997, was the greatest cosmic blast since the Big Bang that
created the universe.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The tightlipped Nobel Peace Prize committee
doesn't give clues, which leaves Nobel watchers grasping anything
that even hints of being a hint about who will win the coveted
prize on Friday.
	   Guesses include someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace
process, or a human rights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of
the U.N. Human Rights Charter, or Czech President Vaclav Havel on
the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or U.S.
peace mediator Richard Holbrooke.
	   Although the committee made its decision before Holbrooke

	   Beyond that, those attempting to guess the winner are left to
their own devices.
	   For example, the announcement that an Irish musical group, the
Cranberries, would perform at the traditional Nobel Peace Concert
in December led to a frenzy of speculation that the Nobel Laureate
had to be involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.

it wouldn't say much. Another potential laureate, Mary Robinson as
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, is also Irish. Many
believe this year's prize could honor her office or another human
rights activist on the U.N. charter's anniversary.
	   The committee might also honor two anniversaries at once with a
prize to Havel, the Czech president. Havel is noted as a human
rights activist, and this is 30th anniversary of the Prague Spring
democracy movement that was crushed by a Soviet invasion.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Security has been tightened at the Lagos
airport ahead of the anticipated return Wednesday of Nigeria's
pre-eminent exile, the Nobel Prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka.
	   Extra security agents were dispatched to the airport late
Tuesday night, and security checks were more pronounced at the
airport Wednesday.
	   Friends of Soyinka's say he is expected to land in Lagos on
Wednesday night.
	   Soyinka, who fled Nigeria four years ago fearing an attack from
the regime of the late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, has said he was
concerned about his security once he returned to Nigeria.
	   Soyinka recently met in New York with Nigeria's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who urged him to return home.
	   The new junta recently dropped treason charges against Soyinka _
charges filed during Abacha's rule which were believed to have been
trumped up in an attempt to silence Soyinka, a vocal critic of the
Nigerian junta.
	   Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, a friend of Soyinka's, said Tuesday that a
large airport welcome was being planned for the playwright's
return.
	   At Abubakar's urging, several exiles have returned to Nigeria in
recent months. The general, who took office after Abacha died in
June, pledges to return Nigeria to democracy and has freed many
political prisoners.
	   Soyinka, who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta, won the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, the first African to win the
award. He fled Nigeria in 1994 after learning that military
authorities were going to arrest him for criticizing the
government.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but 10
years since gaining independence from Britain in 1960.

Saddam chairs second meeting on U.N. inspections, no decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein and his top aides
held a second meeting Wednesday to review relations with United
Nations but took no decision on restarting the stalled weapons
inspections, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   INA said Saddam chaired a meeting of the Revolutionary Command
Council and the regional Command of the Baath party to review the
issue. A similar meeting was held Tuesday but a decision was
deferred.
	   The Iraqi leadership completed its discussion of ``the various
aspects of the intelligence process'' that U.N. weapons inspectors
have been conducting against Iraq, INA said.
	   It said the leadership will resume its discussion of the topic
but gave no details.
	   Iraq and the United Nations are locked in a standoff over
weapons inspections which the country is compelled to
unconditionally accept under the terms that ended the 1991 Gulf War
over Kuwait.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with U.N. arms monitors Aug. 5,
saying it will not allow the inspectors carry out any more spot
searches of its banned weapons unless the Security Council takes
tangible steps to remove the sanctions.
	   The embargo limits Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
The Security Council has said it cannot be lifted until the
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.

Striking state workers converge on capital, challenge President

Pastrana &QL;

 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of striking public
sector workers marched Wednesday through Colombia's capital,
clogging arteries and jamming Bogota's main square in defiance of
President Andres Pastrana, who says giving in to union demands
imperil the economy.
	   Marchers from the provinces, arriving in more than 300 buses,
added to the shouting masses who converged on Bolivar Plaza, waving
the Colombian flag, carrying placards and paralyzing downtown
traffic.
	   ``The government is more concerned with the peace process and
guerrillas than with listening to a part of the public that isn't
armed,'' striking teacher Luz Garcia said of Pastrana's policy
priority of establishing a peace dialogue with leftist rebels.
	   The strikers are protesting a government austerity package that
cuts spending on social spending and reduces wage increases next
year to about 14 percent. Union leaders insist on salary increases
that at least match Colombia's 18 percent inflation, and an end to
plans to privatize state industries.
	   A midday rain shower drenched marchers and helmeted riot police
who ringed the square as strike leaders delivered speeches from the
steps of Congress, vowing to continue the walkout until their
demands are met. The weeklong strike, which has hobbled essential
services, is the first major political test of the conservative
president's two-month administration.
	   ``We have a country unnecessarily and unjustly in convulsion,''
Labor Minister Fernando Yepes said in a radio interview Wednesday.
The stoppage and related slowdowns have canceled classes for
millions of students, shut down courts, limited hospitals to
emergency services and caused extensive delays at some airports.
	   Union leaders representing more than 650,000 workers stormed out
of negotiations on Tuesday night after Pastrana, in a national
television and radio address, defended his refusal to offer
concessions, which he said would aggravate the budget deficit.
	   ``We are not going to give in to unattainable demands that
endanger the country's economic integrity,'' said Pastrana. He
portrayed the strikers as a selfish and unpatriotic minority and
accused the unions of stacking picket lines with ``human walls'' of
pregnant women and children.
	   The rancor was aggravated Tuesday as striking workers and
security forces scuffled in Bogota and the north-central city of
Barrancabermeja, where the state-owned oil company Ecopetrol has
its main refinery, over strikers' refusal to admit other employees
into workplaces.
	   Luis Eduardo Garzon, president of the Central Council of
Workers, called Pastrana's speech counterproductive.
	   ``What he did was polarize the situation,'' he said in a radio
interview Wednesday, adding that he expected 100,000 workers to
march on Bogota.
	   Pastrana says the belt-tightening is needed to correct for the
fiscal excesses of prior governments, but the unions say they
shouldn't be made to pay for those mistakes.

</HEADLINE>
Chechnya &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 6th graf with two clans demanding hostages'
release and vowing revenge. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The British Embassy in Moscow has received no
direct information about three Britons and a New Zealander
kidnapped in breakaway Chechnya nearly two weeks ago, an embassy
official said Wednesday.
	   No ransom demands have been made for the hostages, said an
embassy spokeswoman, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechnya's security forces launched a 10-day crackdown last
week, seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads
to the hostages.
	   A particularly thorough search was being conducted in Chechnya's
mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held. No trace of
the Britons and the New Zealander have been found, Chechen
officials have said.
	   Two Chechen clans who said the foreigners had been ``under their
protection'' demanded the release of the hostages Wednesday and
threatened revenge. They called the kidnapping ``an insult to two
of the most influential clans in Chechnya,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Another high-profile hostage, Russian presidential envoy
Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped on May 1, remains missing.

Prosecutors say they are investigating former Auschwitz doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - Authorities said Wednesday they are
investigating a retired German physician who admits he helped
notorious Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele carry out medical experiments
on Auschwitz concentration camp inmates.
	   Bavarian prosecutors began examining 87-year-old Hans Muench two
weeks ago after Der Spiegel newsmagazine published an interview
quoting him as saying that gassing Jews at Auschwitz was
humanitarian because they would have suffered longer dying of
disease.
	   Helmut Schuetz, a spokesman at the Bavarian state chancellery,
said prosecutors in Munich began an immediate investigation of
Muench for playing down the seriousness of what the Nazis did at
Auschwitz, where some 1.5 million Jews perished. Muench lives in
the Bavarian town of Rosshaupten.
	   However, Schuetz said that ``since prosecutors in Frankfurt are
already investigating Muench'' in another case, the latest
investigation may be added to the ongoing one to speed up the
process.
	   Frankfurt prosecutor Job Tilmann confirmed his office was
investigating war crimes charges Muench was acquitted of by a
Polish court in 1947.
	   He said his office was still waiting for files from Munich to
decide whether to combine the cases.
	   Schuetz denied allegations in a letter from the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Paris sent to Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, which charges
that two weeks after the Spiegel interview nothing had been done
about Muench.
	   A copy of the letter from the Wiesenthal center obtained by The
Associated Press asks Stoiber ``to immediately detain Muench
pending an investigation of his complicity in war crimes and his
current violation of German laws against the banalization of the
Holocaust.''
	   ``He speaks of the Jews as sub-human and the laborious problems
in burning them. Rejecting any remorse, Muench praises his
notorious colleague, Dr. Joseph Mengele,'' the letter says.
	   Mengele, known as the Nazi ``Angel of Death,'' conducted cruel
experiments on Jewish inmates at Auschwitz, including injections in
the eyes to try to change their color.
	   In the Spiegel interview, Muench is quoted as saying he could
only ``speak the best,'' about Mengele, who arrived at Auschwitz
the same day in the summer of 1943.
	   ``Mengele and the others sent us their material, heads, livers,
spinal fluid, whatever came up. We analyzed it,'' Spiegel quotes
Muench as saying.
	   Spiegel said Muench had no remorse about working at Auschwitz,
and claims that the medical experiments carried out there prevented
more inmates from dying of diseases that were rampant at Auschwitz.
	   ``I was the king in the hygiene institute. That happens very
quickly, calmly to live at a place where hundreds of thousands of
people were gassed. That didn't bother me,'' the report quotes
Muench as saying.
	   Muench was tried as a war criminal in an Auschwitz trial at
Krakow, Poland, in 1947 for his malaria and rheumatism experiments
in which Jews were infected on purpose to study if they were
immune, according to Spiegel.
	   He spent 10 months in prison in investigative custody, but was
acquitted of war crimes on Dec. 22, 1947, by the Polish national
court, Spiegel said.
	   ``A string of my prisoners spoke up for me,'' Spiegel quoted
Muench as saying.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian support for armed attacks against
Israel is on the rise and while confidence in the peace process
remains high, a majority believe agreement is far from reach,
according to a survey released Wednesday.
	   The results come a day before a Mideast peace summit between the
leaders of Israel and Palestinians aimed at ending months of
stalemate and completing agreement on an Israeli troop pullback
from the West Bank.
	   The poll was conducted by The Center for Palestine Research and
Studies, which conducts similar public opinion polls every three
months among Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Fifty-one percent of the Palestinian public questioned said they
support acts of violence against Israel, up 7 percent from August.
	   However, a majority of Palestinians still back the peace
process. Sixty-six percent of those polled said they support peace
with Israel, while 30 percent opposed. And 49 percent said they now
believe that the peace process would lead to Palestinian statehood,
compared to 37 percent in August.
	   The sharpest drop came regarding public support for a unilateral
declaration of statehood _ something which Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat is considering for May 1999 in the absence of
progress in peace talks.
	   Forty-five percent said they would support the move, down from
58 percent in June. The center attributes the decline to Israeli
threats of collective punishment such as closure or annexation of
more land and uncertainty over how the Palestinian leadership would
handle such a crisis.
	   Still, 61 percent of those surveyed said they do not believe
that both sides are capable of reaching agreement over the
conflict's major issues such as Jerusalem, permanent borders and
Jewish settlements. That's an increase of 9 percent in the past 18
months.
	   The poll, conducted door-to-door between October 8-10,
interviewed 1,331 Palestinians and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percent.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nikos Machlas, Nikos Lymberopoulos and
Marinos Ouzounidis all scored first-half goals and Greece cruised
to a 3-0 European Championship qualifying victory Wednesday.
	   Playing on a wet pitch before 7,000 spectators at the Athens
Olympic stadium, Greece pushed from the start and scored two goals
in three minutes. It raised its record to 1-1-0 and four points in
Group Two.
	   Lymberopoulos set up the first goal, crossing the ball from the
right. Georgian keeper Nika Togonidze dived to knock it away but
Machlas stole the ball to give Greece the lead in the 12th minute.
	   Three minutes later, Lymberopoulos made it 2-0 off a pass from
Theodoros Zagorakis.
	   The visitors came close to scoring in the 16th, but Gocha
Dzhamarauli's shot from three meters went wide.
	   Georgia pressed to narrow the difference, but it was Greece
which scored again with a header by Ouzounidis off a free kick from
Costas Frantzeskos in the 36th.
	   The Georgians became more aggressive after halftime, but never
threatened goalkeeper Ilias Atmatzidis. Instead, the Greeks missed
two scoring opportunities when Georgian field players saved the
ball off the line.

Iraq aims to produce up to 6 million barrels daily after sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq aims to produce up to six million
barrels of oil a day after the U.N. sanctions are lifted, but the
ambitious plan requires at least dlrs 30 billion investments, an
Oil Ministry study says.
	   The study said it will take five years after the sanctions end
to achieve the target that will make Iraq the second largest oil
producer in the world after Saudi Arabia, which extracts 8 million
barrels a day.
	   Foreign firms have already been invited to develop ``ten
super-giant oil fields'' as part of the government plan to boost
production, said the study. A copy was obtained by The Associated
Press Wednesday.
	   ``Iraq may be the only country in the world with giant oil
fields, fully discovered, fully appraised and just waiting to be
developed,'' the study said.
	   Companies from France, Russia, China, Italy, Spain, India, South
Korea, Malaysia and Canada are vying to win the contracts, it said.
	   The unabashed attempt to woo investors marks a U-turn for Iraq's
petroleum industry, which for decades has been fully, owned and
operated by the government.
	   Sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait barred
oil exports, impoverished the country and laid waste its oil
industry. Now, it appears that only outside money can rehabilitate
the decrepit infrastructure.
	   Attracting potential investors has other benefits: businesses
can pressure their governments to help Iraq get rid of the
sanctions.
	   Iraq produced 3.5 million barrels a day before the 1991 Gulf War
over Kuwait. Recently, officials have said Iraq should be exempted
from production quotas of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries because of the high losses sustained by the sanctions.
	   The study appears to reiterate that stand. It said even a daily
production of 8 billion barrels a day is attainable with the
participation of foreign companies.
	   The dlrs 30 billion investment needed will be raised by foreign
companies selling their share of crude that they will produce in
Iraq, the study said.
	   Still, it is not clear how much money oil companies have
committed so far or intend to do so.
	   The study said at least five of the 10 super fields have already
been offered but only two countries _ Russia and China _ have
signed agreements for the West Qurna oil field and the Ahdab field.
	   Negotiations are going on with France's Elf and Total and
Italy's Agip for other fields, it said.
	   Iraq says its proven reserves are 112 billion barrels, the
world's second largest after Saudi Arabia's 261 billion barrels.
Iraq's probable reserves are 214 billion barrels, the study said.
	   For now, Iraq's main concern would be reaching the pre-war
target of 3.5 million barrels a day once the sanctions are lifted.
That alone will require an investment of about dlrs 6 billion, the
study said.
	   But there is no indication when the sanctions will end. For that
to happen, the United Nations must be fully satisfied that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.

New German coalition sets landmark steps to integrate foreigners
</HEADLINE>

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Declaring Germany ``a country of
immigrants,'' the future governing partners reached a landmark
agreement Wednesday to promote the integration of immigrants by
modernizing the nation's 85-year-old citizenship law.
	   The decision to ease citizenship requirements is the first major
policy shift resulting from the left's election victory last month
and an important gesture to 7 million foreign residents who make up
nearly 10 percent of the population.
	   Germany's 2 million Turks have fought especially hard for the
changes. Most Turkish children born here have grown up virtually as
Germans, but they still feel excluded from an increasingly
multicultural society by the citizenship law.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and their
junior partner, the Greens, said they intend to give automatic
citizenship to German-born children of foreigners for the first
time, if one of their parents has been living in Germany since age
14.
	   Both sides also agreed on allowing dual citizenship _ an
important point for the Turkish population _ and on shortening
foreigners' eligibility for naturalization to eight years from 15.
	   ``It is a clear signal for integration,'' said Greens negotiator
Kerstin Mueller, a domestic policy expert. ``This government will
recognize that Germany is a country of immigrants.''
	   The language took direct aim at outgoing Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's government, which insisted that Germany is not a country of
immigrants.
	   The changes will scrap the principle of a 1913 law that bases
automatic citizenship on German blood ties, not place of birth.
	   For example, ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union
currently have an immediate right to a passport even though their
forebears left the homeland generations ago. But Turks living in
Germany must wait until they are teenagers to even apply for
citizenship. Current law requires Turks to give up their Turkish
passport, which many are reluctant to do.
	   Germany began recruiting large numbers of Turkish workers in the
1960s to help fuel its postwar economic boom. In recent years, they
and their children have made headlines mainly as victims of
anti-foreigner violence, including a 1993 firebombing in which five
Turks died.
	   Wednesday's agreement followed tough bargaining in which the
Greens gave up more liberal goals. They had called for naturalizing
foreign children simply if one of their parents is a permanent
resident.
	   ``Finding a compromise was not easy,'' Mueller said.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government, which was
voted out in Sept. 27 elections after 16 years, refused to
liberalize the citizenship law, mainly because of pressure from its
conservative Bavarian coalition partner, the Christian Social
Union.
	   But even some liberal members of the old government had been
calling for changes in the law, which critics see as outdated and
nationalistic.
	   Both parties also announced agreements to:
	   _promote controlled distribution of heroin to long-term addicts
to fight drug-related crime.
	   _step up the fight against petty crime, such as shoplifting.
	   _work for expanded rights for homosexual couples.

Is Israel's famed old warrior finally ready for peacemaking?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sharon's other first-day activities, adds reason
given for his late arrival to summit, comment from ministry veteran
on his role
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was a moment like so many in Ariel Sharon's
storied military career: he marched straight in and took charge.
	   Sharon _ aging ex-general, master political survivor, revered by
some as a war hero and reviled by others as a war criminal _
formally assumed control of Israel's foreign ministry on Wednesday,
a day before his departure for a crucial Mideast summit outside
Washington.
	   The 70-year-old Sharon gave every indication of relishing his
re-emergence in a leadership post after a decade and a half of
disgrace and political exile.
	   Even before he showed up to start work at the ministry, he made
his first foray abroad as foreign minister _ a quick trip to
Jordan, in the company of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to
brief leaders about the upcoming summit.
	   Later, meeting with top ministry officials _ and, briefly, with
reporters _ the burly, white-haired Sharon turned on a typical mix
of diplomatic formulations, unyielding doctrine and blunt-force
charm. Asked about the powers of his new position, he laughed.
	   ``I'm not the kind of man people give things to,'' he said in
his trademark trumpeting voice. ``I take them!''
	   Emphatic though his entry was, Sharon's ability to shape the
ministry's agenda is likely tied to the success of the U.S. talks.
After all, he got the job mainly because Netanyahu needs him to
help quell right-wing opposition to any accord reached there.
	   ``The anticipation is that he wants to be involved and
engaged,'' said a ministry veteran. But his long-term ability to do
that ``very much depends on the summit,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Probably no other Israeli public figure arouses such conflicting
passions. To his partisans, Sharon is the daring, brilliant
tactician whose battlefield victories helped turn the tide of three
of Israel's wars, the only politician with the force and stature to
lead the rightist camp.
	   To detractors, he is a destroyer. The Israeli left despises him.
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat flatly describes him as a
war criminal.
	   Many Palestinians hold him responsible for Lebanese Christian
militiamen's 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, and
angrily recall his aggressive promotion of Jewish settlement growth
during a stint as housing minister.
	   Sharon returns the ill feeling: he has said publicly he won't
shake Yasser Arafat's hand, even in his post as Israel's principal
negotiator of peace with the Palestinians.
	   Perhaps to avoid any awkwardness over greeting Arafat, Sharon is
arriving late for the summit. While opening handshakes occur in
Washington, Sharon will still be in Israel, attending a ceremony
for soldiers slain in the 1973 war. Only once the venue has move to
the privacy of the conference center at Wye Plantation, Maryland
will be arrive.
	   Many of Sharon's allies on the right reacted with dismay to his
appointment as foreign minister, considering him an opportunist who
betrayed principles to fulfill his own political ambitions. His
acceptance of the job, they believe, amounts to endorsement of a
land deal with the Palestinians, something they bitterly oppose.
	   Even Sharon's own boss doesn't much care for him. In the past,
Sharon has publicly disparaged Netanyahu, and the prime minister
repaid him by relegating him to the second-string post of
infrastructure minister.
	   Some observers believe Sharon's desire to rise above past
disgrace _ he had not held a top government position for 15 years,
since being held indirectly responsible for the massacres at the
Sabra and Shatilla camps south of Beirut _ could be the key to his
stance at the summit and in months to come.
	   The word being used over and over again by commentators is
pragmatism. Sharon is viewed by friend and foe alike as hard-headed
and hard-nosed, unlikely to sign onto an accord unless he really
thought it would work on the ground.
	   And his background gives him greater credibility than anyone
else on questions of Israel's security, something on which any
accord will hinge.
	   A government official long acquainted with Sharon, speaking on
condition of anonymity, likened his potential role to that of the
late Moshe Dayan in the Camp David process _ ``the practical
general who understands this is the last chapter of his life, that
there are limits to power and the use of force in solving
disputes.''
	   His desire to become a statesman, the official suggested, could
strongly propel him toward unexpected compromise.
	   ``Sharon is a man of surprises, and not only on the
battlefield,'' commentator Avraham Tirosh wrote in the Maariv
newspaper. ``No one is able to assess what Sharon will really do.''

Ukraine beats Armenia 2-0 in Euro Champs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine delivered a 2-0 defeat to Armenia
Wednesday in a European Championship qualifying match, getting a
third straight victory in the tournament in as many games.
	   Ukrainian Serhiy Skachenko opened the score with a 31st minute
header after getting a pass from the left and striking the ball
into the net just a moment before an Armenian defender tried to
strike it away.
	   Ukrainians did not allow the Armenians to create a single
scoring opportunity in the first half and the beginning of the
second, but failed to outplay Armenian goalie Roman Berezovsky, who
made a number of good saves.
	   The Ukrainian team suddenly appeared tired and retreated to its
half of the field some 20 minutes before the end, allowing several
dangerous attacks from their opponents.
	   However, Andriy Husin cheered more than 50,000 spectators at
Kiev's Olimpiyskiy stadium in a quick attack in the 82nd minute.
	   The Ukrainian midfielder struck an irresistible 10-meter
(10-yard) shot, capitalizing on the mistake of an Armenian
defender, who headed the ball directly to Husin's feet while trying
to stop a pass from the left.
	   The victory over Armenia allowed Ukraine to retain the leading
position over France in Group D until the next round of games due
in March 1999.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Ukraine _ Oleksandr Shovkovsky, Oleh Luzhny, Yuriy Dmytrulin,
Oleksandr Holovko, Vladyslav Vashchuk, Serhiy Popov (Yuriy
Maksymov, 77th), Serhiy Skachenko (Serhiy Kovaliov, 63d), Andriy
Husin, Vitaliy Kosovsky, Andriy Shevchenko (Valeriy Kryventsov,
81st), Serhiy Rebrov.
	   Armenia - Roman Berezovsky, Yervand Sukiasian, Vardan

Yugoslav government formally endorses Kosovo agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Set to prove its compliance ahead of
a NATO deadline, the Yugoslav government on Wednesday officially
endorsed a deal President Slobodan Milosevic made on Kosovo, paving
the way for its legal implementation.
	   The government authorized Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic to
sign an agreement with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to send some 2,000-strong ``verification
mission'' to Kosovo, a key point of the agreement Milosevic struck
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The federal government also said it would allow reconnaissance
flights of non-combat NATO planes over Kosovo, another means to
verify whether Milosevic will live up to his pledge to withdraw
special police troops, enable return of refugees and open dialogue
on Kosovo.
	   The Yugoslav government said the deal Milosevic made with
Holbrooke preserved territorial integrity for the country. It said
the deal helped preserve peace in the Balkans.
	   The government also said it supported political measures brought
by the Serbian government on Kosovo that envision self-rule in the
province, as well as elections within nine months.
	   Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, a Milosevic foe, also
hailed the agreement for Kosovo, calling it ``the only possible
wise move.''
	   Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and much smaller Montenegro.

Russian PM assures Fiat on economic openness

 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS decision to speed up work on opening new joint auto plant
in Russia, includes amount of Fiat's planned investment in Russia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried to
assure Italian auto giant Fiat on Wednesday that Russia's economy
will remain open to foreign investment, a news agency reported.
	   ``You must know that Russia wants to be an open economy,''
Primakov told a delegation of Fiat managers, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``We will not shut ourselves off from the
world. We want cooperation with foreign partners.''
	   Fiat is involved in a joint venture with Russia's GAZ automaker,
and has said it does not intend to back down from the deal in spite
of a crippling financial crisis in Russia that has sent many
foreign investors into panic.
	   In fact, Primakov and the Fiat managers agreed at the meeting to
speed up work precipitating the launch of the joint venture, which
will make up to 150,000 cars annually at a plant in Nizhny
Novgorod, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Fiat will invest dlrs 850 million in the plant, currently the
biggest investment by a foreign company in Russia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Fiat is ``important for the Russian as well as the Italian
economy,'' Primakov said. ``We are proceeding to a new stage of
relations and industrial cooperation.''

Georgia steps up security around terminal for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Georgia has stepped up security around a new
terminal receiving oil from the Caspian Sea, bringing in special
government guards to take over from local police, a news report
said Wednesday.
	   The decision to bring in an Interior Ministry force comes amid
an overall tightening of security in the region, officials told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The terminal is near the Black Sea port town of Supsa, which
borders on the breakaway region of Abkhazia. Abkhazia declared
independence in 1992, and separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.

Accused rebel leader asks Sierra Leone's president to testify
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Prosecutors wrapped up their case
Wednesday against Sierra Leone's rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who
stands accused of treason, crimes against humanity and other
related charges.
	   Sankoh, who is organizing his own defense after failing to find
a lawyer, surprised courtroom observers by asking that President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and several rebel leaders living in the bush to
appear as witnesses on his behalf.
	   But the request was denied by Justice J. Ademosu, who ordered
the accused man to limit his witnesses to ``those who will not
demolish his defense but instead help support him.''
	   Kabbah is Sankoh's archrival who spent 10 months in exile
following a bloody May 1997 coup by soldiers allied to Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front, which moved into the capital soon after
the takeover.
	   The junta was driven back into the bush in February by West
African intervention troops and Kabbah's government was restored
soon afterwards.
	   Rebels continue to battle loyalist forces in the interior and
have been accused of killing, maiming and raping thousands of
people in a bitter revenge campaign on Sankoh's behalf.
	   It is not clear when the month-long case _ due to continue later
this week _ will end. If found guilty, Sankoh faces death by
hanging. At least 34 military officers and more than a dozen
civilians have earlier been condemned to death in connection with
last year's coup.

Brazilian Marinho becomes coach of Salvadoran national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Former Brazilian World Cup star
Mario Perez, better known as Marinho, has aggred to become head
coach of El Salvador's national team on Wednesday.
	   Salvadoran Football Federation president Juan Torres said he and
Marinho had come to an agreement and just needed to sign the
contract.
	   ``I come to El Salvador with the certainty that I will win,''
Marinho said, adding that he expected to start work in November.
	   Marinho will replace Milovan D'Joric, a Serb who left after El
Salvador's national team failed to qualify for the World Cup this
year.
	   Marinho, 51, started on Brazil's national team in the 1974 World
Cup in Germany, where Brazil finished fourth. He has coached since
1980, with Brazilian and Portuguese teams, but has never been very
well known as a coach.
	   Neither Torres nor Marinho would comment on the salary, but
Salvadoran news media reported it would be dlrs 180,000 a year.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Counting down toward its Kosovo
deadline, NATO warned Wednesday that Slobodan Milosevic isn't doing
what he must to avoid airstrikes and ethnic Albanian refugees
voiced reluctance to return home out of fear of Serb forces.
	   Even as the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys, skepticism
was widespread that the Yugoslav president will meet international
demands and refrain from further hostilities toward ethnic
Albanians.
	   Demonstrating that it's not taking him at his word, NATO
positioned warplanes at bases in Italy for possible air attacks on
Serbia.
	   ``NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted by Milosevic,'' said
an official at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We'll be keeping up the military pressure for some time to
come.''
	   Milosevic reluctantly agreed Monday to the demands of world
leaders determined to halt his seven-month offensive against
separatist ethnic Albanians and fearful of tragedy involving tens
of thousands of refugees still living in the open as winter
approaches.
	   But even before the agreed-to force of 2,000 international
monitors to check on his compliance is assembled, it's clear
Milosevic has still not met at least one key demand: withdrawing
his forces to levels before the crackdown in the Serbian province
began Feb. 28.
	   The 16 NATO members have given Milosevic until Saturday to
comply fully or face the renewed threat of airstrikes.
	   The official in Brussels said a number of Yugoslav units remain
dug in in Kosovo and must be withdrawn, including what he called
one ``notorious'' special police unit from Nis, Serbia. He declined
to say how many troops remain in the province but said they ``far
exceed'' the level required by NATO.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Western
monitoring teams reported a much smaller Serb police presence in
Kosovo on Wednesday as well as evidence of signs of refugees
returning. But he said the monitoring force is needed, to ensure
that police aren't just being moved around or hidden.

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Twenty known hooligans already were headed
back to England Wednesday and two-dozen more English fans were
arrested prior to the start of the Euro 2000 qualifier between
Luxembourg and England.
	   About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high
alert throughout the day, outnumbered by about 2,500 English soccer
fans who poured into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy.
	   The last two visits of England here in 1977 and 1983 were marred
by crowd violence, when hooligans vandalized Josy Barthel national
stadium and then rampaged through the streets, demolishing cars and
storefronts.
	   On Tuesday, two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels
airport in neighboring Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because
their names were on police lists of known hooligans. Six were sent
back to England, the rest were to be expelled by the end of the
day, Lt. Eric Froidmont of the Belgian gendarmes said.
	   Before the match, police in Luxembourg said they had arrested 25
drunken fans in the capital and on the border with Belgium. Police
spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd be released after the
game.
	   Police sealed off streets around the stadium, and were only
letting ticket holders past their barriers. Lindenlaub said there
was no major trouble before the game.

Government announces privatization of state phone company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz announced
the sale of up to 25 percent of the state telephone monopoly
Wednesday, the biggest privatization since Poland adopted democracy
and market reforms in 1989.
	   Proceeds from the sale of Telekomunikacja Polska SA, valued by
analysts at more than dlrs 8 billion, will be used to cover budget
deficits, reform of the social security system and further
privatizations.
	   The government will sell 15 to 25 percent of the telephone
company's shares beginning Oct. 19, a volume that could double
shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and make it the largest
exchange in central Europe.
	   The government also will look for a private investor in the
telecommunications field to buy a 25 to 35 percent share and
distribute another 15 percent to workers. A further 5 percent will
go to a fund compensating people whose property was confiscated by
the communist regime that controlled Poland for more than 40 years.
	   Public shares will be offered at between 14 and 18.5 zlotys
(dlrs 3.50 and 5.30) per share, Wasacz said.
	   The Polish company is the third major central European
telecommunications company to be privatized, after Hungary's Magyar
Tavkozlesi Vallalat Rt., or Matav, and Czech's SPT Telecom.
	   Privatization of the biggest commercial bank Grupa Pekao SA in
June was the largest sale in Poland so far.
	   Next year, companies targeted for sale include the national
airline, LOT, and petrochemicals giant Petrochemia Plock SA. The
privatization plan also will focus on the electricity, steel,
alcohol and sugar industries, along with parts of the coal
industry.
	   Selling off state holdings is a key component of economic
reforms in Poland, which has one of the strongest economies of
former Soviet satellite states.

Government extends cease-fire by three months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The government extended by three months a
cease-fire that expired Wednesday, to allow food to reach civilians
caught in the war with rebels in the south.
	   Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail told reporters that the
government accepted a truce even though it is aware the rebels may
benefit from it by regrouping and rearming.
	   ``The extension of the cease-fire ... is in recognition of the
humanitarian situation and in response to international and
regional efforts,'' Ismail was quoted by the official Sudan News
Agency as saying.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army announced last week a
similar three-month extension to the three-month truce that the two
sides had concluded in July for the southern Bahr el-Ghazal
province.
	   Ismail also reiterated the government's wish for an unlimited
truce ``to enable delivery of relief to the affected citizens in
south Sudan and create a suitable atmosphere for peace.''
	   He accused the rebels of moving fighters from Bahr el-Ghazal to
the Equatoria area where fighting is taking place now.
	   Aid workers estimate about 1.5 million people are facing severe
food shortages in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal
province, as a result of drought and fighting.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month at a cost of dlrs 30 million into the south in the world's
largest aid operation.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years, pitting
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against the
government in the Muslim, Arab north. About 1.5 million people have
died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Counting down toward its Kosovo

voiced reluctance to return home out of fear of Serb forces.
	   Even as the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys, skepticism

	   Milosevic reluctantly agreed Monday to the demands of world

	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Western
monitoring teams reported a much smaller Serb police presence in
Kosovo on Wednesday as well as evidence of signs of refugees
returning. But he called the early assessment of Milosevic's
compliance efforts ``a mixed bag,'' and said the monitoring force
is needed to ensure that police aren't just being moved around or
hidden.
	   The advance party of the ``ground verification mission'' _ the
final concession by Milosevic needed to seal an agreement after
over a week of intense negotiations with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke _ arrived in Kosovo from neighboring Macedonia on
Wednesday. The several dozen Americans, Canadians and Europeans had
been evacuated Monday.
	   But the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the monitoring mission, says it may take
weeks to recruit the needed personnel from its 54 member nations.
	   ``I'm worried that the international community will be too slow
and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six months to
get there when we need them there in six days or at least six
weeks,'' Holbrooke said in an interview with CNN.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday for fear of Serb
attacks if NATO launched airstrikes.
	   Many refugees are still in hiding in Kosovo, fearing reprisals
from Serb special police who have torched their villages and been
accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just rebel fighters
fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say whatever
people want to hear,'' said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee
in the forested hamlet of Baks, northwest of Pristina. ``One
hundred times he has lied.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that NATO would be
watching closely for evidence of compliance and that Milosevic
should take alliance warnings seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told BBC radio. ``The united consensus within NATO
that we were ready to take military action was there at the
beginning of the week, is still there and that decision is still on
the table. We can reactivate these plans any time we feel it is
necessary to do so.''
	   In addition to withdrawing forces, allowing the monitoring force
and helping refugees return, Milosevic must show serious efforts
toward restoring the autonomy he stripped from Kosovo in 1989.
	   The Serb government took a step toward that late Tuesday,
outlining a plan for a separate parliament and saying Kosovo
Albanians would have their own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   Milosevic has portrayed his handling of the Kosovo crisis as a
victory. On Wednesday similar success claims were made in Moscow,
Belgrade's major ally, which led international opposition to use of
force against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told Russian lawmakers. ``We must knock on wood,
but it appears there will be no airstrikes.''

Argentina, France agree to look into EU subsidies dispute

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac said Wednesday that France
wanted to resolve a dispute between Argentina and the European
Union over EU subsidies for farmers, but warned of
``misunderstandings'' on the issue.
	   Chirac, speaking to reporters after a 90-minute meeting with
Argentine President Carlos Menem, said the two countries had agreed
to create a forum to look into the agricultural dispute.
	   ``There are some difficulties but also some misunderstandings,''
Chirac said. ``But we are determined to solve the problems.''
	   Menem, standing beside Chirac, said he hoped the forum would
``quickly address the issue,'' but said the problem also extended
beyond the European Union.
	   ``It's not just a problem with France, but with the whole of the
European Union and also the United States,'' Menem said. ``This is
causing us problems.''
	   Argentina is a member of the Cairns group _ a free trade lobby
organization pressing for an end to farm tariffs and non-tariff
barriers to agricultural trade throughout the world.
	   Under Menem's leadership since 1989, Argentina's economy has
been transformed. By pegging the peso to the U.S. dollar and
implementing free market policies, hyperinflation gave way to price
stability and the country enjoyed unprecedented growth.
	   The country is now a bullish exporter of commodities.
	   In an interview published Tuesday by French daily Le Figaro,
Menem said the EU subsidies run contrary to the spirit of the free
market.
	   ``In Argentina, we feel that our partners don't practice what
they preach, and that's painful,'' Menem was quoted as saying.
	   France is the third biggest foreign investor in Argentina, after
the United States and Spain, with interests in the car, water,
telecommunications, food and energy sectors. Between 1990 and 1996,
it invested dlrs 4.6 billion in Argentina.
	   Menem will meet with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday.
After leaving France, he heads to Portugal for the Oct. 17-18
Ibero-American Summit.

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Twenty known hooligans already were headed
back to England Wednesday and two-dozen more English fans were
arrested prior to the start of the Euro 2000 qualifier between
Luxembourg and England.
	   About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high
alert throughout the day, outnumbered by about 2,500 English soccer
fans who poured into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy.
	   The last two visits of England here in 1977 and 1983 were marred
by crowd violence, when hooligans vandalized Josy Barthel national
stadium and then rampaged through the streets, demolishing cars and
storefronts.
	   On Tuesday, two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels
airport in neighboring Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because
their names were on police lists of known hooligans. Six were sent
back to England, the rest were to be expelled by the end of the
day, Lt. Eric Froidmont of the Belgian gendarmes said.
	   Before the match, police in Luxembourg said they had arrested 25
drunken fans in the capital and on the border with Belgium. Police
spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd be released after the
game.
	   Police sealed off streets around the stadium, and were only
letting ticket holders past their barriers. Lindenlaub said there
was no major trouble before the game.

Effenberg caught driving under the influence

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Stefan Effenberg, the Bayern Munich
midfielder, faces a fine after being caught driving legally drunk,
police said Wednesday.
	   Effenberg was caught during a routine check in a Munich suburb.
He had a blood alcohol level of 1.07, more than double over the 0.5
legal limit.
	   He faces a 500-mark (dlrs 300) fine and could lose his driving
license for four weeks.
	   The 29-year-old midfielder was sent home from the 1994 World Cup
in the United States for showing an obscene gesture to German fans.
	   He came back to the German team last month for two exhibition
games but quit the national team several days later.

Scientists becoming more optimistic about life past Earth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ Take some chemicals, stir in a source
of energy and mix with mild temperatures for a few hundred million
years.
	   It's the recipe for life, researchers now believe, and
understanding it more fully has made many of them more optimistic
that life may be commonplace beyond the Earth.
	   ``There have been key discoveries that suggests life is simple,
straightforward and easy if you have the right conditions,'' Bruce
M. Jakosky, a University of Colorado planetary scientist, said at a
meeting of the American Astronomical Society. ``There is a
remarkable change among scientists from just 20 years ago.''
	   In this solar system alone, there are at least four places
besides Earth where life could have evolved. And beyond the sun,
untold numbers of stars could be shining on planets teeming with
life of some form.
	   ``There has been a revival in the serious search for life,''
Stanford University scientist Chris Chyba said. ``There is a
substantial higher optimism for the existence of life beyond the
Earth.''
	   This optimism is based, in part, on this new knowledge:
	   _At least a dozen planets have been found in orbit of distant
stars. All are the size of Jupiter or larger, and none is
``Earth-like.'' But their existence strongly suggests the existence
of smaller planets more friendly to life. NASA is now mulling 30
proposals to search specifically for ``Earth-like'' planets.
	   _Biologists now know life is more robust than once believed.
Microscopic organisms have been found to thrive in extreme
conditions, from the ice of the Arctic to boiling vents at the
bottom of the ocean to solid rock deep within the Earth. Microbes,
it is now known, can live without the sun, thriving on chemical
energy alone.
	   ``The biomass deep beneath the Earth is now estimated to equal
all the biomass living on the surface,'' Chyba said. ``That makes
the possibility for life on Mars, for instance, more credible.''
	   _Fossil studies show that life developed very quickly on Earth,
probably within the first 200 million years after the planet
formed.
	   ``We don't understand yet how, but we see that it happened
quickly,'' said Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames
Research Center. ``That supports the notion that it could have
happened quick somewhere else.''
	   In Earth's solar system, experts now believe that life could
have evolved on Mars; on Europa, a Jupiter moon thought to have an
ocean; on Ganymede, another moon of Jupiter; and on Venus, now a
torrid planet but a place that once had more pleasant temperatures.
	   Despite the new optimism, scientists also have found new limits
on conditions that make life probable.
	   Not every star or planet can promote life, said David Koch of
NASA Ames. Some burn too brightly, overheating planets. Some have a
lifetime too short to allow life to evolve. And double star systems
_ 60 percent of all stars _ are less likely to have a stable family
of planets.
	   ``Even if there is only one star in a thousand that could harbor
life, that's still a billion stars in this galaxy alone,'' McKay
said.
	   Nevertheless, other factors also come into play. Planets can be
battered so often by asteroids that life has no chance to evolve or
sustain itself. Except for early in its history, Earth has been
protected by Jupiter and Saturn, giants that swept up most of the
threatening asteroids around.
	   Life also is most likely on planets within the ``habitable
zone'' about a star. This is an orbit where sunlight keeps
temperatures mild enough for water to remain liquid.
	   Yet even with new optimism that life is out there, many
scientists believe the evolution of intelligent life remains highly
uncertain.
	   For single-cell animals to evolve into modern humans took 4
billion years on Earth and required a process that remains largely
a puzzle.
	   Fossil evidence, for instance, shows that 30 million years ago,
the dolphin had more brain power than did ancestors of modern
humans. What happened to allow humans, and not dolphins, to evolve
intellectually is not understood, Chyba said.
	   ``Despite the new optimism, the prospects for finding
intelligent life is unchanged,'' he said. ``We don't understand
very well how intelligent life can evolve.''

Doping report criticizes Italy's soccer federation, Olympic
</HEADLINE>
committee &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Olympic and soccer officials and sports
doctors share responsibility for lax drug-testing in Italian
soccer, a government report said Wednesday.
	   The Italian Olympic Committee, the national soccer federation
and the association of sports doctors all neglected their duties in
overseeing the now-closed Acqua Acetosa lab, according to a
commission appointed by acting Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni, who
is sports minister.
	   Drug tests were carried out only partially, documentation was
not properly preserved and there have been allegations that
positive results were covered up.
	   ``The facts show that there was a lack of appropriate
oversight,'' Veltroni said.
	   The ongoing scandal has sparked three inquiries by prosecutors
and led to the resignation of Italian Olympic Committee president
Mario Pescante and the firing of Emilio Gasbarrano, the head of the
Acqua Acetosa lab.
	   The soccer federation was criticized for failing to abide by
international urine-testing guidelines, and its president, Luciano
Nizzola, acknowledged, ``There may have been mistakes.''
	   But he ruled out stepping down.
	   Veltroni argued for drastic reform.
	   ``Major renewal is needed, including reforming CONI and cleaning
up the image ... of the sports world, which has been seriously
compromised,'' he said, using the acronym for the Italian Olympic
Committee.

Sweden beats Bulgaria 1-0 in Euro qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURGAS, Bulgaria (AP) _ Henrik Larsson used a mistake by the
Bulgarian defense to score Sweden's only goal in a 1-0 victory in a
Group 5 Euro 2000 qualifier Wednesday.
	   Larsson sneaked between Bulgarian defenders and goalie Zdravko
Zdravkov and scored from close range in the 62nd minute at the
Neftochimik stadium in this Black Sea town, 400 kilometers (250
miles) east of Sofia.
	   Bolstered by a 0-0 draw against England last Saturday on
Wembley, the Bulgarians launched a series of attacks in the first
half, but Hristo Stoichkov and Valentin Naidenov narrowly missed
good opportunities in the 2nd and 30th minute.
	   A spectacular save by Zdravkov prevented Arsenal's Fredrik
Ljundberg from scoring with a strong shot in the 32nd minute.
	   The game was crucial for Bulgaria, which lost its first
qualifier to Poland 3-0 on Sept. 6. Since its fourth place at 1994
World Cup finals in the United States, Bulgaria's team of aging
stars and unexperienced youngsters has repeatedly disappointed its
fans.
	   Sweden beat England 2-1 on Sept. 5.
	   --- &QC;

Davenport wins first match as world No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Lindsay Davenport won her
first match as the world's top-ranked woman Wednesday, posting a
second-round straight-sets win over French qualifier Julie
Halard-Decugis at the European Championships.
	   The 22-year-old American began the defense of her European crown
_ as well as her reign atop the rankings _ with a convincing 6-4,
6-2 win over the French player in just 58 minutes for a place in
the quarterfinals.
	   ``I definitely wanted to win this match,'' said Davenport, who
officially took over as the world's top player from Martina Hingis
on Monday. ``But it was hard to play. Being No.1 adds a little more
pressure.
	   ``I thought, oh God, people are going to think I should play so
well because I'm No.1, but what if I don't play that well?''
	   Davenport got off to a shakey start, holding serve to go 1-1,
but then losing the next three games and giving Halard-Decugis a
4-1 lead.
	   The American quickly rallied back, however, serving up a love
game before breaking back to return on serve. At 4-4, the American
broke Halard-Decugis to go up 5-4, then served for the set.
	   The two traded breaks to go 2-2 in the second set, before
Davenport broke the French player twice in a row to clinch the
victory.
	   ``I thought it was going to be a difficult match because she can
get really hot sometimes,'' said Davenport, who won five titles
this season, inlcuding the U.S. Open. ``I didn't play very great
tennis tonight but I played well enough to win.
	   ``I'm never going to be a Graf or Seles and be great right from
the start,'' said the soft-spoken American. ``Often I have to play
my way into a tournament so I don't appear to be that great a
player at the beginning. But I get through.''
	   The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning streak in
Switzerland to 14 victories.
	   The American's run began at the 1993 European Open in Lucerne,
where she captured her first career title at the age of 16. She
went on to defend that title in 1994 before winning in Zurich last
year.
	   In earlier second round play, seventh-seed Mary Pierce of France
defeated South African lucky-loser Joanette Kruger 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.
	   With boyfriend Baltimore Orioles star second-baseman Roberto
Alomar watching from the sidelines, Pierce at first had difficulty
finding her rythm in the first set. But the French player clearly
found it early on in the second, which she took in just 33 minutes.
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa easily advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Romania's Ruxandra
Dragomir.
	   Second-round action will continue Thursday with three Americans
on center court.
	   Second-seed Venus Williams will play lucky-loser compatriot
Corina Morariu, and Lisa Raymond will face fourth-seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France.
	   Eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost, who brought to an end Hingis's
80-week reign at the top of the standings with a quarterfinal
victory in Filderstadt last week, will play France's Amelie
Mauresmo.
	   With Hingis out due to an ankle injury, Patty Schnyder will
continue to carry Swiss hopes during her second-round match against
Austrian wildcard Barbara Schett.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Wole Soyinka, the Nobel laureate and
outspoken junta critic who fled Nigeria four years ago, returned
Wednesday to his home country, where hundreds of singing supporters
welcomed him back.
	   ``Welcome our king, we have been waiting for you,'' the crowd of
about 500 people sang in Yoruba, one of Nigeria's main languages,
as they pressed toward him.
	   Soyinka appeared to try to speak to the crowd, but the noise and
tumult made that impossible and he was quickly escorted to a
waiting car.
	   Friends said he would go immediately to the family home of
Moshood Abiola, the Nigerian opposition leader who died in custody
in July. Soyinka was to meet with Abiola's family, they said.
	   Extra security agents had been dispatched to the airport late
Tuesday night because of the writer's return, and security checks
were more pronounced at the airport Wednesday.

NATO says Milosevic violating peace deal in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; UPDATES with later meeting of NATO ambassadors; ADDS new comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance said Wednesday
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not meeting international
demands to restore peace in Kosovo needed to stave off airstrikes.
	   One day after setting the clock ticking, NATO ambassadors agreed
Milosevic must still show he is ending his crackdown against Kosovo
Albanian separatists by 0500GMT on Saturday at the latest.
	   The decision to begin punishing strikes, if necessary, ``is
still totally in effect. NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted
by Milosevic,'' said a NATO official, who asked not to be
identified.
	   Compliance with a deal to withdraw forces, begin peace talks
with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into Kosovo ``has
not yet been achieved,'' said the NATO official.
	   The official said later, after a second meeting of the NATO
ambassadors in one day, Tuesday's airstrikes order ``will remain in
place for the foreseeable future,'' i.e. beyond the four-day
countdown that expires Saturday.
	   NATO was also working on an air reconnaissance plan for Kosovo _
using unarmed, high-flying spy planes such as U-2s and P3 Orion
aircraft _ to verify if Milosevic's respects a peace deal. Russia
has expressed an interest in joining in the air verification scheme
and NATO is considering that.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana was considering to go to
Belgrade Friday to sign the accord and deliver the message that it
would be in Milosevic's interest not to push NATO around any
further on Kosovo.
	   Under an agreement worked between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader must withdraw special troops
from Kosovo, allow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo, let
NATO reconnaissance planes fly over the province and sign a deal by
early November outlining future talks with the Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, who are the vast majority in the Serb province.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
expected to sign a deal Thursday in Belgrade to dispatch 2,000
``compliance verifiers.'' NATO was also working on an agreement
with Yugoslavia for reconnaissance flights over Kosovo to back up
the OSCE ground verification mission.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia early Tuesday by approving an ``activation order'' that
formally placed hundreds of allied warplanes under the command of
the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.
	   The NATO official said Milosevic must withdraw forces, saying a
``number of units'' remain dug in, notably the ``notorious'' 36th
Special Police Unit. The official would not say how many troops are
in Kosovo except they ``far exceed'' the level predating the start
of the violence there in March.
	   NATO officials were keen to point out Wednesday that airstrikes
plans remain active. ``The planes are arriving at their forward
bases in Italy,'' said one official. ``We'll be keeping up the
military pressure for some time to come.''

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The church of apartheid crept
toward reconciliation with its non-white sister church on
Wednesday, indicating it agreed with the principles of social
justice and racial equality, but refusing to adopt them as
doctrine.
	   The painful soul-searching by Dutch Reformed Church leaders at
their four-year synod underlined how South African institutions
continue to wrestle with the nation's transition from racism to
democracy.
	   Heading the agenda was a merger with the Uniting Reformed
Church, composed mainly of black and mixed-race members.
	   Delegates approved measures intended to lead to a merge, and
delegate Ernst van der Walt of Cape Town called it ``a huge move
forward.''
	   However, the Dutch Reformed church members refused to adopt the
Confession of Belhar, a statement written by non-white church
members in 1986 to protest apartheid, and named after the
mixed-race neighborhood where it was sanctioned.
	   The Uniting Reformed Church wanted the white church to adopt the
doctrine to reaffirm past admissions that it wrongly used the Bible
to justify the white government's hold on power.
	   James Buys, the mixed-race URC moderator who spent 43 days in
solitary confinement under apartheid, said the white church's
failure to clear the Belhar hurdle represented ``a new type of
apartheid, one of language and culture.''
	   Buys' colleague, URC church magazine editor Pieter Fourie of
Cape Town, was more upbeat.
	   ``We're quite happy at this point,'' Fourie told the Associated
Press.
	   Most Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch settlers who speak
Afrikaans and hold much of the country's wealth, regard the Dutch
Reformed Church as a linguistic and cultural anchor against
majority black rule that took power in 1994.
	   Many live in rural areas, where they have been increasingly
targeted for violent and sometimes murderous attacks.
	   ``Our people live in a new society and now they hear people
saying, `We want to change your church,' '' said Freek Swanepoel,
past Dutch Reformed moderator, or top leader. ``(Acceptance) must
grow from your heart, not your head.''
	   During the four-hour debate, several delegates rejected the
Belhar doctrine because of a phrase that says God is on the side of
the underprivileged.
	   ``God is not only the god of the poor,'' said Piet Strauss of
Free State province.
	   However, delegate Schalk van Wyk _ expressing a tone of
reconciliation _ urged the gathering to accept the Confession of
Belhar to provide hope for the poor in South Africa, where 40
percent are unemployed.
	   ``It makes it possible to take up the cross and follow Jesus and
listen to the pain of a lot of people,'' he said.
	   Delegates said the conciliatory tone of the debate made possible
compromises that were unthinkable four and eight years ago.
	   President Nelson Mandela attended the 1994 synod, where
delegates sang a special hymn for the black leader and white church
theologians who argued against apartheid.
	   One of the theologians was assassinated in 1994.
	   ``We thought then that we had done with apartheid,'' said Piet
Meiring in an interview. ``We realize now that it's easy to get
apartheid out of our statements, but not so easy to get it out of
our hearts.''
	   On Tuesday, nearly all 400 delegates approved a resolution
denouncing apartheid as ``sinful'' and a theological ``travesty.''
	   By adopting the resolution, the church reactivated its
membership in the 75-million strong World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, which comprises reformed and Presbyterian churches. The
world body had suspended the Dutch Reformed Church in 1982 because
it violated teachings of the Bible.
	   Starting that same year, the 1.5-million-member white church
gradually renounced its hard-line position but kept separate
branches for blacks, mixed-race and Indian congregants.
	   The black and mixed-race branches merged in 1994 to become the
1.5-million-member Uniting Reformed Church.

Germany beats Moldova 3-1 in Euro 2000 qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Defending champion Germany conceded an
early goal Wednesday but stormed back to beat Moldova 3-1 and gain
its first victory in the qualifying for the 2000 European
Championship.
	   Ulf Kirsten scored two goals in the first half to help the
unimpressive Germans over the outsiders.
	   Beaten 1-0 by Turkey on Saturday, Germany needed a victory to
stay alive in Group 3.
	   But Moldova stunned the Germans with a goal in the sixth minute.
	   Sergiu Clesenco outpaced the German defense and fired a good
shot from 15 meters (yards). Goalkeeper Oliver Kahn made a reflex
save and the ball bounced off the bar. From the ensuing corner,
Alexandru Guzun was left unmarked to tap in the first goal.
	   While Germany dominated the action, Moldova's fast forwards
often troubled the German defense with fast counter-attacks.
	   But in the 20th, the Germans equalized when Kirsten was left
unchallenged to head in from close range.
	   Germany used its superiority in the air to score two more goals
within two minutes. Oliver Bierhoff headed to Kirsten in the 38th
and the Bayer Leverkusen striker volleyed home from close range.
Two minutes later, Bierhoff drove in a headed pass from Lars
Ricken.
	   Five minutes into the second halftime, Kahn made a spectacular
save to deny Clesenco from close range, and Germany came under a
lot of pressure from a well-combining Moldova team.
	   Kahn made two more great saves to atone himself for the mistake
that led to Turkey's goal four days ago.
	   Six minutes from time, Moldova's Igor Obrea was sent off with
his second yellow card of the match.
	   A crowd of 5,000 saw the match.

Iraq aims to produce up to 6 million barrels daily after sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq aims to produce up to 6 million
barrels of oil a day after the U.N. sanctions are lifted, but the
ambitious plan requires at least dlrs 30 billion investments, an
Oil Ministry study says.
	   The study said it will take five years after the sanctions end
to achieve the target that will make Iraq the second largest oil
producer in the world after Saudi Arabia, which extracts 8 million
barrels a day.
	   Foreign firms have already been invited to develop ``ten
super-giant oil fields'' as part of the government plan to boost
production, said the study. A copy was obtained by The Associated
Press Wednesday.
	   ``Iraq may be the only country in the world with giant oil
fields, fully discovered, fully appraised and just waiting to be
developed,'' the study said.
	   Companies from France, Russia, China, Italy, Spain, India, South
Korea, Malaysia and Canada are vying to win the contracts, it said.
	   The unabashed attempt to woo investors marks a U-turn for Iraq's
petroleum industry, which for decades has been fully, owned and
operated by the government.
	   Sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait barred
oil exports, impoverished the country and laid waste its oil
industry. Now, it appears that only outside money can rehabilitate
the decrepit infrastructure.
	   Attracting potential investors has other benefits: businesses
can pressure their governments to help Iraq get rid of the
sanctions.
	   Iraq produced 3.5 million barrels a day before the 1991 Gulf War
over Kuwait. Recently, officials have said Iraq should be exempted
from production quotas of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries because of the high losses sustained by the sanctions.
	   The study appears to reiterate that stand. It said even a daily
production of 8 billion barrels a day is attainable with the
participation of foreign companies.
	   The dlrs 30 billion investment needed will be raised by foreign
companies selling their share of crude that they will produce in
Iraq, the study said.
	   Still, it is not clear how much money oil companies have
committed so far or intend to do so.
	   The study said at least five of the 10 super fields have already
been offered but only two countries _ Russia and China _ have
signed agreements for the West Qurna oil field and the Ahdab field.
	   Negotiations are going on with France's Elf and Total and
Italy's Agip for other fields, it said.
	   Iraq says its proven reserves are 112 billion barrels, the
world's second largest after Saudi Arabia's 261 billion barrels.
Iraq's probable reserves are 214 billion barrels, the study said.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Zvonimir Boban scored twice as Croatia
rallied to a 3-2 victory over a resilient Macedonia on Wednesday in
a Group 8 qualifying match for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Sasa Ciric stunned the home crowd when he rose between two
defenders to head the Macedonians into the lead in the opening
minute of play.
	   But World Cup top scorer Davor Suker tied for the Croats in the
16th minute with another header from close range and captain Boban
gained the lead on the stroke of halftime with a well-connected
volley on an awkward angle.
	   Refusing to buckle under pressure, Macedonia opened further,
hoping to coax the Croats into taking greater risks. The strategy
paid off in the 55th minute when Macedonia won a free-kick just
outside the box.
	   Dzevdet Sainovski smacked the ball low and hard through the wall
and past stranded goalie Drazen Ladic into the net.
	   Boban sealed victory in the 70th minute for Croatia when he
splendidly directed a curling free-kick from more than 20 meters
(yard) inside the top-right post.
	   The win against Macedonia, and Malta on Saturday, keeps the
Croats in the running for a spot in Euro 2000. Croatia won third
place in the World Cup last summer, but it got off to a rocky start
in its opener, losing to the Republic of Ireland 2-0.
	   Ladic, Croatia's most capped player with 51 appearances, played
his last game before retirement from international soccer.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II sets down his views on
religion in modern society in an encyclical being issued by the
Vatican on Thursday.
	   The encyclical, one of the most important documents a pope can

and Reason.''
	   It is the 13th encyclical of John Paul's papacy and timed to
come out a day before he marks the 20th anniversary of his election
as pope.
	   The Vatican has also scheduled a news conference after the

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ An Iraqi child who was treated in Scotland
for malnutrition and leukemia because of the efforts of a British
lawmaker arrived in Jordan Wednesday on her way back home.
	   The 4-year-old Mariam Hamza, who has lost her hair from
chemotherapy, was carried by her grandmother, Faten Hamid, into a
VIP airport lounge after arriving in Amman on a commercial flight.
	   ``Thank God, Mariam was taken to England and received the
treatment,'' Mrs. Hamid said.
	   The girl was accompanied by Iraqi-British physician Foutouh
Binyamin and Labor Party Parliament member George Galloway who had
taken her out of Iraq in April.
	   Binyamin said the girl underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy
for several months in a Scottish hospital. ``She is in a remission
stage and has recovered,'' he said.
	   The group is scheduled to leave for Baghdad Thursday aboard a
private plane that has been approved to fly to Iraq by the United
Nations in an exemption from the sanctions, which prevent flights
to and from the country.
	   The U.N. also had allowed Mariam to be flown out of Baghdad
instead of subjecting her to the grueling drive of at least 10
hours across the desert to the Amman airport.
	   Galloway, a regular visitor to Iraq, has long called for the
lifting of0Yor her to be treated in Scotland. She also was suffering
from salmonella.
	   Galloway said he wanted to highlight the suffering of the Iraqi
public due to U.N. sanctions that have caused severe shortages of
medicines and medical equipment. Iraqi officials say hundreds of
children die every day in the country.
	   Mariam's cancer treatment cost 55,000 pounds sterling (dlrs
93,000), which was paid for by private donations.
	   The girl, who brought with her 3,000 toys for other Iraqi
children and medication for two years, was taken to Al Amal cancer
hospital in Amman for an overnight stay.

New government proposes a ban on slapping children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new liberal government is
considering making it illegal to slap children.
	   A measure to outlaw spanking and slapping children, even as a
disciplinary measure, is to be discussed as part of the coalition
talks between the victorious Social Democrats and their future
government partner, the Greens, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   ``The right of children to be reared without violence must be
anchored in the law books,'' the new government's designated Family
Minister Christine Bergmann was quoted by the Cologne Express as
saying.
	   German law already provides that ``degrading disciplinary
measures, in particular physical and mental mistreatment, are
improper,'' Bergmann, a Social Democrat, told the newspaper.
	   Outgoing Family Minister Claudia Nolte condemned violence
against children, but said legally speaking it was impossible to
legislate ``a childhood without violence.''
	   The Social Democrats and the Greens don't envision strict
penalties in a proposed measures to outlaw slapping. However, a
Social Democratic family expert, Edith Niehuis, said they want to
send a message that ``a whack on the behind should no longer be
allowed as a parental tool.''
	   Organizations dedicated to the child protection welcomed the
proposal.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-ranked Pate Sampras needed three sets
to beat Jeff Tarango on Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals the
dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP indoor tournament.
	   Sampras rallied for a 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 victory over the fellow
American, a qualifier.
	   Patrick Rafter kept up the chase for Sampras' No. 1 ranking by
beating Byron Black 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in a first-round match.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, is No. 2 and has a chance of
replacing Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the
coming weeks.
	   While Rafter advanced, third-seed Carlos Moya, the French Open
champion, was upset by Bohdan Ulihrach, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Eighth-seeded Tim Henman advanced by beating Magnus Gustafsson
6-3, 6-4, and will clash with Sampras in the quarterfinals.
	   Rafter used one break of serve to win the first set.
	   In the second, Rafter fought back from a break down and saved
four set points to hold serve for 6-6. The Australian used his
powerful serve-and-volley game to win the tiebreaker.
	   Rafter leads the tour with six titles this year.
	   Henman, coming off back-to-back titles in Tashkent and Basel,
celebrated his 18th win in the last 21 matches despite fighting a
cold at the start of the week.
	   The Briton is on pace to reach the eight-man ATP Tour World
Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Moya blew a 4-1 lead in the first set and two set points in the
tiebreaker. In the second, he fought back from a 4-1 deficit, but
double-faulted to give Ulihrach the match.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ After two consecutive victories in
European qualifying matches, Turkey slumped Wednesday to a 3-1 loss
to Finland at Istanbul.
	   Finland surprised the Turks with speedy attacks in the opening
stages of each half which unsettled the Turkish defense for the
remainder of the match.
	   Finland opened the scoring in the 5th minute when Mika-Matti
Paatelained connected with a Tommi Kautonen corner and headed into
the net.
	   On a rain-drenched field, Turkey's forwards were unable to break
through the tightly Finnish defense throughout the first half.
	   Heavily marked striker Hakan Sukur missed a chance to equalize
the score as his powerful strike landed right of the post.
	   Turkey began the second half with a series of attacks but
Finland scored a counter-attacking goal in the 51st minute through
Jonatan Johanson.
	   Relentless attacking raids, Ogun Temizkanoglu scored Turkey's
goal with a powerful kick from outside the penalty area.
	   Finland forward Jari Litmanen clinched victory when he scored
the third goal deep into injury time.
	   On Saturday, Turkey scored the upset of the round by beating
defending European champions, Germany, while Finland lost to
Northern Ireland.
	   Lineups:
	   Turkey: Rustu Rencber; Alpay Ozalan, Tayfur Havutcu, Okan Buruk,
Fatih Akyet, Ogun Temizkanoglu, Tugay Kerimoglu, Abdullah Ercan,
Hakan Sukur, Oktay Derelioglu, Sergen Yalcin.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Economist Amartya Sen, a native of India, won
the Nobel Prize on Wednesday for work that studies the world's poor
and shows governments new ways to help them.
	   Sen's work analyzes the distribution of wealth, the causes of
catastrophes such as famines, and ways to include the very poor in
evaluating a nation's overall economic situation.
	   Sen, who was visiting New York on Wednesday, said he was
thrilled that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards
the prize, had finally acknowledged his field.
	   It ``gives recognition to problems of poverty and equality and
in general the interests of the people placed at the downside of
the economy,'' said the 64-year-old master at Britain's Trinity
College in Cambridge.
	   Economists agreed that the field has long been overlooked,
saying that the usual indicators of a nation's well-being, such as
gross national product, are not enough.
	   ``Just looking at GNP or GNP growth for a country like India
might not be a very good way to say, `Is the development plan of
the country really helping people?''' said Jerry Hausman, economics
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
	   ``Being able to look at the numbers in different ways and think
about it is very helpful,'' he said.
	   Sen said GNP, the total value of all the goods and services
produced by a country, ``overlooks the fact that many people are
terribly poor. We have to pay attention to the downside of what's
happening and not just the average, majority position,'' he said.
	   Robert Eisner, past president of the American Economic
Association and professor emeritus at Northwestern University,
said, ``Poverty and hunger and the distribution of income in the
world ... have been all too much neglected by the top economists,
who seem to frequently do what is eventually useful work but
(doesn't) tie that much to the problems facing masses of people.''
	   Sen learned he won the dlrs 963,000 prize hours after arriving
in New York to attend Thursday's memorial service for Mahbub ul
Haq, a former finance minister of Pakistan and the architect of the
annual Human Development Index, used by the United Nations to
measure the wealth of nations by citizens' living standards.
	   Joseph Duncan, a former U.S. government economist and current
chief economic adviser to Dun and Bradstreet Corp., said choosing
Sen was an interesting contrast to last year's winners, Americans
Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, whose work generally benefited the
rich.
	   The Americans were honored for their work on valuing risky
``derivatives'' investments such as stock options, but came under a
cloud last month after the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund in
which they were partners.
	   Sen's interest in the dynamics of famine was spurred by his own
experience during India's famine in 1943, when he was 9. ``It was
rumored then that the food supply was not very low,'' Sen said,
``nevertheless a famine occurred.''
	   In 1981 book, he wrote that famines are not only caused by food
shortages but sometimes result from distribution problems _ like
the ones many African nations experienced in the late 1980s and
early 1990s _ and simple economics.
	   ``Famines can occur even when the food supply is high but people
can't buy the food because they don't have the money,'' Sen said.
	   He found that famines never occur in democracies because
government leaders are held accountable by the public, through
elections and a free press.
	   Before moving to Britain, Sen was a professor of economics and
philosophy at Harvard, where he still has an office and remains a
professor emeritus.
	   ``He is a wonderful man and a very serious and profound scholar
who has in a quite unique way combined philosophy and economics,''
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard
economics professor, said in an interview on C-Span.
	   The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the
will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite.
It was created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central
bank. Prizes in chemistry and physics were given earlier this week.
	   The last Nobel to be given _ the peace prize _ will be awarded
Friday.
	   The winners will receive their prizes Dec. 10, the anniversary
of Nobel's death.

Davenport wins first match as world No. 1

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Martinez/Spirlea match, graf 12 &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Lindsay Davenport won her
first match as the world's top-ranked woman Wednesday, posting a
second-round straight-sets win over French qualifier Julie
Halard-Decugis at the European Championships.
	   The 22-year-old American began the defense of her European crown
_ as well as her reign atop the rankings _ with a convincing 6-4,
6-2 win over the French player in just 58 minutes for a place in
the quarterfinals.
	   ``I definitely wanted to win this match,'' said Davenport, who
officially took over as the world's top player from Martina Hingis
on Monday. ``But it was hard to play. Being No.1 adds a little more
pressure.
	   ``I thought, oh God, people are going to think I should play so
well because I'm No.1 ... but what if I don't play that well?''
	   Davenport got off to a shakey start, holding serve to go 1-1,
but then losing the next three games and giving Halard-Decugis a
4-1 lead.
	   The American quickly rallied back, however, serving up a love
game before breaking back to return on serve. At 4-4, the American
broke Halard-Decugis to go up 5-4, then served for the set.
	   The two traded breaks to go 2-2 in the second set, before
Davenport broke the French player twice in a row to clinch the win.
	   ``I thought it was going to be a difficult match because she can
get really hot sometimes,'' said Davenport, who won five titles
this season, including the U.S. Open. ``I didn't play very great
tennis tonight but I played well enough to win.
	   ``I'm never going to be a Graf or Seles and be great right from
the start,'' said the soft-spoken American. ``Often I have to play
my way into a tournament so I don't appear to be that great a
player at the beginning. But I get through.''
	   The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning streak in
Switzerland to 14 victories.
	   The American's run began at the 1993 European Open in Lucerne,
where she captured her first career title at the age of 16. She
went on to defend that title in 1994 before winning in Zurich last
year.
	   Third-seed Conchita Martinez became the first seeded player to
get knocked out of the tournament, the Spaniard surrendering 6-2,
7-6 (7-0) to Romania's Irina Spirlea.
	   The Romanian won the first four games of the match before
Martinez was able to keep her first serve. But the distance was too
much for the Spaniard to make up and Spirlea took the opening set
unchallenged.
	   In the second set, a determined Martinez broke the Romanian's
second serve then held to jump to a 4-1 lead. But the Spaniard's
game began to crumble once more, and Spirlea came back from a 5-2
deficit to win the next three games and even the score.
	   Forcing a tie-break, the Romanian then steamrolled over a
passive Martinez for the win.
	   In earlier second round play, seventh-seed Mary Pierce of France
defeated South African lucky-loser Joanette Kruger 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.
	   With boyfriend Baltimore Orioles star second-baseman Roberto
Alomar watching from the sidelines, Pierce at first had difficulty
finding her rythm in the first set. But the French player clearly
found it early on in the second, which she took in just 33 minutes.
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa easily advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Romania's Ruxandra
Dragomir.
	   Second-round action will continue Thursday with three Americans
on center court.
	   Second-seed Venus Williams will play lucky-loser compatriot
Corina Morariu, and Lisa Raymond will face fourth-seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France.
	   Eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost, who brought to an end Hingis's
80-week reign at the top of the standings with a quarterfinal
victory in Filderstadt last week, will play France's Amelie
Mauresmo.
	   With Hingis out due to an ankle injury, Patty Schnyder will
continue to carry Swiss hopes during her second-round match against
Austrian wildcard Barbara Schett.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Henning Berg scored on a header with three
minutes remaining Wednesday and Norway rallied from a two-goal
deficit in the final 10 minutes to get a 2-2 draw with soccer
minnow Albania in European Championship qualifying.
	   It was the second major shock at home in little over a month for
Norway, which fell to Latvia 3-1 on Sept. 6 in Ullevall Stadium.
Until the Latvia game, Norway had not lost at Ullevall in the
1990s.
	   Albania took the lead eight minutes before halftime when Alban
Bushi capitalized on a poor clearance by Norwegian goalkeeper Frode
Grodas to score.
	   The crowd of 17,770 jeered the Drillos as they left the field
for halftime and intensivied six minutes into the second half when
Albania doubled its lead. Altin Haxhi passed on to Albanian forward
Igli Tare, who made it 2-0.
	   Norway moved one of its midfielders forward ten minutes into the
second half to join Tore Andre Flo, but it took another 25 before
it finally paid off.
	   Tare was called for grabbing the jersey of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
jersey in the 80th minute, and Kjetil Rekdal converted the penalty.
	   Henning equalized with a header after a corner kick from Stig
Inge Bjorneby.
	   ``We played excellent in the last 35 minutes of the game, but it
was not enough. The first half was terrible, and we had to use a
new formation in the second half,'' Norwegian coach Nils Johan Semb
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Norway: Frode Grodas; Alf-Inge Haland (Steffen Iversen, 56th
minute), Erik Hoftun, Henning Berg, Stig Inge Bjornebye, Jostein
Flo (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, 56th), Stale Solbakken (Sigurd
Rushfeldt, 90th), Vegard Heggem, Kjetil Rekdal, Roar Strand, Tore

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Economist Amartya Sen, a native of India, won
the Nobel Prize on Wednesday for work that studies the world's poor
and suggests new ways that governments can help them.
	   Sen's work incorporates factors such as income distribution and
health in measuring poverty. He analyzes the causes of catastrophes
such as famines, and ways to include the very poor in evaluating a
nation's overall economic situation.
	   Sen, who was visiting New York on Wednesday, said he was
thrilled that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards
the prize, had finally acknowledged his field.
	   It ``gives recognition to problems of poverty and equality and
in general the interests of the people placed at the downside of
the economy,'' said the 64-year-old master at Britain's Trinity
College in Cambridge.
	   Economists agreed that the field has long been overlooked,
saying that the usual indicators of a nation's well-being, such as
gross national product, are not enough.
	   ``Just looking at GNP or GNP growth for a country like India
might not be a very good way to say, `Is the development plan of
the country really helping people?''' said Jerry Hausman, economics
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
	   ``Being able to look at the numbers in different ways and think
about it is very helpful,'' he said.
	   Sen said GNP, the total value of all the goods and services
produced by a country, ``overlooks the fact that many people are
terribly poor. We have to pay attention to the downside of what's
happening and not just the average, majority position,'' he said.
	   Sen developed alternative indexes which also include income
distribution, among other factors.
	   He worked with the theory of ``social choice'' _ how different
individuals' welfare is affected by collective decisions. The
Academy said in announcing the prize, ``By combining tools from
economics and philosophy, he has restored an ethical dimension to
the discussion of vital economic problems.''
	   Robert Eisner, past president of the American Economic
Association and professor emeritus at Northwestern University,
said, ``Poverty and hunger and the distribution of income in the
world ... have been all too much neglected by the top economists,
who seem to frequently do what is eventually useful work but
(doesn't) tie that much to the problems facing masses of people.''
	   Sen learned he won the dlrs 963,000 prize hours after arriving
in New York to attend Thursday's memorial service for Mahbub ul
Haq, a former finance minister of Pakistan and the architect of the
annual Human Development Index, used by the United Nations to
measure the wealth of nations by citizens' living standards.
	   Joseph Duncan, a former U.S. government economist and current
chief economic adviser to Dun and Bradstreet Corp., said choosing
Sen was an interesting contrast to last year's winners, Americans
Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, whose work generally benefited the
rich.
	   The Americans were honored for their work on valuing risky
``derivatives'' investments such as stock options, but came under a
cloud last month after the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund in
which they were partners.
	   Sen's interest in the dynamics of famine was spurred by his own
experience during India's famine in 1943, when he was 9. ``It was
rumored then that the food supply was not very low,'' Sen said,
``nevertheless a famine occurred.''
	   In 1981 book, he wrote that famines are not only caused by food
shortages but sometimes result from distribution problems _ like
the ones many African nations experienced in the late 1980s and
early 1990s _ and simple economics.
	   ``Famines can occur even when the food supply is high but people
can't buy the food because they don't have the money,'' Sen said.
	   He found that famines never occur in democracies because
government leaders are held accountable by the public, through
elections and a free press.
	   And he discusses how to prevent famine or limit its effects.
	   Before moving to Britain, Sen was a professor of economics and
philosophy at Harvard, where he still has an office and remains a
professor emeritus.
	   ``He is a wonderful man and a very serious and profound scholar
who has in a quite unique way combined philosophy and economics,''
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard
economics professor, said in an interview on C-Span.
	   The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the
will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite.
It was created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central
bank. Prizes in chemistry and physics were given earlier this week.
	   The last Nobel to be given _ the peace prize _ will be awarded
Friday.
	   The winners will receive their prizes Dec. 10, the anniversary
of Nobel's death.

agreement

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Counting down toward its Kosovo
deadline, NATO warned on Wednesday that Slobodan Milosevic isn't
doing what he must to avoid airstrikes and ethnic Albanian refugees
voiced reluctance to return home out of fear of Serb forces.
	   Even as the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys, there was
much doubt the Yugoslav president would meet demands and stop
hostilities toward ethnic Albanians.
	   Demonstrating that it's not taking him at his word, NATO
positioned warplanes at bases in Italy for possible air attacks on
Serbia.
	   ``NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted by Milosevic,'' said
an official at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We'll be keeping up the military pressure for some time to
come.''
	   Milosevic reluctantly agreed Monday to the demands of world
leaders determined to halt his seven-month offensive against
separatist ethnic Albanians and fearful of tragedy involving tens
of thousands of refugees still living in the open as winter
approaches.
	   But even before the 2,000 international monitors to check on his
compliance are in place, it's clear Milosevic has still not met at
least one key demand: withdrawing his forces to where they were
before the crackdown in the Serbian province began on Feb. 28.
	   The 16 NATO members have given Milosevic until Saturday to
comply fully or face a renewed threat of airstrikes.
	   The official in Brussels said a number of Yugoslav units remain
dug in in Kosovo and must be withdrawn, including what he called
one ``notorious'' special police unit from Nis, Serbia. He declined
to say how many troops remain in the province but said they far
exceed the level required by NATO.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Western
monitoring teams reported a much smaller Serb police presence in
Kosovo on Wednesday as well as evidence of signs of refugees
returning. But he called the early assessment of Milosevic's
compliance efforts ``a mixed bag,'' and said the monitoring force
is needed to ensure that police aren't just being moved around or
hidden.
	   The advance party of the ``ground verification mission'' _ the
final concession by Milosevic needed to seal an agreement after
over a week of intense negotiations with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke _ arrived in Kosovo from neighboring Macedonia on
Wednesday. The several dozen Americans, Canadians and Europeans had
been evacuated Monday.
	   But the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is responsible for the monitoring mission, says it may take
weeks to recruit the needed personnel from its 54 member nations.
	   ``I'm worried that the international community will be too slow
and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll take six months to
get there when we need them there in six days or at least six
weeks,'' Holbrooke said in an interview with CNN.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had
resumed aid convoys, which were suspended Monday for fear of Serb
attacks if NATO launched airstrikes.
	   Many refugees are still in hiding in Kosovo, fearing reprisals
from Serb special police who have torched their villages and been
accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just rebel fighters
fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say whatever
people want to hear,'' said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee
in the forested hamlet of Baks, northwest of Pristina. ``One
hundred times he has lied.''
	   Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not
do the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said,
referring to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav
republic.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that NATO would be
watching closely for evidence of compliance and that Milosevic
should take alliance warnings seriously.
	   ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be clear about
that,'' Cook told BBC radio. ``The united consensus within NATO
that we were ready to take military action was there at the
beginning of the week, is still there and that decision is still on
the table. We can reactivate these plans any time we feel it is
necessary to do so.''
	   In addition to withdrawing forces, allowing the monitoring force
and helping refugees return, Milosevic must show serious efforts
toward restoring the autonomy he stripped from Kosovo in 1989.
	   The Serb government took a step toward that late Tuesday,
outlining a plan for a separate parliament and saying Kosovo
Albanians would have their own parliament, judiciary and police.
	   Milosevic has portrayed his handling of the Kosovo crisis as a
victory. On Wednesday similar success claims were made in Moscow,
Belgrade's major ally, which led international opposition to use of
force against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Look how they respect Russia in the world,'' Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told Russian lawmakers. ``We must knock on wood,
but it appears there will be no airstrikes.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The coalition of Italy's toppled premier pleaded
with his sometimes-allies Wednesday to join him in a new
government, saying the country urgently needed them to get to work
on the budget.
	   The appeal by Romano Prodi's Olive Tree coalition appeared to be
an overture to a small but key centrist party, which had said it
wouldn't give him its support unless he publicly asked for it.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government collapsed in a failed vote of
confidence in the Chamber of Deputies on Friday. The 29 votes of
Francesco Cossiga's centrist party could determine whether it
regains power.
	   ``Given the grave need of the country in regard to approval of
the budget and a strong entry into monetary union, it is deemed
necessary to turn to an appeal ... to build a majority capable of
governing and approving the budget,'' Olive Tree said in a
statement after he met privately with Cossiga.
	   The statement acknowledged Prodi's old governing majority no
longer existed, which also was a condition of the centrist party.
There was no immediate word on its third and final public demand,
that it have a say in Cabinet appointments.
	   Prodi emerged from talks with Cossiga earlier in the day
acknowledging that the task of piecing together a new coalition
government was ``extremely difficult.''
	   The pressure is on Prodi to pass a cost-cutting 1999 budget that
meets requirements of the European common currency, the euro.
	   Anxious that Italy be ready for the euro's January debut,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked Prodi on Tuesday to try to
form a new government. To do that, Prodi needs to show he can once
again command a majority of votes in Parliament.
	   Prodi has been adamant he would do no under-the-table deals to
form a new government; Italian TV has repeatedly aired a clip of
him pounding his fist in the air and shouting, ``No! No!'' at the
very thought.
	   Prodi's government was Italy's second-longest-serving of 55
since World War II. Scalfaro asked him to stay on as acting premier
for now, but the shakeup means that little actual governing is
getting done, with action on the budget and other top issues on
hold.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The first world-class diamond mine in North
America began production Wednesday, seven years after a geologist
discovered the treasure under the tundra of far-northern Canada.
	   A planeload of dignitaries, including two Cabinet ministers,
traveled close to Arctic circle for ceremonies inaugurating the
Ekati mine beside a remote lake in the Northwest Territories.
	   Over the next 25 years, the mine is expected to produce dlrs 7
billion worth of high-quality diamonds _ roughly 5 percent of total
global sales.
	   The celebrations have been tempered slightly by a worldwide
slump in the diamond industry, which is facing one of its toughest
years in two decades because of the Asian financial crisis. Sales
are down sharply, especially in Japan, which is the No. 2 consumer
of diamonds after the United States.
	   But the mine's operator and majority owner, Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. of Australia, is confident about Ekati's long-term
prospects.
	   ``We face this sort of cyclical downturn all the time,'' said
BHP spokesman Graham Nicholls. ``The situation doesn't undermine
the viability of the mine.''
	   For the Northwest Territories, the mine is a bright spot in a
period of economic uncertainty. Seventy percent of Ekati's 800
permanent jobs are going to residents of the territory, including
30 percent to aboriginals.
	   All the diamonds from Ekati will be evaluated in Yellowknife,
the territorial capital about 185 miles (290 kms) southwest of the
mine. Most of the diamonds will be shipped out in their rough form,
though a few will be cut and polished locally.
	   ``Quite simply, it is our future,'' said Yellowknife Dave
Lovell. ``We'd be going into quite a recession if it wasn't for the
diamond mine.''
	   Within the diamond industry, there is keen interest in ongoing
negotiations over whether BHP will give the De Beers diamond cartel
a role in marketing the diamonds from Ekati. For now, BHP says it
will market the diamonds through its own outlet in Antwerp,
Belgium, but many experts believe some role for De Beers is
inevitable.
	   The De Beers Central Selling Organization controls 70 percent of
the world diamond market, and even its critics in the industry
acknowledge it helps keep prices stable through control of
supplies.
	   The diamonds at Ekati were discovered in 1991 by Charles Fipke,
a geologist from British Columbia. For 10 years, he had been
following the path of Ice Age glaciers across the sparsely
populated region, looking for tiny mineral traces in the surface
rocks that would signal the presence of diamond-bearing ore
underneath.
	   A second diamond mine is now in the works nearby. Controlled by
British-based Rio Tinto PLC, the Diavik mine is expected to be as
lucrative as Ekati when it begins production, probably in 2002.
	   De Beers, meanwhile, is stepping up exploratory drilling
southeast of Ekati on a site that prospectors believe could be as
rich as the BHP mine.

	   The diamonds at Ekati were discovered in 1991 by Charles Fipke,
a geologist from British Columbia. For 10 years, he had been
following the path of Ice Age glaciers across the sparsely
populated region, looking for tiny mineral traces in the surface
rocks that would signal the presence of diamond-bearing ore
underneath.
	   A second diamond mine is now in the works nearby. Controlled by
British-based Rio Tinto PLC, the Diavik mine is expected to be as
lucrative as Ekati when it begins production, probably in 2002.
	   De Beers, meanwhile, is stepping up exploratory drilling
southeast of Ekati on a site that prospectors believe could be as
rich as the BHP mine.

	   MARIBOR, Slovenia (AP) _ Sasa Udovic scored a late goal for
Slovenia to defeat Latvia 1-0 on Wednesday in a Group 2 qualifying
match for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Slovenia tussled and toiled to capitalize on its possession
advantage over Latvia, but it wasn't until the 86th minute that
Udovic converted one of a handful of open opportunities.
	   The diminutive striker, who plays in Swiss first league club
Lausanne, raced into the box and latched onto a perfect cross from
the blind side with his head to give the Slovenians their first
victory in three years.
	   Latvia, which was sitting atop of the table with six points and
a handy upset 3-1 win over Norway, seemed to have arrived in
Slovenia content to depart with a point. The Norwegians packed
their defense and rarely dared to stray in search of a goal.
	   Consequently, they went home empty handed. The Latvians watched
their best chance foiled in the second half when Mihail Miholaps
snuck away from the Slovene backline but shot into the legs of
goalie Marko Simeunovic.
	   The win could have been more convincing for Slovenia had
forwards Milan Acimovic and Zlatko Zahovic showed more composure
before Latvian goalie Oleg Karavajev.
	   --- &QC;

Prince Charles artwork raises thousands for bomb victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A signed lithograph of a painting by
Prince Charles fetched 53,000 pounds (dlrs 90,000) at a charity
auction Wednesday for the victims of the worst terrorist strike in
Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict.
	   The sale raised more than 150,000 pounds (dlrs 255,000) for the
victims of the car bomb planted Aug. 15 in the town of Omagh by a
splinter Irish Republican Army group dubbed the Real IRA.
Twenty-nine people died and 370 were injured.
	   Charles' lithograph, one of 15 reproductions of a 1995
watercolor of Windsor Castle, Queen Elizabeth II's weekend home
west of London, was the focus of the auction at Dublin's National
Concert Hall.
	   A work by Louis le Brocquy, one of Ireland's leading artists,
was sold for 21,000 pounds (dlrs 36,000).

Spanish judge asks Britain to hold Pinochet for questioning
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge has asked British police to
hold Gen. Augusto Pinochet until Spanish authorities can question
the former Chilean dictator on allegations of genocide and
international terrorism.
	   The request was made by National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon,
one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes into human rights
violations in Chile and Argentina.
	   Garzon filed his request to question Pinochet on Wednesday.
Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question
Pinochet a day earlier.
	   Pinochet, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc Friday in
London, was reported to have left London Bridge Hospital earlier
Wednesday. British authorities have declined to comment on his
whereabouts or the Spanish judges' requests.
	   In 1996, Castellon opened his probe into murder, torture and
disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's 1973-90 regime. Garzon is
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1986-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ England survived an early scare before
plodding on to a thoroughly joyless 3-0 win over the part-timers of
Luxembourg, moving it up in Euro 2000 Group 5 but doing nothing to
lift the gloom hanging over the team.
	   The narrow margin and the lackluster performance will increase
pressure on coach Glenn Hoddle to resign following the third
pitiful performances in a row. Bulgaria kept England to a goalless
draw at Wembley over the weekend and Sweden beat England last
month.
	   Michael Owen scored his first goal for England since his World
Cup beauty against Argentina, when he took a deep pass from Darren
Anderton, swerved round goalie Paul Koch and right footed it the
net 19th minute.
	   Alan Shearer added a second in the 40th minute, converting a
penalty for after Dany Theis unnecessarily handled the ball in the
penalty area.
	   In the 90th minute, Gareth Southgate scored from close range to
put an almost respectable result on the scoreboard.
	   Luxembourg, always the underdog, could have stunned the soccer
world for a few fleeting minutes when earned a penalty in the 5th
minute. Gareth Southgate headed a ball to goalie David Seaman but
it fell woefully short and Seaman brought the onrushing Marcel
Christophe down.
	   The hapless Theis sent Luxembourg's moment of glory skyhigh
over.
	   The result left Poland and Sweden leading the group with 6
points, ahead of England. Bulgaria has one point and Luxembourg 0.
England has played three games compared to two for Sweden and
Poland.
	   England looked far from impressive and the return from
suspension of David Beckham yielded precious few moments of
creativity. Offered acres of space, he too often chose against the
deep pass or a run at an opponent.
	   The 2,500 fans traveling with the team were shouting ``what a
load of rubbish'' near the end of the game. The English team was
booed off the pitch. The steadfast rain coming down over the 8,200
capacity Josy Barthel Stadium only made the evening more miserable.
	   Apart from his penalty goal, Shearer was invisible. The rest of
the team also lacked any offensive sparkle.
	   Lineups :
	   Luxembourg : Paul Koch; Ralph Ferron, Nico Funck, Laurent
Deville, Frank Deville (85th Christian Auverdi), Jeff Strasser;
Jeff Saibene, Dany Theis (61, Luc Holtz), Manuel Gardoni, Patrick
Posing; Marcel Christophe (78, Paolo Amodio).
	   England : David Seaman; Rio Ferdinand, Phil Neville, Sol
Campbell, Gareth Southgate; David Batty, Paul Scholes (77, Ian
Wright), David Beckham, Darren Anderton (64, Robert Lee); Alan
Shearer, Michael Owen.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Janos Hrutka scored eight minutes from
time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Hungary against Romania in a Group 7
qualifying match Wednesday for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan, coming off a ruptured thigh
muscle, scored his team's goal in the 50th minute.
	   Before 40,000 fans in People's Stadium, Hungary dominated the
first half and wasted a half-dozen opportunities.
	   In the second half, the Romanians played a very controlled game,
combining with with precise passes, and their game plan paid off in
the 50th when Moldovan fired in the ball from 16 meters (yards).
	   The Hungarians threw everything into the attack and Hrutka
scored the equalizer from 24 meters (yards) out.
	   Ferenc Hamori of Hungary and Iulian Filipescu of Romania were
sent off in the last four minutes in separate incidents.

Denmark ties Switzerland 1-1 after late equalizer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A goal from Ole Tobiasen three
minutes into second-half injury time gave Denmark a 1-1 tie against
Switzerland in a tense European Championship qualifying match
Wednesday.
	   Both fielded changed teams after disappointing defeats in
Saturday's round of qualifiers. But they made a tentative start to
the match, with few clear goal chances in the first half hour.
	   Denmark's Soeren Frederiksen missed the best chance of the first
half shortly before the break, shooting wide after confusion in the
Swiss defense left him clear on goal.
	   Switzerland launched a counterattack in which Raphael Wicky had
a claim for a penalty kick turned down.
	   The match, played in front of 12,500 spectators at the Hardturm
stadium, opened up in the 58th minute when Borussia Dortmund
striker Stephane Chapuisat shot past Danish 'keeper Mogens Krogh to
open the scoring.
	   Both sides pressed forward, Denmark having a goal disallowed for
offside.
	   Denmark dominated the last 15 minutes of the match, finally
breaking through in the 93rd minute when Tobiasen forced a cross
from Jan Heintze past the Swiss defense.
	   The result leaves new Swiss coach Gilbert Gress still waiting
for his first win in charge of Switzerland, which lost 2-0 in Italy
at the weekend.
	   Denmark, European champion in 1992, desperately needed points
following its shock defeat by Wales on Saturday.
	   Lineups:
	   Switzerland: Andreas Hilfiker, Ciriaco Sforza, Sebastien
Jeanneret (Regis Rothenbuehler, 76th), Stephane Henchoz, Johann
Vogel, Raphael Wicky, David Sesa (Bernt Haas, 90th), Sebastien
Fournier, Fabio Celestini, Stephane Chapuisat, Patrick Mueller
(Francesco di Jorio, 77th).
	   Denmark: Mogens Krogh, Ole Tobiasen, Marc Rieper, Jes Hoegh, Jan
Heintze, Per Frandsen (Soeren Colding, 59th), Thomas Helveg, Brian
Steen Nielsen, Martin Joergensen, Soeren Frederiksen (Ebbe Sand,
61st), Jon Dahl Tomasson (Mikkel Beck, 78th).

Sampras wins, his pursuer Rafter too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, REMOVES reference to Henman playing
Sampras next &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-ranked Pate Sampras needed three sets
to beat Jeff Tarango on Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals the
dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP indoor tournament.
	   Sampras rallied for a 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 victory over the fellow
American, a qualifier.
	   ``It's always tough to play Jeff, he knows me too well,''
Sampras said.
	   Patrick Rafter kept up the chase for Sampras' No. 1 ranking by
beating Byron Black 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in a first-round match.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, is No. 2 and has a chance of
replacing Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the
coming weeks.
	   While Rafter advanced, third-seed Carlos Moya, the French Open
champion, was upset by Bohdan Ulihrach, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Eighth-seeded Tim Henman advanced by beating Magnus Gustafsson
6-3, 6-4, and could clash with Sampras in the quarterfinals if he
beats another another Swede, Thomas Enqvist.
	   Rafter used one break of serve to win the first set.
	   In the second, Rafter fought back from a break down and saved
four set points to hold serve for 6-6. The Australian used his
powerful serve-and-volley game to win the tiebreaker.
	   Rafter leads the tour with six titles this year.
	   Henman, coming off back-to-back titles in Tashkent and Basel,
celebrated his 18th win in the last 21 matches despite fighting a
cold at the start of the week.
	   The Briton is on pace to reach the eight-man ATP Tour World
Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Moya blew a 4-1 lead in the first set and two set points in the
tiebreaker. In the second, he fought back from a 4-1 deficit, but
double-faulted to give Ulihrach the match.

NATO says Milosevic violating peace deal in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds:UPDATES with later meeting of NATO ambassadors; ADDS new
comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance said Wednesday that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not meeting a demand to
restore peace in Kosovo, a necessary condition to avert airstrikes.
	   One day after setting the clock ticking, NATO ambassadors agreed
Milosevic must still show he is ending his crackdown against Kosovo
Albanian separatists by 0500 GMT on Saturday at the latest.
	   The decision to begin strikes, if necessary, ``is still totally
in effect. NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted by
Milosevic,'' said a NATO official, who asked not to be identified.
	   Milosevic has been ordered to withdraw forces, begin peace talks
with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into Kosovo. This
``has not yet been achieved,'' said the NATO official.
	   The official said later, after a second meeting of the NATO
ambassadors in one day, that Tuesday's airstrikes order ``will
remain in place.'' This would mean it would still be in effect
beyond the four-day countdown that expires on Saturday.
	   NATO was also working on an air reconnaissance plan for Kosovo _
using unarmed, high-flying spy planes such as U-2s and P3 Orion
aircraft _ to verify if Milosevic respects a peace deal. Russia has
expressed an interest in joining in the air verification scheme and
NATO is considering that.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana was considering going to
Belgrade on Friday to sign the accord and deliver a message saying
it would be in Milosevic's interest not to push NATO around any
further on Kosovo.
	   Under an agreement worked between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader must withdraw special troops
from Kosovo, allow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo, let
NATO reconnaissance planes fly over the province and sign a deal by
early November outlining future talks with the Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, who are the vast majority in the Serb province.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
expected to sign a deal Thursday in Belgrade to dispatch 2,000
``compliance verifiers.'' NATO was also working on an agreement
with Yugoslavia for reconnaissance flights over Kosovo to back up
the OSCE ground verification mission.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia early Tuesday by approving an ``activation order'' that
placed hundreds of allied warplanes under the command of Supreme
Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.
	   The NATO official said Milosevic must withdraw forces, saying a
``number of units'' remain dug in, notably the ``notorious'' 36th
Special Police Unit. The official would not say how many troops are
in Kosovo except they ``far exceed'' the level predating the start
of the violence there in March.
	   NATO officials were keen to point out Wednesday that airstrikes
plans remain active. ``The planes are arriving at their forward
bases in Italy,'' said one official. ``We'll be keeping up the
military pressure for some time to come.''

Gun picture lands team in trouble

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket team manager Steve
Bernard has been severely reprimanded over a photograph of him and
two players wielding rifles alongside Pakistani border troops.
	   The Australian newspaper said the Australian Cricket Board had
reprimanded Bernard over the photograph and he had apologized.
	   ``I deeply regret the image portrayed by the photograph and
apologize unreservedly for my actions,'' the newspaper quoted
Bernard as saying.
	   ACB chairman Denis Rogers said the images depicted in the
photograph did not conform with the values of the Australian
cricket team.
	   ``The actions of the group were naive and ill-considered and
offensive to the wider Australian community,'' Rogers said.
	   The photo, which shows Bernard and players Justin Langer and
Gavin Robertson with assault rifles, has outraged the antigun lobby
in Australia, which has called for Bernard's resignation.
	   National Coalition for Gun Control chairman Roland Browne said
the style of gun was outlawed in Australia in 1996.
	   ``This photograph sets an appalling example for young people in
Australia, for whom these blokes are sports icons,'' Browne said.
	   Australia is on a three-test tour of Pakistan with match two
scheduled to start in Peshawar on Thursday. Peshawar is near the
border with Afghanistan and heavy security is expected at the
ground.

Ireland wins 5-0 to top group 8
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Teenager Robbie Keane fired two goals in
three first half minutes Wednesday to spark Ireland to a
comfortable 5-0 victory over Malta and send his team to the top of
its European Championship qualifying group.
	   The 18-year-old striker scored his first in Irish colors in the
16th minute with a left foot shot which trickled over the line from
Mark Kinsella's corner. The strike before 34,000 fans at Lansdowne
Road meant he became Ireland's youngest goalscorer since John Giles
in 1959.
	   Three minutes later it was 2-0 when Keane went past two
defenders and fired low past the 'keeper.
	   It was nearly 3-0 in the 31st minute when Niall Quinn took a
pass from Kinsella and his shot was turned round the post by
goalkeeper Reginald Cini. Just before half time Quinn produced a
25-meter shot that skimmed the crossbar.
	   Nine minutes into the second half, Manchester United midfielder
and Ireland captain Roy Keane, who is no relation to the striker,
hit the third with a 25-meter shot that struck the goalkeeper on
the leg and rebounded over his head into the net.
	   It was 4-0 in the 63rd minute when Damien Duffed crossed and
Niall Quinn turned the ball in first time for his 17th goal for his
country but first for more than two years.
	   Coventry defender Gary Breen netted the fifth eight minutes from
the end, staying upfield after the Maltese had half cleared a set
piece and he was well placed to beat a defender and fire the ball
home.
	   Lineups:
	   Ireland: Shay Given, Jeff Kenna, Steve Staunton, Gary Breen,
Kenny Cunningham, Roy Keane, Jason McAteer, Mark Kinsella, Niall
Quinn, Robbie Keane, Damien Duff.
	   Malta: Reginald Cini, David Carabott, Jeffrey Chetcuti, Michael
Spiteri, Darren Debono, John Buttigieg; Noel Turner, Paul Sixsmith,
Antoine Zahra, Joseph Brincat, Hubert Suda.

Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka returns to his homeland

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Wole Soyinka, the Nobel laureate and
outspoken junta critic who fled Nigeria four years ago, returned
Wednesday to his home country, where hundreds of singing supporters
welcomed him back.
	   ``Welcome our king, we have been waiting for you,'' the crowd of
about 500 people sang in Yoruba, one of Nigeria's main languages,
as they pressed toward him.
	   Soyinka, who said he was home on a short visit, appeared to try
to speak to the crowd, but the noise and tumult made that
impossible and he was quickly escorted to a waiting car.
	   Later, he met briefly with the family of Moshood Abiola, the
Nigerian millionaire turned opposition leader who died in custody
in July.
	   With reporters and photographers jammed into the Abiola living
room with him, Soyinka told the family they ``are a source of
inspiration to Nigerians.''
	   ``Looking at faces of people, one gets the feeling there's a lot
of work to be done,'' he said after leaving the house.
	   Soyinka's outspoken criticism of the junta from inside Nigeria
and later from abroad has made him an important opposition symbol
to many Nigerians. He remains, however, best-known among the
nation's intellectuals and political class.
	   Soyinka fled Nigeria four years ago fearing an attack from the
regime of the late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. Later, he helped set
up the National Liberation Council of Nigeria, which lobbied to
bring an end to the Abacha regime.
	   Soyinka recently met in New York with Nigeria's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who urged him to return home. But
Soyinka put off the visit for a few weeks, saying he was concerned
about his security.
	   Extra security agents had been dispatched to the airport late
Tuesday night because of the writer's return, and security checks
were more pronounced at the airport Wednesday.
	   The new junta recently dropped treason charges against Soyinka _
charges filed during Abacha's rule which were believed to have been
trumped up in an attempt to silence Soyinka, a vocal critic of the
Nigerian junta.
	   At Abubakar's urging, several exiles have returned to Nigeria in
recent months. The general, who took office after Abacha died in
June, pledges to return Nigeria to democracy and has freed many
political prisoners.
	   Soyinka, 64, who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta, won the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, the first African to win the
award. He fled Nigeria in 1994 after learning that military
authorities were going to arrest him for criticizing the
government.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but 10
years since gaining independence from Britain in 1960.

	   VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) - Mario Frick and Martin Telser
combined within two minutes at the beginning of the second half
Wednesday to give Liechtenstein a 2-1 victory over Azerbaijan in a
qualifying match for the European 2000 championships.
	   After Harry Zech missed on a penalty kick in the 45th minute,
Frick put the host team on the scoreboard with a second penalty
kick in the 47th, thrilling the home crow of 1,500 in Vaduz's
Rheinpark stadium. Telser gave them more to cheer about in the
49th.
	   Peter Jehle, Liechtenstein's 16-year-old goalie, then had his
hands full in his debut with the national team, which also featured
three other under-18 players.
	   Kurban Kurbanov's goal in the 59th minute gave the visitors
hope, but they were unable to catch the players from the tiny
Alpine principality despite two near goals.
	   Nazim Suleimanov hit the post in the 67th minute and Vidadi
Rzayez also failed by hitting the crossbar in the 90th.
	   Lineups:
	   Liechtenstein: Peter Jehle; Harry Zech; Christoph Ritter, Daniel
Hasler, Martin Stocklasa; Herbert Bicker (Juergen Ospelt, 67th),
Hansjoerg Lingg, Michael Stocklasa, Thomas Beck (Marco Buechel,
74th); Mario Frick, Martin Telser.

Man on FBI's most-wanted list charged in Olympic bombing

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Eric Robert Rudolph, one of the FBI's 10
most-wanted fugitives, was charged Wednesday with the 1996 bombing
at the Olympics and two other attacks in Atlanta.
	   Attorney General Janet Reno, accompanied at a news conference by
FBI Director Louis Freeh, said the criminal complaint charging
Rudolph with the Olympic blast and the 1997 bombings of a gay bar
and an abortion clinic was being filed with a federal court.
	   ``Eric Rudolph is on the run,'' Reno said. ``We are going to
keep searching until we find him and we're are not going to rest
until we bring him to justice.''
	   Freeh said Rudolph now is charged with six bombings, including
the three attacks in Atlanta and the Jan. 29 bombing of a
Birmingham, Alabama abortion clinic for which he was charged
earlier. Freeh mentioned six bombs, because secondary bombs were
placed at both the Atlanta clinic and at the bar.
	   Federal authorities released a new picture of Rudolph _ one they
said they believe represents how he looked at the time of the
bombings in Centennial Park during the Olympics. It shows Rudolph
wearing khaki shorts, a green T-shirt and dark socks and shoes.
	   The initial investigation into the Olympic park bombing focused
on Richard Jewell, a security guard who discovered the bomb. His
name was leaked to the media, but he was never charged. Eventually,
the FBI publicly ruled him out.
	   Wayne Grant, Jewell's lawyer, said it would be inappropriate for
Jewell to comment on the latest development.
	   Both Reno and Freeh appealed to the public for assistance in
apprehending Rudolph, who has been believed hiding out in North
Carolina.
	   Reno recalled the bombing that shattered the Olympics in the
summer of 1996 ``as thousands milled nearby.'' She said authorities
were determined to press ahead against senseless violence.
	   The Olympic bombing killed one person and wounded more than 100
others. An off-duty policeman working as a guard was killed and a
nurse was injured in the Birmingham bombing.
	   Freeh said all the bombs ``were powerful antipersonnel devices,
containing nails, that were designed to kill and maim.''
	   Secondary bombs at the Atlanta bar and clinic may have been
designed to harm law enforcement and rescue workers, as might a
last-minute telephone warning before the Olympic blast, some
investigators say.

Court releases chained wild South African elephants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ A South African judge on Wednesday
ordered 30 young elephants released from a wildlife export farm
near Pretoria after lobbying by animal rights groups.
	   Since their capture along the Limpopo River in neighboring
Botswana in August, the 5- to 10-year-old elephants were being
tamed so they could be sold to zoos and safari parks.
	   International wildlife organizations have been lobbying for
their release since reports in September that they were held in
chains.
	   The cruelty charges were brought by Rick Allan, of the National
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
	   ``It's a great feeling to have them released,'' said Allan in a
telephone interview.
	   African Game Services bought the elephants for dlrs 2000 each
from Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve, a private organization
of 19 landowners and tourist lodges.
	   Allan said that Magistrate Glas, whose first name was not known,
ordered the release late Wednesday, without stating reasons for his
ruling.
	   The animals will be transported to a national park in Northwest
Province on Wednesday with trucks supplied by South Africa's
National Parks Board, Allan said.
	   The tale of the 30 elephants highlights many Africans' concern
about a species listed as endangered yet whose numbers are growing
by 7 percent a year and destroying the crops sustaining humans.

Wales grabs 3-2 win over Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ A Kit Symons goal five minutes from full
time earned Wales a 3-2 win over Belarus and its second successive
victory in European Championship qualifiers.
	   Symons outjumped the Belarus defense to connect with a Darren
Barnard corner in the 85th minute and guided a looping header
inside the far post to score the clincher.
	   Wales opened the scoring ast Ninian Park through John Robinson
in the 15th minute when he netted a rising right-foot shot from
just inside the penalty area.
	   But instead of capitalizing on the advantage, the Welsh defense
opened up and Belarus hit back six minutes later when Sergie
Gurenko finished off a long-range attack to level the scores.
	   The visitors grabbed the lead three minutes after the halftime
break when Valentin Belkevich breezed through the Welsh defense
into the area and beat Paul Jones in a one-on-one encounter.
	   Symons narrowly missed an equalizer minutes later when he met a
corner with a powerful header but it was stopped with a stunning
save by Andrei Satsunkevich.
	   But Wales persevered and drew level in the 54th minute when
Chris Coleman pounced on a rebound after Nathan Blake's header hit
the crossbar.
	   Wales regained control of the match and raid after raid on the
Belarus goal finally resulted in the winner in the 85th minute.
	   Lineups:
	   Wales _ Paul Jones, John Robinson, Kit Symons, Robbie Savage,
Chris Coleman, Darren Barnard, Mark Pembridge, Mark Hughes, Andy
Johnson, Nathan Blake, Dean Saunders.
	   Belarus _ Andrei Satsunkevich, Erik Yakhimovich, Andrei
Ostrovsky, Sergei Shtanyuk, Andrei Lavrik, Alexander Khatskevich,
Vasily Baranov, Sergei Gurenko, Valentin Belkevich, Vyacheslav
Gerashchenko, Vladimir Makovsky.

Frustrated France struggles to 2-0 win over Andorra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France _ World champion France took nearly an hour
to break down a determined Andorra defense Wednesday before beating
its amateur visitors by a disappointing 2-0 margin.
	   In a match totally dominated by the home team, France opened the
scoring in the 53rd minute when right back Vincent Candela latched
on to a diagonal pass from Didier Deschamps to poke the ball into
the net from eight meters (yards).
	   Youri Djorkaeff made it 2-0 on the hour, tapping in from close
range after goalkeeper Alvarez Koldo found a Tony Vairelles shot
too hot to handle.
	   The win means that France has won two and drawn one of its first
three Euro 2000 qualifying matches.
	   But France will be bitterly disappointed with the narrow margin
of victory at the Stade de France.
	   The contest between the world champion and Europe's newest and
weakest football nation - Andorra's population could fit inside the
80,000-capacity stadium - seemed a mismatch.
	   But in its first home match since beating Brazil in the World
Cup final, France struggled to penetrate a wall of determined
Andorran defenders, and rarely showed the fluency that it showed
during the summer.
	   France looked to make the most of its height advantage by piling
in regular crosses.
	   But Andorran right back Francesco Ramirez easily contained
Chistophe Dugarry, while the raids of lively winger Vairelles were
usually blocked by a mass of defenders.
	   Andorra goalkeeper Koldo was also in inspired form, beating out
a 30-yard drive from Frank Leboeuf and saving from Djorkaeff from
point blank range in the first half, before making a brilliant
reaction save from Robert Pires near the end.
	   David Trezeguet was also wasteful, blasting wide with a 15-meter
volley early on.
	   Lineups
	   France _ Bernard Lama; Vincent Candela, Bixente Lizarazu,
Laurent Blanc, Frank Leboeuf; Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff
(Alain Boghossian, 82nd); Zinedine Zidane; Christophe Dugarry

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge has asked British police to
hold Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who underwent surgery in London, until
the former Chilean dictator can be questioned on allegations of
genocide and terrorism.
	   The request was made by National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon,
one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes into human rights
violations in Chile and Argentina.
	   Garzon filed his request to question Pinochet on Wednesday.
Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question
Pinochet a day earlier.
	   Pinochet, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc Friday, was
reported to have left London Bridge Hospital earlier Wednesday.
British authorities have declined to comment on his whereabouts or
the Spanish judges' requests.
	   In 1996, Castellon opened his probe into murder, torture and
disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's 1973-90 regime. Garzon is
also investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish
citizens in Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.

Davenport wins first match as world No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Lindsay Davenport won her
first match as the world's top-ranked woman Wednesday, posting a
second-round straight-sets win over French qualifier Julie
Halard-Decugis at the European Championships.
	   The 22-year-old American began the defense of her European crown
_ as well as her reign atop the rankings _ with a 6-4, 6-2 win over
the Halard-Decugis in 58 minutes for a place in the quarterfinals.
	   ``I definitely wanted to win this match,'' said Davenport, who
officially took over as the world's top player from Martina Hingis
on Monday. ``But it was hard to play. Being No. 1 adds a little
more pressure.''
	   Davenport got off to a shakey start, falling behind 4-1 in the
first set. She quickly rallied back, winning the final five games
of the set.
	   The two traded breaks to go 2-2 in the second set, before
Davenport broke the French player twice in a row to clinch the win.
	   ``I thought it was going to be a difficult match because she can
get really hot sometimes,'' said Davenport, who won five titles
this season, including the U.S. Open. ``I didn't play very great
tennis tonight but I played well enough to win.
	   ``I'm never going to be a Graf or Seles and be great right from
the start. Often I have to play my way into a tournament so I don't
appear to be that great a player at the beginning. But I get
through,'' she added.
	   The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning streak in
Switzerland to 14 victories.
	   Her run began at the 1993 European Open in Lucerne, where she
captured her first career title at the age of 16. She went on to
defend that title in 1994 before winning in Zurich last year.
	   Third-seed Conchita Martinez became the first seeded player to
get knocked out of the tournament, losing 6-2, 7-6 (7-0) to
Romania's Irina Spirlea.
	   In earlier second round play, seventh-seed Mary Pierce of France
defeated South African Joanette Kruger 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa easily advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Romania's Ruxandra
Dragomir.
	   Second-round action will continue Thursday with three Americans
on center court.
	   Second-seed Venus Williams will play compatriot Corina Morariu,
and Lisa Raymond will face fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat of France.
	   Eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost, who ended Hingis's 80-week
reign at the top of the standings with a quarterfinal victory in
Filderstadt last week, will play France's Amelie Mauresmo.

Tribunal prosecutor reaffirms jurisdiction of court in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal reaffirmed Wednesday her right to investigate
atrocities in Kosovo amid indications that Belgrade had tried to
limit the court's jurisdiction in the southern Serb province.
	   The Security Council resolution that established the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993
clearly states that the court has authority to investigate and
prosecute crimes committed in Kosovo, Louise Arbour told reporters.
	   Her comments came amid reports that the scope of the tribunal's
authority in Kosovo was a sticking point during negotiations
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to end the Serb offensive on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   ``The jurisdiction of ICTY is not for Mr. Milosevic to decide,
nor is it subject to negotiation between him and anybody else,''
said Arbour, of Canada.
	   She stressed that she had not seen Holbrooke's agreement and was
speaking only to reaffirm the court's powers following press
reports that Milosevic had refused to acknowledge the authority of
the tribunal.
	   Yugoslav authorities had also recently held up visas for
tribunal investigators to go to Kosovo. Arbour said she couldn't
speculate as to the government's motive for delaying the visas,
which have since been issued. But she said she planned to apply for
visas for another mission soon.
	   ``In light of this potential confusion, I will request that we
be given speedy, expedited answers to the general question of
access and more specifically, the issuance of visas,'' she said.
	   Serbia, which includes Kosovo, is the larger of the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke told the NBC television show ``Today,'' on Tuesday
that the tribunal's scope came up during the marathon negotiations
that ended with Milosevic agreeing to withdraw his forces from
Kosovo, begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians
and allow 2,000 international monitors to verify Serb compliance
with U.N. demands.
	   ``We had a big argument about the war crimes tribunal,''
Holbrooke said. ``It is embedded in our agreement that he said he
will fully comply with the U.N. resolution ... He agreed to double
the war crimes tribunal staff in Belgrade and let them travel
freely in Kosovo.''
	   Arbour said the tribunal had no plans to double its staff.
	   She refused to specify what crimes investigators would be
looking into. When asked whether the tribunal was considering
indictments against Milosevic himself, Arbour said she only
discusses possible indictments with her office.
	   ``I have discussed and I continue to discuss with my staff the
feasibility and desirability of indicting all those _ particularly
those in the most senior positions of responsibility,'' she said.
	   The tribunal's jurisdiction ``applies to possible war crimes
committed by either side of the conflict,'' she added, when asked
if the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army was also being
investigated.

Effenberg caught driving under the influence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Stefan Effenberg, the Bayern Munich
midfielder, faces a fine after being caught driving legally drunk,
police said Wednesday.
	   Effenberg was caught during a routine check in a Munich suburb.
He had a blood alcohol level of 1.07, more than double over the 0.5
legal limit.
	   He faces a 500-mark (dlrs 300) fine and could lose his driving
license for four weeks.
	   The 29-year-old midfielder was sent home from the 1994 World Cup
in the United States for showing an obscene gesture to German fans.
	   He came back to the German team last month for two exhibition
games but quit the national team several days later.

Diplomat: EU to lift sanctions on Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The European Union is poised to remove
sanctions against Nigeria in the wake of democratic reforms by the
country's military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, a visiting
European diplomat said Wednesday.
	   Ramon de Miquel, Spain's Secretary of State for the European
Union said in a statement that travel and other diplomatic
restrictions on the Nigerian government would soon be lifted,
although an arms embargo would remain in place until an elected
government had been installed.
	   The 15-nation EU would, however, consider military training
agreements prior to the handover, Miquel said. The statement was
released after the diplomat met with Nigeria's president.
	   Since taking power in June, Abubakar has released most of the
country's political prisoners and promised national elections in
February and a handover to an elected civilian government by the
end of May.
	   Abubakar told the EU diplomat that the Nigerian government was
``taking steps to address all identified problems that might hinder
the successful implementation'' of democracy, state-controlled
radio reported.
	   Britain's High Commissioner Graham Burton was quoted by a
Nigerian newspaper Wednesday as saying the EU was backtracking on
trade sanctions and a flight ban on officials and family members of
the junta.
	   The sanctions were put in place during the discredited regime of
the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of apparent heart
failure on June 7.
	   ``When the sanctions are lifted, we hope to have a new
development agreement,'' Burton said.
	   Nigeria's most well known junta critic living abroad, Nobel
laureate Wole Soyinka, returned home Wednesday to Lagos, where he
was greeted by hundreds of singing supporters.

Puerto Rico will have to import coffee after hurricane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans will have to buy coffee,
long a source of pride, from other countries for years because of
damage caused by Hurricane Georges, agriculture officials say.
	   Luis Talavera, executive director of the Puerto Rican
Agricultural Services and Development Administration, said
Wednesday it could be three years before new coffee plants will
begin producing.
	   Puerto Rican coffee, while not a big export, is widely favored
on the island over foreign brands. It often wins international
awards.
	   Hurricane Georges hit on Sept. 21, just weeks before the coffee
harvest. It destroyed about 70 percent of the harvest and 40
percent of coffee plants, a total of about dlrs 100 million,
Talavera said.
	   Five of the largest coffee brands _ Yaucono, Cafe Selecto,
Rioja, Cafe Rico and Selecto Coffee Break _ said Wednesday they
would probably have to import about 12 million pounds of coffee
beginning in January.
	   About 16 million pounds were in storage before the hurricane
struck. Puerto Rico consumes about dlrs 10 million pounds a year,
she said.
	   ``We can assure you that coffee will continue to be on the
Puerto Rican dinner table,'' said Enrique Jimenez, owner of
Yaucono.
	   Most of the imported coffee will come from Costa Rica and
northern areas of the Dominican Republic that were spared the brunt
of the hurricane, the companies said.

Nicaraguan soldiers guard ancient city uncovered in jungle

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's president said Wednesday
that he had sent soldiers to guard a lost Indian city discovered by
a filmmaker in a southeastern jungle.
	   A team of Nicaraguan scientists set out Wednesday for the remote
site, and President Arnoldo Aleman said another team including
scientists from New Orleans' Tulane University would follow. It is
near the Costa Rican border, 150 miles (250 kms) southeast of the
capital, Managua.
	   If the two-square-mile (five-square-km) site is proven to be a
lost Chibcha Indian city, as archaeologists believe, Aleman said it
``would be of great touristic benefit to the country. It must be
protected.''
	   The site was discovered early this month by a Costa Rican
documentary filmmaker, Jose Cortes. It includes more than 10 rock
piles that are believed to be tombs and could contain gold jewelry,
archaeologists said.
	   Archaeologists disagreed about the find.
	   Nicaraguan archaeologist Jose Espinoza said the discovery could
be the city of Cariay, described by Christopher Columbus during his
fourth trip to the New World. Espinoza said Columbus wrote about
the city to Queen Isabel in a June 7, 1503, letter.
	   According to the letter, it was five leagues (14.5 kilometers)
upstream along the San Juan River from the Caribbean Sea, which
matches the site's location. Columbus said the Chibcha Indians
there were great gold artisans _ better than the Aztecs, Mayas or
Incas.
	   Another Nicaraguan archaeologist, Jaime Incer, disagreed.
	   ``It's very premature to make statements,'' he said, ``But I
think it appears to be the city of Yari or Yare, which the Spanish
capital Diego de Machuca described in 1539.''
	   He said the remains of the city of Cariay are located in
present-day Costa Rica.

LONDON: Macedonia 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; GROUP 1 &QC; 
 &UR; Wales 3, Belarus 2

<TEXT>
	   Wales scored first at Ninian Park through John Robinson in the
15th minute.
	   Two glaring defensive lapses allowed Belarus to equalize in the
21st minute through Sergei Gurenko and then snare the lead in the
48th minute when Valentin Belkevich cruised through some feeble
defending.
	   Wales equalized in the 54th minute when Chris Coleman swooped on
a rebound and then Kit Symons scored the clincher with five minutes
to spare.
 &UR; Switzerland 1, Denmark 1
	   At Zurich, an Ole Tobiasen goal three minutes into injury time
allowed Denmark to salvage a draw with Switzerland.
	   Switzerland seemed headed for victory through Stephane
Chapuisat's goal in the 58th minute.
 &UR; GROUP 2 &QC; 
 &UR; Greece 3, Georgia 0
	   At Athens, Greece raced to a three goal lead over Georgia in the
first half. Nicos Machlas opened the scoring in the 13th minute,
Nikolaos Liberopoulos extended the lead two minutes later and
Marinos Ouzounidis netted the third in the 36th minute.
 &UR; Norway 2, Albania 2
	   At Oslo, Albania had a 2-0 lead early in the second half through
goals by Alban Bushaj in the 38th minute and the Igli Tare in the
53rd.
	   But Norway hit back, scoring two goals in the last ten minutes
via Kjetil Rekdal in the 80th minute and Henning Berg with three
minutes to spare.
 &UR; Slovenia 1, Latvia 0
	   At Maribor, striker Saso Udovic's 85th minute goal allowed
Slovenia to edge Latvia in a defense-oriented match.
	   Slovenia had the bulk of possession but created very few
opportunities until Udovic ceased on a late chance to clinch
victory.
 &UR; GROUP 3 &QC; 
 &UR; Moldova 1, Germany 3
	   At Kishinev, Moldova struck first through Alexandru Guzun in the
sixth minute but Germany replied with three first-half goals to
seal its first win of the Euro 2000 campaign.
	   The defending champions were stunned by the Moldova goal and
stormed back as Ulf Kirsten fired two goals, in the 20th and 36th
minute, and Oliver Bierhoff sealed the result with a goal two
minutes later.
 &UR; Turkey 1, Finland 3
	   At Istanbul, Finland ended Turkey's winning streak. Mixa
Paatelainen opened the scoring in the fifth minute but it took 45
minutes before Jonatan extended Finland's lead to two.
	   Turkey reduced the margin to 2-1 with a goal through Ogun
Temizanoglu in the 73rd minute but the comeback was short-lived.
Jari Litmanen scored the clincher for Finland deep into injury
time.
 &UR; GROUP 4 &QC; 
 &UR; France 2, Andorra 0
	   At Saint-Denis, France's first home match since winning the
World Cup didn't go quite to plan with a two goal win over European
minnows, Andorra.
	   The teams battled out a scoreless first half but the French came
home in the second half with goals in the 53rd and 61st minute
through Vincent Candela and Youri Djorkaeff.
 &UR; Iceland 1, Russia 0
	   At Reykjavik, Iceland snatched an unlikely win on an own-goal by
Russian defender Yuri Nikiforov in the 88th minute. The game was
destined for a draw until Nikiforov made the mistake of trying to
head-away a harmless cross into the area and it ricocheted into the
Russian net.
 &UR; Ukraine 2, Armenia 0
	   At Kiev, Serguey Skachenko converted a penalty attempt in the
31st minute to give Ukraine a one goal advantage going into
halftime. Ukraine maintained the one goal margin until the 83rd
minute when Andrei Husin notched the second.
 &UR; GROUP 5 &QC; 
 &UR; Bulgaria 0, Sweden 1
	   Glasgow Celtic's Henrik Larsson broke the deadlock at Burgas,
Bulgaria with a close-range goal in the 62nd minute as Sweden edged
to its second win in two Euro 2000 matches.
	   Sweden joined Poland at the top of the group with two wins from
two matches, including a 2-1 win over England.
 &UR; Luxembourg 0, England 3
	   In Luxembourg, England got its first win of the Euro 2000
campaign but it came in uninspiring style. Michael Owen opened the
scoring in the 19th minute when a miscued kick beat the 'keeper.
Captain Alan Shearer made no mistakes with a penalty in the 40th
minute to extend the margin to two and Gareth Southgate added a
modicum of respectability with a last minute goal.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Heading to the United States for a
crucial Mideast peace summit, Yasser Arafat said Wednesday he was
optimistic and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu said he would work
towards agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The two men will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington Thursday and then head to a secluded conference center
in eastern Maryland for talks.
	   Clinton has been pushing the sides to end months of stalemate by
completing an agreement based on a U.S. initiative for Israel to
withdraw troops from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
detailed Palestinian measures to fight terrorism.
	   Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israel's right-wing
camp which opposes ceding land to the Palestinians. Wednesday,
opponents of the U.S. plan, including the powerful Jewish settler
lobby, threatened to topple the government and field a challenger
to Netanyahu in the next elections if he signs off on a pullback
deal with the Palestinians.
	   Even two Netanyahu allies, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
Science Minister Silvan Shalom, said Netanyahu should back out of
the summit because unrealistically high expectations for a success
would pressure Israel into making too many concession.
	   Settlers were demonstrating outside of Netanyahu's home
Wednesday and planned to send representatives to the summit to try
and convince Israeli leaders to walk away from the talks.
	   But Netanyahu said Wednesday that if Israel's security demands
are met, ``we will be willing to go a long way, even very long''
toward a peace agreement.
	   Tuesday, Netanyahu said there was no possibility that an
agreement would be signed at the close of the summit. But Wednesday
he said there was a 50-50 chance that agreement could be reached.
He would take any deal back to his Cabinet for approval before
signing.
	   Speaking to reporters during a stop-over in London Wednesday,
Arafat said, ``I personally believe this is a window of
opportunity. I am optimistic because of the energy and the time
that have been invested by President Clinton,'' Arafat said.
	   Results of a poll conducted by a Palestinian research center
found that Palestinian support for armed attacks against Israel is
on the rise and while confidence in the peace process remains high,
a majority believe agreement is far from reach.
	   Netanyahu has cited nine conditions the Palestinians must
fulfill before he will go ahead with a withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians must arrest suspected Islamic militants,
cooperate with Israel on security matters, reduce their police
force by several thousands, confiscate illegal weapons, extradite
prisoners sought by Israel and annul sections of the PLO charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians say that the offending sections of its charter
have been voted out and that past security plans developed by both
sides, have been rejected by Netanyahu. The United States has been
trying to work out a new security arrangement.

 &UR; San Marino 1, Austria 4

<TEXT>
	   At Serravalle, Austria went scoreless in the first half but
fired in four goals in 18 minutes to blitz San Marino.
	   It took just under an hour before Ivica Vastic opened the
scoring in the 58th minute. Christian Mayrleb added a second goal
in the 63rd minute, Martin Hiden scored a third goal five minutes
later and Eduard Glieder put the issue beyond doubt with Austria's
fourth on 76 minutes.
	   San Marino scored a conselation goal when Adny Selva converted a
penalty in the 80th minute.
 &UR; Israel 1, Spain 2
	   At Tel-Aviv, Spanish coach Jose Antonio Camacho won on his
debut. Israel opened the scoring through Alon Hazan in the 63rd
minute but Spain's Fernando Hierro struck back to equalize within
two minutes. Joseba Etxeberria scored the winner in the 77th minute
to seal a morale-boosting victory.
 &UR; GROUP 7 &QC; 
 &UR; Hungary 1, Romania 1 &QC; 
	   Viorel Moldovan fired Romania ahead after 51 minutes in Budapest
but Janos Hrutka earned a point for the home team with an equalizer
eight minutes from the end.
 &UR; Liechtenstein 2, Azerbaijan 1 &QC; 
	   In Vaduz, Mario Frick's penalty two minutes into the second half
game the home team the lead and Martin Telser added a second two
minutes later. Kurban Kurbanov pulled a goal back for Azerbaijan in
the 59th.
 &UR; Slovakia 0, Portugal 3 &QC; 
	   Long-serving striker Joao Pinto fired Portugal two goals ahead
by half time in Bratislava with goals in the 16th and 31st minutes.
Abel Xavier added the third 18 minutes from the end.
 &UR; GROUP 8 &QC; 
 &UR; Croatia 3, Macedonia 2
	   At Zagreb, Zvonimir Boban scored twice as Croatia held off a
determined Macedonia. The visitor struck first through Sasa Ciric
in the second minute but World Cup hero Davor Suker leveled in the
16th minute. Boban's first in the 45th minute was matched by
Dzevdet Sainovski 10 minutes later to tie the score 2-2. But Boban
ensured Croatia's second successive win with the clincher in the
70th minute.
 &UR; Ireland 5, Malta 0
	   At Lansdowne Road, Dublin, 18-year-old Robbie Keane scored his
first two international goals within three minutes to set-up
Ireland's five goal blitz.
	   Irish captain Roy Keane scored the first goal of the second half
in the 54th minute, while goals to Niall Quinn in the 63rd minute
and Gary Breen in the 82nd added to Malta's woes.
 &UR; GROUP 9 &QC; 
 &UR; Lithuania 4, Bosnia-Herzegovina 2
	   Muhamed Konjic gave the Bosnians a fourth-minute lead in Vilnius
but Valdas Ivanauskas leveled six minutes later. It was Ivanauskas
who edged Lithuania ahead in the 67th only for Elvir Baljic to
level a minute later but then get sent off for a bad foul.
Ivanauskas scored his third in the 75th and Virginijus Baltusnikas
hit the fourth for the Lithuanians in the final seconds.
 &UR; Scotland 2, Faeroe Islands 1
	   Craig Burley fired Scotland ahead in the 22nd minute in Aberdeen
and Billy Dodds, who scored twice against Estonia on Saturday,
headed the second just before half time. John Petersen replied for
the Faeroes four minutes from the end for a foul by Colin Hendry on
Johannes Jonsson.
 &UR; Czech Republic 4, Estonia 1 &QC; 
	   At Teplice, Czech Republic, Pavel Nedved gave the Czechs an 8th
minute lead before Patrik Berger added two more goals from free
kicks in the 21st and 41st minutes. An own goal by Janek Meet just
before half time made it 4-0 and the only goal in the second half
came from Estonia's Argo Arbeter in the final minute of the game.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
defended a decision Wednesday to take his wife Sarah with him to
Washington for a crucial Mideast summit.
	   The United States, which is hosting the summit, had asked
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to come
unaccompanied by their spouses in order to concentrate fully
negotiations aimed at ending months of stalemate.
	   ``I am the prime minister of Israel. I do not accept dictates,
on political matters or on personal ones,'' Netanyahu responded
when asked about the decision by an Israel TV reporter.
	   The prime minister's office said Mrs. Netanyahu would maintain a
separate schedule from her husband during the summit.
	   Mrs. Netanyahu, the premier's third wife, has accompanied her
husband on nearly every overseas trip and usually brings the
couple's two young sons.

Nicaraguan soldiers guard ancient city uncovered in jungle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with museum director saying rock formations may have
been result of volcanic explosions, not man-made. RECASTS lead.
CORRECTS Isabella sted Isabel in graf 8.
 &UR; By FILADELFO ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's president said Wednesday
that he had sent soldiers to guard what may be a lost Indian city
discovered by a filmmaker in a southeastern jungle.
	   A team of Nicaraguan scientists set out Wednesday for the remote
site, and President Arnoldo Aleman said another team including
scientists from New Orleans' Tulane University would follow. It is
near the Costa Rican border, 150 miles (250 kms) southeast of the
capital, Managua.
	   If the two-square-mile (five-square-km) site is proven to be a
lost Chibcha Indian city, as archaeologists believe, Aleman said it
``would be of great touristic benefit to the country. It must be
protected.''
	   It includes more than 10 rock piles that archaeologists said
could be tombs containing gold jewelry.
	   Archaeologists had initially thought that the rock piles were
man-made. But the director of Nicaragua's National Museum, Manuel
Roman, said they may actually be basalt columns formed by volcanic
explosions millions of years ago.
	   Roman said the government will send scientists to the site
Friday to determine its origins.
	   The site was discovered this month by a Costa Rican documentary
filmmaker, Jose Cortes.
	   Nicaraguan archaeologist Jose Espinoza said the discovery could
be the city of Cariay, described by Christopher Columbus during his
fourth trip to the New World. Espinoza said Columbus wrote about
the city to Queen Isabella in a June 7, 1503, letter.
	   According to the letter, it was five leagues (14.5 kilometers)
upstream along the San Juan River from the Caribbean Sea, which
matches the site's location. Columbus said the Chibcha Indians
there were great gold artisans _ better than the Aztecs, Mayas or
Incas.
	   Another Nicaraguan archaeologist, Jaime Incer, disagreed.
	   ``It's very premature to make statements,'' he said, ``But I
think it appears to be the city of Yari or Yare, which the Spanish
captain Diego de Machuca described in 1539.''
	   He said the remains of the city of Cariay are located in
present-day Costa Rica.

Bahamas hanging two convicted criminals despite opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH NASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas is sending two murderers to
the gallows Thursday, following a Caribbean trend to fight rising
crime with the harshest punishment despite international
opposition.
	   Attorney General Tennyson Wells said the Bahamas would hang
Trevor Fisher, 28, and Richard Woods, 51, even though they have
appeals pending at the Organization of American States'
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
	   The Costa Rica-based commission had received Fisher's petition
in June 1996 and that of Woods in November 1996.
	   The Bahamian Ministry of National Security said the government
had not received any recommendation from the commission and
``considers that it has complied with its obligations.'' The
ministerial statement came Friday, the same day the death warrants
were read to the condemned men.
	   Some Caribbean countries have accused the commission of
deliberately prolonging its decisions in a bid to prevent hangings.
Jamaica withdrew from the commission this year and Trinidad has
said it will withdraw next year.
	   Bahamian officials needed to carry out the executions ahead of a
five-year limit set by Britain's Privy Council, which ruled in 1993
that it was inhumane to keep prisoners on death row for more than
five years. As a result, hundreds of condemned convicts had their
sentences commuted to life imprisonment, since the Privy Council of
the House of Lords is the highest court for several current and
former British Caribbean colonies.
	   In the Bahamas, 17 death sentences had to be commuted this year
and 30 people remain on death row.
	   The Privy Council ruled three-two last week that the Bahamas,
independent since 1973, should act. It emphasized the ``requirement
on humanitarian grounds that in countries which retain the death
penalty, lawful death penalties should be carried out as swiftly as
practicable.''
	   The council said it also was necessary ``to maintain public
confidence in the criminal justice system in the Bahamas.''
	   Britain's government is opposed to the death penalty and has
tried to persuade Caribbean countries to stop it. In response,
Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad _ all independent nations
with varying links to Britain _ announced in July that they plan to
cut ties to the Privy Council and form their own Caribbean Court of
Justice.
	   The hangings in the Bahamas are scheduled separately for 8 a.m.
(13:00 GMT) and 9 a.m. Thursday.
	   Fisher was convicted on March 25, 1994, of shooting an unarmed
man at point blank range in a botched 1990 robbery attempt. Woods
was sentenced Jan. 18, 1995, for the 1993 murder of Pauline
Johnson.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis is the only other Caribbean country to hang
a convicted murderer this year, ending a 13-year hiatus there.

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. fined dlrs 8 million for oil dumping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the
world's second-largest cruise line, was fined dlrs 8 million
Wednesday for dumping oil overboard and lying about it to
investigators.
	   U.S. District Court Judge Juan Perez Gimenez also put the
company on legal probation for five years, meaning it could face
additional punishment if inspectors believe it is breaking
environmental rules.
	   ``This case should sent a message to those who own and operate
ships that they cannot dump oil in our waters and make false
statements to our government with impunity,'' U.S. Attorney
Guillermo Gil said in a written statement.
	   The sentencing sealed a bargain made with prosecutors in June,
when Miami-based Royal Caribbean agreed to plead guilty to the
charges in Miami and San Juan and pay a dlrs 9 million fine, the
largest environmental penalty ever against a cruise company.
	   ``This is making it official,'' said Lynn Martinstein, a
spokeswoman for the cruise line. She said the company was given
until Dec. 15 to draw up new procedures regulating handling of oil
on its ships.
	   The first dlrs 1 million of the fine was imposed by a federal
judge in Miami. It was earmarked for conservation projects in
Florida and Puerto Rico.
	   The sentencing in Puerto Rico was set for Sept. 25 but was
postponed after Hurricane Georges hit the island on Sept. 21.
	   Prosecutors claimed five Royal Caribbean ships, including the
Nordic Empress, pumped oily bilge water overboard off the coast of
Puerto Rico as well as in the Pacific Ocean between ports in Canada
and Alaska.
	   Bilge is a mixture of water, spilled fuel, oil and other liquids
that collects in the lowest parts of ships. It must be routinely
pumped out, and federal regulations require that the oil be kept in
holding tanks.
	   Prosecutors said the company installed a pipe on the Sovereign
of the Seas cruiseliner to bypass an oil separator. They claimed
the company cut up the bypass pipe and hid it from Coast Guard
inspectors.
	   The company also pleaded guilty to charges of tampering with oil
sensors and keeping false records of oil discharges, the Justice
Department said.

Is Israel's famed old warrior finally ready for peacemaking?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sharon's other first-day activities, adds reason
given for his late arrival to summit, comment from ministry veteran
on his role
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-102
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was a moment like so many in Ariel Sharon's
storied military career: he marched straight in and took charge.
	   Sharon _ aging ex-general, master political survivor, revered by
some as a war hero and reviled by others as a war criminal _
formally assumed control of Israel's foreign ministry on Wednesday,
a day before his departure for a crucial Mideast summit outside
Washington.
	   The 70-year-old Sharon gave every indication of relishing his
re-emergence in a leadership post after a decade and a half of
disgrace and political exile.
	   Even before he showed up to start work at the ministry, he made
his first foray abroad as foreign minister _ a quick trip to
Jordan, in the company of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to
brief leaders about the upcoming summit.
	   Later, meeting with top ministry officials _ and, briefly, with
reporters _ the burly, white-haired Sharon turned on a typical mix
of diplomatic formulations, unyielding doctrine and blunt-force
charm. Asked about the powers of his new position, he laughed.
	   ``I'm not the kind of man people give things to,'' he said in
his trademark trumpeting voice. ``I take them!''
	   Emphatic though his entry was, Sharon's ability to shape the
ministry's agenda is likely tied to the success of the U.S. talks.
After all, he got the job mainly because Netanyahu needs him to
help quell right-wing opposition to any accord reached there.
	   ``The anticipation is that he wants to be involved and
engaged,'' said a ministry veteran. But his long-term ability to do
that ``very much depends on the summit,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Probably no other Israeli public figure arouses such conflicting
passions. To his partisans, Sharon is the daring, brilliant
tactician whose battlefield victories helped turn the tide of three
of Israel's wars, the only politician with the force and stature to
lead the rightist camp.
	   To detractors, he is a destroyer. The Israeli left despises him.
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat flatly describes him as a
war criminal.
	   Many Palestinians hold him responsible for Lebanese Christian
militiamen's 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, and
angrily recall his aggressive promotion of Jewish settlement growth
during a stint as housing minister.
	   Sharon returns the ill feeling: he has said publicly he won't
shake Yasser Arafat's hand, even in his post as Israel's principal
negotiator of peace with the Palestinians.
	   Perhaps to avoid any awkwardness over greeting Arafat, Sharon is
arriving late for the summit. While opening handshakes occur in
Washington, Sharon will still be in Israel, attending a ceremony
for soldiers slain in the 1973 war. Only once the venue has move to
the privacy of the conference center at Wye Plantation, Maryland
will be arrive.
	   Many of Sharon's allies on the right reacted with dismay to his
appointment as foreign minister, considering him an opportunist who
betrayed principles to fulfill his own political ambitions. His
acceptance of the job, they believe, amounts to endorsement of a
land deal with the Palestinians, something they bitterly oppose.
	   Even Sharon's own boss doesn't much care for him. In the past,
Sharon has publicly disparaged Netanyahu, and the prime minister
repaid him by relegating him to the second-string post of
infrastructure minister.
	   Some observers believe Sharon's desire to rise above past
disgrace _ he had not held a top government position for 15 years,
since being held indirectly responsible for the massacres at the
Sabra and Shatilla camps south of Beirut _ could be the key to his
stance at the summit and in months to come.
	   The word being used over and over again by commentators is
pragmatism. Sharon is viewed by friend and foe alike as hard-headed
and hard-nosed, unlikely to sign onto an accord unless he really
thought it would work on the ground.
	   And his background gives him greater credibility than anyone
else on questions of Israel's security, something on which any
accord will hinge.
	   A government official long acquainted with Sharon, speaking on
condition of anonymity, likened his potential role to that of the
late Moshe Dayan in the Camp David process _ ``the practical
general who understands this is the last chapter of his life, that
there are limits to power and the use of force in solving
disputes.''
	   His desire to become a statesman, the official suggested, could
strongly propel him toward unexpected compromise.
	   ``Sharon is a man of surprises, and not only on the
battlefield,'' commentator Avraham Tirosh wrote in the Maariv
newspaper. ``No one is able to assess what Sharon will really do.''

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The Federal Emergency
Management Agency on Wednesday praised tougher building codes for
protecting the Virgin Islands from Hurricane Georges.
	   The territory adopted stricter codes and re-roofed many homes
after Hurricane Hugo struck in 1989 and Hurricane Marilyn
devastated the islands in 1995. Damages from Georges covered by the
agency totaled dlrs 6 million, most of it in St. Croix, while Hugo
cost about dlrs 321 million.
	   ``Efforts to make the territory resistant to high winds and
damaging surf paid off this year,'' said Marianne C. Jackson, a
federal coordinating officer for the agency.
	   The island's utilities also strengthened poles and lines after
Marilyn, reducing damage, officials said.
	   ``The Virgin Islands' people prepared for the worst and came out
on top,'' FEMA director James Lee Witt said in a written statement.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of striking public
sector workers marched on the Colombian capital on Wednesday,
clogging arteries and jamming Bogota's main square in defiance of
President Andres Pastrana, who says giving in to union demands
would imperil the economy.
	   Marchers from the provinces, arriving in more than 300 buses,
added to the masses who peacefully converged on Bolivar Plaza,
waving the Colombian flag, shouting anti-government slogans,
carrying placards and paralyzing downtown traffic.
	   ``The government is more concerned with the peace process and
guerrillas than with listening to a part of the public that isn't
armed,'' striking teacher Luz Garcia said of Pastrana's policy
priority of establishing a peace dialogue with leftist rebels.
	   A midday rain shower drenched marchers and helmeted riot police
who ringed the square as strike leaders delivered speeches from the
steps of Congress, vowing to continue the walkout until their
demands are met.
	   The week-old strike, which has hobbled essential services, is
the first major political test of the conservative president's
two-month-old administration.
	   ``We have a country unnecessarily and unjustly in convulsion, ''
Labor Minister Fernando Yepes said in a radio interview Wednesday.
The stoppage and related slowdowns have canceled classes for
millions of students, shut down courts, limited hospitals to
emergency services and caused extensive delays at some airports.
	   Union leaders representing more than 650,000 workers stormed out
of negotiations on Tuesday night after Pastrana, in a national
television and radio address, aggressively defended his refusal to
offer concessions that he said would aggravate a budget deficit
that has already reached 4.8 percent of gross domestic product.
	   ``We are not going to give in to unattainable demands that
endanger the country's economic integrity,'' said Pastrana. He
portrayed the strikers as a selfish and unpatriotic minority and
accused the unions of stacking picket lines with ``human walls'' of
pregnant women and children.
	   The rancor was aggravated Tuesday as striking workers and
security forces scuffled in Bogota and the north-central city of
Barrancabermeja, where the state-owned oil company Ecopetrol has
its main refinery, over strikers' refusal to admit other employees
into workplaces.
	   The strikers are protesting a protesting a government austerity
package that cuts public sector spending and reduces wage increases
next year to an average of 14 percent. Union leaders insist on
salary increases at least in line with Colombia's 18 percent
inflation, and an end to plans to privatize state industries.
	   Pastrana says the belt-tightening is needed to correct for the
fiscal excesses of prior governments, but the unions say they
shouldn't be made to pay for those mistakes.
	   ``We know the situation is bad, but we're not the guilty ones.
We're not responsable for all the embezzlement this country has
had, '' said 31-year-old teacher Eulisias Casavillegos, who came
175 miles (280 km) from eastern Casanare state to join the
protesters in Bogota.

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Luxembourg police detained around 80 English
fans for fighting and drunkenness Wednesday but avoided a repeat of
the violent rampages that shocked this tiny nation the last two
times the England played here.
	   Riot police held dozens of ticketless English fans who tried to
fight their way into the stadium where their team beat Luxembourg
3-0 in a Euro 2000 qualifier.
	   Another 40 fans detained earlier spent the match sobering up in
jail, and 20 drunks and known hooligans were intercepted in Belgium
and sent home.
	   About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high
alert throughout the day, outnumbered by about 2,500 English soccer
fans who poured into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy.
	   The last two visits of England here in 1977 and 1983 were marred
by crowd violence, when hooligans vandalized Josy Barthel national
stadium and then rampaged through the streets, demolishing cars and
storefronts.
	   On Tuesday, two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels
airport in neighboring Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because
their names were on police lists of known hooligans. Six were sent
back to England, the rest were to be expelled by the end of the
day, Lt. Eric Froidmont of the Belgian gendarmes said.
	   Before the match, police in Luxembourg said they had arrested 25
drunken fans in the capital and on the border with Belgium. Police
spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd be released after the
game.
	   Police sealed off streets around the stadium, and were only
letting ticket holders past their barriers. Lindenlaub said there
was no major trouble before the game.
	   So far this year, a trail of destruction has followed the
English team. In France, riots with locals, particularly North
African youths in the port city of Marseille, erupted during the
World Cup. Violence again marred England's European qualifier with
Sweden in Stockholm last month when the Swedes won 2-1 and fans
began tearing apart a section of Rasunda Stadium.
	   In Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 fitted between France,
Belgium and Germany, police have warned shopkeepers in the capital
of possible violence and many planned to close their shops early.
	   ``You can see there are fewer people in town, they've afraid to
come downtown,'' said Isilda Moreira in her smart fashion store.
``We all know this lot are more aggressive than other supporters.''
	   Moreira was keeping her store open as usual, but the next-door
grocers had the shutters down with and a handwritten sign in the
window ``Closed because of the soccer.''
	   England already is 0-1-1 in European qualifying and another
disappointment against the amateurs from Luxembourg would have a
devastating effect.
	   Fears are the English fans could take it out on the town.
	   Police have long prepared for the encounter. Cooperation with
the border authorities in Belgium and France was increased and a
half dozen spotters from British police will accompany the fans.
	   After the match, the fans who came by train could have to sit
out the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport will be
available until the morning.

	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ Chi Chi Rodriguez, one of the most
popular regulars on the Senior PGA Tour, underwent a successful
angioplasty operation after suffering chest pains, his agent said
Wednesday.
	   Rodriguez, 62, had what he thought was severe indigestion
Tuesday while preparing to play in the Raley's Gold Rush Classic
senior tournament, which begins Friday at Serrano Country Club in
nearby El Dorado Hills.
	   He went to a doctor, who found a partially blocked artery, said
a statement by Eddie Elias Enterprises Inc. of Akron, Ohio.
	   ``The doctors performed a successful angioplasty procedure and
Chi Chi is resting comfortably and doing well'' at a Sacramento
hospital, said the statement.

Will a luxury tax work? NBA taking a long look
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association's
negotiating team spent Wednesday studying the union's luxury tax
proposal to see if it will actually slow the growth of player
salaries.
	   Plugging in the numbers, one thing quickly became clear: As
presently constituted, the formula would produce only a trickle of
``tax revenue.''
	   ``We are going to examine every element of this tax to see
whether under some circumstance, at the right levels and in the
right amounts, a tax could work,'' commissioner David Stern said.
	   If the owners latch onto the concept and adopt the tax system in
a counterproposal Friday, it could signal that the sides have found
an acceptable mechanism for solving the biggest rift between them _
a new economic operating system for the next collective bargaining
agreement.
	   The lockout is now 3 1/2 months old, and the league took the
unprecedented step Tuesday of canceling the first two weeks of the
season.
	   Both sides are awaiting a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick on
the union's grievance over whether more than 200 players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   Feerick's decision, which could have a major impact on the
negotiations, is due by Sunday.
	   The union made its tax proposal Tuesday, indicating to owners
that they are willing to give ground to get the season started. The
tax would theoretically be a deterrent against owners signing their
own free agents to overly lucrative long-term contracts.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the tax proposal
was far from a breakthrough, yet they seemed surprised nonetheless
that the union was offering a way to control superstar salaries.
	   ``Amongst the players who came into town and spent a couple of
days here, I think there was a sense on their part that they were
making a new offer that was different and might be designed to make
some progress,'' Stern said. ``We want to make sure that we've
analyzed it every possible way to show our good faith here.''
	   Under the union's offer, a 50 percent tax would be levied on the
amount of any annual salary over dlrs 18 million, with the tax
money to be redistributed to low-revenue teams.
	   Of all the players currently under contract for the upcoming
season, only one _ union president Patrick Ewing _ has a salary
that exceeds the proposed threshold. Ewing is due to make dlrs 18.5
million, meaning dlrs 500,000 of his salary would qualify for the
50 percent tax.
	   Last season, only Ewing (dlrs 20.5 million) and Jordan (dlrs 33
million) had salaries that would have triggered the tax.
	   Clearly, a middle ground would need to be found to make a tax
palatable to the owners.
	   ``The numbers are negotiable,'' union attorney Jeffrey Kessler
said.
	   One thing a luxury tax might not do is reduce the amount of
basketball-related income being devoted to player salaries.
	   In the last labor agreement reached in 1995, the owners agreed
to pay the players between 48 percent and 51.8 percent of revenues.
If the percentage went higher _ and owners claim it reached 57
percent last season _ they had the right to toss out the old deal.
	   Owners have proposed a hard salary cap that would reduce that
number to 48 percent over four years, while the union has proposed
two cap-tightening measures if the number rose to 63 percent.
	   Stern indicated that the owners might accept a luxury tax
proposal if it included a fall-back provision that included a hard
cap. That way, if the tax system wasn't keeping salary costs down,
another system would kick in to ensure cost certainty.

Padres down Braves 5-0 to advance to World Series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's game &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The surprising San Diego Padres reached the World
Series for the first time since 1984, shutting down the Atlanta
Braves' comeback bid behind MVP Sterling Hitchcock for a 5-0
victory Wednesday in Game 6 of the National League championship
series.
	   The Braves had won two in a row, fueling speculation they might
become the first team in baseball history to overcome an 0-3
deficit in the postseason. But the Padres won the series 4-2,
wrecking that plan with a five-run sixth inning off Tom Glavine as
October hero Jim Leyritz drove in the go-ahead run.
	   Now it's the Padres, given little chance at the start of the
playoffs, who will travel to meet the New York Yankees in Game 1 of
the World Series on Saturday night.
	   For Tony Gwynn, at 38 the last remaining member from the Padres'
only other trip to the Series _ a five-game wipeout by Detroit _
the win meant his first-ever visit to Yankee Stadium. The
eight-time batting champion contributed two hits in the clincher.
	   For the Braves, the loss meant the end to yet another
disappointing year. Despite having reached the postseason a record
seven straight times, they have just one World Series championship
to show for it _ with 106 victories, they are the winningest team
to fail to reach the Series.
	   Hitchcock, forced to move up a day in the rotation because of
Kevin Brown's relief appearance in Game 5, again came through. Just
9-7 in the regular season and with a history of pitching poorly on
three days' rest, improved to 3-0 with a 1.13 ERA in postseason
wins over Houston's Randy Johnson and Atlanta's Greg Maddux and
Glavine.
	   Hitchcock, a former Yankees starter, allowed only two hits in
five innings and struck out eight. Leading 5-0, he left after a
pair of leadoff walks to start the sixth and then Brian Boehringer
_ also formerly of the Yankees _ relieved and got three quick outs.
	   With the game scoreless, Glavine and the Braves ruined
themselves in the sixth.
	   The inning began innocently enough when Gwynn grounded out. Greg
Vaughn, back in the starting lineup for the first time since
leaving the opener because of a strained left quadriceps, singled
and ran to third when Ken Caminiti grounded a broken-bat single
through the vacant hole on the right side.
	   Up stepped Leyritz, whose three-run homer for the Yankees in
Game 4 of the 1996 World Series at Atlanta sent them on to the
title. He didn't hit the ball out of the park, though his RBI
groundout put the Padres ahead.
	   Wally Joyner followed with a single and Glavine pitched around
No. 8 hitter Chris Gomez, loading the bases with a two-out walk.
Hitchcock hit a low liner that seemed to confuse Danny Bautista,
and the left fielder got a bad break in toward the ball.
	   Bautista made a late dive and it was no good. The ball clanged
off his glove and the Braves could only watch as two runners
scored. That finished Glavine, and Quilvio Veras greeted John
Rocker with an RBI single for a 5-0 lead.
	   The big inning quieted the crowd of 50,988, which had come
hoping the Braves could force a Game 7 showdown between Maddux and
Brown. The Padres relied on their strong bullpen to close it out
the combined two-hitter, with relief ace Trevor Hoffman getting the
final three outs.
	   Having already beaten Houston (102 wins) and Atlanta (106), the
98-win Padres will try to do it again against the Yankees, who set
an American League record with 114 victories.
	   With a combined 212 wins, the Yankees and Padres have the most
victories among World Series opponents. The previous mark was 210
by Baltimore (108) and Cincinnati (102) in 1970.

Japan's August current account surplus up for 17th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again,
climbing 43.6 percent in August from a year ago, the government
announced Thursday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.158 trillion yen (dlrs 9.73 billion) in August, up 43.6
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise marked the 17th consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Economist Amartya Sen, a native of India, won
the Nobel Prize on Wednesday for work that studies the world's poor
and suggests new ways that governments can help them.
	   Sen's work incorporates factors such as income distribution and
health in measuring poverty. He analyzes the causes of catastrophes
such as famines, and offers ways to include the very poor in
evaluating a nation's overall economic situation.
	   Sen, who was visiting Manhattan on Wednesday, said he was
thrilled that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards
the prize, at long last acknowledged his field.
	   It ``gives recognition to problems of poverty and equality and
in general the interests of the people placed at the downside of
the economy,'' said the 64-year-old master at Britain's Trinity
College in Cambridge.
	   Economists agreed that the field has long been overlooked.
	   The usual indicators of a nation's well-being, such as gross
national product or majority rule, are not enough, they said.
	   ``Just looking at GNP or GNP growth for a country like India
might not be a very good way to say, `Is the development plan of
the country really helping people?''' said Jerry Hausman, economics
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
	   ``Being able to look at the numbers in different ways and think
about it is very helpful,'' he said.
	   Sen said GNP, which looks at a nation's aggregate income,
``overlooks the fact that many people are terribly poor. We have to
pay attention to the downside of what's happening and not just the
average, majority position,'' he said.
	   Sen developed alternative indexes which also include income
distribution, among other factors.
	   He worked with the theory of ``social choice'' _ how different
individuals' welfare is affected by collective decisions. The
Academy said in announcing the prize, ``By combining tools from
economics and philosophy, he has restored an ethical dimension to
the discussion of vital economic problems.''
	   Robert Eisner, past president of the American Economic
Association and professor emeritus at Northwestern University,
said, ``Poverty and hunger and the distribution of income in the
world ... have been all too much neglected by the top economists,
who seem to frequently do what is eventually useful work but
(doesn't) tie that much to the problems facing masses of people.''
	   Sen learned he won the dlrs 963,000 prize hours after arriving
in New York to attend a memorial service for former Pakistani
Finance Minister Mahbub ul Haq, a longtime friend who died in July
of pneumonia.
	   Joseph Duncan, a former U.S. government economist and current
chief economic adviser to Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp., said Sen's choice
was an interesting contrast to last year's winners, Americans
Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, whose work generally benefited the
rich.
	   The Americans were honored for their work on valuing risky
``derivatives'' investments such as stock options, but came under a
cloud last month after the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund in
which they were partners.
	   Sen's interest in the dynamics of famine was spurred by his
memories of India's famine in 1943, when he 9. ``It was rumored
then that the food supply was not very low,'' Sen said,
``nevertheless a famine occurred.'' His own family was not
affected, he said.
	   In 1981 book, Sen wrote that famines are not caused only by food
shortages but sometimes result from distribution problems _ like
the ones many African nations experienced in the late 1980s and
early 1990s _ and simple economics.
	   ``Famines can occur even when the food supply is high but people
can't buy the food because they don't have the money,'' Sen said.
	   He found that famines never occur in democracies because
government leaders are held accountable by the public, through
elections and a free press.
	   ``The absence of democracy is not just a violation of human
rights and political liberty,'' Sen told reporters at the United
Nations. ``It's also a major violation of people's security in the
most basic sense _ the security of survival.''
	   And he discusses how to prevent famine or limit its effects.
	   Before moving to Britain, Sen was a professor of economics and
philosophy at Harvard, where he still has an office and remains a
professor emeritus.
	   ``He is a wonderful man and a very serious and profound scholar
who has in a quite unique way combined philosophy and economics,''
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard
economics professor, said in an interview on C-Span.
	   The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the
will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite.
It was created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central
bank. Prizes in chemistry and physics were given earlier this week.
	   The last Nobel to be given _ the peace prize _ will be awarded
Friday.
	   The winners will receive their prizes Dec. 10, the anniversary
of Nobel's death.

Finally, Gwynn is going back to the World Series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Tony Gwynn is going back to the World Series, and
he's taking a whole new cast of San Diego Padres with him.
	   Gwynn is the only player left from the 1984 Padres team that
rallied from two down in the best-of-5 National Hockey League
championship series against the Chicago Cubs for the franchise's
first pennant. He made the final out as the Detroit Tigers won the
World Series in five games, and has been trying to get back ever
since.
	   Gwynn had two singles in the Padres' 5-0 win over the Atlanta
Braves on Wednesday that clinched the NL championship series 4-2
and put the Padres in the World Series against the New York
Yankees.
	   ``This is a great day for us,'' he said. ``We really stepped
up.''
	   Gwynn, 38, has never been to Yankee Stadium, but the Padres'
team bus circled it twice this year when the driver got lost trying
to get them from Shea Stadium to the airport.
	   Gwynn was coming off his first batting title in 1984, and he's
since won seven more to tie Honus Wagner's NL record of eight. He
had 148 hits this season to push his career total to 2,928.
	   Gwynn was bothered by nagging injuries this season and hit .321,
which would be great for most major leaguers but sub-par for Gwynn,
a lifetime .339 hitter.
	   The sweet-swinging lefty has often said that he'd give back all
those batting titles for another chance to win a World Series ring,
and now he's got it in the twilight of his career.
	   Gwynn's 1984 teammates included Goose Gossage, Steve Garvey and
Graig Nettles. Others on that team were Bruce Bochy, now the
manager; Tim Flannery, now the third base coach; and Greg Booker,
the bullpen coach.
	   His current teammates include Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley, Trevor
Hoffman and Wally Joyner, all going to the Series for the first
time.
	   Kevin Brown is going back for the second straight year, and Jim
Leyritz gets to face the team he helped steer toward the '96 World
Series championship with his dramatic homer off Atlanta's Mark
Wohlers in Game 4.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks resumed their rebound Wednesday after a
one-day setback, as the early rush of company reports on the third
quarter remained generally encouraging. The Dow Jones industrial
average swung from an early 60-point drop to a 110-point gain, but
finished just 30.64 points _ or 0.4 percent _ higher at 7,968.78
thanks to a late pullback. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chief executive of the International
Monetary Fund said Wednesday there should be a slight improvement
in global economic fortunes next year spearheaded by Europe and the
United States. Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, predicted
world growth of around 2.5 percent in 1999, creeping up from the
recently revised-down figure for this year of 2 percent. The IMF
chief told reporters that Europe and the United States _ ``the two
motors of the world economy'' _ were still going strong, despite
some slowdown in America and Great Britain. He said Asia should be
able to keep its economic head just above water, avoiding negative
growth next year. (SPAIN-IMF)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq aims to produce up to 6 million
barrels of oil a day after the U.N. sanctions are lifted, but the
ambitious plan requires at least dlrs 30 billion investments, an
Oil Ministry study says. The study said it will take five years
after the sanctions end to achieve the target that will make Iraq
the second largest oil producer in the world after Saudi Arabia,
which extracts 8 million barrels a day. Foreign firms have already
been invited to develop ``ten super-giant oil fields'' as part of
the government plan to boost production, said the study. A copy was
obtained by The Associated Press Wednesday. (IRAQ-OIL)
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada is using its first budget surplus since
1970 to reduce the national debt rather than cut taxes or boost
spending, Finance Minister Paul Martin said Wednesday. Martin,
making an annual fall economic report to Parliament, said the
cautious approach was warranted because of the global economic
turmoil. He said the government came out ahead by 3.5 billion
Canadian dollars (dlrs 2.25 billion) in the last fiscal year. The
surplus has been applied to the national debt, which stood at 579.7
billion Canadian dollars (dlrs 375 billion). ``This marks the first
time in 28 years that Canada has actually paid down the debt,''
Martin told the House of Commons finance committee.
(CANADA-ECONOMY)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Securities Exchange, once
hailed as a symbol of fledgling Palestinian independence, faces
collapse after only 20 months of operation, the managing director
said Wednesday. Trading has dropped sharply since the start of the
year because investors have lost confidence and because the
Palestinian Authority has failed to pass the necessary regulations,
said the managing director, Safwan Bataineh, a Wall Street veteran
and former economic adviser to Jordanian prime ministers. ``If this
continues, the stock market will collapse because companies are
losing money,'' Bataineh told The Associated Press.
(PALESTINIAN-STOCK EXCHANGE)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Wednesday
effectively torpedoed a controversial plan to negotiate
liberalizing international investment, saying France will skip
long-delayed talks next week. He called for a different venue.
Negotiations were due to resume next Tuesday at the Paris
headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Talks had been stalled for six months, chiefly at the
insistence of the French, while a new basis for an accord could be
hammered out behind the scenes. Jospin told lawmakers the talks on
the Multilateral Agreement on Investment should be shifted to the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization, as Canada has suggested.
(FRANCE-TRADE)
	   CUPERTINO, California (AP) _ Apple Computer Corp. reported its
first profitable fiscal year since 1995, as sales of its new iMAC
helped the rebounding computer company earn a healthy dlrs 106
million in its fourth quarter. The company's earnings released
Wednesday translated to 68 cents per diluted share, in the quarter
ended Sept. 25, compared to a loss of dlrs 161 million, or dlrs
1.26 per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue
fell to dlrs 1.56 billion from dlrs 1.61 billion. (US-EARNS-APPLE)

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A tabloid story about a haircut-gone-bad for
14-year-old Prince Harry has his father threatening a complaint to
press watchdogs.
	   The Mirror said Wednesday on the front page that Harry and his
Eton classmates tried to copy soccer player Michael Owen's short
haircut, but something went wrong and the prince wound up with a
Marine-style crop.
	   The paper included computer-generated images of how ``Harry the
skinhead'' might look.
	   Sandy Henney, Prince Charles' spokeswoman, said the story and
pictures ``raise a general issue about the extent to which
individual news stories about Prince William and Prince Harry
cumulatively constitute an intrusion into their privacy.''
	   Mirror editor Piers Morgan said the paper told Charles' office
about the story Tuesday. The office ``agreed with our belief that
it was both amusing and harmless and provided us with official
confirmation.''
	   Charles has been extremely protective of his sons' privacy since
their mother died in a car crash 14 months ago.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Al Pacino has taken to the dusty streets of
Arab towns to film ``Man of the People.''
	   Pacino, on the set Tuesday and Wednesday, plays a producer of
the U.S. television news show ``60 Minutes'' who interviews a
leader of the guerrilla organization Hezbollah, the daily Yediot
Ahronot reported.
	   When plans for filming in Lebanon fell through, mostly Arab
towns in Israel were chosen instead.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A signed lithograph of a painting by
Prince Charles fetched 53,000 pounds (dlrs 90,000) at a charity
auction Wednesday for the victims of the worst terrorist strike in
Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict.
	   The sale at Dublin's National Concert Hall raised more than
150,000 pounds (dlrs 255,000) for the victims of the car bomb
planted Aug. 15 in the town of Omagh by a splinter Irish Republican
Army group dubbed the Real IRA. Twenty-nine people died and 370
were injured.
	   Northern Ireland businesswoman Agnes McCourt bought Charles'
lithograph, one of 15 reproductions of a 1995 watercolor of Windsor
Castle, to hang in her office. She said she ``fancied having one of
the prince's pictures.''
	   A work by Louis le Brocquy, one of Ireland's leading artists,
was sold for 21,000 pounds (dlrs 36,000).
	   The money will go to Omagh's Tyrone County Hospital, which
treated most of the victims.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket team manager Steve
Bernard has been severely reprimanded over a photograph of him and
two players wielding rifles alongside Pakistani border troops.
	   The Australian newspaper said the Australian Cricket Board had
reprimanded Bernard over the photograph and he had apologized.
	   ``I deeply regret the image portrayed by the photograph and
apologize unreservedly for my actions,'' the newspaper quoted
Bernard as saying.
	   ACB chairman Denis Rogers said the images depicted in the
photograph did not conform with the values of the Australian
cricket team.
	   ``The actions of the group were naive and ill-considered and
offensive to the wider Australian community,'' Rogers said.
	   The photo, which shows Bernard and players Justin Langer and
Gavin Robertson with assault rifles, has outraged the antigun lobby
in Australia, which has called for Bernard's resignation.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SKUKUZA, South Africa (AP) _ Kruger National Park on Wednesday
said it was cracking down on visitors who litter, feed animals,
speed or leave their cars.
	   Violators would be fined up to 1,500 rand (dlrs 250) or face
possible prison terms.
	   The crackdown came after ``numerous complaints from our regular
visitors,'' park management said.
	   Traffic officers, game rangers and plain-clothed security
personnel would be on the lookout. Prison terms were not specified.
	   ``Reckless behavior endangers the animals and has a negative
impact on the environment and to our other visitors' enjoyment,''
management said.
	   The park, which covers 21,497 square kilometers (8,598 square
miles) or an area the size of Israel, is one of South Africa's main
tourist sites and attracts some 700,000 visitors a year.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Counting down toward its Kosovo
deadline, NATO warned on Wednesday that Slobodan Milosevic isn't
doing what he must to avoid airstrikes and ethnic Albanian refugees
voiced reluctance to return home out of fear of Serb forces. Even
as the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys, there was much
doubt the Yugoslav president would meet demands and stop
hostilities toward ethnic Albanians. Demonstrating that it's not
taking him at his word, NATO positioned warplanes at bases in Italy
for possible air attacks on Serbia. ``NATO airstrikes have not yet
been averted by Milosevic,'' said an official at the alliance's
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, speaking on condition of
anonymity. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Heading to the United States for a
crucial Mideast peace summit, Yasser Arafat said Wednesday he was
optimistic, and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu said he would work
toward agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal. The two men will
meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington Thursday, then
head to a secluded conference center in eastern Maryland for talks.
Clinton has been pushing the sides to end months of stalemate by
completing an agreement based on a U.S. initiative for Israel to
withdraw troops from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
detailed Palestinian measures to fight terrorism. Netanyahu is
under intense pressure from Israel's right-wing camp which opposes
ceding land to the Palestinians. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Wole Soyinka, the Nobel laureate and
outspoken junta critic who fled Nigeria four years ago, returned
Wednesday to his home country, where hundreds of singing supporters
welcomed him back. ``Welcome our king, we have been waiting for
you,'' the crowd of about 500 people sang in Yoruba, one of
Nigeria's main languages, as they pressed toward him. Soyinka, who
said he was home on a short visit, appeared to try to speak to the
crowd, but the noise made that impossible and he was escorted to a
car. Later, he visited the house of Moshood Abiola, the Nigerian
millionaire turned opposition leader who died in custody in July.
With reporters and photographers jammed into the Abiola living room
with him, Soyinka told Abiola's family they ``are a source of
inspiration to Nigerians.'' (NIGERIA-SOYINKA)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Economist Amartya Sen, a native of India, won
the Nobel Prize on Wednesday for work that studies the world's poor
and suggests new ways that governments can help them. Sen's work
incorporates factors such as income distribution and health in
measuring poverty. He analyzes the causes of catastrophes such as
famines, and ways to include the very poor in evaluating a nation's
overall economic situation. Sen, who was visiting New York on
Wednesday, said he was thrilled that the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences, which awards the prize, had finally acknowledged his
field. It ``gives recognition to problems of poverty and equality
and in general the interests of the people placed at the downside
of the economy,'' said the 64-year-old master at Britain's Trinity
College in Cambridge. (NOBEL-ECONOMICS)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ With pleasantries and a few barbed
comments typical of their long estrangement, rivals China and
Taiwan held their highest level meeting in five years Wednesday and
edged closer to resuming ruptured talks. Koo Chen-fu and Wang
Daohan _ elder statesmen charged with shepherding Taiwan-China ties
in the absence of formal channels _ hugged, smiled and said the
lapse since their first and only meeting in Singapore in 1993 gave
them much to talk about. Aides said the two octogenarians noted
that the ``peaceful atmosphere'' was conducive to frank talks. But
the two then restated divisive positions. Koo urged communist-run
China to learn from Taiwan's robust democracy. Wang demanded
ambitious negotiations to tackle reunification. The two were to
chat again Thursday, then attend an opera together. (CHINA-TAIWAN)

Student dies after U.S. Marine indicted for hit-and-run accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An 18-year-old high school student has died from
injuries sustained in a hit-and-run accident on the southern
Japanese island of Okinawa for which a U.S. Marine has been
indicted, local police said Thursday.
	   Yuki Uema, a high school junior, was struck by a car on Oct. 17.
She died at 10:10 p.m. (13:10 GMT) Wednesday at a hospital in
Okinawa city, said local police spokesman Yukinori Shima.
	   U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, is believed to have
been the driver of a car that hit the small motorcycle being driven
by Uema.
	   Eskridge was charged Tuesday with causing injury through
negligence, driving under the influence of alcohol and leaving the
scene of an accident by Japanese prosecutors in Naha.
	   Naha, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is the
capital of Okinawa, where Eskridge was based.
	   The accident occurred on a highway near the young woman's home
in the city of Ginowan.
	   Police suspect that a second car also hit the young woman after
the first collision, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported.
	   There long has been friction between U.S. troops and local
residents of the island because of crime, noise and other nuisances
blamed on the presence of American bases.
	   Tensions reached a peak in 1995 after a 12-year-old girl was
assaulted and raped by three U.S. servicemen.
	   Under the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States
and Japan, Eskridge was handed over to Japanese authorities on
Tuesday. The agreement outlines what is to be done with military
personal suspected of crimes in Japan.
	   Marine Corps officials reported the incident to Japanese
authorities after they apprehended Eskridge on suspicion he had
fled the scene of the accident.
	   Eskridge was stopped by a gate guard as he tried to enter a
military facility. The guard noticed unusual damage to the front of
his car, including a cracked windshield.
	   A second Marine who was in the car with Eskridge was questioned
by local police and released.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley called on Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura after the accident to express condolences to Uema's
family.

An Els, Woods showdown looms in semifinals

	   VIRGINIA, WATER, England (AP) _ Ernie Els won three straight
World Match Play Championships before he was stopped in the finals
a year ago by Vijay Singh.
	   If form holds, he'll meet Tiger Woods in Saturday's semifinals
Is Els relishing the pairing?
	   ``No, not really,'' said Els, flashing a smile. ``I wouldn't say
I'm running scared or anything, but he's a very good match player
and tough to beat.''
	   This is Woods' first appearance in the 12-man, 36-hole-per-day
event and, like Singh, Els and Florida neighbor Mark O'Meara, he
has a first-round bye Thursday with a spot in Friday's
quarterfinals guaranteed.
	   Woods is sure to draw large galleries from nearby London and _
like O'Meara _ is lucky to have Thursday off. They're both taking
antibiotics and fighting the flu after arriving in soggy Britain
for last week's Dunhill Cup in Scotland.
	   In Thursday's first round, Steve Stricker faced Patrik Sjoland,
Colin Montgomerie was up against Thomas Bjorn, Lee Westwood played
Stuart Appleby and Darren Clarke squared off with Ian Woosnam.
	   ``Eight rounds in four days is a lot of golf on this kind of
golf course where it's wet and soft,'' Woods said. ``Only playing
six rounds is a distinct advantage, no doubt about it.''
	   Well or not, Woods is the No. 1 player in the world and,
although the rankings are based on stroke play, he's up there in
match play, too.
	   ``I had the flu at Disney (1996) with a 102 degree fever and I
shot 66 to win the tournament,'' he said. ``When I got home my
fever was 104.2.
	   ``Anybody who is sick usually plays well,'' he added. ``You
conserve yourself a little bit better, you expect less of yourself.
When you're sick, you often see guys with their best rounds.''
	   Woods should like the 7,006-yard West Course at Wentworth. The
wet fairways are making the course play longer and the flat, soft
greens should make for U.S.-style target golf. And match play seems
to suit him _ particularly with the 36-hole format, meaning a bad
stretch isn't disastrous.
	   ``I do consider myself a good match-play player with my history
of winning six USGA titles. That's not too bad,'' Woods said.
	   ``I like the one-on-one, the head-to-head,'' he added. ``In
professional golf you don't get this chance very often. There are
only a couple per year where you go head-to-head in match play.''
	   Woods is also playing well lately. He was 14 under in three
rounds in the Dunhill Cup despite missing a 4-foot putt in the
semifinals to eliminate the United States.
	   ``I'm hitting the ball better than I have for most of the year
and putting great,'' he said. ``So things aren't going too bad for
me.''
	   Els is again a favorite, although he said his game ``isn't quite
where it was last year.'' The smooth-swinging South African won
three straight ('94, '95, '96) and lost to Singh in last year's
final.
	   ``I've been in the finals four straight times and I don't want
to let go,'' he said. ``I've had a good run on this course and in
this tournament.''
	   Els will face either Westwood or Appleby in the quarterfinals
with Woods looming in the semifinals. Woods faces either Clarke or
two-time winner Woosnam in the quarters.
	   In the other bracket, Singh will face either Stricker or Sjoland
in the quarterfinals with O'Meara getting the Montgomerie-Bjorn
winner.

Tyson says he doesn't believe he'll get boxing license

	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson said he
isn't confident he'll get back his boxing license. His doubts,
however, aren't keeping him from preparing for a possible fight
this year.
	   For the last two weeks, Tyson has been training in a gym near
downtown Phoenix awaiting a Nevada State Athletic Commission
decision whether to allow him to resume boxing. Other states have
been honoring the license revocation.
	   ``I don't think they are going to give me back my license, to be
honest,'' Tyson said after a workout Wednesday. ``I'm not sure of
anything, especially anything nice happening to me.
	   ``Some of the great fighters and great trainers and many of
these great people in boxing can't even get their names in the
paper unless they mention my name.''
	   His license was suspended after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears
during a June 1997 heavyweight championship fight.
	   Many in the industry questioned whether Tyson's mental state was
sufficiently stable for him to remain in boxing. Tyson also has
served time in prison for rape and allegedly attacked two people in
Maryland this summer.
	   Tyson signed autographs for a small group of people Wednesday
before entering the gym with his entourage for a few hours of
training.
	   The five-member Nevada commission will hold a hearing on Tyson's
revoked license on Monday. The commissioners are expected to cast
their final votes that day as well, said Marc Ratner, the
commission's executive director.
	   ``There certainly has been no prejudice whatsoever,'' Ratner
said, declining comment on what Tyson said Wednesday. ``He will
have a fair and equitable hearing.''
	   Tyson, 31, ignored questions seeking his comment on Tuesday's
release of a psychiatric report by the commission which concluded
he suffers from a ``constellation of neurobehavioral deficits'' but
is mentally fit to return to the ring.
	   Nevertheless, Tyson said ``I feel great'' and called Phoenix
``extremely positive. I don't want to be anyplace else.''
	   Stacy McKinley, one of Tyson's trainers, said he suggested Tyson
work out in Phoenix, selecting Madison Square Garden Gym two blocks
away from the governor's office.
	   ``It's an old, throwback-type of gym that Mike was brought up
in. It's not a fancy-type gym,'' McKinley said.
	   Tyson has been training five or six days a week.
	   ``I think he'll be here for a couple of months. He likes the
town, he likes the gym and the people are kind to him,'' McKinley
said. ``He is in good shape. He'll be ready for his fight.''
	   Richard Rodriguez, who runs the gym, said it's an honor to have
Tyson and doesn't care about the former champ's past. ``We are all
human and we all make mistakes,'' he said.
	   Rodriguez said he's trying to secure Tyson's permission to
rename the gym ``Mike Tyson's Youth Center.''

Mysterious black magic murders shake crisis-ridden Indonesia

	   BANYUWANGI, Indonesia (AP) _ Lying in a hospital bed with his
teeth smashed and his body bruised, Rahmad could not understand how
he was caught up in a wave of attacks on Muslims accused of
witchcraft.
	   Two weeks ago, a mob dragged the screaming 21-year-old through
the streets, accusing his family of dabbling in black magic and
denouncing his father as an evil sorcerer.
	   ``I don't understand why mobs wanted to attack us,'' he said
from his bed, his abdomen and buttocks badly scraped. ``My father
is a Muslim and we are only poor peasants.''
	   Rahmad, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, was alone
in the house when the mob came. His family is said to have fled the
village.
	   He is among a growing number of victims of such attacks as a
string of eerie executions have occurred in recent months in
Banyuwangi, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) east of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   Witnesses and police say machete-wielding gangs dressed in black
have killed at least 153 people in nighttime raids. In scenes
reminiscent of the Salem witch hunts in 17th-century Massachusetts,
crowds have lynched suspected evil magicians.
	   On Monday, about 100 villagers attacked 55-year-old Haji Jajul
bin Suhaemi outside a mosque in Serang, a small town about 75 miles
(120 kilometers) west of Jakarta, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   Police said the crowd accused Jajul of being a sorcerer. Some
wanted to test him by immersing him in a pool of water. Others
couldn't wait and killed him with sticks and stones.
	   The surge in violence, which erupted as Indonesia grapples with
political turmoil and the worst economic crisis in decades, has
bewildered police and terrified villagers.
	   Looting and rioting that broke out after violent protests killed
about 1,200 people and helped drive former President Suharto from
office in May had usually targeted members of the mostly Christian
or Buddhist ethnic Chinese minority.
	   The new violence, however, is plaguing Indonesia's Muslim
majority. Amid the social confusion of the economic crisis _
skyrocketing inflation, unemployment, poverty and food shortages _
no one is sure who is doing the killing or why.
	   National police chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi has speculated that
the slayings might be in revenge for the slaughter of tens of
thousands of communists in the mid-1960s when Suharto took power.
	   Historians say Muslim clerics helped the army carry out the
carnage. With Suharto gone, many fear old scores are being settled.
	   Others believe the killings may represent a bloody power play
before general elections to be held next year under proposed
democratic reforms.
	   A third possibility is that some Muslim groups want to stamp out
ancient and lingering beliefs in mysticism that permeate Indonesia
hundreds of years after the arrival of Islam.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Nevertheless, some who regard themselves as devout Muslims often
worship spirits. Shamans are in high demand by those who want good
luck, a better love life, improved health or revenge against an
enemy or rival.
	   Whatever the cause, people are frightened.
	   Wardiyah, a 50-year-old mother of two in Banyuwangi, was
attacked in the dark by two men last Sunday.
	   ``They grabbed my hand and beat my neck, then stamped on me,''
she said, pointing to injuries on her shoulders, neck and arms.
	   A man named Salam was not so lucky. A neighbor said he was
hauled from his house, beaten with sticks and stamped to death.
	   Mobs demolished his tiny house, next to a small mosque where
Salam's family had prayed every day.
	   Many victims have been members of Indonesia's largest Islamic
organization, the 30 million-strong Nahdlatul Ulama. The group has
dismissed speculation that the attacks have anything to do with
retribution for the '60s and say they have more to do with the
current political turmoil.
	   Hundreds of people fear they might be targeted and have sought
police protection.
	   Haji Abdullah Misbach, a Muslim preacher and Nahdlatul Ulama
member, has twice narrowly escaped attack by masked groups.
Neighbors guard his house each night.
	   He has stayed at home for the past month, too frightened to go
out.
	   ``I'm scared that I am one of their targets,'' he said.
	   The military has promised to step up security in town and
villagers, but worried residents have already taken matters into
their own hands.
	   Vigilantes with sticks, swords and sickles patrol the otherwise
deserted streets of Banyuwangi. They guard alleys, watch the houses
of Muslim clerics and look out for mobs or strangers.
	   ``It's like a war now, so we have to be careful,'' said a
stick-bearing villager, Hadi Sucipto.

Zanardi looks for Australian win as Pruett defends title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ With Alex Zanardi moving to
Formula One next season to drive for Williams, the CART PPG Cup
series champion hopes to add the Honda Australian IndyCarnival
title to his 1998 portfolio before jumping circuits.
	   Zanardi, the 1996 rookie of the year, has already clinched the
1998 series title after winning six races this year and 14 in 49
starts for Target-Chip Ganassi Racing. He has amassed 250 points in
17 races this season, 102 more than second-place Jimmy Vasser.
	   On Sunday, Zanardi will try to make it 15 wins when he lines up
with defending champion Scott Pruett and former winners Michael
Andretti (1994), Paul Tracy (1995) and Jimmy Vasser (1996) on the
4.5-kilometer (2.794-mile) Surfers Paradise street circuit.
	   Zanardi, who arrived on the Gold Coast on Thursday, is only the
second driver to win rookie of the year and the PPG Cup in his
first two seasons, the other being Canadian Jacques Villeneuve.
	   Last year, Zanardi, who will celebrate his 32nd birthday next
Friday, was dueling for the lead with Tracy when the two collided
on lap 42 of the scheduled 65 laps, sending Tracy out of the race.
Pruett won the accident-shortened race over 57 laps by less than a
second over Canadian Greg Moore, with Zanardi fourth.
	   Pruett said fans could expect record lap times around the
circuit on Sunday.
	   ``Given everything else being equal . . . the engines are
better, the chassis produce more downforce and being that we get
the same amount of grip as we did last year, you will see
significantly faster speeds,'' Pruett said.
	   He also said coming off a street circuit in the last CART series
race at Houston would make it ``easier for the guys'' to adjust at
Surfers Paradise.
	   He is seventh in the CART series and said consecutive Australian
wins would be a tough proposition.
	   ``This is probably my favorite stop in the whole series and it
continues to be and so, hopefully, we can come away from here with
a repeat of last year.''
	   In August, Pruett announced he was leaving the Patrick Racing
team and has signed with the Toyota-backed Aciero-Wells Racing team
in 1999.
	   Toyota entered the CART series in 1996 but has failed to reach a
podium finish.
	   Scotsman Dario Franchitti is the form driver of late, winning
three of his past four races, including Houston. But Andretti likes
his chances in Australia.
	   ``This is a track where you have to be aggressive, a track you
can attack and that suits my style,'' said Andretti. (djp)

Hitchcock's postseason solid gold for Padres
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Sterling Hitchcock has had a solid-gold
postseason, and now he's going to the World Series.
	   First he beat Randy Johnson to get San Diego into the National
League championship series, then he won against a couple of other
former Cy Young winners, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, to help the
Padres reach their first World Series in 14 years.
	   Next up are the New York Yankees, who drafted Hitchcock in 1989
and traded him away in 1995 after his first full big league season.
	   Hitchcock, at 27 the youngest of the Padres starters, was voted
the NLCS most valuable player for his two victories against the
Braves.
	   He made the three biggest starts of his career in 11 days,
coming up with three wins and striking out 25. The latest was
Wednesday's 5-0 win over Atlanta to clinch the Padres' second NL
pennant in their 30-year history.
	   ``We ran into a buzz saw with him,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox
said. ``He really went through the middle of our lineup like he
knew what he was doing.''
	   Hitchcock was pitching on three days' rest for the fifth time in
his career, and the numbers from the previous four such starts
weren't good _ he was 0-2 with an 8.41 ERA. The last time he went
on short rest, May 4, 1998, he gave up four home runs to the
Montreal Expos.
	   ``Before, in the past, I haven't had a whole lot of luck on
three days,'' he said.
	   This time it was different, probably because it's the playoffs.
Ace Kevin Brown had been scheduled to make this start, but he threw
41 pitches in a surprise _ and losing _ relief appearance Monday
night, allowing Michael Tucker's go-ahead, three-run homer when the
Padres were just five outs away from the World Series.
	   As soon as Brown was pulled from Game 5, Hitchcock walked up to
pitching coach Dave Stewart in the dugout and told him he wanted
the ball for Game 6.
	   Once he got it, he was fabulous. He allowed just two singles in
five-plus scoreless innings, struck out eight and walked three,
including two straight opening the sixth that got him lifted for
reliever Brian Boehringer.
	   He also poked a ball into left field that bounced off Danny
Bautista's glove for an error, bringing in two runs in the five-run
sixth that chased Glavine.
	   The Braves got runners to third base twice, but neither scored.
	   In the second inning, Hitchcock walked Andres Galarraga, then
threw wild pitches to consecutive batters that moved the Big Cat to
third. With two outs, Hitchcock struck out Bautista.
	   With runners on first and third and two outs in the fourth, he
got Andruw Jones to pop up.
	   After walking Walt Weiss and Gerald Williams to open the sixth,
manager Bruce Bochy brought in Brian Boehringer, who was with the
Yankees when they beat the Braves in the 1996 World Series.
	   On Oct. 4, Hitchcock struck out 11 and beat Johnson and the
Houston Astros 6-1. In Game 3 of the NLCS on Saturday, he beat
Maddux and the Braves 4-1, striking out six and hitting a single
off Maddux to start the go-ahead rally in the fifth inning.
	   The Yankees traded Hitchcock to the Seattle Mariners in the deal
for Tino Martinez on Dec. 7, 1995, and the Padres got him 364 days
later for Scott Sanders. He was 10-11 with a 5.20 ERA in 1997, and
9-7 with a 3.93 ERA this year.

Abandoning the myth of perfection in medicine

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Dr. Steve Small of Massachusetts General Hospital
likes to see his fellow physicians make mistakes.
	   That's how he gets them talking.
	   The mistakes he sees occur in critical events staged in his
high-tech medical simulation lab for Boston-area doctors. The
project is part of a growing national movement in the United States
to abandon the myth of perfection in medicine, to try to stop
mistakes before they occur and to deal with the consequences of
mistakes.
	   Doctor errors include everything from failure to request a
follow-up culture to wrong-site surgery. Most are relatively minor
and do not affect the patient. But some result in permanent harm
and death.
	   Researchers at Harvard University released a study in 1993 that
estimated 1 million potentially preventable medical errors lead to
120,000 deaths each year.
	   The result is a wrenching story of human loss, sometimes
splashed over front pages, such as the death of Betsy Lehman, a
Boston Globe health columnist who died four years ago after she was
given too much of a chemotherapy drug.
	   What is not as often discussed is how all mistakes, including
minor ones that harm nobody, are potentially devastating to the
doctors involved, Small and his colleagues say.
	   Doctors are scarred by ``eidetic imagery'' from such events,
that is, moments that are vividly recalled and readily reproducible
in one's memory long after they have occurred.
	   Doctors can carry these events with them for their entire
careers, feeling a mixture of embarrassment, humiliation, guilt and
shock that extends long past the incident.
	   One doctor, then a resident in pediatrics, was performing a
routine blood transfusion for a baby. He mistakenly infused the
baby with packed red blood cells, thinking he was using fully
constituted blood. He failed to notice a bag of plasma, hanging
just behind the red blood cell bag, that should have been added.
	   He only realized his mistake when the baby began to turn gray.
Fortunately, a senior doctor arrived and promptly remedied the
situation.
	   Mistakes are inevitable in the practice of medicine, doctors
say, but the consequences of even small mistakes are often severe.
	   ``The energy of the organization is spent on perpetual
witch-hunting,'' says Dr. Don Berwick, who heads the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group in Boston.
	   The result is a culture of fear that makes it difficult for
hospitals to see past the individual and address more deeply rooted
causes of errors.
	   ``The culture is, `Let's keep this to ourselves,''' says Dr.
Harry Greene, vice president of the Massachusetts Medical Society.
``If you're going to turn it (a mistake) into anything positive,
you need to share.''
	   Dr. Lucian Leape, a Harvard researcher who is one of the world's
foremost experts on medical errors, says the focus on individuals
in error evaluation leaves medicine far behind other industries,
such as aviation and nuclear power, that understand the key to
prevention of errors lies at the system level.
	   The solution is not to berate doctors to try harder but to put
in place systems that will catch errors before they can harm a
patient, Leape says.
	   The myth of perfection has also set up doctors for an inevitable
fallout with patients.
	   Malpractice suits abound, often against doctors who have given
impeccable care to their patients.
	   ``It's easy to take it personally,'' says Small, an
anesthesiologist. ``You're standing in a white coat and in your
place of work, and you're handed a subpoena by a sheriff.''
	   Small's simulator program, which began in 1994, is his way of
chipping away at a culture from the inside. Since 1994, all Harvard
anesthesiology residents _ some 250 per year _ have gone through
his program. He wants to expand the program to include surgical and
emergency medicine residents.
	   Dr. Josh Bloomstone, an anesthesiologist at MGH, went through
the simulator when it first began.
	   Four years later, he can still outline the details of each
crisis scenario he went through, a tribute, he says, to the realism
of the simulator.
	   More important, he says, he remembers the debriefing that
followed.
	   ``There was no specific fingerpointing. No one was told they did
a horrible job. They focused in a really positive way,'' he says.
	   Small says the goal is not only to heighten doctors' ability to
handle crises but also to make them more vigilant in observing
system-level problems that might need changing.
	   ``It's easy to blame the person who made the last mistake,''
Small says. It's much more difficult, and painstaking, to review
the event step-by-step as they do in the simulator to see where the
system broke down.
	   There are signs that others in medicine are beginning to come
around.
	   The National Patient Safety Foundation, dedicated to addressing
medical errors, was established a year ago. It is one of several
organizations sponsoring a national conference in Rancho Mirage,
California, in November on medical mistakes.
	   In Massachusetts, a group of 20 medical organizations with a
similar mission has joined to create the Massachusetts Coalition
for the Prevention of Medical Errors.
	   Such programs can only help doctors who know, Small says, that
``some day, we'll all be patients.''

Biochemist says he's close to developing male contraceptive pill

<TEXT>
	   NORFOLK, Virginia (AP) _ Researcher Joseph C. Hall says he's
close to meeting the challenge his wife and the mother of his six
children gave him more than a decade ago: Invent a birth control
pill men can take.
	   The Norfolk State University biochemist has created a compound
that he said neutralizes sperm. Hall said he believes the compound,
in pill form or possibly a patch, could be on the market within
five years.
	   Such a pill would offer men an alternative to condoms, which can
inhibit sexual pleasure, or vasectomies, surgical procedures which
often are not reversible.
	   ``If you give them an option, they'll use it'' _ especially if
it's reversible, reliable and nontoxic, said Hall, 42, who arrived
at Norfolk State last year after teaching at North Carolina State
University in Raleigh.
	   Hall's work focuses on an enzyme that sperm use to detect and
fertilize eggs.
	   ``If you could find out what part of the sperm is the `eye,' you
could find a way to block it,'' said Hall, who works out of a
temporary lab in a trailer on campus. ``You essentially create a
blind sperm.''
	   In the fertilization process, a protein on a sperm latches onto
the sugary coating surrounding an egg by connecting with a protein
on the egg. That produces an enzyme that eats through the coating,
allowing the sperm to enter and fertilize the egg.
	   Hall's compound is similar to the egg coating and acts as a
decoy by binding to the enzyme. That prevents the enzyme from
attacking the egg coating, meaning fertilization can't take place.
	   Hall said he has had success rates of 92 to 98 percent in tests
on rats, with no apparent side effects.
	   ``That's a good approach,'' said Dr. Christina Wang, chairwoman
of the World Health Organization's Male Contraceptive Task Force
and manager of several studies on male contraception.
	   But Hall is looking at much more than five years before he could
market a pill because more research needs to be done, including
human trials, said Ms. Wang, of the Harbor-UCLA Research and
Education Institute in Torrance, California.
	   Fertility researcher and gynecologist Dr. Jaroslav Marik was
more skeptical. He said the compound could work if it targets only
the sperm enzyme without affecting enzymes in other body parts and
creating side effects. However, he isn't sure that's possible.
	   Even if Hall's work is successful, Marik doubts that there will
be much of a market for a male contraceptive pill.
	   ``It will have to compete against a pretty efficient medication
which already is available'' for women, said Marik, medical
director of the Tyler Medical Clinic, an infertility clinic in Los
Angeles. A male pill might be an option in those few instances when
a woman is unable to take birth control pills, he said.
	   Hall and other researchers, though, believe many men, especially
those in long-term, monogamous relationships, will be interested in
a contraceptive pill of their own.
	   ``It's a matter of sharing responsiblity and men accepting
responsibility for family planning and in general for reproductive
health,'' Ms. Wang said.
	   The availability of another contraceptive method could help
reduce the more than 3 million unwanted pregnancies annually in the
United States, said Nancy Alexander, a physiologist and associate
director of medical services at Organon Inc., of West Orange, New
Jersey, a subsidiary of the Dutch pharmaceutical company N.V.
Organon, which markets birth control pills.
	   ``The more contraceptive choices the better,'' said Ms.
Alexander. ``Male contraception wouldn't be for everyone, but then
no contraceptive is.''
	   Hall is doing further research to make his compound even more
effective, and he hopes to soon begin testing the pill on men.
	   His work has been funded by grants from the National Science
Foundation. To speed the research along, Hall has started his own
company, Innovative Reproductive Technologies, based in Virginia
Beach. Five scientists are working with him on the project.
	   Hall said many past and present attempts to find an effective
male contraceptive have involved trying to reduce sperm production
by manipulating hormone levels. They have been unsuccessful, he
said, because that can suppress the sex drive and affect secondary
sexual characteristics. For example, he said, a man could grow
breasts.
	   Hall said he believes his method will be more successful because
it disrupts the function of sperm, not its production.
	   A male pill will affect men's lives as much as the female pill
did for women, predicted Wayne Ferrell, a sex therapist and San
Diego-based author of ``Why Men Are the Way They Are.''
	   It will allow men the same control over conception that the pill
has long given women, Farrell said. ``The female birth control pill
took women away from biology being their destiny,'' he said. Until
men get their own pill, ``female biology is male destiny.''

Japanese stocks mixed, dollar lower against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices traded little changed early
Thursday as worry over the outlook for corporate profit growth
offset hope new legislation will stabilize the banking system. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 43.92 points,
or 0.34 percent, to 13,026.81 in the first hour of trading. On
Wednesday, it had fallen 172.06 points, or 1.30 percent.
	   But the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 0.15 points, or
0.02 percent, to 984.33. It had lost 14.80 points, or 1.48 percent,
the previous day.
	   Investors bid up shares of some banks amid optimism Japan's
upper house of Parliament will grant swift approval of a bill
setting guidelines for pumping public funds into a weakened banking
system, traders said.
	   The lower house already passed the bill on Tuesday.
	   But traders said gains were capped by lingering worry that a
stagnant domestic economy and the yen's recent strengthening _
which erodes profits from overseas _ will crimp earnings.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 118.40
yen, down 1.32 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its
late New York level of 118.98 yen overnight.
	   The dollar was weighed down by selling from foreign players and
Japanese institutional investors.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.830 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.850
percent, with its price declining to 108.67 yen from the previous
day's 108.68 yen.

Scientists edge closer to understanding how marijuana kills pain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK CALLAHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Maria Welch, a 52-year-old Baker City,
Oregon, resident who underwent surgery in July to remove most of
her cancerous right lung, was in misery after doctors sent her home
with some potent painkillers.
	   The drugs deadened some of the pain but left her nauseous,
hallucinatory and suffering from sleepless nights.
	   ``I felt like my body was asleep but my mind was awake. I just
had to stop taking them because they didn't agree with me.''
	   Then a friend gave Welch two marijuana brownies. Though she had
never tried illegal drugs, she was desperate for relief.
	   ``When I ate them I couldn't believe it. It was like a miracle.
It took the pain away and it gave me an appetite,'' said Welch, a
food industry researcher. ``I slept like a log that night.''
	   Scientists once scoffed at the claims of cancer patients like
Welch that they enjoyed relief from pain by puffing on a joint of
marijuana or gobbling a plate of pot-laced brownies.
	   But research during the past decade has buoyed the case for
marijuana as medicine. Scientists have made progress untangling
pot's chemical makeup and gained insight into how its ingredients
act on the brain to produce the anecdotal benefits claimed by
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis patients.
	   Now research has confirmed what some of those patients have been
claiming all along: Marijuana does indeed kill pain.
	   Scientists at the University of California at San Francisco
found that a marijuana-like drug deadens pain in rats by
interacting with the same pain-modulating area of the brain
activated by morphine.
	   The findings prove that cannabinoids _ which include marijuana's
active ingredient, THC _ are potent analgesics that deliver true
pain relief, said Ian Meng, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF's
Department of Neurology.
	   In findings reported in the Sept. 24 issue of the journal
Nature, the UCSF researchers describe how they injected rats with a
synthetic cannabinoid to test how quickly the rodents reacted when
a heat source was applied to their tails.
	   The drugged rats reacted more slowly to the heat than those not
given the drug WIN55,212-2, and when a region of brain called the
rostral ventromedial medulla that acts like a volume dial for pain
was switched off, the drug's analgesic attributes ended, the team
found.
	   A second set of tests demonstrated that it was the cannabinoid's
pain-killing abilities _ not the loss of motor coordination it also
induces_ that caused the rats to react slowly to their heated
tails.
	   Meng said that given the findings, scientists should now push
ahead and test cannabinoids on humans.
	   ``People are smoking marijuana and giving anecdotal accounts. I
think the time is here for real, controlled clinical trials,'' he
said.
	   Proponents of the medical use of marijuana have claimed for
decades that pot stifles chronic pain without the nausea, weight
loss and addiction associated with morphine and other opiates.
	   The finding that cannabinoids target the same area of the brain
as opiates, albeit through a different mechanism, raises the
prospect that marijuana and opiates might be used together to
exploit their combined analgesic qualities.
	   Using the drugs together in smaller amounts might also reduce
the nausea caused by morphine and the euphoria sparked by
cannabinoids that are undesirable in chronically ill patients, said
Dr. Gavril Pasternak, who studies the biology of pain at the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
	   ``I would say that it sounds reasonable that if used together
the combination could work quite good,'' he said. ``We know now
that the brain circuitry can be activated by more than just
morphine. So there's not a single key to make it work, there's two
and maybe more keys.''
	   Dr. Billy Martin, a professor of pharmacology at the Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond who has studied cannabinoids
for 25 years, said the UCSF team's findings are illuminating but
offer no magic bullet.
	   ``This study is a little tiny piece of this whole big puzzle,''
Martin said. ``...It opens up the possibility of developing new
ways of treating and controlling pain and understanding pain, but
it doesn't get us any closer to a cannabinoid pill tomorrow that's
going to be useful.''
	   Martin is one of several researchers who discovered that the
human brain has a naturally occurring system that processes
cannabinoids.
	   He said while scientists have made strides in understanding how
marijuana's hundreds of compounds act on the brain to deliver the
laundry list of benefits users claim to enjoy, the hardest work
lies ahead.
	   Supporters of the medical use of marijuana who campaigned
successfully for ballot measures legalizing its medical use in
California and Arizona complain that the federal government has
made advanced marijuana studies more difficult by erecting
roadblocks to researchers.
	   The reason, they say, is that exposing marijuana's good side
would undermine the government's war on drugs.
	   ``The government has decided to wage a war against marijuana and
they don't want any kinks in the armor. They don't want people
knowing that marijuana, like morphine, has a medical use,'' said
Bill Zimmerman, director of the Los Angeles-based group Americans
for Medical Rights.
	   The nonprofit group is campaigning for medical marijuana
measures that are on the ballot in five other states _ including
Oregon, where Welch must now travel to Canada to buy her marijuana
brownies _ and the District of Columbia this November.
	   The group's criticisms are unfair, said Dr. Frank Vocci,
director of the medication development division of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, which co-funded the UCFS study. He said
the reality is that the government has received very few proposals
for research into marijuana and its components.
	   ``Until there's more interest in this you can't really say
there's a conspiracy because there's a dearth of applications,''
Vocci said.
	   The only human clinical trial under way involving medical
marijuana is one that seeks to determine whether cannabinoids have
any adverse effect on drugs being used to treat AIDS patients.

Bahamas will hang two criminals despite opposition

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with appeal from Inter-American

CORRECTS that commission is based in Washington D.C., sted Costa
Rica.
 &UR; By DEBORAH NASH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas is sending two murderers to
the gallows on Thursday despite international opposition.
	   At home, there have been none of the protests that accompanied
the last hanging in the Bahamas, in 1996. That follows a Caribbean
trend to fight rising crime with the harshest punishment.
	   ``We pray that others will take note that the Bahamian society
is fed up with these heinous types of crime,'' said the Rev. Simeon
Hall, president of the Bahamas Christian Council, which had
protested the 1996 execution.
	   ``The innocent people have been pushed to this day and feel this
is their only recourse,'' Hall told The Associated Press hours
before the scheduled hangings.
	   Bahamians have been particularly sickened by the killings of
three foreigners in August _ two women, one British and one
American, who were on vacation and a cruise ship worker. An
18-year-old Bahamian jetski operator has been arrested in the
killings of the women.
	   Attorney General Tennyson Wells said the Bahamas would hang
Trevor Fisher, 28, and Richard Woods, 51, even though they have
appeals pending at the Organization of American States'
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
	   The Washington D.C.-based commission made a last-minute appeal
for the men's lives Wednesday, Bahamian government radio reported.
But there was no response to the commission, which had received
Fisher's petition in June 1996 and that of Woods in November 1996.
	   The Bahamian Ministry of National Security said the government
had not received any recommendation from the commission and
``considers that it has complied with its obligations.'' The
ministerial statement came Friday, the same day the death warrants
were read to the condemned men.
	   Some Caribbean countries have accused the commission of
deliberately prolonging its decisions in a bid to prevent hangings.
Jamaica withdrew from the commission this year and Trinidad has
said it will withdraw next year.
	   Bahamian officials needed to carry out the executions ahead of a
five-year limit set by Britain's Privy Council, which ruled in 1993
that it was inhumane to keep prisoners on death row for more than
five years. As a result, hundreds of condemned convicts had their
sentences commuted to life imprisonment, since the Privy Council of
the House of Lords is the highest court for several current and
former British Caribbean colonies.
	   In the Bahamas, 17 death sentences had to be commuted this year
and 30 people remain on death row.
	   The Privy Council ruled three-two last week that the Bahamas,
independent since 1973, should act. It emphasized the ``requirement
on humanitarian grounds that in countries which retain the death
penalty, lawful death penalties should be carried out as swiftly as
practicable.''
	   The council said it also was necessary ``to maintain public
confidence in the criminal justice system in the Bahamas.''
	   Britain's government is opposed to the death penalty and has
tried to persuade Caribbean countries to stop it. In response,
Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad _ all independent nations
with varying links to Britain _ announced in July that they plan to
cut ties to the Privy Council and form their own Caribbean Court of
Justice.
	   The hangings in the Bahamas are scheduled separately for 8 a.m.
(13:00 GMT) and 9 a.m. Thursday.
	   Fisher was convicted on March 25, 1994, of shooting an unarmed
man at point blank range in a botched 1990 robbery attempt. Woods
was sentenced Jan. 18, 1995, for the 1993 murder of Pauline
Johnson.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis is the only other Caribbean country to hang
a convicted murderer this year, ending a 13-year hiatus there.

Yankees rest up for World Series

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bad news for the San Diego Padres: The New York
Yankees will be well-rested when the World Series starts Saturday
night.
	   Not that New York needed any more advantages, what with an
American League-record 114 victories, the home-field advantage and
the rabid fans of the Bronx Zoo.
	   ``Hopefully we can wrap it up in four,'' David Wells said early
Wednesday in the glow of the Yankees' record 35th American League
pennant. ``That would be the best thing to do.''
	   As the autumn sun splashed down on Yankee Stadium, players took
a day off following the 9-5 victory over Cleveland that won the AL
championship series 4-2.
	   ``To me, this is probably the tensest part, getting here,''
manager Joe Torre said. ``The World Series, if we win the World
Series, it will be magnificent and we will celebrate. But getting
there is a such a tough mountain to climb, and to have been able to
do that against a club like the Cleveland Indians, who have been
there so often, it is just very satisfying.''
	   New York, second in the AL with a .288 batting average, won the
pennant despite a .218 average in the six games against the
Indians. After scoring five runs in the first inning of the opener,
New York was just 6-for-39 (.154) with runners in scoring position
through Game 5. The Yankees then went 4-for-12 in Game 6.
	   ``I felt the pressure leave us after Saturday, once we were even
at two,'' Torre said. ``We had a good batting practice Sunday. We
left some runners. We could have scored more.''
	   Pitching, as it has all year, carried the Yankees. Wells, who
won two of the four games against Cleveland, was voted the ALCS MVP
and is expected to start the World Series opener against Kevin
Brown.
	   ``How does it get any better than this?'' said San Diego's Jim
Leyritz, a postseason hero for the Yankees two years ago and for
the Padres this year. ``That's one of the greatest things in this
sport, to be able to play the World Series and play center stage in
New York.''
	   While most Yankees didn't care who won the NL title, Wells was
looking forward to a matchup with the Padres.
	   ``Hopefully, San Diego,'' he said. ``That is where I am from.
That is where I grew up, and it would be exciting for me and a
challenge as well.''
	   The Padres obliged him by beating Atlanta 5-0 to win the NL
championship series 4-2.
	   ``I never knew I'd like New York so much,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said.
	   After taking Wednesday off, the Yankees will regroup Thursday
for a practice. Torre must figure out how to order pitchers David
Cone, Andy Pettitte and Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez for Games
2-4.
	   While nothing was set beyond the opener, the best guess
Wednesday was that Hernandez would start Game 2, followed by Cone
and Pettitte.
	   If they are to take their place with the great teams, alongside
the 1927 Murderer's Row, the 1970s Big Red Machine and others, the
Yankees must win four more games and win the Series for the second
time in three seasons.

Indiana University study to focus on adolescent sexual behavior
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The Indiana University Medical Center will
spend the next five years studying adolescent sexual behavior to
learn how they acquire sexually transmitted diseases.
	   The study, financed by a dlrs 7 million grant from the National
Institutes of Health, is believed to be the first of its kind in
the nation.
	   Dr. Donald Orr, director of adolescent medicine at Riley
Hospital and head of the newly created Mid-America Adolescent
Sexually Transmitted Disease Cooperative Research Center, said the
center will examine adolescents and how they acquire or don't
acquire sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea,
trichomoniasis and human papillomavirus.
	   Last year, the National Institute of Medicine identified
sexually transmitted diseases as a hidden epidemic. In 1995, there
were 14 million reported cases of sexually transmitted diseases in
the United States, 3 million of them among adolescents. Health
costs for treating those diseases totaled dlrs 8 million in 1995.
	   The center will study up to 600 girls between the ages of 14 and
16 and their mothers. A smaller number of boys also will be
included.
	   The teens will be followed for a 27-month period, regardless of
their sexual activity. They also will receive regular medical
checkups.
	   ``Adolescents in the inner city are at higher risk for all
STDs,'' Orr said. Nationwide, 65 percent of all reported sexually
transmitted disease cases occur in individuals between the ages of
15 and 24 years old.

 &UR; Underwater observatory to be built off Martha's Vineyard
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Within two years, oceanographers and students
worldwide should be able to log on to their computers and see
what's happening in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's
Vineyard.
	   The plan is for a tiny camera at an underwater observatory to
transmit pictures to a site on the Internet as well as directly to
computer screens at the New England Aquarium and universities
throughout the world.
	   The camera will be anchored to the Katama Observatory, a
conglomeration of oceanographic equipment being built about 40 feet
(12 meters) below the surface off the island's south shore,
scientists said.
	   The station's purpose is to help scientists learn how storms
spur erosion and affect sea creatures.
	   ``We realize that to have a long-term understanding of the
environment we need long-term monitoring,'' said Wade McGillis, a
scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which will
monitor the camera. ``One of the most exciting areas of
oceanography is the coastline.''
	   McGillis said the station will barely be visible to visitors on
the Vineyard. It will consist of a small shore station and a
20-foot (6-meter) -tall mast with atmospheric sensors.
	   Scientists say the equipment will be able to collect data 24
hours a day for studies of coastal meteorology, air-sea interaction
and sediment transport.
	   Funding for the station has been provided by the National
Science Foundation and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The
total cost is dlrs 1.2 million.

Calcavecchia looks for Presidents Cup slot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mark Calcavecchia played Wednesday like a man
determined to achieve his season goal _ a spot in the Presidents
Cup competition later this year in Australia.
	   Calcavecchia didn't come close to a bogey all day, shooting a
7-under-par 65 under nearly flawless conditions to tie Robert
Damron for the first-round lead in the 90-hole Las Vegas
Invitational.
	   ``I figured when the year began that if I made the Presidents
Cup team I would have had a good year,'' Calcavecchia said. ``The
Presidents Cup is my goal. If I can hang on and do that, it's been
a good year.''
	   Calcavecchia, getting a break by playing in the morning before
the wind came up, made seven birdies on the TPC Summerlin course to
beat by a stroke the opening-round 66 he shot here last year when
he ended up in a tie for fourth.
	   Calcavecchia also finished third here two years ago.
	   ``I've had chances to win both years,'' he said. ``I've been on
a pretty good roll here for three years now.''
	   Paul Azinger topped a group of seven golfers a shot back at 66,
while U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen and 13 others were at 67. Among
those at 67 was Chip Beck, who only last month ended a streak of
missing the cut in 47 straight tournaments.
	   All in all, it was a very crowded leaderboard with 39 golfers
within three shots of the lead.
	   Calcavecchia is currently in 10th place on the points list for
the team, and needs to hold that position through the season-ending
Tour Championship if he wants to make the United States squad.
	   The top 10 automatically make the team, while captain Jack
Nicklaus said he will likely round out the team with the Nos. 11
and 12 players on the list.
	   To make sure he has a good showing in town he clearly enjoys,
Calcavecchia has put some self-imposed limits on his stay for the
dlrs 2 million tournament.
	   ``I just like to have fun here,'' he said. ``I like to gamble
but I put an 8:30 p.m. curfew on myself here.''
	   Damron also posted his score early at TPC Summerlin, one of
three courses used for the first three days of the tournament.
	   In the 93rd spot on the money list, Damron doesn't have to worry
about a spot on the Presidents Cup. He also doesn't have to worry
about dropping out of the top 125 spots on the money list _ which
means he is almost guaranteed a tour card for next year.
	   ``My goal this week is to have a good time,'' Damron said.
	   Damron made the cut in last week's Michelob Championship, only
to pull out on Saturday, saying he was burned out on golf. He
didn't pick up a club until Wednesday, then went out and made eight
birdies before hitting a ball into a greenside bunker on the 17th
hole and missing a 4-footer (1.2 meters) for par.
	   In a tournament in which low scoring is an annual event, the
first round scores were not as low as a group as in recent years
although the leaderboard was dotted with scores in the 60s. That
was largely a result of afternoon winds, which are predicted to
continue through the rest of the week.
	   The early players got the benefit of better conditions,
including John Daly, who shot his 4-under 68 at the Desert Inn
Country Club, probably the toughest of the three courses in the
rotation.
	   Daly, showing no effects from jet leg after winning all his
matches over the weekend in the Dunhill Cup, hit every green in
regulation and never made a bogey in what for him was an
uncharacteristic steady round.
	   ``It's been a long time since I hit 18 greens in a row,'' Daly
said. ``I was pretty happy. It's a nice round.''

Settlers step up lobby against Israel-Palestinian agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Worried about their future on the eve of a
Mideast summit, thousands of Jewish settlers and their supporters
took their protests to the prime minister's doorstep hoping to
scuttle a deal to cede more land to the Palestinians.
	   Leaders of the powerful settler lobby and their representatives
in government have threatened to bring down Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu if he agrees at the summit, which opens Thursday, to an
American plan to withdraw Israeli troops from 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   ``Withdrawal means no government,'' read signs held by
demonstrators outside the premier's residence just hours before
Netanyahu was to leave for the United States.
	   Netanyahu campaigned on a promise to slow down the peace
process. Most Israeli settlers voted for Netanyahu, hoping his
hardline government would halt the land-for-peace process started
by his predecessors.
	   At a secluded conference center in eastern Maryland on Thursday,
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton hope to conclude the terms for an Israeli withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank.
	   Some 150,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, which Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. It is also home to
1,600,000 Palestinians who want the West Bank to become part of a
future Palestinian state.
	   Netanyahu committed to carrying out a series of troop
withdrawals but has so far balked, citing security concerns,
especially for the settlers who live in close proximity to the
Palestinians.
	   Many settlers, who believe the West Bank is part of the biblical
land of Israel promised to the Jews by God have sworn to fight for
the land rather than lose it.
	   Yisrael Medad, who lives in the Shilo settlement, which is
likely to become surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory
under the American plan, said such a pullout would leave
settlements vulnerable to attacks by Palestinian militants.
	   ``The more opportunity the Arabs have to kill Jews, the more
they will do so,'' he said. ``It would mean more Palestinian dead
and more Israeli dead,'' Medad warned.
	   Government-backers of the settlement movement command a powerful
position in Netanyahu's coalition government. The 17-member
right-wing block has more than enough seats to topple Netanyahu and
vowed to do so if the premier signs or initials an agreement for a
withdrawal.
	   Addressing Wednesday's demonstration, lawmaker Michael Kleiner,
who leads the 17-member ``Greater Israel Front,'' declared, ``The
only way to prevent a war is to stop now.' He called on Netanyahu
not to attend the summit at all.
	   Many settlers feel they have been shunted aside by a government
they elected and fellow Israeli citizens who see them as a thorn in
the way of peace with the Palestinians.
	   Joseph Alpher, the former head of a Tel Aviv University's think
tank, said the settlers, who make up only 3 percent of the
population, still managed to wield a great deal of power over the
years. ``They have mounted a very effective lobby,'' he said.
	   An agreement for another Israeli pullback in the West Bank,
however, would be a negative turning point in Israel's settlement
movement, Alpher said.
	   On the other hand, if no agreement emerges from the summit,
``that is clearly a defeat for the peace process and a victory for
them,'' he said.

Japan's August current account surplus up for 17th straight month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with export, import figures, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again,
climbing 43.6 percent in August from a year ago, the government
announced Thursday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.158 trillion yen (dlrs 9.73 billion) in August, up 43.6
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, higher than Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow
Jones Newswires had expected, marked the 17th consecutive monthly
year-on-year increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing international pressure to revive
its sluggish economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning
surplus.
	   Meeting in Manila last week, Southeast Asian trade ministers
urged Japan to reform and resuscitate its economy and provide
leadership for economic recovery in the region.
	   In August, imports contracted 5.5 percent from their year before
level to 2.752 trillion yen (dlrs 23.12 billion) due to sluggish
domestic demand. Exports rose a marginal 0.7 percent to 3.842
trillion yen (dlrs 32.06 billion).
	   In services trade, however, Japan posted a deficit of 544.0
billion yen (dlrs 4.57 billion) in August, compared with a deficit
of 594.2 billion yen (dlrs 4.99 billion) a year earlier.

Australian weightlifter tests positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian weightlifter Johnny Nguyen
faces a two-year ban after testing positive to steroid Stanozolol,
according to a newspaper report Thursday.
	   Australian Weightlifting executive director Robert Kabbas said
he could not confirm the report in the Sydney Morning Herald.
	   ``We are confirming that one of our athletes has tested positive
but because there hasn't been a result on the B sample we can't
confirm the athlete's name,'' Kabbas said Thursday.
	   The Herald reported that Nguyen was tested before last month's
Commonwealth Games, where he failed to live up to expectations. The
results were not available until after the games.
	   Vietnamese-born Nguyen was favored to win all three gold medals
in the 54-kilogram class at Kuala Lumpur but finished with none.
	   Commonwealth Games team reserve Duncan van Rooyen was dropped
before the Games after testing positive to Clenbuterol.
	   Australian Weightlifting president Sam Coffa told the Herald the
positive results were distressing but the sport was trying to
address the situation with more education.
	   ``The last couple of years have been pretty good, really, but
these two cases are stupidity,'' Coffa said. ``If people do wrong
they have to face the consequences.''

Economist says Nobel-winning work rooted in boyhood famine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NYR108-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE STANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Amartya Sen is still haunted by boyhood
memories of a famine that gripped his native India.
	   Neither he nor his family starved _ a fact that later formed the
basis of his economic theories that earned him a Nobel prize on
Wednesday.
	   Emaciated rural laborers died by the thousands in 1943 while
most people were untouched by wartime inflation that pushed food
prices beyond reach of the poorest members of the then-British
colony.
	   ``I knew of no one who was affected by the famine _ no relation,
no friend, no one I ever associated with. That, to me, was a great
insight later, I thought, though I didn't see it at that time. I
just thought we were very lucky,'' Sen said Wednesday.
	   The experience stirred his interest in the cause of famines _ an
interest that led ultimately to his pioneering work in development
economics.
	   Sen, 64, was awarded the prestigious prize for his contributions
to welfare economics, which help explain the economic mechanisms
underlying famines and poverty, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said Wednesday.
	   Last year's prize winners, Americans Robert Merton and Myron
Scholes, were honored for their work on valuing risky
``derivatives'' investments like stock options _ work that
generally benefited the rich.
	   ``The fact that economics is also concerned with the poor, the
downtrodden, the underdogs of society is something that is very
close to my heart,'' Sen said.
	   Sen spoke at a news conference at the United Nations, after
flying from his home in Britain where he works as master at Trinity
College in Cambridge. He came to New York to attend a memorial
service Thursday for Mahbub ul Haq, a longtime friend and a former
finance minister of Pakistan.
	   ``Dr. Amartya Sen has contributed substantially to United
Nations thinking on matters of economic importance,'' U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said earlier.
	   Sen has been a regular advisor to the U.N. Development Program's
human development report, a measure of global economic welfare, and
he advised former U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
	   In measuring poverty and prosperity, Sen looks at more than a
nation's gross national product. He also incorporates factors like
income distribution and health, a method hailed by other economists
in the field.
	   ``Just looking at GNP or GNP growth for a country like India
might not be a very good way to say, `Is the development plan of
the country really helping people?''' said Jerry Hausman, economics
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
	   ``Being able to look at the numbers in different ways and think
about it is very helpful,'' Hausman said.
	   Sen's best-known work, detailed in his 1981 book ``Poverty and
Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation,'' challenges the
common view that the shortage of food is the most important
explanation of famine.
	   Sen was 9 when he witnessed the effects of India's wartime
famine. Despite rumors that food supplies were plentiful _rumors he
later substantiated _ people still starved.
	   ``There is hardly a famine that affects more than 10 percent of
a population, in any way,'' he said.
	   ``To see famine mainly as a divisive phenomenon, whereby some
people fall behind and the devil takes the hindmost ... is
something that links, I think, my childhood memories and
impressions of 1943 with the work I did in the decade following
1973.''
	   Sen said famines are easy to prevent in democracies, where a
free press acts as a watchdog and people can vote governments out
of power. Authoritarian regimes, however, often have little
incentive to prevent famines because ruling elites are rarely
affected by them.
	   Sen also said he sees advantages in the growing interdependence
of the world's economies, despite the current global financial
crisis.
	   ``I take the view that globalization is ultimately a major force
for good.''
	   The problem is that social safety nets in countries like
Indonesia and Thailand are inadequate to protect people who lack
the education or training to compete, he said.
	   Before moving to Britain, Sen was a professor of economics and
philosophy at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where
he still has an office and remains a professor emeritus.
	   He said he had no plans yet for spending the dlrs 963,000 prize
money.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders are
keeping up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw many more Serb forces from Kosovo before
Saturday's deadline.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending Kosovo turmoil,
NATO officials said he had a long way to go. And despite noting
signs of progress, a U.S. spokesman called compliance efforts ``a
mixed bag.''
	   ``NATO authorities will have to make a judgment at the end of
the week, whether there is substantial and serious compliance on
the part of President Milosevic,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said in Washington on Wednesday.
	   In case there isn't, the alliance is continuing with
preparations for air raids against the Serbs. NATO warplanes are
being moved to bases in Italy, just across the Adriatic Sea from
Yugoslavia.
	   International officials gathered in Paris and Vienna on Thursday
as part of the assessment process and push for peace in Kosovo.
	   The Contact Group of six leading nations involved in Balkans
diplomacy was to meet in Paris.
	   Later Thursday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was set to approve the 2,000-person verification mission it
will oversee in Kosovo. The mission was a key part of the deal
struck Monday by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke with Milosevic to end
his seven-month crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off the
threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys to refugees
Wednesday, two days after suspending them for fear of Serb
retaliation if NATO attacked. Rubin said European and American
monitors _ the advance team for the verification force _ found
evidence of refugees returning.
	   But many refugees remained in hiding, fearing reprisals from
Serb special police who have torched their villages and been
accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just rebel fighters
fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   ``He's lying!'' said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee in
the forested hamlet of Baks, referring to the Yugoslav president's
pledges. ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say
whatever people want to hear.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian province. Many are
crammed into houses with relatives and other refugees; tens of
thousands of others remain camped and are vulnerable to worsening
weather in hilly Kosovo.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday in Brussels that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo.
He declined to say how many but said they far exceed the level
required by NATO.
	   A week ago, Washington said Milosevic had withdrawn only 40
percent of the troops he sent into Kosovo and only 1,000 of 10,000
special police.
	   International officials acknowledge they won't have a full
picture of the situation until the monitoring mission begins. It's
expected to take days or weeks to assemble the force from the
OSCE's 54 member nations.

Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka returns to his homeland

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Four years after fleeing from Nigeria's
ruling dictatorship, Nobel laureate and outspoken junta critic Wole
Soyinka has returned to his homeland.
	   Soyinka, who flew into Lagos on Wednesday night from Europe, was
welcomed at the airport by about 500 supporters singing: ``Welcome
our king, we have been waiting for you.''
	   Later, he was taken to the home of Moshood Abiola, the Nigerian
millionaire businessman turned opposition leader who died in
custody in July.
	   ``Looking at faces of people, one gets the feeling there's a lot
of work to be done,'' he told reporters after meeting with Abiola's
family.
	   Soyinka was a prominent critic of the regime of Nigeria's late
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, whose abysmal human rights record left
the country an international pariah.
	   Fearing arrest for his criticism, Soyinka fled Nigeria four
years ago by slipping across the border, apparently into
neighboring Benin, after his passports had been seized. Later, he
helped set up the National Liberation Council of Nigeria, which
lobbied to bring an end to the Abacha regime.
	   Soyinka said after his exile began that Nigeria was ``retreating
into the Dark Ages'' and compared its rulers to leaders of
apartheid-era South Africa.
	   His return was warmly greeted by ordinary Nigerians.
	   ``Now he has come,'' said Etuk Ekpeyong, a Lagos gardener. ``He
is welcome home.''
	   Soyinka, who said he was home for a brief visit, had no
appearances scheduled for Thursday. He was to lecture Friday at a
Lagos university.
	   Soyinka's return comes a few weeks after he met with Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who came to power after Abacha's death in
June. Abubakar has shifted the country's direction since taking
power, scheduling elections and a return to civilian rule and
freeing many political prisoners.
	   Abubakar urged Soyinka to return home, but the writer put off
the visit for a few weeks, saying he was concerned about his
security.
	   Extra security agents had been dispatched to the airport late
Tuesday night because of the writer's return, and security checks
were more pronounced at the airport Wednesday.
	   Several exiles have returned to Nigeria in recent months at
Abubakar's urging.
	   The new junta recently dropped treason charges against Soyinka _
charges filed during Abacha's rule which were believed to have been
trumped up in an attempt to silence his criticism.
	   Soyinka, 64, who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta, won the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, the first African to win the
award. He is the author of some 20 novels, plays and collections of
poetry.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but 10
years since gaining independence from Britain in 1960. Presidential
elections are scheduled for February, with a return to civilian
rule scheduled for May.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Leaders of a powerful Jewish settler lobby and
their representatives in government have threatened to bring down
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he agrees at a Mideast summit
to cede more land to the Palestinians.
	   ``Withdrawal means no government,'' read signs held by
demonstrators Wednesday outside the premier's residence just hours
before Netanyahu was to leave for the United States.
	   Netanyahu campaigned on a promise to slow down the peace
process. Most Israeli settlers voted for Netanyahu, hoping his
hard-line government would halt the land-for-peace process started
by his predecessors.
	   At a secluded conference center in eastern Maryland on Thursday,
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton hope to conclude the terms for an Israeli withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank.
	   Clinton has been pushing the Israelis and the Palestinians to
end months of stalemate by completing an agreement based on a U.S.
initiative for Israel to withdraw troops from 13 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for detailed Palestinian measures to fight
terrorism.

Vasco beats Universidad Catolica 1-0 in Mercosur Cup

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Vasco needed the 1-0 win against
University Catolica Wednesday evening in the Mercosur Cup to even
dream of going on to the next round of play.
	   And that dream got a big boost as the first half drew to a close
and Gian fired a bomb from way outside the area high and into the
left corner in the 41st minute.
	   In the second half, Vasco continued to dominate but couldn't
manage to pull another goal out.
	   Now to survive, Vasco has to pin their hopes on compatriots
Gremio losing and in their match against River Plate of Argentina.
Otherwise they will have to wait on a series of other results
before they know if they will progress to the next round or not.
	   Lineups:
	   Vasco: Caetano, Marica, Henrique, Alex, Ronaldo Luis, Fabricio
Eduardo, Fabricio Carvalho, Gian (Fabinho), Mauricinho
(Richardson), Sorato, and Luis Claudio.
	   Universidad Catolica: Tapia, Cornejo, Vargas, Ramirez, Pizarro,
Lepe, Ormazabal, Osorio, Edu Manga, Figueroa and L. Diaz.

	   KINDU, Congo (AP) _ Shutters have remained drawn on shops lining
the hot and humid streets of this Congo River town where rebels
swept in this week after battling government forces.
	   People here fear Congolese rebels who captured the town Sunday
after a weeklong battle, suspicious that the new regime may bring
the same tactics of terror used by others before.
	   The rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, have captured about
one-quarter of this vast central African nation in their two-month
rebellion to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Winning over the people who come with the territory may be
tougher.
	   ``Whenever we come into a new town, people flee,'' one of their
commanders, Maj. Siatilo Ngizo, said Wednesday. ``But that's
because they don't understand why we're fighting Kabila. With time,
they will know to appreciate us.''
	   Two years ago, when Congolese Tutsi rebels sparked another
rebellion that put Kabila in power, they were greeted as saviors by
long-suffering people glad to be rid of longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko.
	   But for many, Kabila's government proved no better. And this
time, the people of the provincial capital of Kindu don't seem to
know what to expect.
	   ``We are just tired of war. And we don't know what's coming
next,'' said Ali, a tailor who was too afraid of the consequences
to give his last name. ``We've heard the rebels were taking away
all the young men in other towns. People are scared.''
	   The rebels are promising people in Kindu a better life, one
different from that offered by Kabila's government. The rebels have
accused Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and pitting ethnic
groups against each other.
	   Rebel leaders have promised to replace administrators who have
fled with government troops, to pay civil servants struggling
without wages for months and to re-open schools.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister and now the
rebels' roving ambassador, flew into Kindu to organize the civilian
administration, granting the town its first high-profile visit and
adding credibility to their cause.
	   The rebels have also sent a planeload of rice _ the first
supplies to reach Kindu since Sunday.
	   ``So far, they have been treating us well. There are no
problems,'' Jean-Pierre, a 20-year-old student, said.
	   Not much has been accomplished, though.
	   The rebels are still focusing their resources on the military
gains, and on the streets of Kindu, where life was slowly returning
to its leisurely pace, few people were aware of Karaha or his
program.
	   ``We need contacts with the rebels. We don't know what they
want,'' Ali said.
	   Things haven't gotten off to a warm start. Unlike other cities
where the rebels have seized control, in Kindu they have yet to
make an effort to go meet the townspeople and present their plans.
	   The rebels _a mixture of Congolese ethnic Tutsis as well as
soldiers from many of Congo's 400 tribes fed up with Kabila's
17-month rule _ have also not held any public gatherings as they
have in other cities, in part because they are unsure what sort of
reception they might receive. In other towns, their plans for civic
renewal were often met with discontent and jeers.
	   Continuing economic hardship has only added to Kindu's wariness
after being captured by rebels for the second time in less than two
years.
	   The capital of mineral-rich Maniema province, Kindu has no
industry. It depends on Katanga, Eastern Kasai or the capital,
Kinshasa, for everything from beer to buckets. And supplies are
unlikely to arrive from there as long as the government retains
control of those areas.
	   There is no gasoline or diesel to generate electricity to run
pumps so there is no running water. Retreating government soldiers
looted what little there was in the shops, emptied private homes
and took even the mattresses from the town's three hotels.
	   But the capture of Kindu and its strategic air base, located on
the railway that carries copper ore up from southern Katanga
province to the Congo River, opens the way to the diamond-rich
Eastern Kasai province and Lubumbashi, Kabila's home turf.
	   More importantly, it scuttled government efforts to launch a
counteroffensive against rebel strongholds in the east.

Bank of Japan says economy still deteriorating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy is caught in a vicious cycle of
sluggish consumer demand and falling production with no recovery
yet in sight, the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report Thursday.
	   The bank suggested the government's stimulus measures so far
have had only minimal effects in bolstering economic growth,
defying some expectations of a positive impact.
	   ``Private consumption has not yet shown a recovery despite the
special income tax reduction,'' the BOJ report said.
	   Japan is battling its deepest recession since World War II, with
unemployment and bankruptcy debts hitting record highs. The
government recently forecast the economy would shrink 1.8 percent
this year.
	   The BOJ report said that despite an interest rate cut last year,
banks are skittish about the deteriorating condition of borrower
companies and are hesitant to lend, thereby squeezing companies,
especially smaller businesses.
	   ``The economy is hardly expected to recover immediately, judging
from the negative interactions (of economic events) and the
financial constraints,'' the report said.
	   The Bank of Japan said that since the end of September, the
``Japan premium'' _ extra charges imposed on Japanese banks'
funding abroad _ expanded, ``reflecting intensified market concern
over Japanese financial institutions' funding in foreign currencies
toward the calendar year-end.''
	   Japanese banks are awash in bad debt left over from the collapse
of the speculative real estate bubble in the early 1990s. The
government is now working on a massive bailout to clean up the
mess.
	   The BOJ called attention to ``an immediate need to rebuild the
stability of the financial system,'' urging prompt implementation
of a bill designed to inject public funds into the banking system,
which is expected to become law by the end of the week.
	   Until the economy recovers, the central bank expects downward
pressures on prices to continue.
	   In addition to providing more deflationary pressure, the recent
rapid appreciation of the yen could affect the competitiveness of
exports by Japanese companies, the central bank said.

Brazil defeats Ecuador 5-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Elber, playing for the injured Ronaldo, scored
three times and added an assist as Brazil continued its mastery
over Ecuador with a 5-1 victory Wednesday night.
	   The mostly pro-Brazilian RFK Stadium crowd of 18,116 watched
Brazil improve to 17-0-2 against Ecuador.
	   Brazil has outscored Ecuador 71-14 in those 19 matches, with
Wednesday's game the most lopsided in the series since Brazil won
9-1 in 1949.
	   Playing for the second time since losing to France 3-0 in the
World Cup final three months ago, Brazil got goals from Marcelinho
Carioca (21st minute) and Cafu (70th minute), and a Ronaldo-like
night from Elber.
	   Elber, one of the top scorers in the German league for Bayern
Munich, scored in the 35th, 71st and 78th minutes. The 26-year-old
forward has five goals in five career international appearances.
	   Ecuador, trailing 2-0 at the half, avoided the shutout when
defender Ulises De La Cruz scored his first international goal in
the 69th minute.

Team of '90s going home again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The team of the '90s is running out of time.
There's only year left for the Atlanta Braves to win a second World
Series title.
	   Returning to Turner Field with grandiose plans of becoming the
first team in major league history to rebound from an 0-3 deficit,
the Braves instead gave their tomahawk-chopping fans another winter
to ponder what went wrong.
	   Those 106 regular-season wins are merely the most ever for a
team that didn't make the World Series. No one will remember that
the Braves became the first team to force Game 6 after losing the
first three games, actually coaxing their lackadaisical fans into a
sellout Wednesday.
	   San Diego is going to the World Series after a two-hit, 5-0
victory clinched the NL championship series four games to two.
	   ``I guess we could take the easy way out and never get to this
point,'' John Smoltz said. ``It stinks having to sit here and
answer these questions again. But that's reality. I'm sure there's
hundreds of players who would like to be sitting here in this
position.''
	   Danny Bautista was probably an exception.
	   He stood uncomfortably in front of his locker, trying to explain
what happened in the sixth inning when Sterling Hitchcock's soft
liner ricocheted off his glove for an error, allowing three
unearned runs that turned the game into a blowout.
	   ``I soon as he hit it, I thought I had it,'' Bautista said.
``But I lost it when it went into the lights. I did my best.''
	   Manager Bobby Cox doesn't think another World Series win is
required for the '90s Braves to earn proper recognition.
	   ``We love to win in April, May, June,'' he said. ``I don't know
if it validates anything. Some of other good teams got knocked out
even earlier than we and Cleveland.''
	   At least the Braves used to wait until the Series before losing.
The last two seasons, they haven't been able to get that far _ both
times eliminated at home in Game 6 of the NLCS, both times with Tom
Glavine on the mound, both times scuttled by one big inning.
	   A year ago, Florida scored four runs in the first, eliminated
the Braves with a 7-4 victory and went on to beat Cleveland in a
seven-game Series. Apparently content with having just as many
championships in the '90s as the Braves, the Marlins promptly
disbanded their team.
	   On Wednesday, a five-run sixth inning _ helped along greatly by
Bautista's fielding gaffe _ earned the Padres a meeting with the
New York Yankees.
	   ``We're disappointed that we didn't win this year,'' Glavine
said. ``We'll come back next year in spring training and try to win
again. I'm proud as hell to play in this organization. I've got a
chance to play in the World Series every year.''
	   Maybe the Braves, having made an unprecedented seven straight
trips to the postseason, will have to be content with that lone
World Series title, won in 1995. Maybe the Braves will have to
settle for the monotonous level of regular-season success that
allows them to reach the playoffs year after year.
	   After all, that's a truly remarkable feat considering this
25-man roster has only two holdovers, Glavine and Smoltz, from the
1991 team that got it all started.

Padres, Yankees set to meet in World Series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The New York Yankees and San Diego Padres have
played each other only once, and that was just a rain-shortened
exhibition this spring that ended in a 6-6 tie.
	   Still, there are plenty of intriguing matchups as the teams
prepare to meet in the World Series starting Saturday night at
Yankee Stadium.
	   There's San Diego native David Wells, pitching Game 1 for New
York. There's Jim Leyritz, the former Yankees postseason hero now
playing the same role for the Padres.
	   There's Hideki Irabu, who refused to pitch for the Padres and
held out until he was traded to New York. And San Diego slugger
Greg Vaughn, nearly sent to the Yankees until they nixed the deal
last year.
	   Not to mention the other former New Yorkers playing for the
Padres _ Sterling Hitchcock, Brian Boehringer and also Ruben
Rivera, whose cousin is Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. And even
Homer Bush, sent from San Diego to the Yankees in the Irabu trade.
	   Plus, don't forget ol' Zim. Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer was
the second manager in Padres' history, wearing one of those ugly
mustard-and-brown uniforms in the early '70s.
	   All that, and a lot more.
	   Tony Gwynn, one of the greatest hitters in history, at 38
visiting baseball's most famous stadium for the first time in his
life. Kevin Brown and Trevor Hoffman trying to tame the majors'
highest-scoring team. The Padres going after their first World
Series championship.
	   October vets David Cone and Derek Jeter, plus rookies Orlando
``El Duque'' Hernandez and Shane Spencer. New York hoping to do it
for cancer-stricken Darryl Strawberry and enhance its reputation as
one of the best teams ever. The Yankees trying to win their record
24th title and second in three seasons.
	   Wells, the MVP of the six-game AL championship series win over
Cleveland, can hardly wait to face his hometown team. He'll almost
certainly face Brown in the opener.
	   ``That is where I am from,'' Wells said early Wednesday, before
San Diego beat Atlanta 5-0 in the clinching Game 6 of the NLCS.
``That is where I grew up. It would be exciting for me, a challenge
for me as well. I am pulling for the Padres.''
	   The Padres earned their way to Yankee Stadium, beating a pair of
100-plus win teams, Houston and Atlanta, in the NL playoffs. San
Diego, which went 98-64, now becomes the first club ever to play
three 100-game winners in the postseason.
	   ``They've got a good ballclub. The Atlanta Braves were supposed
to have a great ballclub, also,'' Leyritz said after Wednesday's
win. ``We feel like we can compete with them. If our pitchers pitch
like they have in this series, I think we've got a great shot at
it.''
	   In manager Joe Torre's Yankees, the Padres take on a team that
set an AL record with 114 victories _ a total of 121 wins, counting
the playoffs.
	   ``I think the Padres have a really good chance of beating
them,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``I like San Diego's
chances.''
	   The combined 212 wins of the Yankees and Padres represent the
most by World Series opponents. The previous mark was 210 by
Baltimore (108) and Cincinnati (102) in 1970.
	   San Diego's only other trip to the World Series was in 1984,
when it was wiped out in five games by Detroit. Gwynn is the lone
remaining member from that team, though manager Bruce Bochy went
1-for-1 against the Tigers.
	   ``I've never been in Yankee Stadium,'' Bochy said. ``It doesn't
get any better than this.''

Typhoon Zeb roars out of Philippines, heads for Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Zeb roared out of the
Philippines on Thursday after leaving at least four people dead in
mudslides and headed for Taiwan, where at least two have died,
disaster officials said.
	   As of 9 a.m. (0100 GMT), Zeb, whose peak winds dropped to 165
kph (103 mph) with gusts of up to 200 kph (125 mph), was over the
South China Sea and was expected to head for Taiwan, said weather
forecaster Rene Molina.
	   At least 31,000 people were forced to flee their homes as
rampaging floods swept thatch homes when Zeb, which had packed peak
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour, came shore
and pummeled the northern Philippines.
	   Disaster officials said a 16-year-old boy taking shelter at a
church in Solano town in Nueva Vizcaya province was killed when a
wall collapsed, crushing him to death. Another person was killed in
a separate landslide in the mountain resort city of Baguio in
Benguet province.
	   In Antipolo, just outside Manila, two boys died after a hill
near a quarry site unleashed tons of mud and debris into their hut.
A sister of the boys survived.
	   Two people were in Quirino province were injured after being hit
by flying debris.
	   Officials said they expected more casualties due to numerous
reports of landslides and floods, which they were still verifying.
	   Government offices and schools in the area were turned into
emergency shelters.
	   Zeb's fury was beginning to be felt in Taiwan. Police in
southeastern Taitung said a man was swept out to sea by two-story
high waves as he was fishing, and another died after being trapped
overnight in heavy rains on a mountain.
	   Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to hit the Philippines this
year, was not expected to reach the same force it had when it
entered the country if its slams Taiwan either late Thursday or
early Friday, forecaster Molina said.
	   ``There is no warm air where the typhoon can feed to reach peak
power,'' Molina said. ``Taiwan is likely to be spared much
damage.''
	   But he said it was expected to reintensify as it moves out of
the Philippines at 9 kph (6 mph).
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said several airlines have
canceled domestic flights to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and nearby islets. International flights were not affected.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ German Titov scored his first
two goals for Pittsburgh and Jaromir Jagr had two assists to lead
the Penguins to a 3-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils on
Wednesday night.
	   Stu Barnes also scored for Pittsburgh and goaltender Tom
Barrasso stopped 22 shots as the Penguins spoiled Robbie Ftorek's
home debut as the Devils' coach.
	   The Penguins, who filed for bankruptcy protection early this
week, are 2-0 for the first time since the strike-shortened 1994-95
season. The Devils' 0-2 start is their first since 1983-84.
 &UR; Islanders 2, Lightning 0 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Tommy Salo got his 10th career shutout and
Gino Odjick snapped a 29-game, goal-scoring drought as the New York
Islanders beat the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   The Islanders have won the last six meetings between the teams,
including four consecutive shutouts.
	   Odjick's first-period goal was his first since last Dec. 17 at
Phoenix. Claude LaPointe added a shorthanded goal for the Islanders
with 7:30 left in the third period.
	   Salo stopped 22 shots, including a third-period scoring chance
by No. 1 draft pick Vincent Lecavalier during a two-on-one.

Rasmussen of Angels Camp, California, the only American man to win
two World Cup ski races in the 1990s, announced his retirement
Wednesday after 13 years with the U.S. Ski Team.
	   Rasmussen was the last of the ``Big Three'' downhillers who
lifted the team to unprecedented heights during the decade. Tommy
Moe of Jackson, Wyoming, who won the 1994 Olympic downhill gold
medal and the super-G silver, and AJ Kitt of Boulder, Colorado,
bronze medalist in the 1993 World Championships downhill, announced
their retirements last spring.
	   ``My knee's never felt better,'' said Rasmussen, who missed half
the 1997 season because of torn ligaments in his right knee. He
experienced pain during a summer training camp at Oregon's Mount
Hood, he said, ``but that wasn't a problem.''
	   ``It's just that I've wanted to get on with my life. At some
point, you have to make that commitment.''
	   Rasmussen, 30, said he has enjoyed spending the summer with his
wife and two children while helping a friend build a motel.
	   He hopes to stay involved with the national team, he said,
possibly as a guest coach on World Cup trips or at various camps.
	   Rasmussen, a former junior national champion, had planned to
retire after the 1994 season but when he finished second in the
Olympic combined downhill, he decided to keep racing. The next
season, he won the 65th Lauberhorn, one of the sport's most
heralded downhills, at Wengen, Switzerland and won another race on
the Olympic course in Kvitfjell, Norway.

Report: Citigroup seeks tie up with two major Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citigroup Inc., America's largest financial
services company, will begin talks this month to reach an agreement
on a securities business tie-up with two major Japanese banks, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Citigroup hopes to forge a link with an existing alliance of two
so-called city banks in Japan, Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd.,
to develop and sell mutual funds in the Japanese market, the Tokyo
newspaper said, without citing named sources.
	   It said an agreement could be reached as soon as early next
year.
	   But spokesmen for Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank denied the report,
saying no talks on a tie-up with Citigroup are planned.
	   The report comes amid a series of similar alliances between
foreign and Japanese financial institutions triggered by the recent
deregulation of Japan's banking, brokerage and insurance
industries.
	   Earlier this month, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and
Co. said it would set up a Tokyo-based mutual fund business with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest lenders.
	   Prudential Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. agreed
in July to open a joint mutual fund company. Earlier this year,
Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments Co. both announced plans to
set up separate nationwide retail networks in Japan.
	   Citigroup is the product of a merger announced in April between
Citicorp and the Travelers Group Inc. _ which bought Nikko
Securities Co., Japan's third-largest brokerage house, in June.
	   In September, Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank announced their decision
to join hands in fields such as private banking and mutual fund
marketing. They also plan to purchase shares of one another and
eventually set up a joint holding company.
	   A deal with Citigroup would expand the New York-based financial
giant's access to an estimated dlrs 9 trillion pool of personal
financial assets held by Japanese savers and investors.
	   Tokyo-based Asahi Bank has 429 offices worldwide, employs 12,688
people and has total deposits of 20.4 trillion yen (dlrs 172
billion).
	   Tokai Bank, based in Nagoya, western Japan, has 303 offices
worldwide, employs 11,407 people and has total deposits of 19.9
trillion yen (dlrs 167 billion).

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell Thursday morning amid
rumors that a major Japanese brokerage is facing massive losses.
The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 177.77 points,
or 1.36 percent, to 12,892.96. On Wednesday, it had fallen 172.06
points, or 1.30 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.92 yen in late morning, down 0.80 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
118.98 yen overnight.
	   Share prices started higher but quickly moved into negative
territory by midmorning following a sharp plunge in shares of
Nomura Securities, Japan's top brokerage, amid rumors that the
company is facing massive losses.
	   A spokesman at Nomura said the brokerage would make an
announcement about the valuation on its securities holdings later
Thursday. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
declined to comment on the rumors about the losses.
	   Shares of Nomura Securities were down 86 yen (73 cents), or 9.5
percent, to 823 yen (dlrs 6.97) per share.
	   Investors bid up shares of some banks earlier in the session
amid optimism Japan's upper house of Parliament will grant swift
approval of a bill setting guidelines for pumping public funds into
a weakened banking system, traders said.
	   The lower house already passed the bill on Tuesday.
	   But traders said gains were capped by lingering worry that a
stagnant domestic economy and the yen's recent strengthening _
which erodes profits from overseas _ will crimp earnings.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 9.83 points, or 1.00 percent, to 974.35. It had
lost 14.80 points, or 1.48 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar drifted lower from late New
York levels on dollar-selling by foreign players and Japanese
institutional investors.
	   In addition, renewed talk of monetary easing by Germany,
including remarks from German central bank officials, was lending
some support to the Japanese currency, dealers said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.850 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's
finish. Its price was slightly lower at 108.48 yen, from the
previous day's 108.68 yen.

Australian pleads guilty on child porn charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Australian man arrested during a
series of police raids on a suspected international Internet child
pornography ring pleaded guilty Thursday to possessing child
pornography on computer disks.
	   Nelson Grace Lima, 32, will be sentenced on Dec. 3 after
entering his plea in Sydney's Newtown Local court.
	   Lima was one of two Australians to be arrested as part of a
worldwide investigation headed by British police and coordinated by
Interpol.
	   Police in 21 countries swooped down simultaneously on Sept. 3,
arresting 50 people suspected of being members of the Wonderland
Club who had been exchanging pictures of child pornography on the
Internet.
	   In a brief hearing, the court was told Lima has been undergoing
counseling since his arrest last month.
	   He was released on bail and ordered to reappear for sentencing.

Typhoon Zeb roars out of Philippines, heads for Taiwan

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Zeb roared out of the
Philippines on Thursday after leaving at least four people dead in
mudslides and headed for Taiwan, where at least two have died,
disaster officials said.
	   As of 9 a.m. (0100 GMT), Zeb, whose peak winds dropped to 165
kph (103 mph) with gusts of up to 200 kph (125 mph), was over the
South China Sea and was expected to head for Taiwan, said weather
forecaster Rene Molina.
	   At least 31,000 people were forced to flee their homes as
rampaging floods swept thatch homes when Zeb, which had packed peak
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour, came shore
and pummeled the northern Philippines.
	   Disaster officials said a 16-year-old boy taking shelter at a
church in Solano town in Nueva Vizcaya province was killed when a
wall collapsed, crushing him to death. Another person was killed in
a separate landslide in the mountain resort city of Baguio in
Benguet province.
	   In Antipolo, just outside Manila, two boys, aged two and four,
died after a hill near a quarry site unleashed tons of mud and
debris into their hut. The boys six-year-old sister survived.
	   Two people were in Quirino province were injured after being hit
by flying debris.
	   Officials said they expected more casualties due to numerous
reports of landslides and floods, which they were still verifying.
	   Government offices and schools in the area were turned into
emergency shelters.
	   Zeb's fury was beginning to be felt in Taiwan. Police in
southeastern Taitung said a man was swept out to sea by two-story
high waves as he was fishing, and another died after being trapped
overnight in heavy rains on a mountain.
	   Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to hit the Philippines this
year, was not expected to reach the same force it had when it
entered the country if its slams Taiwan either late Thursday or
early Friday, forecaster Molina said.
	   ``There is no warm air where the typhoon can feed to reach peak
power,'' Molina said. ``Taiwan is likely to be spared much
damage.''
	   But he said it was expected to reintensify as it moves out of
the Philippines at 9 kph (6 mph).
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said several airlines have
canceled domestic flights to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and nearby islets. International flights were not affected.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

Asian economic crisis cuts back U.S. military exercises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis has forced a scaling
back of U.S. military exercises in the region just when such
confidence-building measures would lend stability, the chief of the
U.S. Pacific Command said Thursday.
	   U.S. Navy Adm. Joseph Prueher said the cutbacks have affected
U.S. readiness very little because forces are deployed fully ready.
But he added, ``we lose a little edge'' in the honing of skills
when exercises are attenuated.
	   In a time of worldwide economic stress, and internal political
strain for some nations, it is important for militaries to provide
stability ``and have good communications so we don't have
misunderstandings or miscalculations,'' Prueher said.
	   He saw no bi-lateral issues on the horizon that could turn into
military confrontations.
	   But areas that are being watched are the Korean peninsula, a
territorial dispute between China and Taiwan, Indonesia's political
and economic instability and disagreements between Singapore and
Malaysia over use of air and sea space.
	   ``The place that I think is the most volatile .. is North
Korea,'' Prueher said. ``Because of the mercurial decision-making
that goes on in North Korea, we cannot predict very well what they
will do. By our standards they don't make rational decisions.''
	   He described Indonesia's fragile political, military and
economic state as ``stable but unsatisfactory.''
	   Prueher said the Indonesian military ``has done a very good job
with a difficult situation in supporting the constitutional process
and also trying to support stable conditions in Indonesia.''
	   Prueher said he would travel Friday to Indonesia, where he will
meet with President B.J. Habibie and armed forces commander Gen.
Wiranto.
	   The China-Taiwan dispute has progressed through dialogue over
the past 2 1/2 years, bringing hope for a peaceful solution, he
said.
	   The friction over Malaysia's cancellation of an agreement that
allowed Singapore military and rescue craft unchecked use of
Malaysian sea and air space is ``something to be resolved between
those nations,'' he said.
	   But the Malaysian withdrawal from annual ``Five-Power Defense
Agreement'' exercises with Singapore, Australia, Britain and New
Zealand ``is unfortunate because it is another avenue for
communications and working together among the Southeast Asian
nations that was tending to bring them together.''
	   ``The fact this has gone away is a disadvantage,'' Prueher said.
	   Prueher, based in Honolulu, Hawaii, was in Singapore to discuss
regional security with U.S. ambassadors from Southeast Asia and
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth. After stopping in
Indonesia, he planned to visit Japan and Alaska.

China to donate 80,000 tons of crude oil to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ China will give North Korea 80,000
tons (586,400 barrels) of crude oil, the North's official news
media has reported.
	   China decided to make the donation, ``valuing the DPRK (North
Korea)-China friendship and preserving the excellent traditions of
helping each other in adversity,'' the Korean Central News Agency
said in a dispatch late Wednesday.
	   China is North Korea's last remaining major communist ally.
	   With its economy in shambles, many of North Korea's factories
sit idle and its transportation system is on the verge of collapse
for lack of fuel and spare parts, according to defectors from the
North.
	   Cash shortages forced the country to cut its crude oil imports
from 2.5 million tons (18.47 million barrels) in 1990 to 503,200
tons (3.7 million barrels) last year, South Korean government
officials said.

Report: Malaysia to prosecute Anwar on all 10 charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities are ready to
prosecute jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim on six sodomy and
corruption charges, in addition to the four charges he now faces,
newspapers said Thursday.
	   Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said the prosecution had
applied to the High Court to fix a trial date, the New Straits
Times daily reported.
	   ``The prosecution has all the necessary evidence ... for all the
10 charges against Anwar,'' he said, rejecting speculation that the
authorities weren't ready to prosecute.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
arrested 18 days after he lost his job. He had clashed against
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad over economy policy before being
dismissed for alleged immoral homosexual acts and corruption.
	   Anwar has pleaded innocent to all five counts of corruption and
five counts of sodomy, claiming they were trumped up by his
political adversaries. Anwar has been ordered to stand trial Nov.
2.
	   Mohtar said that if the hearings for the first four corruption
charges could be completed by November, the prosecution would apply
to get hearing dates for the other charges in December or January.
	   Meanwhile, Mahathir was quoted by a newspaper Thursday as saying
he had thought about abolishing the harsh security law that was
used to arrest Anwar and his supporters.
	   But he reportedly dropped the idea after security forces told
him that there was still the threat of instability in Malaysia.
	   ``That is why the ISA must be maintained, to prevent people from
creating chaos in the country without seeking justice in the
courts,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper.
	   On Wednesday, police decided to drop the use of the ISA in
detaining Anwar, following weeks of condemnation by domestic and
international civil rights groups. Anwar was later moved to a
regular jail on the outskirts of the capital.
	   Speaking to thousands at a pro-government rally Wednesday,
Mahathir defended the need for the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Referring to demonstrations in the capital mounted by Anwar's
supporters after his arrest, Mahathir said such kinds of behavior
justified the use of the security law, enacted in 1960 to combat
militant communists.
	   Malaysia has used the sweeping law to crack down on hundreds of
people, from mechanics to legislators, jailing them on charges of
threatening national security.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana announced that
troops have begun withdrawing from a huge swath of southern
Colombia in preparation for peace talks with the hemisphere's
oldest and largest rebel band.
	   Pastrana said Wednesday night that the 42,000-square-kilometer
(16,800-square-mile) area, a rebel-dominated zone twice the size of
El Salvador, would be free of government troops for 90 days, from
Nov. 7 through Feb. 7.
	   Government officials said the pullout, which began Wednesday,
would be gradual and verified by a commission including the
International Red Cross.
	   The area comprises five muncipalities and is a traditional
stronghold of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, which has been fighting the state for 34 years.
	   The pullout, which was announced weeks ago, has raised concerns
about guerrilla reprisals against civilians and an upsurge in drug
trafficking in the region. The area is a prime cultivation,
processing and transit center for coca, the raw material of
cocaine.
	   Pastrana, who took office Aug. 7, told a news conference at the
presidential palace that he had issued a decree recognizing the
FARC's political status. His announcement came on the eighth day of
a nationwide strike by tens of thousands of public sector
employees, and was likely to divert attention from the walkout.
	   The FARC has already named three subcommanders to take part in
peace talks, for which a date has not yet been set.
	   ``The vast majority of Colombians want peace and are prepared to
pay the price for it, but only if it means more democracy, more
social justice and more equal opportunity,'' Pastrana said.
	   ``The moment has come to move from the rhetoric of peace to acts
of peace,'' said government peace commissioner, Victor G. Ricardo.
	   A month before he took office, Pastrana met with the FARC's
supreme commander, Manuel Marulanda, in the southern jungles and
agreed to demilitarize the area as a condition for beginning a
peace dialogue.
	   The FARC, at its strongest ever and holding 245 police officers
and soldiers captured over the past year, has not yet said what it
would ask for in return for laying down its arms. Its 15,000
combatants control vast rural areas of Colombia, funding their
armed struggle through kidnapping and ``war taxes'' on the drug
trade.
	   The mayor of the most populous municipality in the zone told
Radionet radio that people were concerned about living under rebel
rule.
	   ``The people have a lot of expectations and a lot of worries,''
said Omar Garcia, the mayor of San Vicente del Caguan. ``The doubts
have still not been cleared up.''
	   The commander of the armed forces, Gen. Fernando Tapias, said
the military would guarantee the safety of any of the zone's
estimated 80,000 inhabitants who want to leave.
