   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- As a girl growing up on the Winnebago
Indian Reservation in northeast Nebraska, Sarah Berridge was warned
by the nuns about the consequences of embracing the spiritual
teachings of her native tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told I would go to hell,'' she said. ''I was always
scared to be an Indian as far as the Catholic Church went. I was
scared of my Native American beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old now is at the forefront of a burgeoning movement
to encourage American Indian Catholics to meld their native culture
with their Catholicism. She recently served as chairwoman of a
conference on the subject that brought together more than 1,000
Catholic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The annual conference is named after Kateri Tekakwitha, who in
1676 became one of the first American Indians to be baptized into
the Catholic church and could become the first declared a saint by
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''This conference lets them celebrate their unique way of being
Catholic,'' Berridge said.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of Indian Catholics ''are looking for an
opportunity to express their Catholic faith in ways that fit their
native culture,'' said the Rev. Steve Boes, director of the St.
Augustine Indian Mission in Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's more than 500 tribes recognized one spirit
or creator -- known as Ma'una in Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My ancestors believed in that higher being,'' Berridge said.
''We believed that before the white man came and taught us about
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians, in fact, were quicker to accept Catholicism than the
church was to recognize their ancient beliefs, Boes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the elders ... I've spoken to accepted the teachings
of Jesus as being in line with their ancient beliefs -- and that's
true for a great number of Native Americans,'' Boes said. ''Jesus
is the new part.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their great spiritual leaders have found similarities in the
teachings and stories in the Bible and in their own culture,'' he
said. ''It's a matter of believing that the Holy Spirit was at work
long before white Christian missionaries ever showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parishes incorporate Indian symbols, songs and traditions
in their Masses.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Augustine's, for example, Boes burns sacred cedar
branches instead of incense, spreading the fragrance with an eagle
feather instead with an ornamental censer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Winnebago and Omaha people believe cedar purifies -- it
helps to take away sin,'' Boes said. ''That natural symbol fits
perfectly with the penitential rite of the Catholic Church ... we
ask God to lift us up and to purify us.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation also incorporates Native American songs and
music at Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Paul Lenz, executive director of the Bureau of
Catholic Indian Missions in Washington, D.C., stressed that such
practices should not alarm traditional Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Catholic spirituality with the Native American culture,''
he said. ''The Indian culture is able to be joined ... with the
liturgy of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholic missionaries had abhorred intermixing the Indian
culture with Catholicism and demanded strict adherence to the
church's Roman liturgy well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even up into the 1930s ... missionaries would not allow those
types of Native American rituals in the church,'' said the Rev.
John Hatcher, former director of the Sioux Spiritual Center in
Rapid City, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the church's Second Vatican Council, in the
1960s, that church leaders began to reach out to native cultures
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''They very much encouraged these people to use their symbols
and bring them into the liturgy,'' Hatcher said. ''It was a real
change in direction in terms of respecting the culture of people
and basically saying that when the gospel is preached in any
culture, we have to realize that God was already there and we have
to welcome the gifts of that culture into the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said the church is trying to determine the number of
American Indian Catholics in the United States, but it is estimated
to be about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said many of them have yet to feel comfortable with
melding their culture with the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's sort of a liberating experience when that happens,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berridge experienced an epiphany at her first Kateri conference
in Spokane, Wash., in 1981, when she attended a sunrise Mass said
by an ordained Catholic priest who also was an Ojibwe medicine man.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that we have to understand that we were Native
Americans before we were Catholics and that we can't forget those
roots and our beliefs and traditions,'' she said. ''The thought in
my mind was, 'Does he know he's going to go to hell?'''
</P>
<P>
   Berridge said she has forgiven the nuns who ordered her to
abandon her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Catholic because I choose to be,'' she said. ''Nobody can
tell me anymore what I have to be or how I have to dress or how I
have to talk.''

<HEADLINE> Four Face Trial in Child's Death  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A judge ruled Thursday there is enough
evidence to try four people charged with child abuse in the death
of a 10-year-old girl who stopped breathing when she was wrapped in
a sheet during 'rebirthing' therapy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 70-minute, videotaped session, the girl told
therapists 13 times that she was having trouble breathing or felt
she was going to die, prosecutors said. Candace Newmaker had no
pulse when the flannel sheet was unwrapped, and she died the next
day in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Steve Jensen said the four adults assumed a
responsibility to protect Candace and went into the session with
''rose-colored glasses and chose to ignore what should have been
obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapists Julie Ponder, 40, and Connell Watkins, 53; intern
Jack McDaniel, 47; and business manager Brita St. Clair, 41, were
ordered bound over to District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Their arraignments are scheduled Sept. 18. Reckless child abuse
carries a sentence of up to 48 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel's lawyer, David Savitz, said the death was an accident.
''The people in the room were all there with the goal of helping
this youngster's life,'' Savitz said after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense attorney, Michael Steinberg, who represents St.
Clair, said, ''They can be painted as monsters, but these people
dedicated their lives to helping children like Candace.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rebirthing therapy, Candace was curled in a fetal
position and wrapped in the flannel sheet meant to represent the
womb. The attendants pushed against her with pillows and urged her
to fight her way out to become ''reborn,'' authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The session was meant to help the girl overcome ''reactive
attachment disorder,'' in which children resist forming loving
relationships and become unmanageable and violent. The hope was
that she would bond with her adoptive mother, who was present for
part of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Candace's adoptive mother, Jeane Newmaker, 46, of Durham, N.C.,
is due in court next month for a preliminary hearing on the lesser
charge of criminally negligent child abuse resulting in death. The
maximum prison sentence she could receive if convicted is 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Claims VP Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the day he became the first Jewish vice
presidential candidate of a major U.S. political party, Joseph
Lieberman spent hours trying to shore up support among influential
Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Before the nominations of Al Gore and his running mate were
formally ratified Thursday night, Lieberman held a flurry of
private meetings with leaders of labor, women's groups and
teachers' organizations. His slogan for the day: ''Winning is the
whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, with a single mighty shout, delegates to the Democratic
National Convention snapped a long-standing assumed religious
barrier by nominating Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go, Joe, go!'' the delegates chanted and made the nomination
by acclamation without the formality of a state-by-state roll call.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days earlier, Lieberman was barely known outside of his
home state of Connecticut. Gore's selection of him surprised even
some of his close associates, though Lieberman had been on Gore's
''short list'' of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was nominated by Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, a
fellow advocate of Democratic moderation, Rep. Ellen Tauscher of
California, who represents Silicon Valley, and Sen. Christopher
Dodd, Lieberman's colleague from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd recalled that 40 years ago, here in Los Angeles, a
Connecticut senator who was Jewish, Abraham Ribicoff, nominated
John F. Kennedy to become the first Roman Catholic president. Now,
Dodd said, he, a Roman Catholic, was nominating the first Jew to
run on a major ticket for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman made a brief appearance, raising a fist into the air,
throwing kisses at his audience. He had, in effect, already
accepted nomination in a sentimental address to the convention the
previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, meeting with centrist Democrats, Lieberman
acknowledged the tough campaign ahead, and signaled his
determination to fight for every vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't come to play. We came to win,'' Lieberman, chairman
of the Democratic Leadership Council, told about 150 fellow council
members, convention delegates and others.
</P>
<P>
   He met privately at his hotel with members of the National
Organization for Women, the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League, the National Education Association and the
AFL-CIO, among others.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL President Kate Michelman said Lieberman had requested the
meeting with women's groups to reassure them of his support for
women's issues, including abortion rights. NARAL previously had
endorsed the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very small group of women leaders and activists, and
it was a very informal meeting,'' Michelman said. ''Gore has a long
history of support for women's rights and has worked hard to
address women's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the meetings were part of a ''standard protocol'' for
a vice presidential nominee to reach out to the Democratic
coalition's core members.
</P>
<P>
   But some blacks, teachers and others have sought reassurance
that Lieberman's centrist views are compatible with theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman aide Dan Gerstein described the meetings with the
teachers' groups as ''a good, constructive dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers have expressed unhappiness about Lieberman's
support for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said Lieberman ''hasn't backed away from his belief
it's an idea worth testing,'' but he dismissed the matter as a
non-issue. ''Even though Lieberman has said he supports it, it's
not part of the agenda'' for Gore, and he will stand by Gore's
decision, Gerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with NEA President Bob Chase and others was ''very
positive, very cordial and warm,'' said NEA spokeswoman Kathleen
Lyons. They discussed their differences over vouchers, and the
senator ''reassured us that he would support what Al Gore
supports,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also seemed to be making headway with black leaders as
he labored to reassure them that he supports affirmative action.
Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who had expressed concern about
his views, said Thursday that Lieberman is ''my new best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, in an address Thursday to
several hundred activists, said he felt Gore's selection of
Lieberman, the first Orthodox Jew ever chosen for a major party
national ticket, was an example of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been an invisible quota on Jewish people. Lieberman's
not the first guy that's qualified, he's the first guy that's been
chosen because Gore used affirmative action and broke the quota of
zero,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate talk with Illinois convention delegates, Jackson
played down any perceived rift between blacks and Jews: ''There is
an attempt to create a fight where there is no basis.''

AL Gore Accepts Democratic Presidential Nomination

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore launched his fall quest for the White House
Thursday, pledging a ''better, fairer, more prosperous America'' in the
climactic speech of the Democratic National Convention. Acknowledging ''my own
imperfections'' he said nonetheless, ''I stand here tonight as my own man,''
after eight years as vice president. In the final minutes of his convention,
Gore entered the hall to a thunderous ovation. ''In the name of all the working
families who are the strength and soul of America,'' he said, ''I accept your
nomination.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Four Dutch citizens arrested for allegedly
plotting to kill President Slobodan Milosevic have vehemently denied the
accusation, their lawyers said Thursday. The four Dutchmen -- Jeroen van Lersel,
Bas van Schaik, Sander Zeitsen and Godfrid de Rie -- were arrested last month on
suspicion of plotting to kill Milosevic. They were sentenced Friday to 30 days
in jail for illegally entering the country, Dutch officials said, but remained

Tutu Returns to South Africa

   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading activist

''It's so wonderful to be back -- it's enough to move one to tears,'' he told

prostate cancer in November last year, said his recovery had been slower than
expected and pledged to maintain a low profile.

New Grand Jury To Hear Lewinsky Case

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray has empaneled a new grand
jury to hear evidence against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal
as he tries to determine if criminal charges are warranted, legal sources said
Thursday, and the news angered Democrats on the night Vice President Al Gore was
to accept the party's presidential nomination at its convention in Los Angeles.
''It's probably just another Republican dirty trick,'' Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., said. The move follows through on Ray's promise to consider whether the
president should be indicted after he steps down from office next January. Legal
experts cautioned the decision doesn't mean charges will ever be filed.

<HEADLINE> Defense Tries For Lee's Release  </HEADLINE>
By SUE MAJOR HOLMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- An FBI agent whose testimony last
December was a key in denying bail to a fired nuclear scientist
acknowledged Thursday that some of his testimony was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab scientist Wen Ho Lee is in jail
on charges he downloaded restricted files to unsecured computers
and tape. The hearing is the defense's third effort to get Lee
released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mark Holscher questioned the credibility of FBI agent
Robert Messemer, who admitted Thursday that he gave false testimony
in December when Lee was ordered to be held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   He told U.S. District Judge James Parker he did not
intentionally attempt to mislead the judge and said he did not
believe it was a serious error.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer testified on two separate occasions last year that Lee
told another scientist he wanted to use that scientist's computer
to print a resume. He acknowledged Thursday that Lee had told the
other scientist he wished to download files.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agent also acknowledged Lee disclosed contacts with
scientists from the People's Republic of China in a report to the
lab about a 1986 conference he attended.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer insisted, however, that Lee did not disclose the full
scope of those contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer testified last year Lee initially told authorities only
about a Christmas card he had gotten from one Chinese scientist. He
acknowledged that Parker could have inferred from that testimony
Lee was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer also said he wanted to correct a ''minor point'' in
which he said Lee sent letters seeking an overseas job. Messemer
said Thursday the FBI had no evidence one way or the other whether
the letters were sent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, a Taiwan-born American citizen, could face life in
prison if convicted at trial, scheduled to begin Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos scientist Richard Krajcik, deputy director of a
top-secret nuclear weapons division at the lab, testified that he
stood by earlier statements about the seriousness of the downloaded
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents the crown jewels of nuclear design assessment
capability of the United States,'' Krajcik said.
</P>
<P>
   Krajcik conceded the information was not classified as secret
when Lee allegedly took it, but said only scientists with security
clearances could access it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the information had not been reviewed for
classification. The information has since been classified as
confidential restricted data and secret restricted data, but not
top secret.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Cline read descriptions of classification
levels, which define top-secret information as vital to national
security and whose dissemination would cause ''exceptionally great
damage.'' Secret information does not reveal critical features.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was scheduled to resume Friday with more questioning
of Messemer.

<HEADLINE> Some of Gore's Claims Fall Short  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Political speeches rarely give the full story
on nuanced issues, and Al Gore's was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech Thursday, Gore alluded to a pair of tax
fights in Congress: efforts to eliminate the estate tax and the
''marriage penalty,'' a quirk in the tax code whereby some married
couples pay more in taxes than they would if they were single. Both
tax cuts have been championed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore said he, too, favors these cuts. But the
Democrats support much more narrow changes than the high-profile
Republican proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to ''reform the estate tax, so people can
pass on a small business or a family farm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the estate tax already exempts almost all small businesses
and family farms. At issue is whether to eliminate it for the top 2
percent of heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to end the influence of big money in politics and
take on such monied interests as insurers and pharmaceutical
companies, which he said control the Republican party and oppose
efforts to add a Medicare prescription drug benefit. ''They give in
to the big drug companies,'' he accused Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention that his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, is
among Congress' biggest recipients of money from both insurers
($197,419 this election) and drug makers ($84,550).
</P>
<P>
   In attacking proposals of Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, Gore again left out some details:
</P>
<P>
   --He said: ''Their plan tells seniors to beg the HMOs and
insurance companies for prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush proposes that the government give low-income
elderly people prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Bush
promises to give the rest the right to sign up for a plan that
offers coverage but has offered no guarantee those plans would be
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   --He characterized Bush's Social Security plan as one that would
''strip one out of every $6 from the Social Security Trust Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   That would happen only if every worker took Bush up on his offer
to put about one in $6 of their Social Security taxes into a
private retirement account. And while that money would be lost to
Social Security, that program would be paying out a smaller
retirement benefit to people who also have the individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   --He said he ''will not go along with a huge tax cut for the
wealthy at the expense of everyone else,'' and that his opponent's
plan would only give middle-income families 62 cents extra a day.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by a labor-financed research group backs up his
math. Taxpayers earning less than $39,300 would get about $227 per
year -- or about 62 cents per day -- under the Bush plan, according
to Citizens for Tax Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Any across-the-board income tax cut will mean more dollars for
the wealthy mostly because they make the most money and therefore
pay the largest share of taxes. Yet the cuts can mean more to
lower-income people because the money they get back is a larger
share of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Gore boasted about the economy's strong growth over
the past eight years. He noted that deficits are now surpluses and
home ownership is at its highest level.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention that the recovery began before he and
President Clinton took office. And while Democrats passed important
legislation in 1993 increasing taxes and cutting spending,
Republicans have pressed for a balanced budget for years.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's true that 22 million jobs have been created since
Gore became vice president, the nation has seen similar job growth
over similar periods.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that inflation is the lowest in a generation.
That's true when examining the core rate, which excludes the big
jump in oil prices over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated a line from his stump speech, in which he says the
job of president is the ''only job in the Constitution that is
charged with fighting for all of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the office of vice president?

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Angels 1  </HEADLINE>
By VIN A. CHERWOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Denny Neagle scattered nine hits in 6 2-3
innings, and Glenallen Hill, David Justice and Luis Sojo homered
Thursday night to lead the New York Yankees over the Anaheim Angels
6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle (3-3) stopped his three-game losing streak as he
rebounded from his shortest outing in over a year, when he allowed
six earned runs in 1 2-3 innings in the Yankees' 9-6 loss at
Anaheim last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hill became the 15th player to hit a homer into the black area
in center field, with a solo shot in the second inning. It was his
seventh homer in 38 at-bats since being acquired from the Chicago
Cubs on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter reached base four times with a double and three
walks, and Jorge Posada went 2-for-4 with a walk for the Yankees,
who have won seven of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, helped out by a pair baserunning mistakes by the Angels,
struck out three and walked one as he improved to 11-5 overall this
season. He worked out of a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the second
inning when he got Darin Erstad to fly out into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina doubled with one out and Adam Kennedy was hit by a
pitch. Benji Gil then reached safely when third baseman Scott
Brosius couldn't make a play after fielding his bunt.
</P>
<P>
   When Erstad flied out to right, Molina tagged up but retreated
when Justice threw home. Posada took the throw several steps toward
first base and ran toward the mound when he saw Gil near second,
with Kennedy standing on the base. As Gil retreated toward first,
Posada threw to Tino Martinez, who chased Gil down near second.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker (0-2), making his second start since a cerebral
hemorrhage on May 11, allowed two runs on three hits in five
innings. His first start in his return was last Saturday against
the Yankees in Anaheim, when he gave up three runs in 3 2-3 innings
in the Angels' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus, Mo Vaughn, Erstad, Molina and Gil all had two hits
for Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made it 2-0 in the third inning when Jeter doubled
with one out, moved to third on Posada's single and scored on
Bernie Williams' sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   New York added three runs in the sixth on Justice's two-run
homer off Juan Alvarez, and Sojo's solo shot off Eric Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels ran themselves out of another scoring chance in the
seventh. Gil singled with one out and moved to third on Erstad's
single.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus then hit a grounder down the third-base line, which
Brosius fielded behind the bag. He had no play on Glaus, but Erstad
went too far as he rounded second and Brosius threw to second
baseman Sojo who ran Erstad down towards third.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made it 6-0 in the seventh on Justice's sacrifice
fly with the bases loaded. Pinch-hitter Scott Spiezio homered in
the ninth off Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
Notes: ''Baywatch'' star David Hasselhoff sat next to the Angels
dugout. ... Erstad's double in the ninth moved him within 15 hits
of breaking Alex Johnson's franchise record for hits in a season
(202 in 1970). ... Tim Salmon went 0-for-4, dropping to .174
(4-for-23) against the Yankees this season, and .277 for his
career. ... Sojo's homer was his first since rejoining the Yankees.
He had five with Pittsburgh. ... Justice's homer was his 11th with
New York.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Left Breathless by Kiss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This was no peck on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The long, passionate, full-on-the lips kiss that Al Gore laid on
Tipper Gore left Democrats gasping.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow. He's got fire,'' gushed Wisconsin delegate Barbara Hintz.
''Nobody can say he doesn't have a personality. He gets accused of
being stiff; he loosened up.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk of Thursday's finale to the Democratic National
Committee was the passionate, lingering liplock that Gore wrapped
around his wife -- ''someone I've loved with my whole heart since
the night of my high school senior prom,'' he said -- after bounding
onto the podium to accept his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you see his kiss?'' cooed Alison Cameron of Houston. ''I
was like, Oooooh!''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Marlin of Fort Worth, Texas, put it this way: ''It was
perfect.''

<HEADLINE> Protests Continue at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- About 2,500 activists poured into the streets
Thursday for the last day of the Democratic convention, protesting
environmental destruction and greeting Al Gore's big speech with a
chorus of chants outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we nominate Al Gore?'' a demonstrator asked on the protest
stage. ''No!'' the crowd responded. ''Is Al Gore the candidate of
the people?'' she asked. ''No!'' shouted the crowd, supporting
causes as diverse as animal rights, the environment and the plight
of immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people demonstrated peacefully inside a fenced
protest area, some listening to protest bands and dancing and
others holding candles. After the convention ended, the area
emptied, and activists marched north toward the country jail, where
many of the arrested protesters had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, demonstrators passed out vinegar and soaked it on
bandannas to fend off the effects of pepper spray. Others donned
gas masks.
</P>
<P>
   Police stood feet away, armed with guns that shoot pepper spray
and beanbags, in a tense standoff that eventually came to an end as
protesters moved away from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest rally bringing hundreds of demonstrators to the
downtown garment district to protest sweatshops and call for better
wages and health benefits for apparel workers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in the garment district watched from windows of sewing
shops, waving to the demonstrators and shaking their fists in the
air in support. The activists, many of them Hispanics who say
immigrants are often the victims of unfair labor practices, danced
in the street and sang Latin songs while marching to the Staples
Center convention hall under a heavy police presence.
</P>
<P>
   In other protests:
</P>
<P>
   -- About 200 demonstrators rallied in front of the downtown
federal building to protest training exercises on a U.S. Navy
bombing range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. Toting signs,
burning incense, banging drums and shaking rattles, protesters
marched in a circle and chanted ''no more bombs'' in Spanish and
English.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Pershing Square, a gathering place for demonstrators this
week, about 100 activists criticized Citibank for funding projects
they said were ruining the environment. The ''Spank the Bank''
protest moved about two blocks to Citibank Center downtown and
returned without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boycott Citigroup, the world's most destructive bank,'' read
stickers protesters pasted downtown.
</P>
<P>
   -- Environmental activists rallied in Century City, an area west
of downtown where Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore was
staying, and called for protection of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save it, don't pave it,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful protests came a day after bottle-throwing
protesters and baton-wielding police clashed briefly outside the
Staples Center arena.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, police had made 192 convention-related
arrests, the bulk of them for misdemeanor violations.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office charged two protesters with
felony vandalism Thursday, but said 40 others arrested during an
animal rights protest near the site of the Democratic National
Convention were released.

<HEADLINE> TV Analysts Deconstruct Gore Speech  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The pressure was on and Al Gore needed to
prove he could be a regular guy, hold the starch. And he did --
seven years ago as a very funny guest on David Letterman's ''Late
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up Thursday to accept the Democratic presidential
nomination, Gore faced the same task of using television to prevail
over his stiff image. For the most part, analysts said, he
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand here tonight as my own man and I want you to know me
as I truly am,'' Gore told the Democratic National Convention,
neatly fitting his almost hourlong speech into network primetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was there charm there. ... Was there humor? Did he end this
notion he's a wooden guy without any real personality?'' Fox News
Channel anchor Brit Hume asked his reporting crew.
</P>
<P>
   Replied Juan Williams, who watched the speech on TV: ''For the
viewers at home, this was Al Gore as a human being with a
determination and a passion that I haven't seen in many moons.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara Liasson seconded the thought. Gore ''came off as relaxed
and confident. ... How come he hasn't been campaigning and giving
speeches like this all along?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, who introduced her husband after boogeying on stage
for several minutes to a pop tune, was deemed ''pretty cool'' by
ABC's Peter Jennings, paraphrasing a remark by Gore daughter
Kristen.
</P>
<P>
   While Al Gore's delivery won praise, some felt the content fell
short.
</P>
<P>
   ''I honestly thought it was a disappointing speech from a
technical point of view. Is there a memorable line in the speech,''
said Fox News Channel analyst William Kristol, citing George Bush's
''Read my lips'' from 1988 as an example.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention wrapped, with red, white and blue balloons
raining down on delegates, CBS' Dan Rather couldn't resist taking a
last shot at the current, highly packaged state of such political
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   They are ''less a naked act of history than a flagrant act of
hyperbole. 'Popeil politics,' as in Ron Popeil, king of the TV
infomercial,'' he said. ''He invented the infomercial to sell his
household gadget. The Republicans and Democrats have made it their
own to sell their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let the buyer beware. Let the voter be informed,'' Rather said
sternly.
</P>
<P>
   Network scorn toward conventions led to reduced broadcast
coverage, with PBS and cable channels filling the void -- and ready
to poke through the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the Gore campaign worried about their man's likability?''
CNN's Jeff Greenfield asked Thursday. ''Oh, boy, are they. How can
you tell? Just look at who nominated him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Tommy Lee Jones, the Oscar-winning actor and Gore
college roommate. Describing Jones as the ''ultimate alpha male,''
Greenfield said Jones was intended to counter Gore's image as the
ultimate grind.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shot pool, and we watched 'Star Trek,' when maybe we should
have been studying for exams,'' Jones confessed to convention
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the soft drink commercial that avers ''Image is
nothing. Taste is everything,'' commentators suggested the two are
intertwined for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots sincerity was what Gore needed to project, said CNN
political analyst William Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to see a different Al Gore than we've seen in the
past. He's got to make the argument that he is a fighting populist
against the special interests,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   For the networks, however, populism couldn't hold a candle to
Hollywood glamour. Over the course of the four-day convention,
celebrities seemed to get as much air time as politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There was actor Richard Dreyfuss, explaining that while he had a
political adviser, he had no plans to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   There was model Christie Brinkley, being introduced by MSNBC's
Brian Williams as ''a delegate just like any other.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here as a mother. I'm not here as part of a Hollywood
contingent,'' said Brinkley, who described herself as a longtime
activist in her Sag Harbor, N.Y., neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On MSNBC, reporter Dana Kennedy made sport of the difference
between serious celebrity participants in Democratic politics such
as Warren Beatty and Barbra Streisand and the mere dabblers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You saw Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston out at many of the
parties around the convention with their matching highlighted hair
-- they're not really known for their deep social activism,''
Kennedy said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pledges 'Fairer' America  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore launched his fall campaign for the
presidency Thursday, pledging a ''better, fairer, more prosperous
America'' in the climactic speech of the Democratic National
Convention. After eight years as vice president, he said, ''I stand
here tonight as my own man'' ready to turn a new page at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been a distant figure during much of his four-day
convention, but he entered the hall to a thunderous ovation. He
delivered a 51-minute address, dense with policy proclamations,
drawing contrasts with Republicans on issues ranging from Social
Security to tax cuts to abortion and more.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the name of all the working families who are the strength
and soul of America,'' said Gore, ''I accept your nomination.''
Sounding a Democratic drumbeat, he added, ''If you entrust me with
the presidency, I will fight for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagging in the polls, the Democrats were taking off fast in the
campaign against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Gore and his vice
presidential candidate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman were flying overnight
to Wisconsin, the first stop on a post-convention boat trip on the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised President Clinton briefly at the beginning of his
remarks and the powerhouse economy of his presidency. Clinton was
at the White House, three thousand miles away, but cast a shadow
nonetheless, as word spread that a new federal grand jury had been
empaneled to hear evidence in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it plain he was looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we turn the page and write a new chapter. And that's what
I want to speak about tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president touched a wide range of domestic issues and
made only a brief mention of foreign affairs. He vowed to fight for
expanded health care, environmental protection, better education,
targeted tax cuts, campaign finance reform, prescription drugs for
Medicare recipients. There was more: a fight to stop kids from
smoking; hate crimes legislation, an end to racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the difference in this election,'' he said. ''They're
for the powerful,'' he said of the Republicans. ''We're for the
people. Big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical
companies, the HMOs. Sometimes you have to be willing to stand up
and say no, so families can have a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   After two terms as vice president, aides said Gore needed to
introduce himself to the voters anew, and emerge from Clinton's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my own imperfections,'' Gore said. ''I know that
sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight. But the
presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day
fight for people. Sometimes, you have to choose to do what's
difficult or unpopular. Sometimes, you have to be willing to spend
your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you to know this,'' Gore said. ''I've taken on the
powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll
stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president never mentioned Bush by name but the balloons
were still falling on the Democratic end-of-convention celebration
when the GOP launched a rebuttal. ''The working families of
American will not be well-served by more fighting in Washington,''
said spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''Yet Vice President Gore tonight
offers more of the same old language of class warfare, partisanship
and division.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew perhaps his loudest ovation of the night when he
pledged to protect abortion rights and said, ''The last thing this
country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns'' a woman's right
to choose. Bush got a similarly strong ovation at the recent
Republican convention when he vowed to sign legislation outlawing a
procedure known as partial birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not
asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have.
Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer,
more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand here tonight as may own man,'' he said, and at that,
cheers drowned out the rest of his sentence, ''I want you to know
me for who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I won't always be the most exciting politician,'' he
said. ''But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day
and I will never let you down.'' On cue thousands of red white and
blue balloons streamed down on the podium. Confetti filled the air
as Lieberman joined Gore on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The final remark provided only the wispiest reference to
Clinton's personal failings, but delegates got the point.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was important that he said I will never disappoint you. I
think that was a reference to Bill Clinton's scandal with Monica
Lewinsky. And I think people can trust him,'' said Susan Parker,
the Alabama state auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Even as delegates chanted ''Go Al go,'' the polls indicated that
Gore had his work cut out for him. Most surveys showed Bush with a
lead in the range of 10 percentage points. And some Democrats
grumbled privately that the early days of the convention had fallen
short of their own hopes as the Gore campaign maneuvered to
reassure core Democratic constituencies such as blacks and
liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was nominated by acclamation by the convention shortly
before Gore spoke, a step that sealed the Connecticut senator's
place in history as the first Jew on a major party ticket. ''Go
Joe, go,'' the delegates cheered in unison as he made an appearance
at the podium. ''I am humbled and I am grateful,'' he said. ''I am
proud to accept your nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's ascension was followed by speeches designed to flesh
out Gore's life story, from his roots as a senator's son in
Carthage, Tenn., to his education at Harvard, service in Vietnam
and time spent as a newspaper reporter. He got into politics in
1976, winning election to the House, then the Senate, and then, in
1992, the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore introduced her husband, cheered loudly by the
delegates. She danced on stage to the pulsating beat that filled
the hall before she began to speak. ''Al has always been there for
our family and he will always be there for yours,'' she promised.
An avid photographer, she displayed family photos and jokingly
asked delegates not to head for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush agreed with Democrats that it was unfair that the
Clinton legal entanglements would emerge on the day of Gore's big
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made
on the day that the vice president is going to accept the
Democratic nomination,'' said senior Bush strategist Karen Hughes.
''This election is not about the past; it's about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a vacation while Democrats held their convention,
Bush was returning to the campaign. Aides said that he would travel
Friday to Tennessee, Gore's home state, and that the Republicans
were ready for five debates this fall, three between the top men on
the ticket, and two by the vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convention hall, protesters registered their dissent
to Gore's ascension.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we nominate Al Gore?'' a demonstrator asked on the protest
stage. ''No!'' the crowd responded. ''Is Al Gore the candidate of
the people?'' she asked. ''No!'' shouted the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore sketched an agenda of issues he hopes will
erase Bush's lead in the polls. He said the federal budget surplus
makes possible ''a full range of targeted tax cuts to working
families. Not just to help them save for college, but to pay for
health insurance or child care, to reform the estate tax ... and to
end the marriage penalty -- the right way, the fair way.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a jab at Bush and the Republicans in Congress: ''Let me
say plainly. I will not go along with a huge tax cut for the
wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our good economy
in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates who heard the speech expressed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who are leaning to (Green Party candidate Ralph Nader)
who heard this speech will be thinking twice. He showed a real
energy. He clearly made the distinction that Al Gore is his own
person,'' said State Rep. Mark Pocan of Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said, ''I would have been a little
tougher on George W. Bush. George W. Bush clearly lacks the
experience to lead the country. But it's clear the vice president
wants to keep things positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his national audience he was appealing for their votes
''on the basis of the better, fairer, more prosperous America we
can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters were hoping that Americans would come to appreciate
Gore as a man separate from his vice presidential identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the rest of the nation can see the real guy that I've
known for 15 years,'' said Steve Ehrhart of Memphis as he rode a
bus to a convention-city picnic. ''The guy who loves good music and
knows who is singing the song. The guy who likes to have a beer
occasionally. The guy with a true family fun side that is so little
known to the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats wondered about the Clinton legal development.
''It's probably just another Republican dirty trick,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew to take a place on a major party
ticket, met before the evening convention session with moderates
and acknowledged, ''This is not going to be an easy election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign strategists set an unusually early departure for
the ticketmates, and Air Force Two was flying them to Wisconsin a
few hours after the traditional balloon drop closed out the
convention. The two men begin a campaign boat trip on the
Mississippi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, though, there was one final convention city
fund-raiser. Party officials said they hoped to take in $5 million
with Gore and Lieberman as the key attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters returned to the streets during the day, as they had
every day of the convention, denouncing big business and promising
to greet Gore's acceptance speech with a chorus of shouts, chants
and drumbeats. In all, police said they had made 192
convention-related arrests as Thursday dawned.

<HEADLINE> Verizon negotiations continue past deadline  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Talks to settle a 12-day-old strike by 87,000
Verizon Communications phone workers continued past a midnight
Thursday deadline set by union negotiators, who had threatened to
leave the bargaining table unless significant progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, the
larger of the two unions bargaining here, said that the two sides
were making good headway on resolving key union concerns. Those
include the movement of work to areas of cheaper labor and
mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we're beginning to see more substantive
bargaining tonight than we have in quite a while,'' Jeff Miller
said. He expected the CWA representatives, bargaining on behalf of
more than 72,000 employees, to continue talking into the early
hours and resume later Friday. ''We're going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions officials said they were awaiting an updated contract
package that the company had put together and felt it was worth
continuing talks to review the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me they had significant changes on the major
proposals. It makes no sense to leave if they have them,'' said
Myles Calvey, negotiator for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW represents about 14,700 workers in these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the deadline, the company said it had
''fine-tuned'' its contract proposal, but would give no details.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had talked about wanting to see substantial progress, and
I think we are seeing substantial progress,'' said Verizon
spokesman Eric Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   The strike of repair and customer service workers, which began
Aug. 6, affects 25 million Verizon consumers from Maine to
Virginia. Regular phone service is not affected, but the strike has
slowed directory assistance calls and requests for new service and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed by the June merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe of Verizon said Thursday afternoon that the threatened
walkout by union negotiators could give all parties greater
incentive to wrap up the protracted talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's helpful to have a deadline,'' he said. ''It
gets people focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe noted that Verizon is one of the nation's few big
telecommunications companies with a substantial unionized work
force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, we're the good guys from the standpoint of union
workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said Verizon had about 100,000 pending requests for
repairs, about 20,000 more than a week ago and more than three
times the usual number of requests. Storm damage has added to the
repair load, Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, police in Baldwin, N.Y., said two striking
Verizon workers were in critical condition after cutting an
electric cable in an apparent attempt to sever a telephone line.
The men were charged with criminal tampering and criminal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Police released details of a second incident on Long Island, in
which a striking employee was charged with reckless endangerment
for allegedly forcing a Bell Atlantic van off the Long Island
Expressway on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has taken out full-page ads in several newspapers
explaining the dispute to customers. One ad, in Thursday's New York
Times, said of the strike, ''Nobody's winning. Not our company. Not
our customers. Not the union. Not our employees, the very people we
need to keep us competitive in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Judge to decide whether patients can sue industry  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - A federal judge must decide whether patient
complaints listed in a lawsuit against the managed care industry go
beyond any flaws in the nation's HMO laws.
</P>
<P>
   The industry asked U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno on
Thursday to throw out the lawsuit against Humana Inc., which may
serve as a national vehicle for grievances against institutional
health care. He said a ruling would take at least five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The patients are led by Dickie Scruggs, who beat Big Tobacco in
state lawsuits, and David Boies, the Justice Department's top
private attorney on the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Patients charge health insurers are bribing their staffs to
reject claims to save money rather than for medical reasons. They
also say lists of physicians covered by health care plans are
intentionally bloated with nonparticipants, listed specialists are
not necessarily covered within networks, and the internal appeals
process is intended to exhaust patients ''until they go away,''
Scruggs said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry relies on decisions as recent as Tuesday by other
courts that strike down the legal underpinnings of lawsuits against
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No court has ever sustained a claim like this,'' said Humana
attorney Robert Eccles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many hurdles the plaintiffs must overcome here to
survive with any piece of this case,'' said John Beisner, another
Humana attorney. He rejected the patients' claims as ''a direct
attack on the HMO system'' and said Congress is trying to address
the issues with patients rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' lawyers argued the lawsuit went beyond compliance with
federal health care laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our case, we say that Humana lied about the kind of
coverage they were providing,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs added, ''Our case is a challenge to the execution of the
plans, execution of a congressionally mandated scheme in
inappropriate ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge suggested dismissing the case ''as a practical
approach'' and allowing the federal appeals court in Atlanta to
decide whether the lawsuit should stay alive. He also said he might
put the case on hold until Sept. 22 when a panel of federal judges
hears objections to him hearing an industry-wide case.
</P>
<P>
   If he keeps the lawsuit intact, he would have to decide another
underlying legal issue later, whether it meets the standard for
grouping patients under a single class-action.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno also is hearing cases against Aetna, Cigna, Foundation
Health Systems, PacifiCare Health Systems, Prudential and United
HealthCare.

<HEADLINE> Striking Verizon workers -- and their kids -- rally in New York and New Jersey </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Children of all ages joined thousands of
striking workers Thursday outside Verizon Communications buildings
across New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mommy needs a job so she can pay her bills and my
tuition,'' said 8-year-old Khyree Griffin, who wore a bright red
union T-shirt as he joined a Brooklyn protest of about 1,000 people
on the 12th day of the strike by the Communications Workers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company has to see that we have families. There are kids
involved, and all we want is a fair contract,'' said Khyree's mom,
customer service representative Chiffon Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The rallies came while the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers and the CWA said they would walk away from talks
after a midnight deadline, unless an agreement was reached or
substantial progress could be reported.
</P>
<P>
   However, bargainers for both unions continued to talk with
Verizon after the deadline had passed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Communications Workers of America said that
the two sides had made good headway on resolving key union
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions remained.
</P>
<P>
   Although the strikers said they stood firm on their demands for
increased job security and other issues, many said surviving
without salaries was getting tougher on families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been living on savings, but it's getting thin,'' said
Dominique Feldra, a technician, who stood beside her 10-year-old
son Davon.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Chang, also a technician, said he supports his elderly
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father warned me to save up in case there was a strike, but
now we're deep into the second week and it's getting tough,'' he
said, looking on as clowns and face painters tried to keep the kids
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Workers and their families chanted ''No contract, no work'' and
''No compromisin' with Verizon,'' as union leaders urged them to
pester non-striking workers and to hold tight to their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies and picket lines were also held in Staten Island, Port
Jefferson, Garden City and 18 other New York cities, as well as Red
Bank, Dunellen and Union in New Jersey. No arrests or violence were
reported, said New York Police Sgt. Brian Burke.
</P>
<P>
   But in Baldwin, Long Island, two striking Verizon Communications
workers were listed in critical condition after they allegedly cut
what they thought was a phone cable, but instead was an electric
cable.
</P>
<P>
   And in Jericho, Long Island, a striker was facing reckless
endangerment charges after allegedly forcing a Bell Atlantic
Company van off the Long Island Expressway with his Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, meanwhile, put out radio ads in the New York area
telling the company's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   IBEW represents nearly 87,000 employees, whose contract expired
Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   CWA, which has two sets of negotiators bargaining in Washington,
said at least one of those groups plans to leave the talks at
midnight. It includes representatives of New England and New York
workers.
</P>
<P>
   CWA represents more than 72,000 striking workers.

<HEADLINE> Martin Sutphin, longtime AP editor and mentor to generations, dies at 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Martin D. Sutphin, a retired supervising editor
for The Associated Press who helped coordinate coverage from the
Cuban missile crisis through the Clinton years, died of cancer
Thursday. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin, a resident of Rutherford, N.J., died at Hackensack
University Medical Center in New Jersey. He had overcome prostate
cancer after his retirement in December 1996 and was diagnosed with
abdominal cancer two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin worked for more than 30 years on the AP's General Desk
in New York, which oversees coverage of national and international
news.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely admired for maintaining his calm through the most
hectic breaking stories, including the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
the Kennedy and King assassinations, the civil rights upheavals,
moon landings, Watergate and the Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton
years.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how big the crisis, AP reporters and editors across
the country seeking guidance from Sutphin would encounter a soft,
steady voice, careful judgment and exquisite courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marty hid an editor's steel behind a genial facade,'' said
Louis D. Boccardi, the AP's president and chief executive officer.
''His steady and quiet hand led the desk through tumultuous
decades, with a grin more readily than a growl, and helped train
and inspire generations that succeeded him.''
</P>
<P>
   James P. Willse, a former AP colleague and now editor of The
Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., said Sutphin ''would guide the most
complicated news stories - including AP's national election
coverage - without missing a beat. He loved the AP, and the men and
women of AP loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mears, an AP vice president and columnist, once referred
to Sutphin as the ''silent partner'' in the Pulitzer Prize that
Mears won for coverage of the 1976 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin had edited many of Mears' stories, and Mears recalled
that Sutphin ''always made the copy better and with a gentle
Sutphin touch and style that made a writer love his editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wolman, the AP's executive editor who worked with
Sutphin for more than 20 years, said he had ''an almost saintly
countenance. ... He always seemed to get the best from the
reporters and copy desk under his command. And in a worldwide
outfit, he was for many years the glue that turned our far-flung
work into a coherent news report.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin was born on Oct. 12, 1930, in Hightstown, N.J. His
father died when Sutphin was 12, and he attended Rutgers
University, New Jersey's state university, on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the Cape May County Gazette, a New Jersey weekly,
and served two years in the Army before joining the AP in
Annapolis, Md., in 1956. He was transferred to Baltimore three
years later and to the General Desk in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   For many years he was the desk supervisor, dealing directly with
breaking news. His title was news editor of the General Desk when
he retired.
</P>
<P>
   In Rutherford, he was well known as a former softball and Little
League coach and longtime supporter of youth athletics.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement party in 1996, Sutphin spoke about how lucky
he felt to work at the AP through the years. Quoting one of his
favorites, Casey Stengel, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is just a game, and I played it with the best.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joyce Rosenberg, AP assistant
business editor; daughters Kathleen and Martha; a son, Michael; and
five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A private service will be held. Plans for a public memorial are
pending. The family asked that flowers not be sent and will
announce a list of charities where donations can be made in memory
of Sutphin.

<HEADLINE> Suspect could get life imprisonment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRETNA, La. (AP) - A Jefferson Parish grand jury has indicted
Paul Will on aggravated kidnapping charges, alleging he abducted a
teen-ager from a suburban New Orleans mall last month and forced
her to drive with him to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Will, 27, of North Cape May, N.J., had initially faced lesser
charges of second-degree kidnapping and armed robbery which, if
convicted, could have landed him in prison for more than 99 years.
But the sentencing guidelines under those charges also granted the
court some leeway to sentence Will to a much shorter term.
</P>
<P>
   Under the grand jury's charge Thursday, Will would be sent to
prison for life if convicted without any chance for early release.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities and Will's family, Will took a
Greyhound bus to New Orleans in late July to make an unannounced
visit to an ex-girlfriend, a Tulane Medical School student. But
after she refused to take him in, police said, Will became upset.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, July 24, Will got a ride to Lakeside Shopping
Center in Metairie, where his ex-girlfriend works part time. There,
about 7 a.m., police said, he crawled into Nicole Madere's car,
brandished a loaded revolver and started driving her car to
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Madere, an 18-year-old sophomore at Louisiana State University,
said that during the 1,200-mile ride Will talked a lot about
committing suicide. She also said he promised from the beginning to
let her go unharmed, a promise that police said Will kept 18 hours
later when he let her get out of the car in downtown Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Will, who has no criminal background, has suffered
from heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Will remains in a Philadelphia detention center, refusing to
return to Louisiana. But Jefferson Parish District Attorney Paul
Connick Jr. said his office plans to extradite him in the coming
weeks, using a governor's warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Schneider said prosecutors plan
to file extradition documents Monday. He said they'll send them
through the U.S. attorney's office in New Orleans, which will
review them and then pass them along to Gov. Foster in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   If approved as expected, Foster will send Will's extradition
papers to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who, more than likely, will
order Will released into Jefferson Parish custody.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider doesn't expect any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it's happened,'' he said. ''But I've never heard of a
governor refusing to grant extradition, if all the documents are in
order.''

Al Gore Pledges 'Fairer' America
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore launched his fall quest for the White House
Thursday, pledging a ''better, fairer, more prosperous America'' in the
climactic speech of the Democratic National Convention. Acknowledging ''my own
imperfections'' he said nonetheless, ''I stand here tonight as my own man,''
after eight years as vice president. In the final minutes of his convention,
Gore entered the hall to a thunderous ovation. ''In the name of all the working
families who are the strength and soul of America,'' he said, ''I accept your
nomination.''

Protests Continue at Convention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- About 2,500 activists poured into the streets Thursday
for the last day of the Democratic convention, protesting environmental
destruction and greeting Al Gore's big speech with a chorus of chants outside
the convention hall. Most of the people demonstrated peacefully inside a fenced
protest area, some listening to protest bands and dancing and others holding
candles. After the convention ended, the area emptied, and activists marched
north toward the country jail, where many of the arrested protesters had been
taken.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks to settle a 12-day-old strike by 87,000 Verizon
Communications phone workers continued past a midnight Thursday deadline set by
union negotiators, who had threatened to leave the bargaining table unless
significant progress was made. A spokesman for the Communications Workers of
America, the larger of the two unions bargaining here, said that the two sides
were making good headway on resolving key union concerns. Those include the
movement of work to areas of cheaper labor and mandatory overtime.

Dutch Citizens Deny Plot To Kill Milosevic

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Four Dutch citizens arrested for allegedly
plotting to kill President Slobodan Milosevic have vehemently denied the
accusation, their lawyers said Thursday. The four Dutchmen -- Jeroen van Lersel,
Bas van Schaik, Sander Zeitsen and Godfrid de Rie -- were arrested last month on
suspicion of plotting to kill Milosevic. They were sentenced Friday to 30 days
in jail for illegally entering the country, Dutch officials said, but remained
under investigation and will probably face further charges.

Tutu Returns to South Africa

   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading activist
in the struggle against apartheid, returned home from a two-year sabbatical in
the United States Thursday, saying he planned to take a well-deserved rest.
''It's so wonderful to be back -- it's enough to move one to tears,'' he told
reporters after arriving at Cape Town's airport. Tutu, who underwent surgery for
prostate cancer in November last year, said his recovery had been slower than
expected and pledged to maintain a low profile.

New Grand Jury To Hear Lewinsky Case

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray has empaneled a new grand
jury to hear evidence against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal
as he tries to determine if criminal charges are warranted, legal sources said
Thursday, and the news angered Democrats on the night Vice President Al Gore was
to accept the party's presidential nomination at its convention in Los Angeles.
''It's probably just another Republican dirty trick,'' Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., said. The move follows through on Ray's promise to consider whether the
president should be indicted after he steps down from office next January. Legal
experts cautioned the decision doesn't mean charges will ever be filed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Sub Rescue Appears Hopeless  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Rescue efforts Friday to find any survivors on a
shattered submarine looked increasingly hopeless after Russian
officials said the crew probably had no time to escape a
''catastrophe that developed at lightning speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The pessimistic assessments came after a film of the crippled
Kursk showed massive damage, reaching from the bow to the conning
tower, which was much more extensive than earlier thought.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said there was no sign of life Friday among the
118 men aboard the wreck of the nuclear submarine trapped 350 feet
below the surface of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, the head of a government
commission that reviewed the rescue effort Thursday, said there was
a ''terrifying hole'' on the starboard side of the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ''A rather big part of the crew was in the part of the boat that
was hit by the catastrophe that developed at lightning speed,''
Klebanov told reporters in Murmansk, home of the Russian Northern
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been no sounds for quite a long time'' from within
the Kursk, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Both Klebanov and the Navy commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov,
have said that any survivors were expected to run out of oxygen
Friday, but other high-ranking naval officers have given them much
longer. On Thursday, Klebanov declined to say how much air could
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alexander Podrazhansky, a veteran underwater craft
pilot, said survivors could be poisoned by excessive carbonic acid
in the air -- which causes hallucinations and mental disorders -- and
experience a nervous breakdown after spending days in darkness, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Four Russian rescue capsules working in turns again failed
Friday to reach the partially flooded submarine. For the past four
days, strong currents stopped them latching on to the Kursk and
clouds of silt reduced visibility on the bottom to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the rescue problems, Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo
said the Kursk was slowly sinking into the mud. He said it ''does
not significantly impact the rescue operation,'' but the submarine
is already leaning at a sharp angle, impeding rescue work.
</P>
<P>
   After resisting Western offers of assistance for days, Russia
earlier in the week turned to Norway and Britain. But the British
and Norwegian rescue teams were not expected to reach the rescue
site until Saturday at the earliest. A British navy team with a
sophisticated rescue submarine was heading to the area on a ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Navy's deputy chief of staff, Vice Adm. Alexander
Pobozhy, was to meet Friday with NATO officials in Brussels to
discuss technical aspects of their assistance, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have not determined how the Kursk got into
trouble and the likely sequence of events, including one or more
explosions in the front of the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said evidence suggested the submarine, which was taking
part in naval exercises off Russia's northern coast, hit an
unspecified ''huge, heavy object,'' about 66 feet below the surface
and plunged to the sea bottom in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But officials could not explain how a highly sophisticated
submarine, filled with advanced electronic guidance systems, could
crash into a large object. Submarines use radar and other guiding
devices that allow them to spot objects many miles away under
water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have offered various explanations for what happened on
Aug. 12, including a collision with a ship, an internal explosion
or even contact with a World War II mine. There have been no
reports of other ships being damaged and the U.S. Navy has said its
vessels in the area were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines monitoring Russian Navy exercises when the Kursk
was lost detected two explosions at the time, U.S. officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The second explosion was much
larger than the first, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A likely scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
torpedo compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion
in the compartment which is packed with torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk can carry up to 28 torpedoes and anti-submarine
missiles, each with warheads weighing up to 1,000 pounds. A blast
involving even a few torpedoes would have caused catastrophic
damage.

<HEADLINE> Abbie Hoffman's Spirit Lingers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Abbie Hoffman is gone, but the Yippie
prankster's spirit lingers with the closing of the latest
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A new movie tracing Hoffman's 1960s activism, odd romantic life
and years as a fugitive, is hitting theaters Friday. ''Steal This
Movie'' stars Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman, Janeane Garofalo as his
wife, Anita, and Jeanne Tripplehorn as his common-law wife, Johanna
Lawrenson.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the Chicago Seven trial and 11 years after
Hoffman's death, the scene outside this summer's Democratic
gathering at times curiously resembled the giddy anarchy in which
Hoffman played a leading role during the 1968 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Police in riot gear, rubber bullets fired at protesters,
officers on horseback chasing off demonstrators. Protesters on
bicycles, demonstrators carrying puppets, musical statements by
Rage Against the Machine and Bonnie Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Abbie would be joyous,'' said Robert Greenwald, producer and
director of ''Steal This Movie,'' whose title was borrowed from
Hoffman's book ''Steal This Book.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He would have been dancing down the street, rocking and
rolling with Rage Against the Machine, singing backup to Bonnie
Raitt, making the puppets. ... He stood for changing the world but
having fun while doing it. Making love and still making a
revolution,'' said Greenwald, who got to know Hoffman while the
activist was on the run from cocaine charges in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the movie's links to the past is Troy Garity, who
plays his father, Tom Hayden, one of Hoffman's Chicago Seven
co-defendants. (Garity was actually struck by a rubber bullet
outside this week's convention, sustaining a welt on his wrist.)
</P>
<P>
   Garity said he happened to see the movie's script on his
father's dining room table a few years ago and decided he wanted to
be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it would be fun to re-enact that,'' Garity said.
''It's an important story to be told, and I felt very fortunate as
an actor to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Steal This Movie'' traces Hoffman's beginnings as a
buttoned-down campus activist whose clean-cut look prompts a
student to call him a narc. The film follows his development into a
wild-haired social trickster who organized the ''levitation'' of
the Pentagon by anti-war protesters and tossed dollar bills on the
floor of the stock exchange to send brokers scrambling for the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The movie depicts the circus-like Chicago Seven trial, when
Hoffman, Hayden, Jerry Rubin and others were accused of conspiracy
to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Black
Panther Party leader Bobby Seale was chained and gagged during the
trial, while other defendants donned judicial robes to mock the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The real focus of the movie is Hoffman's private life: the love
triangle among him, Anita Hoffman and Lawrenson; and a persecution
complex that stemmed from federal surveillance and manic
depression.

   ''I didn't see this as a biopic,'' D'Onofrio said. ''I see it as
a drama. It's about the emotional life of the man. I think a lot of
people know what he stood for, but I don't think many knew about
all these things that went on in his private life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's death at 52 in 1989 was ruled a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In his spirit, the filmmakers have been lending ''Steal This
Movie'' for screenings to benefit Planned Parenthood, Refuse &AMP;
Resist and other social groups.
</P>
<P>
   Near the movie's end, an older, more reserved Hoffman speaks to
jurors at a trial of student activists. He begins by addressing
jurors, then turns to the courtroom crowd and finally speaks
directly into the camera, delivering an exhortation to filmgoers to
act on their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted him reaching out beyond the courtroom, to the people
beyond the camera,'' Greenwald said. ''Through that, through the
benefit screenings, the movie is trying to do what Abby did his
whole life. He made protesting for social change interesting, he
made it exciting. He had an enormous gift to entertain and
motivate.''

<HEADLINE> Reiner Ignored at Calif. Delegation  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Meathead gets no respect.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner, the director and comic actor who portrayed a
character nicknamed ''Meathead'' on the television show ''All in
the Family,'' chatted up Al Gore's candidacy to California
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner refused to get discouraged that only a few dozen
delegates stood to applaud him out of hundreds in the room. He also
wouldn't allow the din of breakfast conversation over fruit cups
and french toast drown him out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a partial standing-O. That's OK. It's hard to stand up
when you're having a fruit cocktail,'' he said. ''I'm going to keep
talking anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner directed movies ''Stand By Me,'' ''When Harry Met Sally''
and ''Misery,'' which state Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres
said is how Republican George W. Bush would feel after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner praised Gore's proposals to improve education, expand
access to health care and control guns as reasons to elect him for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The noise continued throughout his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you're eating now and not paying attention, but you
will on the day of the election,'' he said. ''You will pay
attention.''
</P>

   Christie Brinkley was a model of political savvy Thursday at the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model and her husband,
Peter Cook, urged voters to look past the superficial and focus on
voting records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really happy to have the opportunity to get the word
out,'' she told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, who in recent years has taken on the role of
environmental activist, said she was attending the convention to a
citizen rather than a celebrity. She's also a member of the New
York delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a mother of three. I worry when I send my children to
school ... about the access to guns,'' she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy has his own Hollywood cachet.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont senator was the most sought-after celebrity at a
post-convention party Wednesday night featuring rock star Sheryl
Crow at Hollywood's Sunset Room.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard about the concert, I called Pat to get me a
ticket,'' said Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, a percussionist
from one of Leahy's favorite bands.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Hart wasn't the only celebrity musician cashing in on
a friendship with the Vermont senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mary Chapin Carpenter called me for a ticket to get in,''
Leahy said. ''I try to help out how I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Vermont delegates and guests from other states,
the bash also drew a hefty political lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is it. This is the place to be tonight,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who says he shares Sheryl Crow CDs
with his three children, ages 29, 26 and 20. ''People have been
talking about this party all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the evening's featured performer lauded Leahy's hipness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hanging out with Senator Leahy is like being around a lot of
rock stars,'' she said before launching into her hour-long concert
of acoustic and electric tunes.
</P>
<P>
   While partygoers just wanted to have some fun, the shindig did
have a purpose -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's
tribute to Leahy for his efforts in banning anti-personnel land
mines.

   Never a wallflower, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy got in on
the act with a seven-piece mariachi band that played Thursday at a
California delegation breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy put his arms around the black-suited musicians in
oversized red ties, warbling along in Spanish with a Boston accent.
Delegates clapped along rhythmically.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy later described haltingly in Spanish how he once studied
the language for a short time in school, then said he would give
the rest of his speech supporting Al Gore in English.
</P>
<P>
   The mariachis also played for California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who
danced to the podium with state Democratic Party Chairman Art
Torres.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be serenaded by such romantic music so early in the morning
-- I can't stand it,'' Boxer said. ''That was very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the morning's last speakers was San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown, who wondered why he didn't get music with his
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Art, where is the ... music?'' Brown asked, prompting a
mariachi reprise.

<HEADLINE> Churches Make It Hard for New Bars  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- In a city better known for encouraging sin
rather than salvation, dozens of churches are making it tough for
new bars or nightclubs to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   Some say a new ordinance that bans the sale of alcohol near
churches is hampering efforts to breathe new economic life into
west Las Vegas -- a pocket of poverty untouched by casino glitz. The
area is home to 176 churches, some set up in small storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an area of town that is in desperate need of some
redevelopment,'' City Councilman Lawrence Weekly, who represents
west Las Vegas, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, passed by the City Council with little fanfare in
December, restricts alcohol sales within 400 feet of a church.
Taverns are restricted within 1,500 of a church.
</P>
<P>
   Existing bars and stores were grandfathered in, but they cannot
expand or keep their liquor licenses if they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly believes many developers simply haven't proposed new bars
or stores in the area because of the ordinance. He has also has had
complaints from convenience stores that have lost their liquor
licenses and now can't reapply.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's the churches causing the problems,'' said
Sarann Knight Preddy, president of the Jackson Street Redevelopment
Co. ''They had nothing to do with the ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and 1950s, west Las Vegas was known for its clubs --
places such as the Harlem Club, Brown Derby and Ebony Club. Many
black performers, including Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole and
Sammy Davis Jr., headlined on the Strip, but were forced to stay at
west Las Vegas boarding houses.
</P>
<P>
   West Las Vegas is regarded as the start of segregation in the
city and remains predominantly black today. Now, it is often
overlooked and has decayed, becoming infested with gangs and drugs.
Few developers have been interested in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Preddy's nonprofit group and others are working to revitalize
the neighborhood, but the ordinance is thwarting people who have
purchased land in the area and want to open clubs and other
alcohol-selling businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''They won't be able to carry their dreams out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Preddy suggests the churches, her group and government officials
work out some kind of agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For the churches, keeping out bars doesn't seem that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ''You only hear it in Las Vegas,'' the Rev. Harold Dorsey,
pastor of the Neway Church of God in Christ, said Thursday. His
church, located across from a grocery store that sells alcohol, has
been in the neighborhood for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He believes there are enough clubs and bars in the city and
doesn't see why limiting bars would limit redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crazy,'' said the Rev. S.C. Hooks, pastor of the Great
Commission Interdenominational Church and a member of the West Las
Vegas Neighborhood Council. ''We've got a lot of casinos, but we
still got to raise our children here.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just the law and they'll just have to abide by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekly is sympathetic and understands that quality of life is
important, but isn't sure what the answer is.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always room for discussion. If it calls for changing
something to make it work, that's open for discussion,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Many Jewish 'Firsts' in U.S. Govt.  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice presidential hopeful Joseph Lieberman isn't
the first Jewish political figure to face questions about how he
would carry out his duties on holy days. Legend has it that George
Washington appealed for funds to financier Haym Salomon on the
highest of holy days, Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon, it is said, suspended services in the synagogue upon
learning of the desperate request, secured pledges from congregants
and then proceeded with observances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story has a ring of credibility,'' says Michael Feldberg,
director of the American Jewish Historical Society in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish-born Salomon contributed much of his own fortune to
help finance the American Revolution, found buyers for unsecured
bonds issued by the fledgling U.S. government and lent money to
members of the Continental Congress. During the British occupation
of New York, twice he was arrested as a spy and imprisoned. He died
penniless in 1785,having never held a government position.
</P>
<P>
   It would be many years before Jews would make inroads
politically. Well into the 19th century, laws in many places said
no person could hold public office without taking an oath affirming
the divinity of Jesus. (Salomon, who served on the governing
council of a Philadelphia synagogue, helped repeal that city's test
oath.)
</P>
<P>
   Even when Jews escaping persecution in Russia began arriving in
large numbers in the 1880s, they were slow to enter politics. The
Irish, who already spoke the language, got involved early in public
life, Feldberg notes. But most immigrant Jews distrusted the
political system and, until World War II, shunned public attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were positive that anti-Semitism lurked just beneath the
surface, so they made sure nothing they did aroused that monster,''
writes Melvin Urofsky, a history professor at Virginia Commonwealth
University, in a historical essay.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1841 that Congress got its first Jewish member, when
David Levy Yulee was chosen as a delegate representing the
territory of Florida. He was elected senator for the newly admitted
state of Florida in 1845. In 1851, Emanuel Bernard Hart of New York
became the first Jewish member of the House. In 1925, Florence Prag
Kahn of California became the first Jewish woman representative,
according to Kurt. F. Stone, author of ''The Congressional Minyan:
The Jews of Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Yulee, the son of an eccentric land speculator who twice tried
to found a Jewish homeland in Florida, told people he wasn't really
Jewish but instead was a descendant of Moroccan royalty, Stone
says. Yulee married the Christian daughter of the U.S. postmaster
general.
</P>
<P>
   Judah Philip Benjamin, a senator from Louisiana, was better
known as secretary of state of the Confederate States. He worked
closely with President Jefferson Davis. And at times when Davis was
ill, says Feldberg, Benjamin ''almost singlehandedly ran the
Confederacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin did not practice his Judaism and married a Christian
woman, who buried him in a Catholic cemetery in France. Still,
Feldberg says that during his lifetime, Benjamin's Christian
contemporaries never let him forget his roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wherever he went, he was accused of being a Jewish devil,''
said Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of the 20th century brought the first Jewish cabinet
member: Oscar Solomon Straus, a member of one of the nation's most
prominent German Jewish families, leaders in international finance.
He became secretary of commerce and labor under President Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Straus declined when Roosevelt offered to make him secretary of
the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was afraid too close an association of Jews and money would
be bad for the image of Jews,'' Feldberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Straus, he says, was subjected to ''the polite anti-Semitism of
the upper classes,'' working but not socializing with Christians.
Though not observant, he supported Jewish causes and lobbied on
behalf of Jewish refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Among later Jewish Cabinet members, Henry Morgenthau served as
treasury secretary during the New Deal and Henry Kissinger was
secretary of state under presidents Nixon and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Louis D. Brandeis faced little blatant anti-Semitism while
working as a lawyer until 1916, when President Woodrow Wilson
nominated him to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came out of the woodwork,'' Feldberg says, noting
anti-Semitic remarks by senators at his confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis had a ''distaste for formal religion'' and had little
to do with organized Jewish life, Urofsky writes. Still, he was
''hailed by American Jews as ... a Moses'' because of his work on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, many presidents have had informal advisers
who were Jewish. Among the best-known was Bernard Baruch, counselor
to presidents from Wilson to John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Jewish immigrant who fled East Prussia, he became a
stock market speculator in the late 1800s. By time he was 30, he
was a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, President Wilson appointed him to the seven-man
Advisory Commission of the Council for National Defense, and during
World War I, he was named chairman of the War Industries Board.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, Al Gore's choice as a Democratic running mate, was
not the first Jew offered a chance at the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, who had been JFK's secretary of health,
education and welfare, turned down Sen. George McGovern's
invitation to be his running mate in 1972, according to Stone.
</P>
<P>
   To date there have been 26 Jewish senators and 147 Jewish
members of the House, according to Sandy Maisel, government
professor at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, and author of
''Jews in American Politics,'' to be released next year. Stone says
the number is close to 179 if you include converts from Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism has been on the decline for the past two decades,
according to polls taken by the American Jewish Committee and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Feldberg says, many Americans ''have an innocent
ignorance'' about what it means to be Jewish -- an ignorance
Lieberman's selection is already helping to dispel by his open
expression of his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, says Feldberg, everyone will know what Jews do on the
Sabbath.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Suit Given to Clinton Judge  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawsuit brought by Linda Tripp against the
government has been taken away from a Reagan-appointed judge who is
a thorn in the side of the administration and is now in the hands
of a judge appointed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The move, a victory for the Clinton administration, drew strong
objections from lawyers for Tripp, whose secret tape recordings of
Monica Lewinsky triggered the impeachment crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is overwhelming evidence demonstrating that the Clinton
administration illegally leaked information from Mrs. Tripp's
security file and subjected her to an unprecedented smear campaign
because she blew the whistle on illegal conduct committed by
President Clinton and others,'' Tripp's lawyers said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Three federal judges appointed by Clinton took the lawsuit filed
by Tripp away from U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan
appointee, and randomly assigned the case by computer. The computer
assigned it to Judge Emmet Sullivan, one of the three judges on the
calendar committee who had taken the case away from Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   The odds were high that a random selection would yield a
Democratic-appointed judge because nine of the 13 federal court
judges were appointed by Clinton, three are Republican appointees
and one was appointed by President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawsuit alleges the government illegally released to The
New Yorker information showing Tripp stated on a security clearance
form that she had never been arrested, when in fact she had. She
was arrested for grand larceny when she was a teen-ager and pleaded
innocent. A judge disposed of the case by reducing the charge to
loitering.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, a Pentagon employee, is suing Pentagon spokesman Ken
Bacon and the administration as a result of the release of the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth has been critical of the Clinton administration. He
ruled in March that the president had committed a criminal
violation of the Privacy Act by releasing his private
correspondence with Kathleen Willey to cast doubt on her allegation
that Clinton had made an unwelcome sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Last September when Tripp's lawyers filed the lawsuit, they
asked that the case be given to Lamberth on the grounds that it was
related to a suit already before Lamberth involving hundreds of
former appointees from Republican administrations whose FBI
background files were collected by the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Related cases ordinarily are assigned to the same judge in the
interest of efficient use of judicial resources.
</P>
<P>
   But the three Clinton judges said the two cases ''are quite
different,'' with the FBI files matter being a class action
alleging a broad pattern of White House and FBI abuse and the Tripp
case involving a single plaintiff and one incident.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove the case from Lamberth's control comes
amid a judicial investigation into why the chief federal judge in
the District of Columbia, Norma Holloway Johnson, bypassed the
computer system and directed half a dozen criminal prosecutions of
campaign fund-raisers and friends of Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore to Clinton-appointed judges.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Council, which oversees judges' conduct, took the
rare step of hiring a former U.S. attorney to investigate the
matter. That investigation is in its fourth month. The Associated
Press first reported Johnson's decision to bypass the random
assignment system last year.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quakes Hit Japan Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Three strong earthquakes rocked the Tokyo area
Friday, leaving at least one person injured and causing minor
damage from falling rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The first earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.0, hit
at 4:53 a.m. and was centered near Tokyo, about 25 miles below the
ground. A 62-year-old woman broke her shoulder in a fall, said
Tokyo Fire Department spokesman Keita Kaneko.
</P>
<P>
   That quake was followed by two more, the first with a
preliminary magnitude of 6, located near the Izu island chain off
Tokyo's coast. The islands have been rocked recently by daily
quakes and several volcanic eruptions due to shifting magma
undersea.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries from those quakes,
but falling rocks damaged two cars on Kozushima, about 105 miles
south of Tokyo, said a local official, Yoshiyuki Umeda.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby Niijima, several mudslides were reported on roads and
in mountain areas, said Ryuji Okada, an official there.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, one of the world's most seismically active countries, has
been jolted by a series of earthquakes and the eruptions of three
different volcanoes in recent months. The Meteorological Agency
said the Tokyo quake was not related to the Izu quakes.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama on Miyake, one of the Izu islands, erupted last week
for the fourth time in little more than a month, forcing 634 of the
island's 4,000 residents to temporarily seek refuge in community
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since late June, Miyake and other nearby islands have been
jolted by tens of thousands of earthquakes. On July 1, a man was
killed by a landslide following an earthquake on Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes of magnitude 5 are considered very strong, and those
of 6 or higher can cause severe damage near their epicenter.

<HEADLINE> Art Museum Brings Its Work to Vegas  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leading Washington art museum is taking a
pioneering plunge in Las Vegas to raise cash and make more people
acquainted with great paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Collection, the first American institution to
specialize in modern art, will send 26 works to the Bellagio Museum
of Fine Arts, which belongs to the luxurious hotel of the same name
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The museum hopes to raise $1 million or more with the six-month
show that opens Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The display will include paintings by 20th century American
artist Edward Hopper, a 400-year-old El Greco, and a self-portrait
by Paul Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is already known for large-scale reproductions of the
Empire State Building and Egyptian pyramids, as well as card tables
and slot machines. But fine art?
</P>
<P>
   Phillips insist it doesn't see the venture as a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a six-month contract,'' said Thora Colot, director of
marketing. ''We hope to make other arrangements in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Gates, director of the Phillips, said the idea was to bring
new, diverse groups of people to art.
</P>
<P>
   ''Museum founder Duncan Phillips created a collection of modern
art and its sources with a desire to interpret the painter's
language and to share his own personal understanding of art with an
ever-growing audience,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio will charge out-of-state visitors $12 admission to
the show -- $2 off for Nevadans. It will pay transport costs from
Washington, including insurance, and send the rest of the money
back to the Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Phillips asks adults for a $7.50 contribution
and only makes it mandatory on weekends, with additional charges
for special shows.
</P>
<P>
   This could be just the start of bringing more art to the Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim Museum in New York is reportedly planning to send
a popular show called ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' to a new
building that will be put up next to the parking garage of the
Venetian Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wynn, founder of the Bellagio, put in his own collection
of paintings, but the hotel has since been acquired by a new
company, MGM Mirage. Wynn has acquired the older Desert Inn
hotel-casino, which he plans to demolish and replace with a new
one, including an art gallery.

<HEADLINE> Star Gala Nets Millions for DNC  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After taking center stage on the final day of
the Democratic National Convention, presidential nominee Al Gore
shared the spotlight Thursday with Barbra Streisand and Whoopi
Goldberg at a fund-raiser that fattened party coffers by more than
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg served as master of ceremonies at the Shrine
Auditorium, where the Academy Awards are handed out each year,
while Streisand was to provide the finale for a concert that
included singers Enrique Iglesias, Baby Face and Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   The concert was to conclude with Gore and vice presidential
nominee Joseph Lieberman on stage with Streisand and the other
performers.
</P>
<P>
   With tickets selling for as little as $150, Thursday's gala was
the first in a series of low-priced concerts the Democratic
National Committee hopes to stage in the fall to attract new donors
and create enthusiasm among potential supporters. More than 6,000
people were expected.
</P>
<P>
   But big givers were rewarded as well. The best seats went to
co-chairs, who raised $50,000, and vice chairs, who raised or
donated $20,000. Jon Corzine, the Democrat running for the Senate
from New Jersey, raised $30,000 to buy 200 tickets for the state's
convention delegation. Those who raised or gave the most money also
were invited to a private reception at the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   All of the money raised fell within federal contribution limits.
Known as ''hard money,'' these contributions can be used to
directly aid federal candidates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Through June 30, the Republican National Committee had $21.1
million in hard money in the bank, compared with just $9.3 million
for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Parties also raise ''soft money'' -- large, unregulated sums from
corporations, unions and individuals that are used to finance
party-building activities, issue advertisements and to provide
indirect support to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP raised a record $10.1 million at its convention gala in
Philadelphia earlier this month, but soft money contributions
accounted for some of the take.
</P>
<P>
   The month before, the Republican National Committee raised $37.6
million, bringing its total to almost $180 million since Jan. 1,
1999, officials reported Thursday. The party reported it had $68
million in the bank. Democrats, who report their finances
quarterly, raised $108 million from Jan. 1, 1999, through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties used their conventions to court top donors, with
receptions funded through corporate donations and lobbyists
mingling with lawmakers overseeing their issues.
</P>
<P>
   The practice drew criticism from Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.,
the top Democratic sponsor of legislation to overhaul campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real story at the Democratic convention is legalized
bribery and influence peddling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Feingold and the chief House Democratic sponsor of
campaign finance legislation, Rep. Marty Meehan of Massachusetts,
received speaking roles at the convention. Both used their time to
call for passage of their bill, which would ban soft money, and to
endorse Gore, who supports the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush would ban soft money contributions
from unions and corporations, but not individuals.

<HEADLINE> Reunited Korean Families Head Home  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Weeping and embracing each other at
the end of temporary reunions, North and South Korean family
members who met this week after 50 years of separation parted ways
again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Crying men and women grasped each other's faces. Some held hands
and sang songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't go. Don't go,'' sobbed 86-year-old Kim Bong-ja, reaching
from her wheelchair to hug her son, who had to return to North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we met, Mother,'' said a tearful 66-year-old Ri Young Su.
</P>
<P>
   After boarding a bus bound for Seoul's Kimpo airport, Ri stuck
his arm through a window and his South Korean family rushed to grab
his hand. They all began singing a song that is popular on both
sides of the sealed Korean border: ''Our wish is unification.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunions, which began Tuesday, were agreed upon at a summit
between the leaders of the two Koreas in June after decades of
hostility. They allowed 100 North Koreans to visit relatives in the
South, and 100 South Koreans to have similarly emotional reunions
in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans left Seoul aboard a plane of South Korea's
national carrier, Korean Air. The South Korean group returned from
Pyongyang, the North's capital, later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding farewell at a Seoul hotel, some North Koreans knelt on
the ground in front of their parents and older relatives, who were
using wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am leaving now, Father. When will we ever see each other
again? Please stay healthy,'' said a distraught Lim Jae Hyuk, who
bowed deeply to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ok Bae, 62, told her family: ''Please wait for me. I will
come back again, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But when?'' wailed her 87-year-old mother, Hong Kil-soon.
''After I die?''
</P>
<P>
   Those taking part in this week's reunions faced the possibility
they may never see each other again, as many are aging and numerous
obstacles remain to reconciliation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of both Koreas have promised more reunions will be
held, but the 200 Koreans who were reunited with their families
this time are only a tiny fraction of the millions who were
separated from loved ones half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't cry,'' North Korean Seo Yun Man told his weeping family.
''As long as you are alive, we will meet again. Now that I've met
you, I have no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families held up signs reading: ''Have a good trip back,''
''Come again,'' and ''The two Koreas are one. Unification is
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives handed cellular telephones to their North Korean
loved ones so they could talk until their departure.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute reunion in Seoul early Friday, 69-year-old
North Korean Ryang Han Sang met his seriously ill 88-year-old
mother at a Seoul hospital. It was the first reunion to be arranged
outside the designated meeting sites -- a convention center and a
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her, 'When will I be able to fulfill my duties as a son
and take care of you?''' Ryang said later. ''The only solution to
that is reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   In another last-minute reunion, a 74-year-old North Korean man
met his first wife, who is 78, at his hotel late Thursday. The
woman had previously declined to meet him because she has
remarried.
</P>
<P>
   The border between North and South Korea was sealed after the
end of the 1950-53 Korean War, and such reunions have been allowed
only one other time since then. There is no mail, telephone or
other direct means of communication between private citizens in the
two Koreas.

<HEADLINE> Gadhafi's Bid To Ransom W. Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been
trying to grab the world's attention ever since international
sanctions against his country were suspended last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a bid to ransom Western hostages being held halfway
around the world by rebels in the Philippines, he is trying to win
himself a few moments of glory and bury past links to terrorism and
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to end Libya's isolation,'' said Jeremy Binnie, a
North Africa expert for the Jane's group of defense and analysis
publications.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether he's done a complete about-face is doubtful,'' Binnie
added, noting there are concerns that Gadhafi continues to foment
unrest in places like Chad and elsewhere in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Libya has come a long way in ending the isolation imposed
after the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gadhafi handed over for trial in the West two Libyan
government officials who were suspects in the bombing, and the
United Nations responded by suspending economic sanctions. Since
then, Gadhafi has been welcoming foreign politicians and
businesspeople to Libya and appearing at regional summits at which
he portrays himself as a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't lost the flair for drama for which he's been known
since taking over Libya in a 1969 coup. In April, he traveled to an
African summit in July by road in a mammoth convoy that took a week
to cross Niger, Burkina Faso and Ghana on the way to Togo. Months
before, at a summit meant to forge better ties between the
continents, he castigated Europe for ''hatching coups, extending
bribes and manipulating ethnic contradictions'' in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a touch of drama in his involvement in
negotiations to free hostages held by the separatist Abu Sayyaf
Muslim guerrillas in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels hold 28 hostages -- six French, three Malaysians, two
Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and 13 Filipinos. Some have
been in captivity as long as four months.
</P>
<P>
   Their release has been repeatedly predicted and then delayed by
what have been described as negotiating hitches. Bad weather slowed
proceedings even further Thursday, and the hostages were now
expected to be released in several groups over the next three days.
Some hostages are likely to be flown from the Philippines to
Tripoli, where they will get the chance to thank Gadhafi in person.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a Lebanese delegation flew to Libya in hopes of
collecting a French hostage of Lebanese descent, old allegations
against Gadhafi resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Imam Mousa Sadr, the leader of Lebanon's Shiite
Muslims, said Lebanon should not have sent such ''a high-level
delegation'' to Libya before Sadr's 1978 disappearance there was
solved. Sadr vanished after reportedly clashing with Gadhafi. Libya
has denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the kind of memory Gadhafi would want invoked at a time
when he is highlighting his humanitarian impulses. His negotiators
have denied reports they are offering as much as $25 million in
ransom, saying Libya instead will fund development projects in the
southern Philippines in exchange for the hostages' freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has mediated between Muslim guerrillas and the Philippine
government over the years and helped build schools and mosques in
the impoverished south, home to the heavily Roman Catholic
country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, which is fighting for an Islamic state in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, a Philippines government badly shaken by the
kidnappings has been willing to overlook Libya's mixed record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Libya has shown it is very concerned and very supportive of
what is happening in the Philippines,'' said Ricardo Puno, the
Philippine presidential press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Others are equally pragmatic about Libya, a country with proven
oil reserves of 30 billion barrels -- as much as Norway and Britain
combined. Italy and the Italian oil industry maintained close ties
with Libya even after the Pan Am bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Now most of the world's leading oil companies are back in Libya
-- all but Americans hampered by unilateral U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the United States seems to be warming up. Earlier this
year, a state department team went to Tripoli to see whether it
would be a safe place for Americans to visit and do business.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is considering lifting travel
restrictions, enraging American relatives of Pan Am victims.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those who have long viewed Libya as a partner, not
a pariah. South Africa, whose ruling African National Congress was
supported by Gadhafi when it was an anti-apartheid guerrilla group,
sent a Cabinet minister to Tripoli to prepare to receive the two
South African hostages. The minister, Ronnie Kasrils, had lived in
Libya for a time when he was in exile from South Africa's apartheid
government.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore Shows the 'Family Man'  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore's big night was a family affair: Wife
Tipper danced her way onstage. Mom Pauline blew a kiss from the
stands. And then the vice president's four children raced up to hug
dad amid a convention-ending shower of balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The clan by his side capped a night showcasing the private life
of the Democratic presidential nominee, largely using the power of
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With a montage from ''the family photo album,'' Tipper Gore
traced the family's life through prom pictures, college and the
Vietnam War, through the births of their children and last year's
birth of a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's still the man I fell in love with in high school 30 years
ago,'' Mrs. Gore, an avid photographer who took many of the
pictures herself, told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   She mostly left the policy to her husband. The gregarious
51-year-old danced onstage to the beat of a drum band and then
introduced Americans to Al Gore the family man through a video tour
that had convention delegates chuckling and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al has always been there for our family and he will always be
there for your family,'' she pledged before beaming family photos
onto giant video screens. ''See the man I love in a way that you
may not have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   First up was the late Sen. Albert Gore Sr., who groomed his son
for politics and ''was his hero''; and mother, Pauline, ''still one
of the wisest women I know,'' Mrs. Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-year-old family matriarch, watching from a skybox in the
convention hall, later was helped to her feet and blew her son a
kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The photos kept coming: The young couple's first home, in a
trailer park near Gore's Army base. Wedding pictures. Cooing over
newborns. Family vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the tough times, like when the family gathered at
the bedside as then-6-year-old Albert III recovered from a
near-fatal traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore veered from her husband's biography here for a
moment -- to remind Americans of her own advocacy for mental health.
She described the depression she suffered after Albert's injury.
''I got help and it worked,'' she said. ''People care;
professionals can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore's other cause is helping the homeless. Daughter
Kristin, 23, introduced her mother by telling of the day Mrs. Gore
found a homeless woman named Mary living in a park across from the
White House. Mary wouldn't leave because, mentally ill, she thought
she was the president's wife.
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Gore took Mary to the White House gate and asked the
guard to leave a message for the president, saying his wife would
be away for a few hours. ''Mary agreed to go with my mom and accept
treatment,'' Kristin Gore said. ''She got her reality back.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm inspired by my mother's courage.''

<HEADLINE> Beijing Clashes Over New Theater  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- To admirers it's a pearl, to critics an expensive
mistake. China's planned national theater has become a drama in
itself, dogged by a controversy that threatens to bring the curtain
down on the whole project.
</P>
<P>
   Envisioned by French architect Paul Andreu as a giant titanium
and glass dome rising from a shimmering artificial lake, the
theater complex with four auditoriums and 6,200 seats would be a
Beijing landmark to rival nearby Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, whose outrage helped bring preliminary site work to
a halt, assail the project as technically unsound, costly and about
as Chinese as hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders want the theater to symbolize China's arrival
as a modern, sophisticated nation. But instead, the furor over its
futuristic design highlights conflicts over how a modern China
should look. Should it mimic Western nations, or mirror its own
past glories?
</P>
<P>
   The uproar threatens to embarrass Chinese leaders who, according
to Andreu, approved his design. A grand theater in Beijing's heart,
an idea first proposed 42 years ago by then-Premier Zhou Enlai, was
meant to unite Beijingers in pride, not start them bickering.
</P>
<P>
   That Chinese President Jiang Zemin is a music fan only
accentuates the theater's importance. If completed on schedule in
2002, around when Jiang is thought likely to retire, it could
become his signature monument.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents claim the theater would clash with its
surroundings: the giant columned parliament building, the Great
Hall of the People, next door, and the red-walled Zhongnanhai
compound, where China's leaders live and work, across the street to
the north.
</P>
<P>
   The area has long been a center of power, not a theater
district. For critics, Andreu's bubble would further disrupt
Beijing's imperial-era geometry, already traumatized by breakneck
construction that has seen swaths of traditional courtyard homes
disappear under glass-and-tile office blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Critics found the project's original cost excessive -- originally
set at about $565 million, it was trimmed in a redesign -- and they
say maintaining the dome and surrounding lake will be expensive in
Beijing's polluted air and frequent dust storms. They also say its
entrance, via a long underwater tunnel, is culturally insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are three things Chinese people go down to enter: the
subway, the anti-aircraft shelter and the tombs of the Ming dynasty
emperors,'' said Alfred Peng, an architecture professor at
Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
   Andreu, whose previous designs include the towering Grande Arche
de la Defense west of Paris and Shanghai's light and airy new
airport, is not surprised by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always knew it would be a political project. There is not a
country in the world where a piece of land right across from the
government center would not be political,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Andreu said his design's lack of Chinese traits was not an issue
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The culture is like our relationship to our parents,'' he
said. ''We respect them but don't have to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction began in April, but was suspended in mid-July, a
month after 157 Chinese engineers and architects signed two
petitions calling for a reassessment of Andreu's design.
</P>
<P>
   They appear to have won. The official newspaper China Daily
reported Aug. 9 that the government has assigned an engineering
firm to examine a revised design submitted by Andreu.
</P>
<P>
   ''The assessment can make or break the project,'' the newspaper
said. It also quoted Andreu as saying the project's estimated cost
has been trimmed to about $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   A project spokesman insisted that construction is on schedule,
but there is little activity at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Andreu compared the controversy to that a decade ago over
Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre
museum in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''People cried that French culture was in danger,'' Andreu said.
''Now it is considered a wonderful thing.''

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury To Hear New Clinton Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray is signaling
that the Monica Lewinsky scandal is far from over, assembling a new
grand jury to investigate the president's conduct, legal sources
say.
</P>
<P>
   News that the grand jury was impaneled a month ago reverberated
to the other side of the country Thursday, with Democratic Party
loyalists at the convention in Los Angeles decrying the story as a
politically motivated leak designed to hurt Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Clinton was to drop dead, the Republicans would dig him
up,'' complained Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the news ''hours before Al Gore is to give this
speech'' warrants a federal investigation, said Rep. Jesse Jackson
Jr., D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can bet your bottom dollar that the Republican Party was
behind'' the leak, said House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
''I think the American people are going to reject this kind of
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the judicial system was being
''manipulated for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the convention in its final day, Clinton was 3,000 miles
away at the White House, where spokesman Jake Siewert pointed to
prosecutors as a likely source of the leak. Ray's office denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The sources telling The Associated Press that a new grand jury
was convened July 11 in the Clinton-Lewinsky matter are outside the
Independent Counsel's office. The sources spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The setting up of a new Clinton-Lewinsky grand jury at the U.S.
Courthouse in Washington, D.C., follows through on Ray's promise to
weigh whether the president should be indicted after he steps down
from office next January.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after Clinton was impeached by the House and
acquitted by the Senate on a pair of 50-50 tie votes, a special
panel of judges is renewing Ray's mandate for another year.
</P>
<P>
   The judges issued a legalistic one-sentence order Wednesday
declaring that ''termination of the office ... is not currently
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal questions are whether Clinton committed perjury or
obstructed justice when he denied an affair in sworn testimony in
the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Jones case has already ruled the president gave
false testimony and fined him for civil contempt of court. The
disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has also moved
to revoke Clinton's law license.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ausbrook, senior counsel to Ray, declined comment about
any grand jury activity, which is kept secret by law.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to the judges' order, Ausbrook noted that
''we've made public that the Lewinsky investigation remains open
and that the e-mail investigation remains open.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail probe focuses on whether the White House concealed
thousands of electronic messages sought by investigators.
Presidential aides deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail probe, a conservative group, Judicial Watch,
revealed that Ray's office is using a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch released the first page of a subpoena for records
of a major witness in the investigation, Sheryl Hall, a former
White House computer specialist who said some of her fellow workers
had been threatened with jail if they revealed a problem with the
e-mail archiving system. The absence of archiving of incoming
messages made it impossible for the White House to review thousands
of e-mails to determine if they should be surrendered in various
investigations -- from the Lewinsky scandal to Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch has been critical of Ray's office for recently
closing the books on two other Clinton-era controversies -- the
White House gathering of secret FBI files on Republicans and
possible lying regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in the
firings of White House travel office employees. The prosecutor
declined to bring criminal charges in either case and Judicial
Watch says Ray should have waited until the White House
reconstructs e-mail that was missing from the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other federal grand juries are sitting at the courthouse
investigating a variety of matters, yet Ray has sought and obtained
permission to form a separate grand jury focusing on
Clinton-Lewinsky rather than using any of the other seven, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a separate grand jury for Clinton-Lewinsky is ''a way
for Ray to be prepared to act quickly and to deal with this
question efficiently when he turns to it,'' said John Barrett of
the St. John's University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   The new grand jury is likely to get up to speed on the scandal
by receiving evidence in the form of transcripts and summaries of
previously gathered evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage in this particular investigation it would be
highly unlikely for a new grand jury to receive any new information
that had not already been considered at length by Ken Starr, the
United States Congress and the prior grand jury,'' said John
Douglass, an expert in criminal law and criminal procedure at the
University of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett and Douglass did extensive work before grand juries in
the Iran-Contra investigation of Reagan and Bush administration
higher-ups conducted by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh.

<HEADLINE> Sewage Plant Said Model For Others  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Wherever visitors arrive at Deer Island, tour
guide Patrick Costigan asks the same, leading question. ''Do you
smell anything?'' he needles. ''Do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably -- considering you're standing a few feet above 379
million gallons of sewage -- you don't.
</P>
<P>
   This $3.8 billion collection of concrete, pipes, pumps and
computers is the terminus of every sewer line from 43 communities
near Boston -- and there's little effort to disguise the operations
of the nation's second largest sewage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   Now open for tours, the Deer Island Treatment Plant includes a
building called the ''Odor Control Center'' and large pipes labeled
''secondary scum'' and ''thickened digested sludge.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing to hide,'' Costigan says. ''We do get dirty at
times, I have to say -- leaks and so forth. But that's to be
expected. We can't be afraid of the product. If we want to go back
to throwing all our sewage out the window, then we're all in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Deer Island -- actually a peninsula since a 1938 hurricane --
won't be found in many Boston guidebooks. And most of the island's
history is not something to celebrate. It has been a prison for
Indians, a hospital where 800 impoverished Irish immigrants died
and a house of correction. Before a court ordered the state to
clean up its act, the plant was for years a major polluter of the
Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority is
rather proud of the place. The curious are welcome for tours,
whether they are engineers, architecture buffs or simply ratepayers
who want to gauge the bang they're getting for their buck.
</P>
<P>
   And where else can you stand on a 140-foot-tall concrete egg
full of sludge-digesting microbes and enjoy an unbeatable view of
the Boston skyline?
</P>
<P>
   By next spring, there will be even more reason to visit --
jogging and walking trails are planned.
</P>
<P>
   For Costigan, the fresh air is the way he can tell the plant is
doing its job. He grew up in nearby Winthrop and remembers the days
when he held his breath, and when sewage washed up on beaches and
swimming in Boston Harbor was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just terrible,'' he says. ''Prior to 1991, we were
actually releasing sludge into Boston Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of turning a sewage treatment plant into a park
may take some getting used to. Costigan has heard plenty of jokes
in his seven years on the job. Among the favorites? ''We're No. 1
in the No. 2 business.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The product'' goes through several steps before it's released
-- including a stint in the huge concrete eggs familiar to travelers
who've flown in and out of nearby Logan Airport. Microbes digest
the material for a month, then the thick sludge that remains is
pumped onto barges, shipped across the harbor and resold as
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Methane, meanwhile, is reused to help fuel the plant itself.
Other odors are sent through deodorizing ''showers.'' An effluent
pipe sends what's left into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   At the control center, employees track inflow -- up to 1.3
billion gallons a day -- and say they've learned quite a bit about
Boston's sewer habits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We almost can tell when people are waking up and going to
bed,'' Costigan says.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Journey To Best America  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore hurled himself into the finals of the
campaign for the White House, summoning the Democratic National
Convention and the nation to join him ''on a new journey to the
best America.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, he vowed, ''I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who nominated him for president Thursday night
cheered and chanted his name, never louder than when the vice
president declared:
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand here tonight as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   The roar overrode the rest of the line, as he went on, ''and I
want you to know me for who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 51-minute address aimed beyond the convention hall at the
national television audience, Gore blended personal history and his
campaign issues agenda. He offered a quick bow to President Clinton
for the thriving economy and his other achievements, but said he is
not asking for votes ''on the basis of past performance. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''For all of our good times, I am not satisfied,'' he said,
promising a better, fairer, more prosperous nation in a new
Democratic administration.
</P>
<P>
   Before all the balloons had popped, with the confetti and
streamers hardly settled, Gore was racing eastward with Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, his running mate, to hunt votes on a riverboat campaign
voyage down the Mississippi River, from Wisconsin to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   His political ports of call there and in Illinois and Iowa were
in territory crucial to his bid to beat his Republican opponent,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in the election now 81 days away.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention address, Gore called GOP proposals ''old
guard'' and beholden to the powerful and the wealthy, but he never
spoke Bush's name.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush's spokesman had an instant response. Ari Fleischer
called Gore's address ''more of the same old language of class
warfare, partisanship and division.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was almost conversational at times, not the shouting orator
of other campaign days. ''If you entrust me with the presidency, I
know I won't always be the most exciting politician,'' he said.
''But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I
will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore broke no policy ground, repeating the agenda he has been
shaping during a campaign that began not long after the 1998
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The man who heard so many jokes about how boring he was that he
started joking about it himself tried to turn that into an asset:
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my own imperfections. For example, I know that
sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a
day to day fight for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said ''we've got to win this election, because every
hardworking American family deserves to open the door to their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''From this city that marked both the end of America's journey
westward and the beginning of the New Frontier, let us set out on a
new journey to the best America,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, showered by red, white and blue balloons, and by
glittering confetti, he and Lieberman embraced, and strolled the
stage with thumbs-up waves. Their wives, then their children, then
an array of Democratic leaders, Gore's vanquished primary rival
Bill Bradley among them, joined the unity show.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying east on a red-eye Air Force Two flight to
LaCrosse, Wis., Gore and Lieberman made one last Los Angeles stop
at a party fund-raising gala.
</P>
<P>
   Their first campaign day as the Democratic nominees was to span
20 hours of travel and vote-hunting before they called it a night
in Dubuque, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning they were boarding the riverboat Mark Twain for
four days on and off the Mississippi, with rallies afloat and
ashore on the way downstream to Hannibal
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miles, a delegate from St. Charles, Mo., said he was going
to be there in his 34-foot party barge to welcome the ticket. ''The
uniqueness of this boat trip is attention-getting, since they
usually do planes, trains and buses,'' he said, and that should
play well elsewhere in the state. Bush leads in the most recent
polls in Missouri, where Clinton won in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Tully, the Iowa Democratic chairman, said he'd meet the
ticket in Dubuque. ''It is a smart move on their part,'' he said.
Iowa has gone Democratic in the past three presidential elections,
but Gov. Tom Vilsac said Bush would win narrowly if the election
were held now.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin and Illinois also are battleground, swing states that
voted twice for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, was resuming his campaign Friday after a break
at his ranch near Waco, Texas, during the Democratic convention --
his first stop a rally in Bartlett, Tenn., Gore's home state. Vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney was campaigning with him in the
Memphis suburb.
</P>
<P>
   For all the celebrations and victory vows of Los Angeles, there
were upstream political currents facing Gore, in the public opinion
polls that rate Bush the leader, 48 percent to 37 percent in a
Voter.com-Battleground survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And there was an extra burden with the disclosure in Washington
that Kenneth Starr's successor as independent counsel had summoned
a new grand jury to hear evidence against Clinton in connection
with the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Robert Ray had said he would
consider bringing charges against the president, impeached and
acquitted while Starr was on his case, after Clinton leaves office
on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The new grand jury was empaneled July 11; word of it came to The
Associated Press from legal sources Thursday, hours before Gore's
acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven,'' White House
spokesman Jake Siewert said. Even the Bush campaign criticized it,
saying the timing was wrong and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems clearly calculated to have a political impact,'' Gore
spokesman Doug Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates and party leaders chorused praise of Gore's
address, but some of them earlier had voiced their worries about
his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important is the poll taken this weekend,'' said Rep.
Marty Meehan of Massachusetts. ''If an 11-point lead can be cut in
half, then the Democrats have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans this time seem to have their act together,''
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson told delegates from New Mexico,
his home state. ''I think we have to be extra strong, work extra
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign announced that it wants three debates with
Gore this fall, and two between Cheney and Lieberman. Karen Hughes,
Bush's communications director, said the campaign was open to
negotiations on details, sponsors and formats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been ready to debate for months,'' said Chris Lehane,
Gore's spokesman. ''Their newfound readiness to debate shows this
campaign is tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 demonstrators showed up for the last day of the
convention, chanting about assorted causes. They were generally
peaceful, and their protest marches didn't affect the convention
proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Convention Custodians Deal With Mess  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As delegates partied inside under a sea of
signs, confetti and balloons, 120 people huddled outside in bleak
anticipation of the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention is over, but the work has
just begun for the custodians and construction crews charged with
converting Staples Center from political stage back to sports
arena.
</P>
<P>
   What took one month of preparation gets two weeks for
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a long way to go,'' Jay Thomas, Staples Center
director of operations, says with a sigh. ''We think of it as a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else this week, cleaning the 950,000-square-foot
arena is no small production. Crews removed 10 tons to 12 tons of
trash each night, although the estimate for the big finale was
closer to 15 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Convention cleaning requires a tight schedule. The timeline goes
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   -- 9:30 p.m. Thursday: Staff assembles outside Staples, awaiting
the much-anticipated departure of 4,338 carousing delegates. When
the last reveler clears out, crews move in.
</P>
<P>
   Their first order of business: Take carpet tacks to the more
than 150,000 red, white and blue balloons that dropped after Al
Gore accepted the nomination. Second: Clear out 2,400 folding
chairs and begin collecting trash, including an estimated 5,000
signs.
</P>
<P>
   -- 4 a.m. Friday: Crews move into 60 luxury suites converted into
media studios and begin cleaning. Furniture, artwork -- even walls --
that were removed must be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   -- 8 a.m.: Remove kiosks that delegates used to cast their votes
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   -- Noon: Crews rigged with electric blowers head into the rafters
to spray down any of the 700 pounds of confetti still clinging to
the ceiling. Four hours later, custodians sweep up what's left on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Once the trash is out, crews must remove 400 temporary floor
panels and break down the convention stage. The 5-foot-high,
3,700-square-foot structure took three weeks to construct; it'll be
destroyed in three days.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the two weeks consists of replacing 3,000 arena
seats and patching, painting and polishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center cleaning crew is no stranger to big messes.
When the Lakers won the NBA championship, 100 pounds of confetti
and 2,100 streamers were shot into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But even that can't compare to the trash of the Democratic
convention, says Thomas, exclaiming ''Oh my God, yes!'' when asked
whether the convention was messier. He likened the celebratory
confetti fall to a ticker-tape parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes everywhere,'' he says. ''This is a luxury for us to
have two weeks to clean up, but it takes a lot to get back to what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline: Sept. 1, when Staples starts making ice for the LA
Kings. Out with the politics, in with the hockey.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Battles Image Problem  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Only days ago, the Colombian army was
basking in praise after soldiers rescued hostages held by
guerrillas. Now, the army is trying to explain the deaths of six
children allegedly gunned down by its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as national heroes one day and trigger-happy killers the
next, the army is battling two rebel armies and an image problem.
</P>
<P>
   It hopes to polish its reputation, in part by spending half a
million dollars annually on TV ads. One shows soldiers putting
aside their guns to promote human rights in a tiny Indian village.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our army, winning our war,'' another ad proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   The army won praise earlier this week when elite troops rescued
a well-known media magnate and five other hostages held by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians watched Sunday as the bearded, weary hostages
descended from a plane into the arms of jubilant relatives at a
Bogota air force base, the reunions broadcast live on television.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the nation's newspapers showed beaming,
camouflage-clad soldiers standing alongside the media magnate,
Guillermo ''Scoop'' Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the newspapers showed photos of grief-stricken
parents standing beside the coffins of their children. President
Andres Pastrana announced he would oversee a state investigation
into the shootings of the schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Top military officials insisted that the students, hiking near
the western town of Pueblo Rico on Tuesday, were caught in cross
fire between soldiers and rebels of the National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But an adult who was with the students said there were no rebels
in the area. Parents of the six dead children blame the army
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the shootings, Colombia's army chief Gen. Jorge Mora
said rebels had used the children as shields.
</P>
<P>
   Mora did not explain why government troops would shoot at rebels
if children were in the line of fire. The only casualties were the
six dead children -- the youngest of whom was 6 years old -- and four
other students who were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Army commanders claim there was a fierce exchange of gunfire. No
government forces were hurt and no bodies of rebels could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Colombia's state prosecutor's office and an
independent human rights watchdog group were conducting separate
investigations of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as the U.S. State Department prepares a report on
human rights in Colombia, to be presented to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known if the shootings would affect Washington's
appraisal of Colombia's human rights record, State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy. It was a terrible thing that happened, and we
certainly condemned it. But I am just unable to make any broader
observations until we know what (happened),'' Reeker said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's 1999 human rights report described the
Colombian government's record as ''poor'' and said serious abuses
had not improved over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. lawmakers can halt the flow of a recently approved package
of $1.3 billion in military and financial support to Colombia if
they decide the country is not doing enough to improve its human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is planning to visit Colombia at the end
of the month, can reinstate the aid by signing a national security
waiver, the White House said.

<HEADLINE> Convention Coverage Sought on Web  </HEADLINE>
By ANICK JESDANUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Harlan Mork watched the televised speeches at
the Democratic National Convention this week, then logged on to the
Internet for articles about protests and other developments.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis computer systems analyst didn't bother trying
the bells and whistles that promised greater participation and
interactivity. Like many other Americans, Mork treated the Net like
a morning newspaper or a TV.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the new medium getting its big break from this
year's political conventions. Dot-coms became not-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional news organizations and viewing habits continued to
dominate. The Net's promised ''unconventional coverage'' produced
mostly conventional video that resembled television and articles
that resembled publications.
</P>
<P>
   For Alexis Lambert, 21, a student in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.,
the Internet served as a video cassette recorder. She had to work
Tuesday night when the Caroline Kennedy and others of the Kennedy
clan spoke, so she went online for archived video streams of the
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, computer trainer Joan Patterson Garcia, 54, watched
most of the speeches on the C-SPAN cable TV network and used the
Net to pull transcripts and read analyses -- the kind found in
papers.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the Internet wasn't useful. It gave many
Americans the ability to schedule their viewing around jobs, chores
and other commitments. It also gave them greater choice and access
to viewpoints across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot more information available today,'' said Mork,
31. ''I would have had to go to a newsstand to buy 10 or 15
newspapers to get the info I would on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Stober, 30, an engineer in Denver, said he liked the
ability to search for articles himself ''as opposed to having it
spoon-fed to me'' on TV or in papers.
</P>
<P>
   Another engineer, John Prince, 48, of Huntington Beach, Calif.,
found coverage of third-party candidates that he couldn't get
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some political junkies did take advantage of the Internet's
interactive features, which help connect people thousands of miles
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Neal, 17, who runs the Internet Republicans e-mail
discussion group, commented on politics through her e-mail list and
online chat rooms. Jill Starr, 35, a graduate student in
Newfoundland, N.J., got firsthand accounts from protesters via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But true interactivity was often elusive. Speakout.com, which
instantaneously tracked viewer reaction to key speeches, had only a
few hundred participants each night. By contrast, the TV networks
measured audiences in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Several sites installed cameras that let users choose their own
vantage point. But with repeated technical glitches, GOP activist
Michael Ertel, 30, of Oviedo, Fla., found the features ''more
annoying than effective or entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hunter, 24, a doctoral candidate in communications
at the University of Pennsylvania, was disappointed with the
post-speech chats touted by Democrats at their site.
</P>
<P>
   Convention speakers were invited to appear online, but the major
ones declined. And while Democrats took questions from home
viewers, Hunter said, they answered only some of them and didn't
let participants interact with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't seem to live up to the billing,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, which measures traffic on the Internet, said
visits to major news sites dropped during the July 31-Aug. 3
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Pseudo.com, despite
the publicity of snagging a skybox normally reserved for network
TV, had too few visitors to measure accurately. Traffic numbers for
the Democratic convention were not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Payne, 49, a communications professor at Emerson College
in Boston, said the Internet cannot make a dull event exciting. He
said he didn't find anything that would turn on viewers turned off
by the conventions on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just the first phase of Internet coverage,'' he said.
''They don't seem to be doing anything creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Davis, a retired prison administrator who cannot get
broadcast signals in rural Leakey, Texas, is accustomed to logging
on for news, making her a good target for dot-com convention
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But she decided to log off instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems a lot of waste of time and money,'' Davis, 68, said
of the convention. ''I don't think the public is being informed
enough from them.''

<HEADLINE> Delegates Praise Gore's Speech  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They liked the specifics. They thought they
saw some passion. They even thought they'd seen the charisma gap
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly impartial -- these are the most partisan of partisans,
after all -- these jurors were just about unanimous. Delegates to
the Democratic National Convention took cheer from Al Gore's speech
Thursday night accepting their party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loosened up. I'm on the way to the inaugural,'' exulted
one. ''He gave us spirit,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   If there was disagreement with their wonkish candidate's
decision to deliver a speech top-heavy with policy pronouncement,
it concerned his decision to ignore George W. Bush. After all, in
Philadelphia two weeks ago, his Republican rival had said, over and
over, ''They had their chance. They have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked him to be harder (on Bush) but he's got to
be careful of not sounding too partisan,'' said Ronald Canestrari,
a New York state assemblyman from the Albany area. ''But ... he
could have hit him more on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And Marty Meehan, a congressman from Massachusetts, said if it
were up to him, ''I would have been a little tougher on George W.
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Jeanne Shaheen, the governor of New Hampshire.
''We've got two and a half months of this campaign to go after Bush
and go after his record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He laid out the differences on the issues and that's what's
important,'' said Mark Brewer, Michigan Democratic chairman.
''There's no quarrel with the other side. They are both nice men.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences aside on whether Gore should have attacked more, the
delegates in dozens of interviews with The Associated Press within
minutes of the speech's conclusion agreed: It was a good and
politically useful speech.
</P>
<P>
   They had reason to hope for that. Everyone here was well aware
that Gore has been dragging in the polls and the initial returns
showed scant ''bounce'' so far. ''Bounce'' is what a candidate is
supposed to get from four days of a laudatory convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did a masterful job,'' said Ann Delay of Indianapolis,
former Democratic chairwoman from Indiana. ''He really had the
audience engaged and eager to leave here and go out to work for his
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Patterson, a delegate from Cape Girardeau, Mo., was
enthusiastic enough to guess that Gore had wiped out the deficit in
polls in her state.
</P>
<P>
   Said she: ''There is no problem in Missouri any more, no matter
what the polls have said. After this speech, Missouri will go with
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another delegate from the Show Me state, Freeman Bosley Jr., the
former mayor of St. Louis, said, ''I heard the best speech Al Gore
has ever given and I heard him set the tone for the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues aside, delegates liked the persona Gore put on display at
the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he became Al Gore the human being instead of Al Gore
the policymaker,'' said Florida delegate Elizabeth Rawlins DeFazio
of Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's usually a little stiffer,'' agreed Truman Chafin,
majority leader of the West Virginia state senate. ''Tonight he was
relaxed. It looked like he took a page from his boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon: ''He made himself so human
with his life story.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't just talk the talk,'' said Hawaii delegate Lorraine
Akiba of Honolulu. ''He was specific. ... These were Al Gore's
ideas. I think he stood tall by the time he finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Hawaiian, Jill Tokuda of Honolulu, said Gore had buoyed
up the party. ''Everyone's spirits are soaring,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Billi Gosh, a delegate from Brookfield, Vt., said she was more
interested in Gore's policies than his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to vote for somebody who will be a great president, not
a great first date,'' she said, adding: ''His speech was so
positive. It felt like a State of the Union address.''
</P>
<P>
   Personable or not, Nick Colafella, a Pennsylvania state
representative from Monaca, congratulated Gore for being himself.
''This was real,'' he said. ''He could have succumbed to the
image-makers and tried to invent a new Al Gore. Instead, he was
true to himself.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Policy Gets Scant Attention  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In accepting the Democratic Party's
presidential nomination, Al Gore talked to the American people, not
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dealt with foreign affairs in just a dozen sentences in his
51-minute convention closer Thursday night, addressing little more
than Republican Party presidential candidate George W. Bush did in
his own convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, the vice president promised a strong military and
couched foreign policy in terms of what's best for America: ''We
must always have the will to defend our enduring interests -- from
Europe, to the Middle East, to Japan and Korea. We must strengthen
our partnerships with Africa, Latin America, and the rest of the
developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to promote ''truly free trade'' that also is
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must set standards to end child labor, to prevent the
exploitation of workers and the poisoning of the environment,'' he
said. ''Free trade can and must be -- and if I'm president, will be
-- a way to lift everyone up, not bring anyone down to the lowest
common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore mentioned his early support for nuclear arms control, his
service as an Army reporter in Vietnam and his vote, along with
only a handful of other Democrats, for the Gulf War against Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. He mentioned Kuwait in reference to the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But he named no other countries, no other world leaders and no
other global issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in accepting the Republican Party nomination two weeks ago
in Philadelphia, also gave foreign affairs short shrift. He said
the world needs America's strength and leadership, promising
reduced nuclear arms and deployment of missile defenses without
concern for ''outdated treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When America uses force in the world, the cause must be just,
the goal must be clear, and the victory must be overwhelming,''
said Bush, whose foreign policy experience is concentrated mainly
on Texas' relations with Mexico, whose president-elect, Vicente
Fox, is visiting with both candidates next week.
</P>
<P>
   Differences among Americans over national missile defense,
relations with Russia, treatment of China and deployment of U.S.
troops abroad were discussed at the convention mainly in forums
attended by diplomats, foreign government officials and
international reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats criticized the convention's lack of a foreign
policy focus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to know what he is going to do with the future. We
need to know about foreign policy,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California told MSNBC before Gore's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, earlier said, ''I think it's a mistake
for us not to engage the Republicans on defense policy and on
foreign policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden said party organizers wouldn't let him give a foreign
policy address because they wanted to focus on education, health
and the economy. He called Bush and his running mate, former
defense secretary Dick Cheney, ''unilateralists if not
isolationists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, has rejected ''the blunders of isolationism'' and
suggests a foreign policy that reflects ''the modesty of true
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the Democrats, the Republicans' convention
devoted an evening to global affairs and national defense,
featuring retired Gens. Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   Gore senior foreign policy adviser Derek Shearer said that
despite the low profile of such issues at the Democratic
convention, Americans know their president is commander in chief of
the country with the most military strength in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe very strongly that when the American people see the
candidates up close, particularly in the debates,'' Shearer said,
''it will become clearer that Vice President Gore is not only more
competent, he is more experienced and he has a clearer view of the
issues that face the world in this era.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Dealing With Increased Fame  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Marion Jones isn't intimidated by the
prospect of becoming the first woman to win five gold medals in the
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Checking out at the supermarket these days in her small town of
Apex -- now that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's especially difficult when I have all my groceries and I'm
standing in line and I look over to the left and there is me
looking at me from a magazine cover,'' Jones said Thursday. ''I try
to go to another aisle where there isn't one. Then I get to the guy
bagging my groceries and he says, 'Is that you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a starter on the 1994 national championship basketball
team at North Carolina, is now the fastest women's sprinter in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   She gained even more popularity at the U.S. Olympic trials last
month by winning the 100 and 200 meters and long jump, giving her
three spots on the U.S. team. In addition, she will run the 400 and
1,600 relays at Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Television commercials, magazine covers -- even a billboard on
Interstate 95 -- have propelled Jones into the spotlight a month
before she tries to make Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have definitely changed,'' Jones said. ''But it's still
nice to come back to Raleigh and go out there to the track at N.C.
State. There are still the joggers that we have to argue with every
day to let us have lanes one and two. Some of them have no idea who
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jones will leave to compete in Belgium and Germany
before returning home Sept. 2 to regroup. She and husband C.J.
Hunter, the favorite to win gold for the United States in the shot
put, will head to Sydney six days later.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she will be working on her start in the 100 meters in
the two meets before the Olympics, and that she won't be holding
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' she said. ''I'm going to go out there and try and
run as fast as I ever have or jump as far as I ever have and get
tuned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Trevor Graham cringed when he heard Jones talk about going
all-out before the Olympics. However, Graham will take over Jones'
schedule in Sydney, managing her time so she won't get worn down.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the qualifying rounds we just have to take it easy,'' said
Graham, who will coach 11 athletes in the Summer Games. ''We need
to take one jump in the long jump to get to the finals instead of
like what we did in Sacramento. We took more than one jump and that
kind of changed our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she's mentally prepared for the rigors of five
events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to have to avoid looking at the five (events) and
saying, 'Gosh, I know I already have a total of 10 races I have to
run and the long jump qualifying and long jump finals.' I am going
to have to just say, 'OK, today is Monday, what do I have to do?
Let's do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Jones, the most stressed-out person likely will be
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a big deal when I compete; I'm either on or I'm
not,'' Hunter said. ''I can deal with that, but when I have no
control over it, that's when it drives me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one woman track athlete -- Fanny Blankers-Koen of the
Netherlands in 1948 -- has won as many as four gold medals in one
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am aware of what is happening to me, but on the other hand,
I am trying to shy away from it a bit,'' Jones said of her recent
stardom. ''It is thrown in my face every day I step on the track.
So the couple of hours that I have to get away from that, I try to
relish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of her free time is spent with Hunter at the movies or
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normal stuff a 24-year-old does,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> BYU Coach To Step Down After Season  </HEADLINE>
 TIM KORTEAP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah (AP) -- LaVell Edwards developed one of college
football's most innovative offenses, groomed some of the game's top
quarterbacks and won a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in announcing his retirement, effective at the end of this
season, he said his biggest achievement was building a program that
excited the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the fact that football is important at BYU,'' Edwards
said Thursday. ''I don't see any reason that's going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Edwards was hired, BYU had won 43 percent of its games in
47 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He enters his 29th season with a record of 251-95-3, ranking
seventh in career Division I victories. He needs five wins to pass
Tom Osborne for sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards ranks third among active coaches, behind Joe Paterno and
Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno, who needs seven victories to break Bear Bryant's career
victory mark of 323, called Edwards ''one of the giants of our
profession. There isn't anyone I respect more in coaching than
LaVell.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards started in 1972, a former Utah State lineman and 10-year
BYU assistant promoted from defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he knew in January it was time to retire, and
decided in the offseason to coach one more season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You reach a point where it's time to move on and let someone
else take a run at it,'' Edwards said. ''It's turned out a whole
lot better than I ever, ever, ever dreamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Edwards, who will be 70 in October, the Cougars won the
1984 national title with a 13-0 record. He was named national coach
of the year that season.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' teams won 20 conference titles and played in 22 bowl
games. BYU also claimed a Heisman Trophy winner, Ty Detmer, in
1990, and produced a string of other star quarterbacks including
Steve Young and Jim McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Val Hale said a search for a successor will
begin ''at some point where the timing is better.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to put the focus on this season,'' Hale said.
''We're not going to let talk about a successor take away from
LaVell's final season.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards told his players of his decision during a team meeting
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really silent in that room,'' defensive end Setema Gali
said. ''I even felt a little teary-eyed. It was a happy kind of
sadness. We're happy for him, but it's sad because everyone thinks
of coach Edwards and BYU as the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU quarterbacks under Edwards have passed for more than 100,000
yards, about 57 miles. The Cougars haven't been shut out for an
NCAA-record 312 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   BYU led the nation in passing seven times under Edwards, whose
program also produced Outland Trophy winners in Jason Buck (1986)
and Mo Elewonibi (1989).
</P>
<P>
   But it was the passing game that got the most headlines. Edwards
recalled being inspired by the Stanford team that Jim Plunkett led
to the Rose Bowl after the 1971 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember thinking that being a private school, with the
limitations we had, that (passing) might be a good thing to do,''
Edwards said. ''I made the decision right then that we would throw
the football.''
</P>
<P>
   He was mocked when he installed an aerial attack at a time when
schools like Oklahoma and Alabama were running the ball on
virtually every down and winning national titles.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also oversaw the 1982 expansion of Cougar Stadium to
65,000 seats. For years, BYU led the Western Athletic Conference
and now the Mountain West in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started, the stadium held 10,000 people and it was
never filled,'' Edwards said. ''If we had a game on the opening day
of the deer hunt, we had 2,500 women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, Edwards plans to help establish athletic
endowments and make appearances for BYU.

<HEADLINE> Roethlisberger Falters at Trials  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Paul Hamm's legs were going a mile a minute,
scissor-kicking back and forth while he held the rest of his body
high off the floor with his hands. The experts call it Wow
Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the arena, John Roethlisberger rambled down
the runway, jumped off the springboard, flew over the vault and
landed squarely on his backside. That looked more like Whoa
Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Young and old were headed in opposite directions after the first
round of the U.S. Olympic trials Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, the freckle-faced 17-year-old from Wisconsin, drew gasps
of appreciation from the crowd with a nonstop series of explosive
routines to finish second, behind only national champion Blaine
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Roethlisberger, the 30-year-old two-time Olympian, had three
mindboggling mistakes -- a fall on his vault landing, a slip on the
floor and a slide off the high bar -- to further jeopardize his
chances for a third trip to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds stupid, but it feels like I'm battling out there,''
Roethlisberger said. ''There's some force I'm fighting against. But
the last thing I'm doing is giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the future for the elder statesman of U.S. gymnastics
does not look bright. He finished 12th after the first round of the
trials. His combined standings from U.S. nationals and trials
slipped from fifth to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top four will earn automatic berths onto the six-man
team. Two others will be chosen by the men's committee based, in
part, on what specific events they might be able to shore up.
</P>
<P>
   Over the span of three meets, the only event Roethlisberger
hasn't faltered on is the rings. U.S. coach Peter Kormann has
insisted a name and a reputation aren't enough to earn a spot on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Roethlisberger will need one spectacular meet to improve
both his score and his standing in the eyes of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it's all out,'' he said. ''I've got nothing to lose at
this point. I can't go out and think about if the demons are going
to jump up and bite me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Roethlisberger's failings were everyone else's opportunity, and
nobody took more advantage than Hamm. His were powerful routines
that showed off the future -- now the present -- of a sport that
grows progressively more difficult each year.
</P>
<P>
   His floor routine earned a 9.70 and his high-bar routine was
0.05 better. There, he executed a perfect Kovacs move, flinging
himself upward off the bar, soaring high enough to turn two
somersaults and leave plenty of room to come back down and grab the
bar again without breaking his rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy this kind of stuff,'' Hamm said. ''I realize now that
I can keep calm and I can hit my routines when I need to. It gives
me confidence even though this is the biggest meet of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His twin brother, Morgan, wasn't bad either.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a 9.825 on the floor exercise to briefly challenge the
leaders. His only mishap was a slip off the pommel horse for an
8.500. He finished in fourth place, sixth in the combined
standings, and stayed within striking range of giving America its
first set of twin gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 17, I couldn't smell the composure they have,'' Wilson said
of the twins from Waukesha, Wis. ''It must be the cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, winner of five straight national titles, continues to
set a standard nobody in America can reach.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 9.95 on rings, 9.90 on vault and 9.85 on parallel bars
to cruise into first place with 58.525 points. His rings
performance was its usual masterpiece, shoulder muscles quivering
as he lifted himself parallel to the ground, a nearly perfect
planche position.
</P>
<P>
   The 9.95 on rings went with another 9.95 and a 9.90 at
nationals. He'll be a favorite to medal in that event next month
and will contend for gold in the all-around.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did as good tonight as I've ever seen him do in any meet,''
Kormann said. ''He's closer to where he needs to be. I'm not saying
he's going to win it, but he could, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team needs some polish, however.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Townsend, who finished second at nationals, fell off the
rings and the high bar and finished 10th. He slid to third in the
overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen McCain lost his grip on the pommel horse and had trouble
on his vault. He finished third and slipped one spot to fourth
overall, but was surprised he hadn't fallen farther.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before my last event, I looked down and said, 'I'm still in
this thing,''' he said. ''I was a little upset with my
performances. It wasn't a great night.''

<HEADLINE> Zippy Chippy Vanquished by a Human  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Even two-legged speedsters can make a
mockery of Zippy Chippy.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Herrera, a minor league baseball player with a knack for
stealing bases, left the winless horse way behind in a 40-yard race
across the outfield grass at Frontier Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let him go out to pasture and enjoy his days,'' said one
perturbed spectator, Gaven Hurley, 57, a retired financier. ''If he
ever wins, that could ruin him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''2000 Red Wings Derby,'' featuring the losingest horse in
the recorded history of U.S. thoroughbred racing, was staged before
Rochester's game against Scranton-Wilkes Barre on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, 27, the center fielder for the Rochester Red Wings,
bolted ahead of the 9-year-old gelding and went on to win by at
least three (horse) lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time he started running, Jose was far away,''
owner-trainer Felix Monserrate said with a shrug. ''Forty yards is
not enough for him to get warm. He let Jose win to make him feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Zippy Chippy, 0-for-86 in horse races, was banned from
competition at the Finger Lakes Race Track in nearby Farmington
and, because of reciprocal agreements, from most other racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   But Monserrate predicts the horse he bought for $2,500 in 1995
will win before notching 100 losses. He's entered him in a licensed
race Sept. 1 at a fair in Northampton, Mass., the same track where
he finished third in his record-breaking 86th race on Sept. 9,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The race between horse and human lasted less than five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try hard, like a warrior,'' said an ebullient Herrera, who
high-fived all-comers as he was carried across the field in triumph
on his teammates' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm unbelievably fast,'' joked Herrera, who claimed previous
experience racing against horses while growing up on a farm in the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera leads the International League with 152 hits. He's
stolen 10 bases this season, raising his career total to 166. He
spent 1&AMP;frac12; years in the majors, hitting six homers for the Oakland
A's in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers had the horse as a 2-1 underdog, and even jockey
Pedro Castillo wasn't confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's 100 yards, I got a chance,'' Castillo said. ''He was a
little impatient, probably never saw so many people at once and got
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Zippy Chippy has had six second-place finishes, including a loss
by a neck in 1995, and 10 third-places in a career that began with
an eighth-place finish at Belmont Park in 1994. His problem of late
has been leaving the starting gate too slowly, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   When he lost his 85th race, he went into the record books
alongside Gussie Mae and Really A Tenor. Both those horses won
their 86th career starts -- Gussie Mae in 1995 at Atlantic City and
Really A Tenor in 1990 at River Downs.

<HEADLINE> Woods Shares PGA Lead With Dunlap  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Now Tiger Woods knows what it's like to
play in the same group with somebody like Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Jack Nicklaus -- who was cheered warmly and loudly on
every hole -- Woods shot a 6-under-par 66 Thursday to share the
first-round lead with Scott Dunlap in the PGA Championship. Slow
play forced some players to stop before they finished the round.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries at Valhalla Golf Club were pulling for a saddened
Nicklaus. His mother died Wednesday morning back in his hometown of
Columbus, Ohio. One of her greatest fears was that her passing
might interfere with what could be her son's final appearance at
all four majors. Reluctantly, he honored her last wish and played
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was yelling out 'Jack!' So I kind of just walked
around,'' Woods said with a broad smile. '''Jack! Jack! Look over
here, Jack!' No one saw me. It was kind of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't as if Woods went unnoticed. The rest of the field
sure knew he was around.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no stopping him,'' said Dunlap, who has won
tournaments in Canada, South Africa, Argentina and Peru -- but none
on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is seeking his fourth victory in the last five major
championships. He could become the first player to win consecutive
PGA titles since Denny Shute in 1936 and 1937. He could also become
the first person to win three Grand Slam events in the same year
since Ben Hogan in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Since shooting a 75 and a 72 in the first two rounds of the
Masters, Woods has played 11 rounds in 44 under in the major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he isn't driven by matching Hogan's feat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The funny thing about that is I really haven't thought about
it,'' he said. ''I haven't looked at it that way. I have looked at
the fact that I am trying to win a PGA Championship and a major.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where the chips may fall after that, let them fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had seven birdies and one bogey, missing several other
birdie putts inside 15 feet. He nearly eagled the closing hole when
his sand shot caught most of the hole, then settled for birdie when
he hit the 3-foot comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, playing his first competitive round with Woods, said
he was amazed by what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shot the easiest 66 today, and he missed half a dozen
opportunities,'' said Nicklaus, who labored in the heat for a 77.
''Phenomenal control, phenomenal concentration. That was a real
treat to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods only used his driver on two holes, and those drives were
measured at 331 and 328 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dunlap enjoyed his moment in the spotlight after
playing tours around the world. He has never finished higher than
third in 108 tour events, and his best effort in the majors is a
tie for 10th in last year's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing as many cuts (5) as he's made in major
championships, Dunlap said there's always hope of an upset win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, you never know when your first one is going to be,''
Dunlap said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Pittsburgh native had never shot lower in a
major championship than the 68 he shot in the opening round of the
British Open last month. He followed that with a 78 and missed the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can do is come out tomorrow and hopefully do a lot
better than I did Friday at the British Open,'' Dunlap said. ''Just
play another good round and take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his only previous PGA appearance, Dunlap tied for 68th last
year at Medinah, finishing 21 shots behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday he holed a wedge from 30 yards for eagle on the
second hole and added five birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Two shots back after 68s were Northern Ireland's Darren Clark
and 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   Love said he tried to shut out what Woods and everybody else was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just play my own game and get lost in my own little world
out there a little bit,'' he said. ''I am playing very, very well.
And I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Hayes, Fred Funk, Stephen Ames and Edward Fryatt -- who
barely made it into the field as an alternate for the injured Steve
Elkington -- each shot 69.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, second in each of the year's first three majors, had
a 74. So did Colin Montgomerie, seeking to win his first major in
38 tries.
</P>
<P>
   Six threesomes were unable to complete their rounds because of
slow play. The group of Tom Kite, Jim Furyk and Stuart Appleby was
on the course for more than 5&AMP;frac12; hours and were playing the 18th hole
when play was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 players were to complete their rounds before starting
their second round.

<HEADLINE> White House Travel Tab Exceeds $290M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 159 foreign trips made by President
Clinton -- the most widely traveled American president -- and other
administration officials since 1997 have cost taxpayers at least
$292 million, according to a report published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office review of the administration's
travel expenses said that most of the costs were paid by the
Pentagon, which provides the two jetliners that serve as Air Force
One and other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO study, which was obtained by The Washington Post, was
requested by six Republican senators, most of whom declined to
comment until the study is made public.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the lawmakers, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.,
called the costs ''exorbitant.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton spokesman accused the Republicans of requesting the
report for political purposes. The White House said the type of
expenses were similar to the expenditures of other administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that Clinton's 27 trips during the last three years
account for 85 percent, or $247 million, of the total aircraft
cost, the Post said. Next week he plans to fly to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said the Republican lawmakers did not request
comparable data on other administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The report is scheduled for release next month.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers overlooked woman, 83, after 911 calls reported wreck  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - Within minutes after 83-year-old
Tillie Tooter's car plunged off a bridge and into a swamp, at least
two passing motorists called authorities to report what they had
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Local firefighters came peered over the Interstate 595 bridge
for 15 minutes, using spotlights and flashlights to illuminate the
darkness. But they saw nothing, so Tooter remained trapped in her
car for three days before a passer-by found her.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue Department, praised as heroes
Tuesday for pulling Tooter from the swamp, and the Florida Highway
Patrol spent Thursday explaining how they failed to locate her
initially.
</P>
<P>
   They also had to explain why they didn't take another look after
relatives reported Saturday that Tooter disappeared while driving
to Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport. She was going
to pickup her granddaughter, Lori Simms of Marlboro, N.J., and
Simms' boyfriend when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The widow from nearby Pembroke Pines survived on rainwater
captured in a steering wheel cover before being rescued Tuesday.
That's when a 15-year-old boy picking up highway debris spotted her
car, suspended in trees 40 feet below the bridge and just inches
above the snake- and alligator-infested swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter remained hospitalized, with her condition upgraded from
serious to fair on Thursday. She planned a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Highway patrol troopers also are investigating an apparent
one-car accident that occurred at about the same time Saturday a
half-mile from the bridge. That car sustained front-end damage -
Tooter's car was rear-ended.
</P>
<P>
   Two men in their mid-20s, whose names were not released, told
troopers their car had hit the concrete wall, but they did not
mention any other vehicle being involved, said Stephen McInerny,
the fire-rescue department's division chief.
</P>
<P>
   Highway patrol Lt. John Bagnardi said it hadn't been determined
whether that car caused Tooter's accident.
</P>
<P>
   Fire department and highway patrol officials on Thursday blamed
their inability to find Tooter the first time on the thick trees
and the unwillingness of witnesses to stop and point out the exact
spot where her car fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vehicle had been swallowed up by the trees and the brush
and the muddy swamp floor,'' said Stephen McInerny, the fire-rescue
department's division chief.
</P>
<P>
   Even in daylight, he said, her car was impossible to see unless
a person stood directly above it and looked straight down off the
bridge. If one of the witnesses had stayed, maybe they could have
pinpointed the point where the car fell, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Highway patrol Lt. John Bagnardi said troopers were not sent to
the bridge early Saturday morning after dispatchers received a
motorist's call, but he could not explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Lidia Pena said Thursday she made it clear to a highway
patrol dispatcher that she saw a car go off the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Pena did not see the collision, but saw brake lights, followed
by a car climbing the retaining wall and somersaulting over. A
second car then struck the wall, its hood popped up and it
continued on the shoulder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, 21, did not stop, but used her cell phone to call 911 and
was transferred to a highway patrol dispatcher. The dispatcher
never asked for her name or phone number, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On her return home, Pena said she saw a trooper and fire-rescue
personnel gathered near the car she saw strike the wall. She said
she also saw an ambulance leaving the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''I assumed everything was taken care of,'' Pena said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Speech Left Out Some Details  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore's acceptance speech was laden with
policy but sometimes lacking in context, offering an incomplete
picture of his tax plans and his opponent's proposals on Medicare
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore alluded to a pair of tax fights in Congress: efforts to
eliminate the estate tax and the ''marriage penalty,'' a quirk in
the tax code whereby some married couples pay more in taxes than
they would if they were single. Both tax cuts have been championed
by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore said he, too, favors these cuts. But
Democrats support much more narrow changes than the high-profile
Republican proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to ''reform the estate tax, so people can
pass on a small business or a family farm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the estate tax already exempts almost all small businesses
and family farms. At issue is whether to eliminate it for the top 2
percent of heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to end the influence of big money in politics and
take on such monied interests as insurers and pharmaceutical
companies, which he said control the Republican Party and oppose
efforts to add a Medicare prescription drug benefit. ''They give in
to the big drug companies,'' he accused Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention that his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, is
among Congress' biggest recipients of money from both insurers
($197,419 this election) and drug makers ($84,550).
</P>
<P>
   In attacking proposals of Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, Gore again left out some details:
</P>
<P>
   -- He said: ''Their plan tells seniors to beg the HMOs and
insurance companies for prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush proposes that the government give low-income
elderly people prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Bush
promises to give the rest the right to sign up for a plan that
offers coverage but has offered no guarantee those plans would be
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   -- He characterized Bush's Social Security plan as one that would
''strip one out of every $6 from the Social Security Trust Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   That would happen only if every worker took Bush up on his offer
to put about one in $6 of their Social Security taxes into a
private retirement account. And while Social Security would lose
the money going into those accounts, the program would pay smaller
benefits to the people who have them.
</P>
<P>
   -- He said he ''will not go along with a huge tax cut for the
wealthy at the expense of everyone else,'' and that his opponent's
plan would only give middle income families 62 cents extra a day.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by a labor-financed research group backs up his
math. Taxpayers earning less than $39,300 would get about $227 per
year -- or about 62 cents per day -- under the Bush plan, according
to Citizens for Tax Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Any across-the-board income tax cut will mean more dollars for
the wealthy because they make the most money and therefore pay the
largest share of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cuts can mean more to lower-income people because the
money they get back is a larger share of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Gore boasted about the economy's strong growth over
the past eight years. He noted that deficits are now surpluses and
home ownership is at its highest level.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention that the recovery began two years before he
and President Clinton took office. And while Democrats passed
important legislation in 1993 increasing taxes and cutting
spending, Republicans have pressed for a balanced budget for years.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's true that 22 million jobs have been created since
Gore became vice president, the nation has seen similar job growth
over similar periods.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that inflation is the lowest in a generation.
That's true when examining the core rate, which excludes the big
jump in oil prices over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Polls Seek Likely Voters  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One poll shows a close presidential race.
Another shows a 16-point difference. Responses are coming from
Democrats, Republicans, independents and registered and likely
voters. What's a confused political spectator to do?
</P>
<P>
   Two suggestions: Wait for the dust from the political
conventions to settle a bit and try to understand the difference
between registered and likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I strongly advise waiting until a week or so after the
Democratic convention,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press. ''Right now, you have
polls with a short shelf life.''
</P>
<P>
   As voters begin to tune into the campaign, Kohut and other
pollsters will begin measuring the opinions of ''likely voters,''
those most likely to go to the polls. The opinions of non-voters,
including those who are just ''registered'' to vote, are
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Many pollsters don't begin surveying likely voters until the
final months of a campaign, but the Gallup Poll has been measuring
their opinions all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're attempting to say what would happen if the election were
held today,'' said Frank Newport, the poll's executive editor.
''That's the most accurate way to answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree, saying people don't know their intentions until
late in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the detailed questions asked of ''likely voters''
about their voting behavior and intentions tend to inflate the
influence of Republicans among the group, they say.
</P>
<P>
   That could explain why Republican George W. Bush was 16 points
ahead of Democrat Al Gore in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll last week,
when he was just 10 points ahead in others and the two were even in
a few more.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent polls were done in the midst of blanket coverage
of two political conventions, involving different types of voters,
which accounts for the differing outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to wait until voters get some convictions,'' said
Kohut. He said the diversity of poll results ''confuses people.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the election nears, pollsters will focus more on
identifying likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Some pollsters accomplish that by asking more than a half-dozen
questions about the level of interest and voting history. They then
use that information to approximate the results on Election Day,
either by weeding out unlikely voters or giving more weight to
those most likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Likely voters tend to be more educated and more affluent, older
and more interested in politics. As a group, they tend to lean
Republican, although interest among Democrats in voting can
increase sharply as the election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're mad, you turn out more than when you're happy,''
said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. ''Complacency is very
dangerous for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout in 1992 was 55 percent, the highest in 24 years --
after Ross Perot energized young voters and Bill Clinton promised a
new generation of leadership after 12 years of Republican rule. But
the general trend of turnout has been slipping since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was at its lowest level in 24 years in the 1996
presidential election, with 49 percent of the voting age population
casting a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Several indicators point to low turnout again this year,
including the low level of voter interest in the campaign, said
Curtis Gans, director of the Washington-based Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lots of people are registered to vote who have no intention of
voting,'' said Lake. ''It used to be if you were registered to
vote, it was a sign you would turn out.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Demand $1M More  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 28 hostages on a
remote Philippine island are demanding another $1 million for the
release of three Malaysians, negotiators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels were expected to release all the hostages,
including 12 Westerners, by Saturday, chief government negotiator
Robert Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators working to free the three Malaysians said the rebels
had agreed to release them as soon as the additional ransom was
paid. A plane carrying Malaysian officials was expected to arrive
in the southern Philippines later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told that it's in the works,'' said Malaysian Ambassador
Mohamed Arshad M. Hussain. ''I'm keeping my fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential adviser Lee Peng Wee, who has led efforts to
free the Malaysians, said ''the possibilities are very big'' they
would be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5.5 million was paid to the Abu Sayyaf last month
for the release of six other Malaysians and a German woman,
military officials said. That payment was supposed to cover the
three remaining Malaysians as well, but the guerrillas demanded
more money at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels seized 21 hostages from Malaysia's Sipadan diving
resort in April and brought them to Jolo island in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   They released a Filipino woman on Wednesday, leaving the three
Malaysians, three French, two Germans, two Finns, two South
Africans and one Filipino still in captivity from the original
Sipadan group.
</P>
<P>
   They later seized three French journalists and a dozen Filipino
Christian evangelists who came to pray for the Sipadan hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hostages were expected to be freed Thursday. But bad
weather and an order by President Joseph Estrada that all the
captives be freed at once delayed the release, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The instruction of the president is for us to secure their
release in one batch. Nobody should be left behind,'' Aventajado
told The Associated Press. ''We're trying to do that, barring any
physical constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the three Malaysians, however, could be released by
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest are expected tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's instruction raised speculation that he might order a
military attack on the rebels after the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 villagers from Bandang near the Abu Sayyaf's camp on
Jolo island have fled, fearing military action.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two major Muslim rebel groups
that have been fighting to create an independent Islamic nation in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played a high-profile role in the negotiations for the
Western hostages, but denies reports that it is paying as much as
$25 million to the rebels. Officials say Libya will fund
development projects in the southern Philippines instead.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Libya has mediated relations between Muslim
guerrillas and the Philippine government and helped build schools
and mosques in the impoverished south, home to nation's Muslim
minority. But Libya also has been accused of training rebels from
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, another separatist group.

<HEADLINE> 4 Out of 10 Voters Not Backing Gore  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four of 10 American voters don't like Al
Gore, say they won't vote for him and haven't shown much
inclination to change their minds, polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential nominee set out Thursday night to
start winning them over. He also has to win the support of more
core Democrats, more independents and undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   The opening two nights of the Democratic National Convention
didn't sway many voters, according to a bipartisan tracking poll.
But there were signs that Gore's fortunes might have started to
shift by the third night. Among independent voters, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's lead narrowed from 21 points to 11 points during
the week, though Gore's overall poll numbers didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was behind by almost 10 points among all voters at the
beginning of the week, and his deficit hadn't changed by Thursday
in the Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll.
</P>
<P>
   It may take until early next week to find out whether Gore will
get much of a poll bounce. Few voters would have seen his
convention speech by the time the poll wrapped up Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''These undecided voters won't come home unless Gore gives them
some specifics,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. ''They
want to know what the next president will do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign must continue to solidify his base of
Democratic voters, make steady progress with independents, and
figure out how to win a bigger share of women voters, especially
white married working mothers, who currently favor Bush by 40
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had an 18-point lead among men, and the two were about even
among women in the tracking poll. Gore must have a double-digit
lead among women, a traditional Democratic-leaning group, to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gore's weakness in the polls can be traced to the almost
40 percent of voters who just don't like him. Just over half view
him favorably. Bush is viewed favorably by almost a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president addressed his popularity with the public in
his nomination acceptance speech Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my own imperfections,'' he told the Democrats. ''I know
that sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy...
</P>
<P>
   ''But the presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a
day-by-day fight for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say it is natural for the candidate of the
incumbent party to have higher negatives than a challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush is a newcomer who hasn't had time to make any
enemies,'' said Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   But the percentage who don't like Gore is ''a bit higher than
we've seen in past years,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of
the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether that means something about Gore, or about how they
feel about President Clinton is the important question,'' Jamieson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Republicans and a third of independents say they
don't like Gore personally, while just over half of Democrats and a
fourth of independents don't like Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people hate Clinton and others love Clinton,'' Jamieson
said. ''There appears to be a proportion of Gore haters, without
the counterbalancing of Gore lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Voter.com-Battleground poll of 1,000 likely voters was taken
Tuesday and Wednesday and has an error margin of 3 percentage
points.

<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- President Chandrika Kumaratunga
dissolved the Sri Lankan Parliament on Friday, six days before the
end of its six-year term, and scheduled general elections for
October, an official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe gave no reason for the
early end of the 225-member assembly. New elections will be held
Oct. 10, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga's People's Alliance Party is likely to face a tough
challenge from the main opposition United National Party on the
issues of ending the Tamil separatist war, inflation and economic
hardship that the country's 18.6 million people face due to massive
war spending.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Cousin to Stand Death Trial  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Michael Skakel's lawyer has repeatedly
dismissed statements made by two men who claim the Kennedy cousin
confessed to killing his teen-age neighbor in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But a judge relied heavily on their testimony Thursday in ruling
that there is sufficient evidence to put Skakel on trial in the
25-year-old murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Court Judge Maureen Dennis also ordered an
investigation into whether the 39-year-old Skakel should be tried
as an adult or a juvenile. She gave no indication how long the
investigation would take or when she would rule on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel is charged with bludgeoning 15-year-old Martha Moxley
with a golf club on Oct. 30, 1975. The case is currently being
handled in juvenile court because Skakel, a nephew of Robert F.
Kennedy's widow, Ethel, was 15 at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Skakels lived across the street from the Moxleys in Belle
Haven, an exclusive community in Greenwich. Skakel's father,
Rushton, is Ethel Kennedy's brother.
</P>
<P>
   For years, authorities suspected Skakel's older brother, Thomas,
then 17, in the death. But no arrests were made, and the case
stalled until a grand jury consisting of a single judge was
appointed in 1998. In January, Michael Skakel was arrested based on
the grand juror's findings.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Skakel attended the Elan School, a drug and
alcohol treatment center in Maine. During a juvenile court hearing
in June, two former Elan students testified that Skakel told them
he had killed Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman, while cross-examining John
Higgins and Gregory Coleman, tried to cast doubt on their memories
and motives, and asked why they didn't come forward sooner with
Skakel's alleged confessions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis, in her ruling, said she found both men's stories
believable.
</P>
<P>
   She also cited Coleman's testimony that Skakel told him he was
trying to make advances toward Moxley, but that she would not
comply and that he ''drove her skull in'' with a golf club.
Investigators said the club used in the crime was traced to a set
owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also said Skakel told him, ''I am going to get away with
murder. I'm a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he does not believe a jury will find Coleman and
Higgins believable, and that Skakel is anxious for the case to go
to trial: ''He knows that when all the facts are made known ... not
only a jury or a judge, but I think the public at large will also
see that he is not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has asked that Skakel be tried as an adult, and
the court's decision on the matter could significantly affect any
possible penalty.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted as an adult, Skakel could get life in prison. If
convicted as a juvenile, some legal experts have said he could be
spared any punishment.

<HEADLINE> Be Counted: Musicians Helping Causes  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If you don't think it takes courage to perform
at benefit concerts, singer David Crosby wants you to consider the
case of Jackson Browne.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people will tell you he could have been the biggest star
of his time,'' Crosby says. ''He's one of the best writers and
singers, and he's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Browne would agree to play at benefits where -- his agent
would warn -- he couldn't be booked for paying concerts for at least
a year thereafter. Browne did the benefits anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''He damaged his career sticking up for what he believed in,''
Crosby says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stand and Be Counted'' is a documentary Crosby put together
with footage from benefit concerts and his interviews with various
performer-activists including Sting, and Paul Kantner of Jefferson
Starship/Jefferson Airplane. The four-hour program will be shown in
two parts on TLC (formerly the Learning Channel) on Monday and
Tuesday, 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been fascinated by people who have the guts to do
benefits and the courage to stick up for what they believe in,''
said Crosby, a member of the legendary Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Concert footage includes performances by Peter Gabriel, the
Fugees, Eric Clapton, Carly Simon, James Taylor, U2, Robbie
Robertson, R.E.M., Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Emmylou Harris, Woody
Guthrie, the Weavers and, of course, Crosby, Stills and Nash.
</P>
<P>
   There is also footage of Bruce Springsteen celebrating his 30th
birthday at a No Nukes concert, and of Springsteen and Sting
singing an exciting ''Every Breath You Take'' duet.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby said he couldn't get the rights to show Tina Turner and
Mick Jagger performing at 1985's Live Aid concerts, which raised
more than $144 million to fight famine in Africa. But he was able
to get other concert footage, including some that has never been
shown on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the biggest thing people haven't seen is musicians talking
about what matters to them. Jimmy Buffett talks about what he
stands for. When you think of him, you think of drunken
Parrotheads,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Kantner refused to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he liked working for causes but he didn't want to talk
about it,'' said Crosby. ''I guilted him into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby has been an outspoken voice for social change since the
'60s, when he was a member of the Byrds. He has been impressed by
the work of Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger and Joan Baez, but
realizes that some people don't believe musicians should be
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're upset that we use what they see as power that way.
Somebody was running chain saws during the songs when Bonnie Raitt
was giving an outdoor concert in California to try to save the last
of the old-growth redwoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was financed by Norman Waitt Jr., owner of Gold
Circle Entertainment, which includes Samson Music. Samson is the
label for CPR, the trio made up of Crosby, James Raymond and Jeff
Pevar.
</P>
<P>
   Friends encouraged Crosby and writer David Bender to make the
documentary after their book, ''Stand and Be Counted: Making Music,
Making History,'' was published last year by HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was particularly impressed by the people who went into the
South to organize voter registration drives,'' Crosby said. ''They
were risking their lives, and they did so with grace and
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to attend a Sept. 19 rally in Washington, D.C., in
support of campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of all the musicians who try to better the living
condition of somebody else,'' he said. ''To many of us, I don't
know if we feel obligated, but we're overjoyed. It gives meaning to
our lives. It's important for us to feel we're contributing human
beings, part of the solution as opposed to being part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The minute you feel you can do what you love most in the world
and make the world better, even the tiniest bit, it makes you want
to do more.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Suicides Hit Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Suicides in Japan rose to a record high for the
second straight year, driven up by health problems and the nation's
prolonged economic slump, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 33,048 people killed themselves in Japan in 1999, up 0.6
percent from the previous record of 32,863 suicides in 1998, the
National Police Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   About half the total suicides were people suffering from health
problems, the NPA said. Suicides attributed to Japan's prolonged
economic slowdown rose by 11.6 percent in 1999, to 6,758, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a wave of corporate restructuring has forced many
companies to cut workers as the economy remains in its worst slump
since World War II. Last year, Japan's unemployment rate reached an
all-time high of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By gender, 23,512 men took their own lives in 1999, up 499 from
the previous year, and 9,536 women killed themselves, down 314, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates. Every year,
36.5 of every 100,000 men and 14.7 of every 100,000 women commit
suicide. That compares with 19.9 men and 4.6 women in the United
States and 11.7 men and 3.2 women in England, according to the
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the ministry said average life spans in Japan in
1999 were 77.1 years for men and 83.99 years for women. That was
down slightly from the 1998 figures of 77.16 years for men and
84.01 years for women, but still the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry attributed the declines -- the first for both sexes
since a deadly earthquake hit the city of Kobe in 1995 -- to an
increase in deaths caused by an outbreak of influenza-induced
pneumonia that swept across Japan in the winter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Korean Families Find Disagreements  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Euphoria quickly turned to frustration
when Lee Jong-sung, 84, met the two North Korean sons he had not
seen in more than a half century.
</P>
<P>
   Other than endless praises for their country's leader, Kim Jong
Il, and diatribes against ''U.S. imperialists,'' the sons hardly
had anything to say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally told them to get some common sense,'' Lee said.
''When they gave me that political nonsense, they didn't feel like
my own sons.''
</P>
<P>
   A hundred aging South Koreans returned home Friday after
emotionally charged four-day reunions with family members they left
in the North during the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was a dream come true, but also brought a somber
realization of how far the two Koreas have drifted apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pyongyang was like any other big city, except that it had few
street lamps at night, few cars, and no fat people,'' Cho Yoon-jin,
72, said about the capital of North Korea, which is suffering from
a dire shortage of fuel and food.
</P>
<P>
   Cho reunited with his wife, a younger sister and a son he last
saw during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a Christian and told them that they should believe in God
to go to heaven when they die. But they had their own gods. They
said they believe in Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung,'' Cho said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il, the current North Korean leader, took over after
the 1994 death of his father, Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas sent 100 people to each other's capitals this
week after a historic June summit between Kim Jong Il and South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   For those who yearned for their long-lost families, the reunion
was much too short.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't go. Don't go,'' said the tearful Kim Bong-ja, 86,
hugging her son one last time before parting at a Seoul hotel.
''But we met, Mother. Didn't we?'' said Ri Young Su, 66, of North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in this week's reunions face the possibility
that they may never see each other again, since many are old and
numerous obstacles remain to reconciliation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   After boarding a bus bound for Seoul's Kimpo airport, Ri stuck
his arm through a window and his South Korean family grabbed his
hand and sang a song popular in both Koreas: ''Our wish is
unification.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Air plane that took the North Korean visitors home
brought the South Korean group from Pyongyang several hours later.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans said the pain of their departure was more poignant
because of what they saw in the impoverished, totalitarian North.
Up to 2 million North Koreans have died of hunger since 1995, say
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife and two children kept saying they were well-off. But I
saw their clothes and deep lines in their faces and they did not
seem OK. ... That added to my sense of guilt for leaving them in
the North,'' said Lee Young-chan, 83.
</P>
<P>
   Southern visitors said they tried to give their relatives some
U.S. dollars. But the North Koreans proudly declined in the
presence of communist minders.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I slipped a $500 bill each into the pockets of my brother
and son, and they whispered into my ear that I should not tell the
communist officials about the dollar bills,'' said Kim Chan-ha, 77.
''They said they can make good use of the dollars in the North.''

<HEADLINE> New Tropical Storm Near Antigua  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Chris formed Friday east of the
Caribbean island of Antigua, and the long-lived Alberto built
itself up into a hurricane again deep in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   With steady winds of 40 mph, Chris has prospects for building
into a hurricane in two to three days. A reconnaissance plane was
to fly into the storm Friday afternoon to help forecasters better
predict its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The track was expected to stay safely north of the Caribbean
islands, but people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were
advised to keep an eye on the developing storm, which was sending
storm-force winds of 39 mph outward about 70 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll probably miss them to the north by at least 150 to 200
miles,'' said Stacy Stewart, a hurricane specialist at the National
Hurricane Center in Miami. ''They'll be on the south side of the
system, which is usually the weak side.''
</P>
<P>
   The islands may get some showers and a temporary shift in the
trade winds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. EDT, Chris was centered about 410 miles east of
Antigua. The storm was the west-northwest near 13 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Monday before forecasters can tell whether Chris poses
any threat to the continental United States. The storm could slow
down, ride under a weather ridge and pose a threat to the
northwestern Bahamas early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just about as far as I can stick my neck out at this
time,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto strengthened into a hurricane again Friday with 75 mph
winds as it spins in the open Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto, which formed Aug. 4 and never posed a threat to land,
was expected to set the record for August tropical storms later
Friday, topping the 14-day lifespan of Hurricane Felix in August
1995. Stewart called Alberto ''the storm that won't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., Alberto's center was about 1,100 miles southwest of
the westernmost Azores Islands. It was moving northwest at 8 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The storm is making a ''great big loop'' in the Atlantic and in
a few days could reach cooler waters and weaken again, said
hurricane specialist Jack Beven.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in midday trading Friday
despite another strong showing for big-name technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gave up earlier gains powered
by advances in General Motors and Intel. At midday, the Dow was
down 23.44 points at 11,032.20.
</P>
<P>
   Other market barometers were mixed in a relatively quiet morning
of trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 7.53 at 3,948.40 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.26 points to 1,492.81.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors shares rose sharply after news broke that
prominent financier Carl Icahn intends to buy more than $15 million
of the company's stock. GM was up $3.375 at $68.813.
</P>
<P>
   Tech bellwethers continued their upward momentum from the day
before. Intel was up $1.938 at $72 and Sun Microsystems, which
declared a 2-for-1 stock split Thursday, rose $3.188 to $122.625.
Texas Instruments rose $2.375 to $69.875.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications was off $2.063 at $39.50, a day after news
came out that the Texas-based phone company is being accused in a
lawsuit of intentionally slowing the speed at which customers can
connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has been relatively light in recent days, with many
investors on vacation or looking ahead to next Tuesday's Federal
Reserve meeting. Investors are hoping that the Fed has finished
with its credit-tightening campaign and will leave interest rates
alone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 5 to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 400.43 million
shares, up from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.54 points at 515.92.

<HEADLINE> Australia, Aborigines War Over Term  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- The Australian government refused
Friday to acknowledge the term ''stolen generation'' to describe up
to 100,000 Aboriginal children who were taken from their families.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron said the exact number of
children separated from their families under past government
policies would never be known so the claim that they represented a
generation was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Commonwealth has never denied that there were children who
were removed over a period of years,'' Herron told a Senate
committee. But he insisted only about 10 percent of Aboriginal
children were taken from their parents and that this did not
represent a whole generation.
</P>
<P>
   When Herron made similar comments in April, it outraged
Aborigines who warned of protests during the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   From 1910 until the 1970s, thousands of mostly mixed-blood
Aboriginal children were taken from their parents under laws based
on the premise that Aborigines were a doomed race and saving the
children was a humane alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Although lack of documentation made exact numbers impossible to
calculate, a 1996 national inquiry estimated the number of children
totaled 100,000 and that many suffered long-term psychological pain
from the loss of family and cultural connections.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark judgment last week, a federal judge threw out the
case of two Aborigines who tried to sue the government for
separating them from their families.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Maurice O'Loughlin acknowledged the term Aborigines
use to describe those taken when he said the evidence in the case
did not ''deny the existence of the stolen generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister John Howard has consistently refused to make an
official apology to the Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal groups are planning a series of peaceful protests
during the Olympics to highlight the plight of the indigenous
people.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's original inhabitants, Aborigines are a minority of
386,000 mostly impoverished people in a population of 19 million.

<HEADLINE> Germans Urged To Fight Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN GRAHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder urged all Germans to
help fight neo-Nazi violence on Friday ahead of his two-week tour
of eastern Germany, site of a recent rash of extreme-right
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't let a few skinheads gone wild destroy what you have
built here,'' Schroeder told guests at a ceremony marking the 50th
anniversary of the steelworks in the eastern town of
Eisenhuettenstadt.
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities will hit right-wing activity ''clear and
hard,'' he said, citizens must also help stamp out violence and
discrimination against immigrants and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who starts his tour Monday in the spa town of
Bad Elster in Saxony, also repeated his warning that far-right
extremism could damage Germany's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to show that this is not Germany,'' he said in his
first public appearance since returning from vacation in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The steelworks where he spoke, long threatened with closure, is
now profitable under French ownership and one of the few bright
spots in the depressed eastern German economy. The company has also
taken a hard line in combating neo-Nazism in the workplace, sacking
an apprentice in 1998 for attending a far-right demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the interior ministers from Germany's 16 states also
pledged to take a harder line with right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to increase the pressure on neo-Nazi ideologues and
their thuggish followers,'' Fritz Behrens, the interior minister of
North Rhine-Westphalia, said after the meeting in the state capital
Duesseldorf. Still, the states won't announce concrete steps until
November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That comes too late to stop a wave of right-wing violence which
has left at least two people dead this year and sparked a debate
about whether to ban the far-right National Democratic Party, which
is seen by some as a rallying point for extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Interior Minister Otto Schily, who attended Friday's
meeting of his state counterparts, earlier in the day warned that
such a step could force far-right activists underground where they
would me more difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent bid to head off a ban, the National Democratic
Party announced Friday it won't stage any demonstrations until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Schily also said the government will look at whether it can
tighten laws on public demonstrations to prevent a repeat of a
neo-Nazi march through Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and keep neo-Nazis
from rallying at the nearby planned Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident involving right-wing youths, police said
Friday that they took three men aged 18-19 into custody for setting
fire to an Asian fast-food stand in the eastern town of Schwerin.
Two of the suspects are known right-wingers, police said.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers May Be Able To Open Hatch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rescuers should be able to open an escape hatch on
the stricken Russian submarine Kursk from the outside without
assistance from any of the sub's crew, a British expert said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a perfectly straightforward escape hatch system which can
be opened from the inside and the outside,'' said Richard Sharpe, a
retired Royal Navy nuclear submarine captain and editor of Jane's
Fighting Ships, a respected publication on military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue capsule reached one of the sub's escape hatches for the
first time Friday but was unable to gain access because it was so
badly damaged, a Russian navy official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is another hatch, but so far the Russian navy has not
commented on its condition. In an interview Friday with The
Associated Press, Sharpe spoke about how rescuers could use the
hatch if it is intact.
</P>
<P>
   He said there are two doors which control access to each escape
hatch. One is inside, allowing as many as four crew members at a
time to move into the escape column. Once inside, they would close
the inner door, then flood the column to equalize pressure with the
outside while using special breathing devices.
</P>
<P>
   When pressure was equalized, they would open the top door and
swim out.
</P>
<P>
   For a rescue craft, the procedure essentially would be reversed.
Sharpe said he assumed that the interior door on the Kursk's escape
hatch could be operated by someone entering from the outside, but
''that is pure guesswork on my behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if everything works, it is a high-risk operation, Sharpe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has ever done it and lived from 350 feet,'' except
under carefully controlled test conditions with expert divers, he
said.

<HEADLINE> New Grand Jury Investigates Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray is signaling
that the Monica Lewinsky scandal is far from over, assembling a new
grand jury to investigate the president's conduct, legal sources
say.
</P>
<P>
   News that the grand jury was impaneled a month ago reverberated
to the other side of the country Thursday, with Democratic Party
loyalists at the convention in Los Angeles decrying the story as a
politically motivated leak designed to hurt Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Clinton was to drop dead, the Republicans would dig him
up,'' complained Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
GOP nominee, also criticized the release of the information. ''It's
not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made on a day
that the vice president is going to accept the Democratic
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the news ''hours before Al Gore is to give this
speech'' warrants a federal investigation, said Rep. Jesse Jackson
Jr., D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can bet your bottom dollar that the Republican Party was
behind'' the leak, said House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
''I think the American people are going to reject this kind of
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, one of the top Republican
counter-punchers at the Democratic National Convention, said in a
telephone conference call Friday: ''I don't know anything about it
... and I don't think anybody on the Republican side knows anyting
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the judicial system was being
''manipulated for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the convention in its final day, Clinton was 3,000 miles
away at the White House, where spokesman Jake Siewert pointed to
prosecutors as a likely source of the leak. Ray's office denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The sources telling The Associated Press that a new grand jury
was convened July 11 in the Clinton-Lewinsky matter are outside the
Independent Counsel's office. The sources spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The setting up of a new Clinton-Lewinsky grand jury at the U.S.
Courthouse in Washington, D.C., follows through on Ray's promise to
weigh whether the president should be indicted after he steps down
from office next January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate,
which fell 12 votes short of convicting him on a perjury charge and
17 votes short of conviction on a charge of obstructing justice.
Now, a year and a half later, a special panel of judges is renewing
Ray's mandate for another year.
</P>
<P>
   The judges issued a legalistic one-sentence order Wednesday
declaring that ''termination of the office ... is not currently
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal questions are whether Clinton committed perjury or
obstructed justice when he denied an affair in sworn testimony in
the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Jones case has already ruled the president gave
false testimony and fined him for civil contempt of court. The
disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has also moved
to revoke Clinton's law license.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ausbrook, senior counsel to Ray, declined comment about
any grand jury activity, which is kept secret by law.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to the judges' order, Ausbrook noted that
''we've made public that the Lewinsky investigation remains open
and that the e-mail investigation remains open.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail probe focuses on whether the White House concealed
thousands of electronic messages sought by investigators.
Presidential aides deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail probe, a conservative group, Judicial Watch,
revealed that Ray's office is using a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch released the first page of a subpoena for records
of a major witness in the investigation, Sheryl Hall, a former
White House computer specialist who said some of her fellow workers
had been threatened with jail if they revealed a problem with the
e-mail archiving system. The absence of archiving of incoming
messages made it impossible for the White House to review thousands
of e-mails to determine if they should be surrendered in various
investigations -- from the Lewinsky scandal to Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch has been critical of Ray's office for recently
closing the books on two other Clinton-era controversies -- the
White House gathering of secret FBI files on Republicans and
possible lying regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in the
firings of White House travel office employees. The prosecutor
declined to bring criminal charges in either case and Judicial
Watch says Ray should have waited until the White House
reconstructs e-mail that was missing from the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other federal grand juries are sitting at the courthouse
investigating a variety of matters, yet Ray has sought and obtained
permission to form a separate grand jury focusing on
Clinton-Lewinsky rather than using any of the other seven, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a separate grand jury for Clinton-Lewinsky is ''a way
for Ray to be prepared to act quickly and to deal with this
question efficiently when he turns to it,'' said John Barrett of
the St. John's University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   The new grand jury is likely to get up to speed on the scandal
by receiving evidence in the form of transcripts and summaries of
previously gathered evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage in this particular investigation it would be
highly unlikely for a new grand jury to receive any new information
that had not already been considered at length by Ken Starr, the
United States Congress and the prior grand jury,'' said John
Douglass, an expert in criminal law and criminal procedure at the
University of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett and Douglass did extensive work before grand juries in
the Iran-Contra investigation of Reagan and Bush administration
higher-ups conducted by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Dissolves Parliament  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- The government dissolved Parliament
early and called quick elections Friday in a bid to strengthen its
political hand and end a war with Tamil separatists that has killed
at least 62,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's term would have ended in six days. Elections will
be held Oct. 10 and the new Parliament will convene on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga's move comes after the
government failed to win parliamentary approval of a new
constitution granting autonomy to Tamil regions. She hoped the new
constitution would satisfy Tamil moderates and reduce support for
the rebels' 17-year war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The government needs to win a two-thirds majority in the new
225-member assembly to pass the constitution. It currently lacks
this majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we are going for elections eight weeks from now
by not wasting time shows we are eager to take steps to end the
war,'' said Mangala Samaraweera, media minister.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for the early dissolution of Parliament. But
officials at the presidential secretariat said astrologers had told
Kumaratunga that the day and time were auspicious. Sri Lankans are
avid followers of astrology.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga's five-party alliance is expected to face a tough
challenge from the opposition United National Party. A Marxist
group and the Sinhalese Heritage party have also gained votes in
local elections. Nominations end Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition parties said the early elections give the
government, which controls broadcast stations and a newspaper, an
advantage since its rivals will not be able to gear up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has given the minimum time period for
campaigning, which places them at a terrific advantage over
others,'' said Thilak Karunaratne, general secretary of the
nationalist Sinhala Urumaya, or Sinhalese Heritage Party.
</P>
<P>
   The elections had been expected in November.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have rejected the government's new constitution, with
its autonomy offer, saying they want only independence for the
Tamil minority, who are mostly Hindus. Senior Buddhist monks and
nationalists of the Sinhalese majority also opposed the
constitution, saying it gave the Tamils too much and threatened
disintegration of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's constitution, adopted after the country gained
freedom from British colonial rulers in 1947, grants privileges and
powers to the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists and constitute 76
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the government named a new commander of the
100,000-strong army and reported that sporadic clashes in the north
left six rebels and a soldier dead in villages near the city of
Jaffna, a former rebel capital they are trying to recapture.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Lionel Balagalle will take replace Maj. Gen. Srilal
Weerasooriya, who retires as army commander on Aug. 24. Balagalle
joined the army in 1965 and has served extensively on the
northeastern battlefront.

<HEADLINE> British 'Big Brother' Star Booted  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- He is the most reviled TV villain since J.R.
Ewing. Newspapers have labeled him ''the most hated man in
Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bateman didn't bring down a corporation or savage the
environment. He broke the rules of a television game show -- and for
that, Big Brother decreed, he must be banished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nasty Nick,'' a 32-year-old insurance broker, was evicted from
the British version of the ''Big Brother'' reality TV show on
Thursday for conspiring against fellow contestants -- and walked
into a new life of national opprobrium, front-page attention and
lucrative media deals.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster was headline news in Friday morning's newspapers.
''Nick's Out'' blared the tabloid Sun. ''TV nemesis as the enemy
within is turfed out'' said the usually serious Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't committed a murder,'' Bateman told a packed news
conference Friday. ''I was just taking part in a game show.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Big Brother,'' 10 strangers must share a house under the
constant surveillance of cameras and microphones. Each week
contestants are nominated for eviction by the household, and
viewers decide which will be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original Dutch version was harshly criticized as
exploitative and voyeuristic, the show became a hit and was copied
in Germany, Spain and now the United States and England. In the
British version, the last person remaining after nine weeks wins
$105,000.
</P>
<P>
   The show's combination of voyeurism and melodrama has made it a
hit with British viewers, 5.5 million of whom tuned in Thursday.
Even the soberest of newspapers have tracked the daily spats and
squabbles -- and the sole kiss to date -- among the housemates.
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed star of the show was Bateman, who deftly
manipulated his fellow contestants, a self-absorbed but mostly
amiable lot, in a bid to influence their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the program, he told his housemates that he had been
married and his wife had been killed in a car accident in
Australia. He later confessed he had made up the story.
</P>
<P>
   The populist Sun newspaper launched a ''Kick Out Nick'' campaign
and attempted to drop leaflets on the house to reveal to the other
contestants that Nick was lying. Newspapers mulled over conspiracy
theories -- that he had been planted in the house by producers to
stir things up, or had smuggled in a mobile phone in his underwear
to receive instructions from outside.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bateman's housemates discovered what viewers had
known for weeks: He had lied, set them against one another and, in
violation of the game's rules, smuggled in pen and paper with which
to plot his strategy. Producers, who had already issued Bateman a
written warning for discussing the eviction nominations,
disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
   He was promptly whisked off to an undisclosed location to meet
with his family and a counselor -- and then the press.

<HEADLINE> Revised Beethoven's 9th Set To Go  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some music lovers may think it's sacrilege --
like drawing a beard on the ''Mona Lisa.'' But the National
Symphony Orchestra is determined to perform a retooled version of
Beethoven's revered ''Ninth Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center calls it ''Beethoven by Mahler by Slatkin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who know this music well, you'll have fun spotting
the differences,'' director Leonard Slatkin said in announcing a
10-day Beethoven festival. ''And for those who are just coming to
hear Beethoven, it's still Beethoven.''
</P>
<P>
   The revisions come from composer Gustav Mahler, who wrote nine
symphonies of his own a century after the master. His versions of
Beethoven -- Mahler put his mark on six of Beethoven's nine
symphonies -- will be the nub of programs Sept. 7-16 at the Kennedy
Center. Slatkin says it's the first time such a festival has
focused on the reworkings.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler did not change rhythms, solos or melodies. So don't
expect to hear a rhumba rhythm in the ''Ninth Symphony's'' great
''Ode to Joy.'' But at the start of the movement, he did add a tuba
-- an instrument that did not exist in Beethoven's time.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler aimed to improve the sound of passages in which groups of
instruments play together and need strengthening, said David
Pickett, a former conductor of the Bloomington (Ind.) Symphony
Orchestra who is advising Slatkin on the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven had to deal with much smaller halls and far fewer
musicians than today's 100 or more instrumentalists at symphony
concerts, Pickett explained in an interview. So Mahler felt the
weaker sounds of strings and woodwinds had to be reinforced to
balance the stronger brass instruments like French horns.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler's editing of Beethoven generally pleased performers. But
he made his changes in red ink on the printed music and critics
studied them skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   ''They saw a lot of red ink and they raised the roof,'' Pickett
said. ''Mahler got someone to write a one-page defense in rather
flowery language and handed it out at a concert of the Vienna
Philharmonic on Feb. 2, 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahler also took out some repetitions, including at least one
that may have been cut only for a New York audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Viennese love their composers,'' Pickett said, ''and if
one repeats the same melody 25 times they want to hear it 25 times.
Americans aren't so patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Johann Sebastian Bach wrote some music with no indication of
what instruments should play it, leaving the impression that it
could be performed with whatever was at hand. But in Beethoven's
time, orchestras were more solidly established and he made it clear
just where the horns should blast in, and what passages should be
carried by clarinets or violins.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was deaf, but he knew the musical colors he wanted,'' said
Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   Composers have been tinkering with Beethoven's work as far back
as Richard Wagner. Pickett said Mahler did a more thorough job
using natural sound to get the effects that today's engineers try
to create with microphones and loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like painting a beard on the 'Mona Lisa' and not
being able to get it off,'' Pickett said. ''You can always go back
to Beethoven's original score.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Criticizes Immigration Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba called U.S. immigration policy ''murderous''
Friday and said American officials have ignored its requests for
information about cases of illegal immigration after two brothers
recently died off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the Communist Party daily Granma said the deaths
were ''another sinister and gloomy story of the fruits of the
murderous Cuban Adjustment Act and the increasingly unbearable
criminal policies of the U.S. government toward Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Adjustment Act, passed by Congress in 1966, allows any
Cuban who reaches American soil to apply for U.S. residency.
</P>
<P>
   The shark-torn body of Juan Carlos Rodriguez Bueno, 23, found
off the Florida coast, was identified Monday by relatives in the
Miami area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard was unable to retrieve a second body
because it was apparently dragged underwater by a shark. However,
it was believed to be that of 20-year-old Alex Rodriguez Bueno.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were last seen by relatives in Cuba on Aug. 6 and
apparently had been planning to make the dangerous 90-mile trip
across the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials suspect that the brothers were part of a larger
group of people who had hired alien smugglers to take them to the
United States. It wants more information about such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials say U.S. law encourages illegal immigration and
puts lives at risk, but Cuban exiles in Miami characterize illegal
Cuban immigrants as poor souls fleeing communism in search of
freedom.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Victims Honored in Germany  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Joined by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
relatives of the 113 people killed in the Concorde crash gathered
Friday in Cologne's 750-year-old cathedral and were asked: Has
mankind reached too far?
</P>
<P>
   The peal of church bells rang out as relatives of the victims
trailed Schroeder into the vast gothic cathedral, Germany's
largest. Schroeder met with the relatives privately before the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,500 mourners attended the hourlong ecumenical service led
by the Cologne bishop and the head of the German Lutheran Church.
One theme ran throughout the service -- encapsulated in a question
by the Cathedral's priest, Bernard Henrichs: ''What are the limits
of what is possible?''
</P>
<P>
   The question has haunted the relatives of those who died since
the supersonic jet crashed shortly after takeoff outside Paris last
month, killing all 109 aboard and four on the ground. The airline
industry also has had to confront the reality of investigators'
findings that the crash was caused by a burst tire.
</P>
<P>
   Air France, which owned the crashed Concorde chartered by a
German tour group setting off on a luxury cruise through the
Caribbean, has not returned the jets to service since the crash.
British Airways also grounded its Concordes this week.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries, however, have said they are committed to getting
the plane back in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But no determination of cause or official certification that the
jets are safe can comfort the loved ones, religious leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the experts' investigation and journalistic research
may reveal ... does not answer the question, 'Why?''' said the head
of the Lutheran church in Germany, the Rev. Manfred Kock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why this plane exactly, and why these people exactly? All of
the technical explanations will not undo what has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath the cathedral's ornate stained glass windows,
Cologne's bishop drew a sharp distinction between technological
advances that honor God and those meant to glorify mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Friedhelm Hofmann cited an advertising sign at the Basel
airport that reads: ''We are building heaven on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When we truly try to replace the reality of heaven by building
an earthly paradise, death will always tear us abruptly from our
illusions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hofmann said the mourners could find comfort in the
cathedral's graceful spires: ''In building this church, our
forefathers turned our gaze toward heaven through this
manifestation of earthly beauty, harmony and legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   This crash -- and other modern tragedies, like the crash of a
high-speed train in northern Germany two years ago that killed 101
people and a bomb explosion at a Duesseldorf train station three
weeks ago that injured 10 immigrants -- create feelings of
hopelessness, the bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel caught off-guard, abandoned and overtaxed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners were travelers who opted not to take the
pricier Concorde across the Atlantic. Kennith Dixon, a Briton who
retired in Cologne, said he didn't know any of the people who died
but found comfort in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here just to pay my respects to them, even though I
didn't know them, and as a symbol of thanks that I was not on the
plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who attended the service, which included hymns sung
by the Cologne Boys Choir, was receptive to the religious leaders'
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a bit angry about what they said. They tried to build up
a heavy doom-and-gloom atmosphere. This is not the way to help the
survivors,'' said Eberhard Francesco-Lorenz, an opera singer from
Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question, 'Why does it happen?' makes no sense. The better
question is, 'What does this mean for our daily lives?'''

<HEADLINE> USDA May Require Carcass Destruction  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing concerns about the use of
antibiotics and hormones in food animals, the government is
preparing to stop packers from selling any meat from carcasses in
which excessive chemical residue is found.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, packers can throw out the part of an animal
that's tested for drug residue, typically the liver or kidney, and
sell the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which could be made final as early as next
month, would require that the entire carcass be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials said the policy would apply to
all livestock but it would primarily affect slaughtered dairy cows,
the source of about 40 percent of the nation's hamburger meat.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say the intent is to bring their procedures into
line with the Food and Drug Administration's policy on chemical
residues in food. FDA sets the limits, or tolerances, for drug
residues in food animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violation rates are very, very low,'' said Karen Hulebak,
chief scientist for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
''We're talking about a small number of animals in the scheme of
all the animals slaughtered in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The department does not believe, she said, that unsafe meat is
reaching consumers.
</P>
<P>
   About 0.2 percent of the cattle tested in 1997 had drug residues
in excess of FDA limits, or 12,400 of the 6.2 million cattle
slaughtered that year. Animals are tested for more than 50
different compounds, including a variety of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hanson, a food-safety expert with Consumers Union, said the
new policy would be a ''step forward in increasing the safety of
the food supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocacy groups assert that livestock producers are
giving excessive amounts of hormones, antibiotics and other drugs
to their animals. There is concern among scientists, for example,
that harmful bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics when they
are exposed to the drugs in animals and become more of a threat to
humans.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence certain human illnesses and allergic
reactions are due to drug residues in meat.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the new policy would have a significant
economic impact on meatpackers.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins in the packing industry are so thin that
slaughterhouses process or resell every bit of the cattle they
kill, including the blood, bones and even the intestinal contents.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be a pretty dramatic shift,'' Janet Riley, a
spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, said of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Packers can't control the use of drugs in animals they buy, she
said. ''We want to solve this problem before it gets to the plant.
We're working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA does not test every animal for drugs, but instead conducts
a monitoring program for a list of drugs that changes each year,
depending on what chemicals officials think they need to watch for.
</P>
<P>
   Tests are also done at packing plants on animals that USDA
veterinarians suspect may have excessive amounts of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy cattle, because they are slaughtered at an older age than
cattle raised for beef and accumulate more drug residue in their
systems, are tested the most frequently.
</P>
<P>
   When drug residues in the liver or kidney exceed FDA tolerances,
tests are also done on the meat. However, FDA has not set
tolerances in meat for most drugs, so there is no established limit
for USDA officials to use in determining whether the meat is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the department's current policy, the meat can be cleared
for sale if the residue in the meat does not exceed the limits set
for the liver and kidney.

By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LILY DALE, N.Y. (AP) - Maybe it's the drive, past farms and
along the wooded shores of a quiet lake. Or maybe it's passing
through a gate into a cozy community of 19th Century
gingerbread-like houses and streets not widened since their horse
and buggy beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the first moments at the Lily Dale Assembly
elicit a distinct sense of tranquility, a feeling continuously
nurtured through the course of a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Calling itself the ''world's largest Spiritualist community,''
Lily Dale and its yearround and seasonal residents invite visitors
to renew body and spirit. That could involve meditating at an
ancient tree stump deep in a virgin forest, taking part in a
''thought exchange,'' or walking a shrubbery labyrnth - a one-path
maze - while contemplating life's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 22,000 to 25,000 who pass through the gates each
year, it means meeting with one of the assembly's three dozen
registered ''mediums'' - people who claim to commune with the
spirit world - in hopes of receiving a message or guidance from a
loved one who has died.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''It is not a psychic fair,'' cautions historian Joyce
LaJudice, who stresses Lily Dale residents are serious about
privately practicing the religion of Spiritualism. ''We are not
here for entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a believer is not a requirement to wander the grounds,
browse the bookstores or attend free daily meditation and healing
services and clairvoyance demonstrations by resident and visiting
mediums.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 121st season, summer is Lily Dale's busy season, with
workshops, services and lectures on topics ranging from past-life
regression to yoga scheduled every day through Sept. 3. Services
are held on a more limited basis yearround and Lily Dale's resident
mediums continue to offer readings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marion Skidmore library is stocked with hundreds of books
devoted to healing, mediumship, transpersonal pyschology and
spirital development and gift stores stock crystals, clothing,
herbs and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Dale Assembly, named for the abundance of lilies flowering
on Cassadaga Lake on which it sits, has its roots in a group of
Spiritualists who met regulary in the mid-1800s to discuss their
beliefs and practice their healting and mediumship. The first
speaker at Lily Dale was suffragette Elizabeth Lowe Watson, who was
followed by peers including Susan B. Anthony, as the gathering
place about 55 miles southwest of Buffalo became a stronghold for
the suffrage movement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors come for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''To get away and find peace and connect with yourself,'' said
Jackie Laird of Pittsburgh as she walked the wooded grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Burdick-Carey, one of 15 mediums who live permanently at
Lily Dale, is one of several people who noted a shift toward a
search for something beyond material worth.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more people who are coming to see a medium are coming
for spiritual purposes,'' Burdick-Carey said, ''not only whether
they should marry Joe or Bill or if they should buy a blue or green
car. They want to know about their spirituality; what they can do
to upflift their spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really became noticeable last year. There's a definite
change in society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laird, who was making her second visit to Lily Dale, agreed and
said the lectures and lessons help teach people to find ''inner
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are searching and it's a good thing,'' she
said. ''I think we went to one extreme and had to find out who we
really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdick-Carey and the assembly's other mediums know there are
more than a few who doubt their abilities - and the mission of Lily
Dale in general. They welcome the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''People can be extremely skeptical and I have no problem with
that,'' Burdick-Carey said. ''I won't accept something I haven't
researched.''
</P>
<P>
   But, ''This place radiates peace, love and a gentle, healing
energy,'' she said, ''and everyone feels these things.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were down slightly Friday in another
session of lackluster trading as investors preferred to wait on the
sidelines until next week's Federal Reserve meeting.

   At midafternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 33.70 to 11,021.87.

   Trading has been extremely light this week as most companies
have completed issuing second quarter earnings reports and
investors await Tuesday's meeting of Fed policy-makers. Most
traders expect the Fed to leave interest rates alone, believing the
Fed's six rate increases since last summer have sufficiently slowed
the economy and eliminated any inflation risk.

<HEADLINE> John McCain Meets With Doctors  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain met with his doctors
Friday to discuss the seriousness of his skin cancer and to chart
the best action against the malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   The former Republican presidential candidate and his wife,
Cindy, met with doctors for about 3&AMP;frac12; hours at the Mayo Clinic here.
McCain did not speak to reporters but flashed a thumbs-up sign as
he drove from the clinic in a sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said McCain planned to release a statement later Friday
from his doctors about the extent of his cancer and the treatment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment options depend on how deep the cancer is and whether
it has spread. Melanoma near the skin surface can be surgically
removed, with excellent chances of recovery. McCain had a lesion
removed from his shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook is much worse once the cancer has grown deeper
than about two-tenths of an inch or spread into the lymph system or
other tissues. Patients whose melanoma has spread through the body
are usually referred to experimental treatments of new anti-cancer
drugs or vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly four hours he spent at the clinic Thursday,
McCain underwent blood work, a chest X-ray and imaging scans to
determine whether the cancer has spread. Other tests, including an
electrocardiogram, checked the health of his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel fine, thanks,'' McCain told reporters after he left the
clinic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He then donned sunglasses and got behind the wheel of a black
sport utility vehicle to drive home.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain's office said doctors had found two spots
of melanoma, on his left arm and temple. Finding two areas of
cancer simultaneously could suggest the pair are part of a more
serious form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's office said the two spots are not related.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say McCain, who turns 64 on Aug. 29, has faithfully seen
his doctor for checkups every three months since he had a lesion
removed from his shoulder seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   McCain canceled about a dozen scheduled campaign events with GOP
candidates, including a last-minute cancelation of a Thursday
evening fund-raiser for Arizona state Senate candidate Debra
Raeder.
</P>
<P>
   Raeder said she was honored McCain tried to participate amid his
medical work.

<HEADLINE> Latvian Police Search for Suspects  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN C. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Police were searching Friday for suspects
and a motive behind twin bomb blasts that left 35 people injured,
three seriously, in the worst attack of its kind since this former
Soviet Baltic nation regained independence.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions went off minutes apart Thursday, ripping through
crowds at a popular shopping center and sending bleeding victims
staggering into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Latvian Prime Minister Andris Berzins was cutting short his
holiday in France and returning home Friday to deal with the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Police raised the number of injured from 21 to 35 on Friday.
Three remained hospitalized, including two women with severe burns
over some 50 percent of their bodies and deep lacerations, the
Baltic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Others suffered less serious burns and cuts caused by flying
glass and splinters. Some reported hearing loss from the
detonations, which shook nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators turned their attention Friday to possible motives.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Krists Leiskalns said they were seriously
considering the possibility that the bombings were a terrorist
attack, though he did not elaborate. Police also have said the
bombings could have been related to a business dispute.
</P>
<P>
   This nation of 2.5 million has seen several minor bombings since
it regained independence after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union. Injuries have been rare in previous attacks, many of which
were linked to turf battles or extortion rackets by organized crime
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Several monuments commemorating Latvian independence and others
marking Soviet-era war victories also have been bombed in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Admitted wife-beater sentenced to five years in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - An admitted wife-beater who had the support
of the general manager of the Philadelphia Flyers was sentenced
Friday to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Southern New Jersey businessman Robert Stevenson, 36, pleaded
guilty in July to aggravated assault and bail jumping for beating
his wife in 1997 and fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Stevenson, who has since reconciled with her husband,
suffered a fractured skull, four broken ribs, a punctured lung and
a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers general manager Bob Clarke signed an affidavit July 11 in
support of lower bail for Stevenson. The affidavit offered
Stevenson a job and a place to stay until his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who was criticized by two local newspaper columnists for
his support of Stevenson, later said he regretted signing the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't knowing at the time I signed it there was going to be
this big thing,'' he said in July. ''I was certainly not supporting
somebody who beat up on his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Stevenson's plea agreement, charges of attempted
murder were dropped. Because he did not have a a $2,800 restitution
check at his Friday sentencing, that money will be garnished from
future wages, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Former Court of Appeals Chief Judge Lawrence Cooke dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) - Lawrence H. Cooke, who presided over the
unification of New York's courts as chief judge of New York's
highest court, died Thursday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke, who had been in failing health, died at his home. In
1991, he had had a pacemaker installed after his heart stopped in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was one of the last judges to be elected to the state
Court of Appeals, in 1974, and in 1979 he was designated as chief
judge of the court by former Gov. Hugh Carey.
</P>
<P>
   He served until his mandatory retirement at age 70 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Cooke was known as one of the more liberal
voices on the court. Decisions he authored included those
recognizing due process rights and right to counsel of defendants
under the state constitution, which exceed those the federal courts
had recognized under the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke also wrote decisions upholding a woman's right to receive
seniority credit for maternity leave and several rulings defending
adults' parental rights against termination.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Kaye, the current chief judge of the Court of Appeals,
grew up in Monticello and said she knew Cooke since she was a young
child. Kaye said she'd frequently see Cooke in the local grocery
store and in the clothing store Kaye's parents operated in the
Catskill Mountain village.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was ''universally beloved'' in Monticello, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was on such a pedestal in many ways that (being a judge)
was beyond my thinking,'' Kaye said. ''But it certainly must have
influenced my desire to become a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke became renowned for working long hours at the Court of
Appeals, frequently arriving at his chambers at 3 a.m., Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke swore in Kaye when she joined the Court of Appeals in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a year and a half with him'' on the Court of Appeals,
Kaye said Friday. ''The hardest thing I had to do as a judge on the
Court of Appeals was to call him, 'Larry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though described as unfailingly courteous and kind, Cooke
nonetheless tangled with governors over the budgets given the
courts by the state while he was chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   He angered upstate judges in 1979 by transferring 242 of them
temporarily to reduce backlogs in downstate courts. In 1981, Cooke
removed 97 acting state Supreme Court justices in New York City
because of concerns over favoritism - a move that was challenged by
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke appeared before his own court as a litigant in that case.
The court, with Cooke not participating, ruled the chief judge had
exceeded his constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   During Cooke's tenure as chief judge, the state was also in the
process of unifying New York's court system above the level of town
and village courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judge Cooke was a great New Yorker who furthered the great
cause of justice throughout his long and distinguished career,''
Gov. George Pataki said Friday. ''Chief Judge Cooke served this
state with distinction, with dignity and intelligent good humor,
and he will be sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Court of Appeals, Cooke was appointed by
Ronald Reagan to head the National Center for State Courts and
became a law professor at Pace University. Pataki also appointed
him to lead the state's Judicial Screening Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke graduated from Georgetown University and Albany Law
School. He was supervisor in the town of Thompson in Sullivan
County and chairman of the county's board of supervisors in 1947
and 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was from a small community, Cooke said he sometimes
felt others believed he was a ''country bumpkin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to the proper schools, I had been around, and I felt I
could hold my own in any company,'' he told The New York Times just
before leaving the Court of Appeals in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was survived by Alice, his wife of 61 years, and three
children - Edward, George and Lauren. He also had nine
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A wake for Cooke was scheduled for Sunday afternoon at the
Lawrence H. Cooke Sullivan County Courthouse in Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be 11 a.m. Monday at St. Peter's Catholic
Church in Monticello. Kaye will deliver the eulogy.

<HEADLINE> Raritan Township man is founder of the Doodyville Historical Society </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW REILLY
The Star-Ledger of Newark
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say, kids! What time is it?
</P>
<P>
   Any ''kids'' who can correctly answer that question aren't kids
anymore. More likely, they're adjusting to life with bifocals and
relaxed-fit jeans, fretting over the mortgage and their 401(k)
plan's performance.
</P>
<P>
   The full-throated rejoinder, ''It's Howdy Doody time!'' hasn't
been heard from a TV set for decades. The original show went off
the air in 1960 after a 13-year run, and a mid-1970s revival lasted
only two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But in a little corner of suburbia in Hunterdon County, it's
always Howdy Doody time.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Raritan Township, in the hobby room of pharmacist Jeff
Judson, is the international headquarters of the Doodyville
Historical Society, publisher of The Howdy Doody Times and world
epicenter for all things Doody.
</P>
<P>
   Judson founded the club in 1978, and today it has 300 members
from across the country and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from a family of collectors,'' Judson said. ''When I
was ready to graduate college in 1971, I figured I needed a hobby
of my own. I wanted to pick something to do with early television,
with toys and games, something not very many people would
collect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was around this time that Buffalo Bob Smith, who was touring
college campuses with Howdy, Clarabell the clown and other
characters from the old TV show, arrived on the campus of the
University of Connecticut, where Judson was a student.
</P>
<P>
   ''Howdy met all three of my criteria for collecting, and having
Buffalo Bob come to campus just led me in that direction,'' Judson
said. ''Howdy Doody was the show I grew up with, my favorite show
growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   So Judson began collecting. After meeting other collectors and
fans of the show, he decided to start up the Doodyville Historical
Society. In addition to Howdy Doody buffs, the membership includes
people who worked on the show, such as Lew Anderson, who played
Clarabell, executive producer Roger Muir and prop master Scottie
Brinker.
</P>
<P>
   The club publishes an 18-page newsletter 11 times a year, and
Judson, who is the editor, said he has no trouble finding items to
fill its pages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be anything from an original article written by a
member to a photocopy of an article from a newspaper in the
1950s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They hold a convention about every other year, the most recent
in October of last year. This fall, members will receive campaign
posters for Howdy Doody for president, featuring the slogan, ''Two
scoops in every ice cream cone.'' As he has every four years since
1948, Howdy is seeking the highest elective office in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his first campaign was a writer's solution to a fairly
vexing problem: How to put on a show starring a puppet when you
have no puppet.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kean, who wrote 1,900 scripts and 90 songs for the show, said
the original puppet known as Howdy Doody actually belonged to a
puppeteer who had a troupe of characters featured on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Until the puppeteer officially joined the show, Buffalo Bob
talked to a slightly opened dresser drawer, pretending Howdy was
hiding inside, too shy to come out. Howdy only emerged after his
owner came on board, but he wasn't the puppet everyone remembers
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The original Howdy Doody puppet was as ugly as sin,'' Kean
said. ''When the show began to catch on, the puppeteer claimed
ownership of Howdy and got into a brawl with NBC. He sued, but he
lost in court.''
</P>
<P>
   The puppet's owner walked off, taking his puppet with him.
</P>
<P>
   Kean wrote a story line that had Howdy deciding to run for
president in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Howdy) didn't think he looked pretty enough, so he went to
Oregon for a face lift,'' Kean said.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months, the recuperating Howdy Doody's head was
completely wrapped in bandages, giving the show time to design and
build a new puppet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney studios helped come up with the image, a 12-year-old,
all-American-boy, cowboy image,'' Judson said. Thus was the
redheaded, freckle-faced, grinning, apple-cheeked Howdy Doody born.
</P>
<P>
   Judson said three Howdy Doody puppets actually were made for the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The original Howdy Doody wound up in the care of the last
puppeteer to work the show. He loaned it to Buffalo Bob, but since
Smith's death two years ago, ownership of the marionette has been
in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A second puppet, a backup called Double Doody, is in the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A third one, with the strings and wires removed so it could be
posed for pictures, is called Photo Doody and was sold at auction a
few years ago for $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Judson doesn't have any of the original marionettes, but he
probably has as much Howdy Doody memorabilia as anyone. He started
by scouring flea markets and antique shops. Then he put ads in
antique magazines. He's bought a few items over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His collection now includes a paint set, a fudge bar, coin
banks, juice cups, jelly jars, lunch boxes, license plates, Pez
dispensers, watches, Jell-O mix, candy, toys, paintings, posters
and numerous other items.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no end to it,'' Judson said.
</P>
<P>
   And with 20 members in New Jersey and scores elsewhere -
doctors, lawyers, factory workers - there are that many more eyes
looking for treasures to buy, trade and sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was every Baby Boomer's favorite. We all watched it,''
Judson said. ''It brings back memories of times before mortgages
and tax bills and insurance payments. A simpler time.''

<HEADLINE> Missionaries spend long days pounding the pavement -- in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY MATHESON
The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - Wholesome-looking and clean-cut, with
white shirts, dark slacks, Bibles and name tags, the missionaries
are easy to spot as they go door-to-door through the streets of
Bellmawr.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hi! We're from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. Have you seen us around here before?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a hot, muggy day and the two 20-year-olds wipe the sweat
from their foreheads before they knock on each door. After all,
they have come to present a message about the Lord and want to look
their best.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you believe in Christ? You do? That's wonderful. Can we
share a message with you about Him?''
</P>
<P>
   The missionaries are friendly and open as they meet the
residents of Beechwood Place, Victory Drive and Aspen Place. They
approach each person differently, yet with the same goal in mind:
to be invited inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have you seen those commercials on TV for The Book of Mormon?
Do you know what it is?''
</P>
<P>
   Many people who answer the door say yes, they've seen the ads
and yes, they've heard of the Latter-day Saints. But the bottom
line is simple: Thanks, but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The young men remain unfailingly polite, even in rejection:
''You have a good day now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though others might see them as telemarketers in the flesh,
elders Aaron Goodfellow and Tom Proctor know they are not salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   They are servants of God.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in southern New Jersey, chances are you've come
across Goodfellow, Proctor or one of the other 138 LDS missionaries
assigned to the church's Cherry Hill mission.
</P>
<P>
   They're not Jehovah's Witnesses, another faith in which members
pair up to proselytize door-to-door. They are members of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as the
Mormon church, even though its followers aren't enamored of the
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a large religion - there are fewer than 11 million
members worldwide - but it has some notable followers. Locally,
WCAU-TV sportscaster Vai Sikahema is bishop of the church's
Moorestown ward; nationally, retired NFL quarterback Steve Young is
a descendant of early LDS leader Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   In its quest to proclaim the gospel and find new members, the
church oversees more than 60,000 missionaries all over the world.
Three-quarters are men between the ages of 19 and 26 who serve for
two years; the remaining 25 percent are women and retired couples,
who serve for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Cherry Hill mission covers the lower two-thirds of New
Jersey. A second mission, headquartered in Morristown, ministers to
the northern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Being a missionary is at once a bonding and isolating
experience. Participants are constantly exposed to the public and
other missionaries, but their contact with the world in general -
and their families in particular - is severely limited.
</P>
<P>
   They are only allowed to call home on Christmas and Mother's
Day, and letters to their family are limited to one a week. They
are also asked to abstain from TV, radio, newspapers, movies and
computers. These things are considered distractions from their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a few find the lifestyle too hard and go home early.
Others may get homesick occasionally but are glad to serve the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings are normal, says Keith Giddens, a Moorestown
resident and president of the Cherry Hill mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're thousands of miles away from home,'' says Giddens.
''Then they get into the work and make their friends here and it
begins to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a miracle, really, when you see what they give up to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it that convinces a 19-year-old man to become an
evangelist for two years?
</P>
<P>
   In a word: tradition. Like bar mitzvahs for Jews and
confirmations for Catholics, missions are a part of religious life
for LDS members. It's not a requirement, but young adults - men
especially - are strongly encouraged to go.
</P>
<P>
   Missionaries don't get to choose their assignments - those come
from church officials in Salt Lake City. Some people are sent to
New Jersey, others to New Zealand. Depending on their destination,
missionaries receive two to eight weeks of training before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Their dedication is such that they save about $10,000 in order
to pay for food, rent and other necessities during their
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Elder Goodfellow came to the Cherry Hill mission 21 months ago
from the small town of Fruitland, Idaho. After being stationed for
weeks at a time in places such as North Brunswick, Absecon,
Burlington City and Princeton, Goodfellow has spent the past five
months in a Barrington apartment, one of more than 50 rented by the
church in central and southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He recently got a new partner - elder Proctor from Sandy, Utah -
as part of the rotation of missionaries within the Cherry Hill
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Their schedule for six days of the week is rigorous - and
mandated: Rise at 6:30 a.m.; personal religious study at 7:30 a.m.;
study with companion at 8:30 a.m.; leave for appointments at 9:30
a.m.; return to apartment at 9:30 p.m.; curfew at 10:30 p.m. On the
seventh day, time is set aside for errands such as grocery
shopping, laundry and letter writing.
</P>
<P>
   Proctor and Goodfellow make their rounds in a white Toyota
Corolla, its trunk full of videos, pamphlets and LDS literature.
Some of their appointments are referrals, people who have responded
to TV ads and want more information, but many are cold calls.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to present six 'discussions' to a prospective
member over a series of visits and then have that person baptized
into the church. Discussions cover the history of the Latter-day
Saints and basic beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not here to force what we believe on anyone,'' says
Goodfellow. ''We're here to present the message and let people find
out for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three months prior to Proctor's arrival, Goodfellow
and his companion, elder Baden Patterson, had six people baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Those who convert, says Goodfellow, make ''all the thousand
doors slammed in your face worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the LDS belief in Christ as the savior, there are parts
of church doctrine that many people - even other Christians - find
off-putting.
</P>
<P>
   Their practice of redeeming the dead through proxy baptism is
unusual, as is their belief that families can be ''sealed''
together for eternity. Coffee, tea, tobacco and alcohol are all
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Missionaries who proselytize around here don't always get the
chance to go into these details. When they visit Marie Clayton's
Bellmawr neighborhood, she tells them she's not interested right
off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just say, 'I'm sorry. I'm Catholic,' and they just leave,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Kennedy, Clayton's next-door neighbor, turns away the
missionaries as much for their method as their message.
</P>
<P>
   Once, she says, a pair of missionaries came in the evening, a
time she felt was inappropriate. She also doesn't like the idea of
strangers in her home - even if they're carrying Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel they should be coming into people's houses,''
says Kennedy, another Catholic. ''I don't like people going
door-to-door.''
</P>
<P>
   Proctor understands he won't be welcome in many homes. The LDS
church teaches that everyone has free agency and people like
Clayton and Kennedy can decide not to hear his message.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're free to choose,'' says Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   And he's free to continue preaching. Proctor is eager to share
the happiness he believes comes from following the Lord through the
Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ''What He has given me and my family,'' says Proctor, ''I want
to give to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part is getting people to listen. That's not easy in
a society where religion occupies a smaller part of people's daily
lives, says Giddens, the mission president.
</P>
<P>
   The elders say sometimes the most willing listeners are in
poorer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The upper-class people are so busy ... they just don't have
the time,'' says Goodfellow. ''(Others,) they've been humbled, so
they're willing to talk.''

<HEADLINE> More phone vandalism on Long Island  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Another telephone vandalism report emerged on
Friday in the metropolitan area as the strike by Verizon
Communications workers entered its 13th day.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone cable in Baldwin, on Long Island, was cut at 7:15
p.m. Thursday, Nassau County police said Friday. Damage caused by
the vandalism at Merrick Road and Central Avenue was estimated at
about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Soraya Rodriguez, a Verizon spokeswoman, would confirm only that
service was disrupted and that the cable served up to 200
customers. She said the problem was fixed within hours.
</P>
<P>
   A Verizon ad in The New York Times on Friday offered a $25,000
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
''telephone cable and equipment vandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications is in the middle of a bitter strike with
two unions, and the incident comes a day after thousands of
striking workers held rallies across New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Two striking Verizon Communications workers remained in critical
condition at the Nassau County Medical Center after a Thursday
incident, also in Baldwin, in which they allegedly cut what they
thought was a phone cable. The line was, in fact, a 13,000 volt
electric cable. The incident disrupted electric service to 2,600
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Joseph Hertzel, 26, Joanne Pinder, 33, both of
Baldwin Harbor, were charged with criminal tampering and criminal
mischief in the Thursday incident.
</P>
<P>
   The strike involves 87,000 company employees, whose contracts
expired on Aug. 6. The workers are represented by the Communication
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues in the contract talks include mandatory overtime and
the movement of work. The unions fear that Verizon - the product of
a summer merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE - will shift work
within its expanded region to areas where labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at the pace of progress, IBEW negotiators and one of
CWA's bargaining tables had threatened earlier in the week to quit
negotiations at midnight Thursday in the absence of an agreement or
substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the deadline, the company said it had
''fine-tuned'' its contract proposal, and negotiations continued on
Friday.

<P>
   The strike of repair and customer service workers affects 25
million Verizon consumers from Maine to Virginia. Regular phone
service has not been impacted, but the strike has slowed directory
assistance calls and repairs and indefinitely halted most new line
requests.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were down slightly Friday in another
session of lackluster trading as investors preferred to wait on the
sidelines until next week's Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 20.88 to 11,034.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 9.01 at 3,931.80 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 4.41 to 1,491.66.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has been extremely light this week as most companies
have completed issuing second quarter earnings reports and
investors await Tuesday's meeting of Fed policy-makers. Most
traders expect the Fed to leave interest rates alone, believing the
Fed's six rate increases since last summer have sufficiently slowed
the economy and eliminated any inflation risk.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors shares rose $2.50 to $68 amid reports that
financier Carl Icahn intends to buy more than $15 million of the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tech bellwethers continued their upward momentum from the day
before. Intel was up 75 cents at $70.75 and Sun Microsystems, which
declared a 2-for-1 stock split Thursday, rose $2.556 to $122. Texas
Instruments rose $2.50 to $69.934.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers were broadly lower, a day after Al Gore chided the
industry in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National
Convention. Merck, down $1.75 to $72.188 and Pharmacia, down $2 at
$57, were among the biggest losers.
</P>

   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 7-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 646.45 million

<HEADLINE> Quietly, Million Youth March gets permit  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - After two years of tooth-and-nail legal haggling
over the Million Youth March, city officials quietly granted a
Labor Day weekend permit for the inflammatory Harlem event, event
organizers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city has decided not to fight us on our permits,'' said
Malik Zulu Shabazz, attorney for the New Black Panther Party for
Self Defense, holding a letter from the city corporation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if Rudy Giuliani, the mayor, has had enough in
this year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, city officials had denounced the affair as a
hate-fest where violence was encouraged. But Corporation Counsel
Michael Hess said the decision to grant the permit was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it's not going to be a big turnout,'' Hess said.
''Last year the turnout was pathetic and pitiful, and it will
likely be the same this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The third annual event - billed as ''B2K: Black Power 2000'' -
was scheduled for Sept. 2 between 119th and 125th streets in
Harlem. The event, as in the past, was organized by former Nation
of Islam spokesman Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, now aligned with the New Black Panther Party, was
booted from the Nation of Islam for publicly calling Jews
''bloodsuckers'' and similarly attacking Catholics, whites and
others.
</P>
<P>
   His venom has crossed racial barriers; he's derided black
elected officials who do not support him as ''Uncle Toms'' and
''boot lickers'' for whites. Muhammad did not attend the Friday
news conference, but will speak at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key granting of the permit follows two consecutive years
where the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the
organizers when city officials moved to block the September event,
condemning it as bigoted and hateful.
</P>
<P>
   The first Million Youth March, in 1998, ended in a melee when
police clashed with the crowd while strictly enforcing a 4 p.m.
curfew. There were 28 minor injuries, including 16 police officers,
in the bottle- and chair-throwing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's event, which drew a mere 2,000 people, was peaceful.
Shabazz was asked if he expected this year's event to proceed in
the same trouble-free vein.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is, 'Can the white man, or the police officers of
New York, promise that they will be non-violent?''' Shabazz
replied. ''If you're non-violent, we will be non-violent.''

<HEADLINE> Israel May OK Palestinian State  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel would agree to creation of a Palestinian
state if the Palestinians end their conflict with Israel, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday in his clearest reference yet to
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after U.S. State Department mediator Dennis Ross
arrived to evaluate whether the two sides are ready to move toward
a peace accord despite the failure of last month's summit at Camp
David, Barak warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare
a state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want to set up a state in the West Bank and
Gaza, with the traditionally Arab section of Jerusalem as its
capital. Israel claims all of Jerusalem and wants to keep small
parts of the West Bank where most Jewish settlers live.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning borders or Jerusalem, Barak said he would
agree to a state, an issue he has been ambiguous about in public
until now.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Palestinian leadership is prepared to confront the
challenge of setting up a Palestinian state and solving the
hardships of its people,'' said Barak, ''it must understand that a
condition for that is ending the conflict with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's opponents charge he is offering the Palestinians broad
concessions without demanding that they formally end the
century-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
   When they signed an interim agreement last September, the two
sides set a target date of Sept. 13 for finishing a peace treaty.
Arafat said that after that date, he would have the right to
declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a military college graduation ceremony, Barak warned
that a unilateral declaration would provoke Israeli countermeasures
and violence. ''This kind of deterioration would hurt, first and
foremost, the Palestinians themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not specify the countermeasures, but Israeli officials
have mentioned annexing parts of the West Bank, blocking entry of
Palestinian workers and stopping trade, effectively choking the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Ross, acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami said the question of another summit is not on the agenda
now. ''We need to have some flexibility from the other side,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said his mission is to see ''whether or not the differences
that exist can be overcome.'' Ross is to meet with Barak, but
Arafat is abroad and is not expected back until next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military expressed regret Thursday over the shooting
death of an elderly Palestinian after he fired on Israeli soldiers
Wednesday near Ramallah on the West Bank. He apparently thought
they were burglars, and the soldiers thought they were under
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's security chief, Col. Jibril Rajoub, charged that the
shooting was a crime that would hurt the peace process. ''I think
it was a plot by the Israelis, who went in the dark of night, like
thieves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians agreed on one issue Thursday --
rejecting a State Department travel advisory warning American
tourists that there is an ''increased possibility of terror
attacks'' in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, an adviser to Barak, said the announcement was
unnecessary. Rajoub called it ''State Department propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said his
forces are always on alert for terror attacks, but there are no
specific warnings now.

<HEADLINE> Disease, Floods Kill 70 in India  </HEADLINE>
By WASBIR HUSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Waterborne diseases and flooding rivers
caused by seasonal monsoon rains have killed at least 70 people and
sickened hundreds in India over the past week, authorities and news
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A bus with more than 60 passengers was swept away by a swollen
Banas River Friday night in central Madhya Pradesh state. Only
seven people managed to swim to safety, the news agency Press Trust
of India quoted police as saying. Rescue operations were hampered
by continuous rains.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, 20 people have also been killed and hundreds
made ill by waterborne diseases in India's flood-ravaged northeast
state of Assam, and authorities warn they don't have enough doctors
to cope with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gastroenteritis is spreading quickly in western Assam districts
of Kokrajhar and Nalbari since tens of thousands of people have
started going back to their villages after the flooding, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The swollen rivers have become polluted and wells filled with
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least 15 deaths were reported and more than 50 are sickened
with gastroenteritis during the past week after villagers ate fish
from the swollen Nijla River,'' J.I. Kathar, the district
magistrate of Kokrajhar, said over the telephone. ''We are finding
it hard to cope with no doctors available to treat the villagers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nalbari district, 95 miles west of Gauhati, at least five
villagers have died of dysentery, while hundreds of others were
reported sick.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-member International Federation of the Red Cross team is
touring parts of Assam to assess the flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the delegation, Geoffrey Dennis, said tens of
thousands of stranded villagers had been without food or medical
care for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''If aid doesn't reach them soon, we may begin to see serious
malnutrition and outbreaks of waterborne diseases,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's monsoon season in India has seen about 300 people
killed and millions of homes destroyed, according to Indian
authorities.

<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Promoter Bob Arum lashed out at the Nevada
Athletic Commission after a federal grand jury acquitted
International Boxing Federation founder Robert W. Lee Sr. of
bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank everyone for bringing me before the commission
prior to the case being over as we had requested,'' a sarcastic
Arum told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Commission executive director Marc Ratner had filed a complaint
against Arum, president of Las Vegas-based Top Rank, because the
promoter had testified in Lee's trial in New Jersey that he paid
$100,000 more than the normal sanction fee to the IBF for approval
of the George Foreman-Axel Schulz fight in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The commission accepted a negotiated settlement in the case
Wednesday, and Arum paid a $125,000 fine and agreed to several
stipulations, including opening his books to the commission and the
Nevada Attorney General's office for six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still can't figure out why I am the only promoter who has
gone before the commission,'' he said by telephone from Southern
California, where he was vacationing. ''I think that is despicable,
picking out the only promoter who is based in Nevada and throwing
him into this without having taken action against anybody. I say
that if this commission doesn't call (promoter) Don King in, with
the oodles of testimony about the payments he made, and ask him at
least if he made those payments, that something fishy is going on
in the state of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really mean that. Again, I don't regret the fine and having
to go before the commission. I don't regret volunteering everything
to the FBI. I do really regret the way this has unfolded in the
state of Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the Lee trial designated King as an unindicted
co-conspirator, but he did not testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner has said that other promoters would be called in to
appear before the commission. Ratner said the reason Arum was
called in first was that the commission had the transcripts of his
testimony in the Lee trial first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really angry,'' Arum said. ''I am chagrined. I don't know
what really is going on. I really deep down believe Mr. King is
pulling the strings. Why did the (commission) have to rush into
this when our lawyers asked them to wait until the (federal IBF)
trial was over?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Flip Homansky of the commission said it didn't matter that
Arum appeared before the federal trial was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our actions didn't depend on the results of the trial in New
Jersey,'' he said. ''The commission (executive director) filed a
complaint after Mr. Arum's testimony in a court of law in which he
stated he paid money to get a fighter a championship fight. We
would have still acted on the complaint no matter what happened in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem here is that Mr. Arum admits to a wrong-doing in
which a jury found that no one was guilty (of bribery). That part
of it doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Luther Mack said he was shocked Lee was found
innocent on the bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is amazing,'' Mack said. ''I can't believe that. It tells
me the states have to do more investigation on these organizations.
I think Nevada will be stronger than the federal government. They
caught him taking the money on tape. I read the transcripts. Maybe
there is something I am not aware of. To me, he appeared to be
guilty at that point. I just can't understand it.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Asks U.S. Aid Thorugh NATO  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At Russia's suggestion, the Pentagon is
coordinating with NATO to offer three options for technical
assistance in reaching the crew of the sunken Russian submarine,
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has not asked for American help, but Cohen said he has
offered to send a small team of U.S. experts to the scene of the
rescue effort to provide engineering, medical and other advice.
That team was being assembled Friday for possible use, he said,
although there is no indication Russia will ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand ready to provide whatever assistance would be
required and called for,'' Cohen told a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he received a written reply Thursday evening to his
letter Tuesday to Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev in
which Cohen urged him to ''not hesitate to ask'' for American
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, Sergeyev thanked Cohen for his concern and
suggested U.S. officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
join ongoing consultations about potential avenues of assistance to
the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Russia asked for British and Norwegian help; those
two nations are sending rescue teams to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering to send a small team of U.S. technical
experts, Cohen said the United States could help set up an
''international coordination cell'' at NATO headquarters and send
special diving suits.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had no insight into how likely the Russians
believe it is that some members of the stricken sub's crew are
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that they are agreeable and willing to have NATO
assistance, should it be necessary in their judgment, is some
indication that they still feel that there are sailors alive,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning that two American submarines were in the
Barents Sea at the time of the sub accident Aug. 12 and detected
sounds of two explosions, Cohen said no U.S. ships were involved in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. submarines got no closer than about 70 miles from the
scene of the accident, according to a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. There were two U.S. submarines within
listening distance of the Kursk, not by design but because one had
just arrived to relieve the other, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, the newest of 11 Oscar II-class attack submarines in
the Russian fleet, has been of particular interest to the U.S.
Navy. Late last summer, the Kursk slipped into the Mediterranean
Sea and shadowed a U.S. carrier battle group -- the first time in at
least two years that a Russian sub had been in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper of the Kursk received a special award for last
summer's mission in the Mediterranean, according to a Pentagon
official who discussed the matter Friday on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress in October, Vice Adm. Daniel J.
Murphy Jr., commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet based in the
Mediterranean, described that mission as ''inconvenient'' for U.S.
forces. He said nine Navy P-3C Orion electronic surveillance
aircraft were diverted from missions over Kosovo to search for the
Russian submarine, which he described as having the ''very best
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar II-class submarines were designed to stalk U.S.
carrier battle groups and, in time of war, attack with nuclear
cruise missiles. The Kursk was commissioned in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> With: BC-NJ--Arum  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The racketeering trial of IBF founder Robert
W. Lee may be over, but its impact is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the four-month trial tarnished some of the biggest
figures in boxing, and portrayed the sport as an enterprise awash
in payoffs, lawsuits and vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum, second only to Don King, was punished this
week, and promoters Cedric Kushner and Dino Duva are being
scrutinized by commissions in important boxing states.
</P>
<P>
   All but King testified, admitting they paid thousands of dollars
for favors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called King an unindicted co-conspirator who was the
principal beneficiary of Lee's machinations, and played an
undercover videotape that an informant said showed a King payoff
being divided.
</P>
<P>
   Although acquitted Thursday on the core charges - that the IBF
routinely took bribes from promoters and managers to rig its
ratings - Lee faces about three years in prison for six
convictions. He was cleared on 27 other felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Now 66, Lee said he intended to retire this year anyway, but he
has been out of the fight game since being stripped of his
authority last year by the federal judge who later oversaw the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was barred through a racketeering lawsuit brought by federal
prosecutors that mirrored the criminal charges. U.S. Attorney
Robert J. Cleary said they would pursue the lawsuit to permanently
ban Lee from boxing and recover illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   The East Orange-based IBF has since named a new president and
continues operating under the scrutiny of a court-appointed
monitor, the first U.S. sports group subject to a remedy generally
reserved for mob-riddled labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not immediately clear if the IBF and the two other major
sanctioning bodies, the WBA and WBC, will be weakened because of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're still under the microscope,'' said Nigel Collins,
editor of The Ring magazine.
</P>
<P>
   More critical, he said Friday, is whether prosecutors and
regulators embrace the provisions of recent Muhammad Ali Boxing
Act, which encourages states to adopt uniform criteria for rating
boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Such guidelines should be distributed later this month to state
boxing commissioners, said Greg Sirb, president of the Association
of Boxing Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The Ali act also bans bribes to sanctioning bodies, a provision
included because of uncertainty whether current laws applied to
such international groups.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in the Lee case bore out that concern.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they dismissed nearly all the alleged racketeering
acts against Lee as unproved, mainly because they did not happen in
New Jersey. The jury was instructed by U.S. District Judge John W.
Bissell that since those charges stemmed from the state's
commercial bribery law, some of the activity had to take place in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, who operates Top Rank boxing in Las Vegas, testified in
June about making a $100,000 payoff in 1995 to the IBF to sanction
a title fight between his boxer, heavyweight champion George
Foreman, and unranked German champion Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Nevada Athletic Commission accepted a
settlement Arum negotiated in which he must pay a $125,000 fine and
accept a largely symbolic six-month ban on involvement with any
fights in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Arum declined to seek immunity, so he could also face criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, who testified he asked for but was denied immunity,
told the jury he made payments of $2,500 to $10,000 to the IBF
several times a year from 1987-1994, and a $100,000 payoff in 1995
for the IBF to order a rematch after Foreman prevailed in a
disputed decision over Schulz, Kushner's fighter.
</P>
<P>
   State boxing commissions are also looking at testimony regarding
King, of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and the Duva family of Main Events
Inc., of Totowa, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations secretly taped by the FBI, Lee and his longtime
ratings chairman, C. Douglas Beavers, refer to King as ''Fuzz'' and
''Fuzzy Wuzzy,'' presumably in deference to the combed-out hair of
the flamboyant promoter. They call his payoffs ''turkey'' and
''ginseng.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New Jersey decline to say whether King,
Arum or Kushner will face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fritz, a spokesman for Don King Productions, has maintained
that King's payments to sanctioning groups are all legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Dino Duva testified, with immunity, that he paid Lee $25,000 in
December 1998 to ensure that one of his fighters, Fernando Vargas,
would get proper treatment and become the top junior middleweight
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas still holds the IBF title. Duva is no longer with Main
Events.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers became an informant and got immunity from prosecutors,
but that did not protect him from Virginia authorities, who removed
him as the state's de facto boxing commissioner as his 22 days on
the stand began in April.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors played 80 audiotapes and three videotapes secretly
made by Beavers and the FBI, with two of the videos showing Beavers
and Lee passing cash in a Portsmouth, Va., hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The three jurors reached by The Associated Press said Beavers
had little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, we determined we couldn't trust Beavers' testimony
on its own,'' said one, Aileen C. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   They also did not trust Arum or Kushner, and did not convict on
their testimony even when it was corroborated by Beavers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Teens diagnosed with whooping cough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOWVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Five teens were diagnosed with whooping
cough in another apparent outbreak of the respiratory infection,
according to health officials.
</P>
<P>
   The youths, whom officials aren't identifying, are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis County Health Department spokeswoman Irene Uttendorfsky
said all contacts of the five teen-agers are being treated for
whooping cough to stop any spread of the infection from the
Lowville area, 60 miles northeast of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory infection that
enters the mouth or nose through the air. Inside the body, the
bacterium multiplies and produces toxins that kill cells that keep
the respiratory tract clear. It can lead to pneumonia and can be
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The disease can be life-threatening to infants who are too young
to be vaccinated. Studies show the vaccination to be about 82
percent effective. The first round is routinely given at
6-weeks-old.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say children under 5 years old are most likely to be
infected with the cough. Half of those infected children are under
1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   For most adolescents and adults, whooping cough, though
uncomfortable, is not fatal.
</P>
<P>
   First symptoms are similar to a common cold, according to health
officials. The disease is most contagious when whooping cough
symptoms are mildest, during the first few days of infection,
Uttendorfsky said.
</P>
<P>
   In more advanced stages a strong cough develops.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost strangling,'' said Lewis County Health Department
spokeswoman Irene Uttendorfsky. ''You have troubles catching your
breath, or you may vomit after you cough.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the way to distinguish the cough from others is by the
characteristic whoop sound made when trying to draw in air.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, western New York has been hit by four
waves of the disease, which nearly vanished in the 1970s. Two were
centered in Erie County, one in Chautauqua County.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent outbreak in Lewis County is farther east than
the first three.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers aren't sure what is causing the resurgence, but some
believe that physicians in western New York might be better at
diagnosing whooping cough, which may be going undetected elsewhere
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of Americans
contract whooping cough each year, but pass it off as a cold.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Smith, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health,
said pertussis ''does seem to be persistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the immunization dose wanes after time, so a
teen-ager could be infected by an infant.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Trade Charges  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each
other of intransigence Friday, as a U.S. envoy was expected to
raise new proposals on the two most intractable issues of the peace
talks -- Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said after a meeting with the envoy,
Dennis Ross, that there is no point in holding another Mideast
summit hosted by President Clinton as long as Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat showed no signs of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who was touring Japan, one of the last stops on this
world tour, blamed Barak for the breakdown of last month's Camp
David summit and warned that there would be an ''explosion'' in the
Middle East if negotiations failed altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Ross arrived in the Middle East on Thursday to gauge prospects
for a second summit during which an Israeli-Palestinian peace
treaty could be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said Clinton would meet with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders separately when they attend the U.N. Millennium
Summit in New York in early September.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, negotiators reached some understandings on the
borders of a Palestinian state and Jewish settlements, but gaps
remained and nothing was put on paper.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Friday that during his current trip, Ross was expected to
deliver new proposals on the most difficult issues -- the future of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak for the first time offered the Palestinians
control over parts of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, but Arafat
insisted on full sovereignty over the eastern sector, which is home
to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian shrines.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture to the Palestinians, Barak delivered his clearest
statement on independence yet, saying Thursday he offered them a
state if they formally ended their conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Barak warned the Palestinians not to declare a
state unilaterally. Arafat has said often that he has the right to
make such a declaration after Sept. 13, a target date the two sides
set for completing a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Ross on Friday paid a courtesy call to Israel's new president,
Moshe Katsav, before holding two hours of talks with Palestinian
negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Ross met with Barak. ''During the meeting,
Ross emphasized the time factor and said there was only a very
narrow window of opportunity,'' Barak's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Ross that he did not believe a second summit would
make sense as long as Arafat did not show flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that on Saturday, Ross was to fly to Egypt, which in recent
days has taken on a more active role as a negotiator.

<HEADLINE> Soccer player seeks to withdraw plea in drug smuggling case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A professional soccer player from Bermuda wants
to take back his guilty plea to charges he and his Customs agent
girlfriend smuggled cocaine into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Friday in federal court in Brooklyn, Dennis Robinson
sought permission from U.S. District Judge Carol Amon to replace
his attorney and change the plea to innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Amon agreed to let Robinson hire a new attorney to argue for the
plea change - they are rarely granted - at a hearing on Sept. 12.
The defendant indicated that he would claim he was poorly
represented in March when he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
distribute narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who is in custody in Brooklyn, faces a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison, although prosecutors had said at
the time of his plea he would likely have received five years or
less if sentenced on Friday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing for Robinson's codefendant, Betty Azzario, also was
postponed until the matter is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 29, was arrested last year with the help of Azzario, a
former Bermuda Customs agent.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a tip from Bermuda authorities, U.S. Customs and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents caught Azzario at Kennedy Airport
last December boarding a Bermuda-bound flight with a package
containing 1.6 kilos of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Azzario, 34, had sought to deflect detection by putting
Bermudian Customs labeling on the package and carrying a phony
document saying she was on a training exercise, authorities said.
She tried to claim the drugs were fake before confessing and
identifying Robinson as her accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Azzario agreed to participate in a sting
operation in which she called him at a Manhattan hotel and
convinced him he should be the one to sneak the drugs back to
Bermuda. She then delivered the package to him in the lobby, where
he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Azzario later pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, hoping to
receive a lighter sentence for cooperating with investigators.

<HEADLINE> Black FMC employees file discrimination lawsuit against Chicago-based company </HEADLINE>
By DON BABWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - Eleven current and former black employees of the
Chicago-based FMC Corp. have filed a lawsuit against the company,
alleging they were blocked from promotions and even fired because
of their race, and punished for speaking out about the need for
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
also alleges the international chemical and machinery company has
created a racially hostile atmosphere where black employees endure
racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In example after example, proud, competent, hardworking people
who sought only to be treated the same as their non-African-
American co-workers were damaged emotionally and physically by
FMC's callous indifference to the basic principle of equality,''
said Jennifer C. Jaff, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney
representing the 11 current and former employees at facilities in
suburban Chicago, Princeton, N.J., and Philadelphia who filed the
lawsuit Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Brozowski, a spokeswoman for FMC, acknowledged that the
lawsuit had been filed. But she said the company does not comment
on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the company has created a ''glass
ceiling'' that restricts the advancement of blacks. Jaff, who said
the 11 plaintiffs seek to represent a class of approximately 500
former and current black employees, said there is only one black
vice president at the company. She did not know how many vice
presidents the company of 16,000 employees has, though.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to one of the plaintiffs, Quentis Rogers, who she
said climbed steadily up the ranks from the time he joined the
company in 1982. Then he suggested the company create the position
of diversity manager to act as a liaison between the minority
employees and management, and took the job for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since then, his career has completely died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, she said that black managers are routinely paid less
than whites for the same work. And she said that as the employees
climb through the ranks, the gap between the rates at which whites
and blacks are retained grows wider, with whites being retained at
a higher rate than blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jaff said the work environment has adversely affected the health
of some black employees, including one woman whose hair fell out
and she developed a nervous ulcer as a result of stress. She said a
number of black employees have gone to counseling.
</P>
<P>
   FMC Corp. is an international company with, according to its Web
site, approximately 16,000 employees at more than 100 manufacturing
facilities and mines in 25 countries.

<HEADLINE> Child sickened from deadly strain of E. coli  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A 5-year-old girl is in fair condition
after being hospitalized with E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth case of E. coli infection that Broome County
has seen this year. All were from the same extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Williams went from serious to fair condition Friday, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same strain of bacteria that sickened over 1,000
people drinking water or eating food at the Washington County Fair
last year. A toddler and an elderly man also died in what was New
York's worst E. coli outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's 2-year-old brother was the first family member to
show symptoms. His sister and a female cousin were the next, the
grandmother told the Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin. She didn't
identify the children.
</P>
<P>
   Broome County health officials believe the family was infected
within the household, but continue investigating.
</P>
<P>
   State Health Department spokeswoman Kristine Smith said the
current cases of E. coli are probably confined to the family and
aren't a threat to others.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith said there are always several cases yearly of E.
coli.
</P>
<P>
   She urged people to cook ground beef to 158 degrees on the
inside, to always wash hands and surfaces that have contact with
food and to wash all fruits and vegetables well. Color of meat
should not be considered in determining whether it is fully cooked
because age could cause it to appear done when it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include mild to severe diarrhea and bloody stools.
Smith said symptoms can occur anywhere from one to nine days after
exposure, but that generally they begin on the third day of
exposure.

<HEADLINE> US Adds 2 Colombians To Banned List  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. government on Friday added two
Colombians to its list of 524 individuals and companies suspected
of drug trafficking and banned from doing business in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The two, Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya and Juan Carlos Ramirez
Abadia, are responsible for huge volumes of drugs that have entered
the United States, the Treasury Department said.
</P>
<P>
   By adding the alleged drug kingpins to its list of ''specially
designated narcotics traffickers,'' Treasury blocked their access
to any assets they may have in the United States and also barred
U.S. companies from doing business with them.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury also added to the list one individual and five
businesses that it said are acting as fronts for the North Valle
drug cartel in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Treasury described Henao as a leader of one of
the most powerful drug-trafficking groups that comprise the North
Valle cartel and Ramirez as an overlord of the infamous Cali
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana, an avid supporter of
extraditing drug kingpins to the United States, this month signed
an order clearing the way for Orlandez Gamboa to stand trial in
Manhattan. Gamboa, who allegedly heads a drug cartel based in
Barranquilla on Colombia's Caribbean coast, could become the third
Colombian extradited to the United States since the country lifted
its extradition ban.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in 1995 authorized certain government agencies
to apply economic sanctions against Colombian drug cartels. The
action taken Friday brings the total number of businesses and
individuals whose assets have been blocked under that order to 532.
</P>
<P>
   The list now includes nine alleged kingpins from Colombian
cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Henao and Ramirez are not on a newer list, compiled by the White
House, of a dozen foreign nationals identified as drug kingpins and
subject to asset seizure and other financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of those on the list, presented to Congress in June, were
already under indictment; some of the six Mexicans are in jail in
their home country. The list also includes a Burmese warlord, a
Chinese national operating in Southeast Asia, two people from St.
Kitts-Nevis and two from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials have said they doubt the alleged drug lords
kept assets in their names in the United States that could be
frozen, and hoped the list would lay the groundwork for cutting off
their financial resources.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Morale Not Low in Military  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen on Friday
disputed assertions by Texas Gov. George W. Bush that morale in the
U.S. military is dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a matter of fact I think morale is increasing,'' Cohen
said, citing recent indications that the military services are
having more success this year retaining men and women in uniform
and meeting their recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon news conference about the sunken Russian
submarine, Cohen was asked about Bush's assertion in his acceptance
speech at the Republican National Convention on Aug. 3 that: ''Our
military is low on parts, pay and morale. If called on by the
commander in chief today, two entire divisions of the Army would
have to report, ''Not ready for duty, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Bush said, ''Morale in our military today is
dangerously low.'' He made similar comments Friday at a campaign
speech in Bartlett, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, responded two weeks ago to Bush's readiness
comment by saying that all 10 of the Army's active-duty divisions
are ready to meet their wartime requirements despite peacekeeping
commitments in Bosnia and Kosovo. Last fall, the commanders of the
1st Infantry Division and the 10th Mountain Division downgraded the
readiness of their units because portions of each division were
deployed on peacekeeping missions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Those divisions have since reported that they are fully combat
ready, Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our forces are ready to fight,'' Cohen said. ''Anyone who
suggests that they are incapable of carrying out their
responsibilities is seriously miscalculating.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a Republican, has focused much of his effort as defense
secretary on increasing military pay, improving housing and taking
other measures to improve the qualify of life in the military. He
said it should not be surprising that during a presidential
campaign the nation's defense capabilities would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is that we have the most capable force in the
world,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Deny Role in Youth Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A leftist rebel group on Friday denied
involvement in the deaths of six schoolchildren, who the army says
walked into a cross fire between government troops and rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, disputed
the army's contention of a cross fire and called for an
international investigation of Tuesday's deaths of the children,
aged 6 to 15. Four children were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The six students were shot and killed while hiking through the
mountains of western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN statement said its combatants were not in the area when
the shootings occurred outside the town of Pueblo Rico, about 125
miles northwest of the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The claims by the ELN, the second largest Marxist group in
Colombia, back up the account of an adult witness who has said
government troops fired on the children without provocation and
that no guerrillas where in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ELN spokesman Francisco Galan, who is serving time in a maximum
security prison near Medellin, read the ELN statement over the
radio, calling for ''international organizations'' to investigate
the shootings. He did not specify which organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Colombian state prosecutors' offices and from
an autonomous Colombian human rights watchdog group, the People's
Defense Council, are already investigating the killings.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana has vowed to uncover the truth behind
the deaths.

<HEADLINE> Drug Suspect Extradited To U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The alleged leader of one of Colombia's
most powerful drug cartels was sent Friday to the United States to
stand trial, days after drug dealers threatened violence if
authorities carried out the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   A small army of security forces escorted Alberto Orlandez Gamboa
onto the tarmac at Bogota's international airport, where he left on
a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane bound for Miami, said
President Andres Pastrana, speaking from the Western highlands city
of Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   From there Gamboa will head to U.S. District Court in Manhattan
to face charges he conspired to import and distribute thousands of
pounds of cocaine from Colombia to New York and other U.S.
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa, who U.S. authorities say is the head of an international
drug trafficking and money laundering organization headquartered in
Barranquilla on Colombia's Caribbean coast, is also accused of
smuggling cocaine to Europe since 1991 and conspiring to launder
millions of dollars in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-year moratorium on U.S. extradition, Gamboa becomes
the third Colombian whom Pastrana has spirited to the United States
to face drug charges in the past nine months. Pastrana favors
extraditing accused drug traffickers to the United States, where
stiffer penalties often await them.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa's extradition comes three days after a newspaper ad paid
for by a band of drug dealers known as the Our Country Movement
threatened to assassinate supreme court judges and government
officials unless authorities here reversed their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't allow the immoral American drug addicts to try us,''
said the ad, published Tuesday in a newspaper in the sprawling city
of Cali, located 185 miles from the capital, Bogota, in
drug-producing southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The group behind the threats claimed to be an offshoot of the
notorious 1980s drug-financed terrorist faction ''The
Un-extraditables.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking for a war like that of Pablo Escobar, but
we will fight to stop all Colombian extraditions,'' their ad said.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar, shot and killed by state forces in 1993, was the
longtime head of the ruthless Medellin Cartel, named for the
western Colombia city from which it operated.
</P>
<P>
   Also a former Colombian senator, Escobar gained worldwide
notoriety as the tough ruler of the Medellin faction.
</P>
<P>
   The faction controlled the world's cocaine trade until months
before Escobar's death. It also used car bombs and machine guns to
wage a prolonged and bloody terrorist-style war against state
forces and pressure the government into barring extraditions of
drug traffickers to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Gamboa, nicknamed ''Caracol'' -- Spanish for
''The Snail'' -- was arrested in June 1998 in Bogota on charges of
murder, kidnapping and illicit enrichment.

<HEADLINE> Romania Police Find 3 Bodies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAIA MARE, Romania (AP) -- Police discovered three decomposed
bodies Friday, and suspect the slayings are the work of a serial
killer targeting the homeless in this northwestern Romanian city.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found on the banks of the Sasar River, but
police are not sure how the bodies wound up there, police
spokeswoman Lt. Voinita Acris said.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, police have found seven bodies in Baia Mare, a city
of 150,000 located 300 miles northwest of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   Acris said the victims were likely killed when they were asleep,
with six having their heads crushed by a hard object. The seventh
victim had sand in his lungs, suggesting drowing, according to
preliminary investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The first body was found behind a gasoline station in July.
Police discovered three more corpses in August, before the most
recent find, Acris said.
</P>
<P>
   Police used fingerprints to identify the three victims found
earlier in August and all are believed to come from the city's
homeless community.
</P>
<P>
   Baia Mare has about 100 homeless people, many of whom live in
temporary shelters on the banks of the river or under bridges.
</P>
<P>
   While some homeless people have left the area after the bodies
were discovered, others decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live in fear now, but we have to stay here. We have no
other place to go,'' said Nelu, one of a group of 15 people who
remained by the river.
</P>
<P>
   Acris declined to say whether police have a suspect.

<HEADLINE> South African Judge Mall Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Judge Hassen Mall, South Africa's
first black acting judge who was at the forefront of efforts to
bring about racial reconciliation, died Friday, the South African
Press Association reported. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mall, who suffered from a heart and kidney condition, was a
senior member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a body
set up to probe apartheid-era crimes and give victims a forum to
tell their of their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   He chaired the commission's most controversial committee, which
heard amnesty applications from both those who committed crimes
enforcing white rule and those trying to overthrow it.
</P>
<P>
   Born in India, he emigrated to South Africa as a young child and
went on to study law. He was a lawyer for 43 years before his
appointment as a full-time judge in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his appointment in 1988 as the country's first black
acting judge that caused a stir within conservative legal circles.
</P>
<P>
   Mall also served as secretary of the Natal Indian Congress -- a
political grouping which opposed apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   President of the Black Lawyers Association Jake Moloi described
Mall as a ''symbol of real transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mall is survived by his wife, Sylvia, son Enver and two
daughters, Marcina and Shereen.

<HEADLINE> Howard Spends Night in Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Terrence Howard spent a night in jail after a
flight attendant accused the movie actor of assaulting her so he
could take his 3-year-old daughter to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines attendant Meredith Hughes, 23, told police
she was trying to coax Howard back to his seat Thursday because the
seat belt sign was on. ''The Best Man'' star grabbed her wrist and
tried to push her, Lt. Sharon McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, an onlooker told Howard to sit down, and he did, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Howard on a misdemeanor count of assault. His
lawyer said he has not yet been charged.
</P>
<P>
   After being released without bond Friday, Howard said he never
touched Hughes. His daughter was recently toilet trained and badly
needed to go to the bathroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was just saying 'Daddy, I've got to go to the bathroom.
Daddy it's coming out.' What do you do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had been in the air a few minutes and the seat belt
sign was on, he said. Howard said he wanted to comply with the
rules ''but I had to take her to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard was en route to Philadelphia for a vacation Thursday. He
was coming from Toronto, where he is making ''All That Glitters''
with Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very upset,'' said James Hardiman, a lawyer for Howard.
''It seems like some sort of colossal mistake. ... I don't think it
rises to the level of a criminal offense.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kirsten Dunst's role as a cheerleader in the new
comedy ''Bring It On'' isn't much of a stretch: the teen actress
once hoisted a megaphone or two back in eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did it to be popular,'' Dunst admits in the September issue
of Maxim magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The role, like many she's taken, is more innocent than her
breakout part in ''Interview With the Vampire,'' in 1994, when she
played an adult bloodsucker trapped in a child's body.
</P>
<P>
   ''My acting coach helped me so much, finding things that I could
focus on that would get that anger out that I didn't really have. A

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City man gets life in killing of Holocaust survivor  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) - The prosecutor called him
''soulless.'' The son of one of his victims called him ''a disgrace
to the human race.'' The judge compared him to Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Crumpton didn't argue. When Superior Court Judge Michael
Connor asked whether he had anything to say at his sentencing
Friday, Crumpton mumbled, ''Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumpton, 37, of Atlantic City, was sentenced to two life prison
terms for killing an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor and her live-in
caretaker in a 1998 burglary that netted only a broken VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Crumpton, a petty thief who had recently been released from
prison, broke into the Atlantic City apartment where Dora Birnbaum
lived with nurse companion Beatrice Cabarrus, 83, in search of
money or valuables to pawn to support his drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle-bound Crumpton beat the women over the head and left
them for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum, who was 4-feet-9-inches tall and weighed about 100
pounds, died at the scene. She choked on her own blood. Cabarrus,
who slipped into a coma later that day, died four months later in a
rehabilitation hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly tragic end for Birnbaum.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Slonim, Poland, she fled the Nazi occupation as a
young woman after her parents, husband and 3-year-old daughter all
were captured and killed by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   She married again and later moved to the United States, where
she raised a family.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother suffered enough in her life,'' said her son, Charles
Birnbaum, 53, of Hammonton. ''She didn't deserve to have it end
with such horror and terror at your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a framed color photograph of his mother and Cabarrus
together, he turned to face Crumpton as the killer sat between his
attorneys, his head bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is truly an evil beyond words that could inflict such a
vicious and savage beating on two precious little old ladies who
wanted nothing more than to live what years were left with
dignity,'' he said. ''You are a disgrace to the human race. You are
a heartless and ruthless killer with no conscience or soul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish you hell on earth for what you did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connor called Birnbaum a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was able to survive Adolf Hitler, but not Louis
Crumpton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cabarrus, a native of southern Virginia who worked as a
seamstress before becoming a hospice nurse, had lived with Birnbaum
for 10 years before their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite expression was ''God loves you, baby, and so do
I.''
</P>
<P>
   Her grand-nephew, William Broadnax, 19, of Lawrenceville, Va.,
said the two had the ''bad luck to cross paths with a big man with
a killing rage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were too late to save Aunt Bee, so we come here today to
save others like her,'' Broadnax said.
</P>
<P>
   Crumpton, who has AIDS, pleaded guilty last month to two counts
of felony murder after trying to kill himself in jail.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably die in prison, anyway. He must serve at least
63 years without parole on each of the life terms, which are to be
served consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant Atlantic County Prosecutor Murray Talasnik said
he hoped Crumpton would live long enough to suffer in prison, amid
''conscienceless, soulless human predators just like himself.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Explaining Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Only days ago, the Colombian army was
basking in praise after soldiers rescued hostages held by
guerrillas. Now, the army is trying to explain the deaths of six
children allegedly gunned down by its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as national heroes one day and trigger-happy killers the
next, the army is battling two rebel armies and an image problem.
</P>
<P>
   It hopes to polish its reputation, in part by spending half a
million dollars annually on TV ads. One shows soldiers putting
aside their guns to promote human rights in a tiny Indian village.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our army, winning our war,'' another ad proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   The army won praise earlier this week when elite troops rescued
a well-known media magnate and five other hostages held by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians watched Sunday as the bearded, weary hostages
descended from a plane into the arms of jubilant relatives at a
Bogota air force base, the reunions broadcast live on television.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the nation's newspapers showed beaming,
camouflage-clad soldiers standing alongside the media magnate,
Guillermo ''Scoop'' Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the newspapers showed photos of grief-stricken
parents standing beside the coffins of their children. President
Andres Pastrana announced he would oversee a state investigation
into the shootings of the schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Top military officials insisted that the students, hiking near
the western town of Pueblo Rico on Tuesday, were caught in cross
fire between soldiers and rebels of the National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But an adult who was with the students said there were no rebels
in the area. Parents of the six dead children blame the army
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The National Liberation Army issued a statement Friday denying
any involvement, saying none of its fighters was at the site where
the children were slain. The group called for international
organizations to investigate the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the shootings, Colombia's army chief Gen. Jorge Mora
said rebels had used the children as shields.
</P>
<P>
   Mora did not explain why government troops would shoot at rebels
if children were in the line of fire. The only casualties were the
six dead children -- the youngest of whom was 6 years old -- and four
other students who were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Army commanders claim there was a fierce exchange of gunfire. No
government forces were hurt and no bodies of rebels could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Colombia's state prosecutor's office and an
independent human rights watchdog group were conducting separate
investigations of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The case comes as the U.S. State Department is preparing a
report on human rights in Colombia, to be presented to Congress
next month. It was not known if the shootings would affect
Washington's appraisal of Colombia's human rights record, State
Department spokesman Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy. It was a terrible thing that happened, and we
certainly condemned it. But I am just unable to make any broader
observations until we know what (happened),'' Reeker said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's 1999 human rights report described the
Colombian government's record as ''poor'' and said serious abuses
had not improved over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   If Colombia has not met any of a number of human rights-related
conditions, a recently approved package of $1.3 billion in military
and financial support from the United States could be delayed.
President Clinton can waive the conditions, citing national
security concerns, but none of the aid can be spent until he does
so.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is visiting Colombia Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Posts $4.76B July Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal treasury posted a surplus of $4.76
billion in July, smaller than June's $56.3 billion surplus but a
rare feat since July usually is marked by a budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The government's surplus last month, announced by the Treasury
Department on Friday, compared with a $25.2 billion deficit in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the government posted a surplus in July
since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is on track to produce a record bounty for the entire
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for July totaled $134.1 billion, while expenditures came
to $129.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 10 months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1, the
government is running a surplus of $181 billion -- far surpassing
the record $124.4 billion surplus for all of fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the first nine months came to $1.67 trillion, while
spending totaled $1.49 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   With the expected surplus for fiscal year 2000, it would be the
first time the government has reported three consecutive surplus
years since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $224 billion surplus
for fiscal 2000, while the Congressional Budget Office is
projecting a slightly larger $232 billion.

<HEADLINE> Pataki vetoes bill requiring truck back-up equipment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Delivery trucks will not be required to have
special equipment designed to enhance drivers' views of what is
behind them due to the veto of a bill by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called the measure sent him by the state Legislature
''well-intentioned.'' But he added that he saw several technical
flaws in the legislation, as well as some practical problems in
achieving the goal of making the delivery vehicles safer to be
around when they are backing up.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, trucks with delivery bays longer than 8 feet, 6
inches would have to be equipped with cross-view back-up mirrors or
video cameras to allow drivers to see what is directly behind them.
</P>
<P>
   One problem Pataki found with the legislation is that it calls
for a civil fine to be imposed on violators. But the governor said
local police don't have the authority as the measure is written to
stop, detain or arrest anyone for a civil penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the governor said the bill does not allow for the
next generation of safety devices for trucks - sonar-like sensors
which beep in the driver's cabin to warn if a person is behind the
truck - to qualify as an acceptable safety measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said they drew up the legislation in response to
tragedies like the one which occurred in 1996 in Ulster County,
when 5-year-old Joseph Henderson was killed by a delivery truck
which was backing out of his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leading freight and package delivery companies have
moved voluntarily or have announced plans to equip their vehicles
with safer backing equipment. United Parcel Service, for instance,
said it will install video monitoring equipment on its fleet by
Oct. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he has ordered the state Department of
Transportation to petition the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration and request the agency set up safe-backing-equipment
requirements nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a nationally applicable rule would be a fitting tribute
to Joseph's memory and to the perseverance of his family,'' Pataki
said in his veto message released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills rejected by the governor included:
</P>
<P>
   - Pataki vetoed a bill that would have required the
establishment of programs at the State University and City
University of New York for college credit for students who perform
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he likes the idea of increasing participation in
such programs, but he complained the measure does not spell out
what would qualify as acceptable activities for students to perform
and ''provides no structure for quality control or oversight of the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   - Pataki refused to sign a bill sponsors said would increase the
number of abandoned dogs or cats adopted in New York. The bill
would have allowed the animals to be released to pounds, shelters
or other animal-welfare groups when that release ''is reasonably
believed to improve the opportunity'' that the dog or cat will be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the measure had technical flaws and was thought by
groups including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals to potentially curtail the opportunities for pet
adoptions, not increase them.

<HEADLINE> PR executive killed in subway accident  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Peter Seligman and Sarah Sinek were on a happy
errand downtown to get a marriage license. The Manhattan couple
were to be married Sept. 3, and it was one of the last details.
</P>
<P>
   But on the crowded subway train at the height of rush hour
Friday morning, Seligman, a public relations executive, began to
feel dizzy, and the couple decided to stand on the small platform
between two subway cars so he could get some air, police said. As
the southbound No. 5 train pulled into the Brooklyn Bridge Station
at 8:36 a.m., Seligman apparently fainted, fell onto the tracks and
hit the electrified third rail.
</P>
<P>
   Sinek called for help and Seligman was rushed to Beekman
Hospital. The 30-year-old was pronounced dead at 9:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues of Seligman's at Dan Klores &AMP; Associates
- where he was a partner who handled talk show host Jay Leno and a
number of sports accounts - expressed shock at his death, and
sorrow for a man who was about to marry the woman of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very, very hardworking - he was deeply committed to his
clients,'' said Dan Klores in a telephone interview. ''He
recognized that he was growing, and that made him better. He was
very loyal to the people who worked for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's why this is so unbelievable, to say that he's dead,''
Klores added.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman joined the firm eight years ago - a year after it was
founded - and became a partner four years ago, Klores said, calling
Seligman ''my protege.'' Seligman supervised 20 people at the
Manhattan agency, one of the top 20 independent firms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked like he was 21, but he had the earnestness of a
middle-aged man,'' Klores said.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman and Sinek became engaged about eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was to be married at The Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers
and planned to honeymoon in Bali, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   They met at the agency, and when they got engaged, Sinek left
for another job.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were the fifth couple, including myself and my wife, who
met at my place,'' Klores said.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman, who grew up in Harrison and graduated from the
University of Wisconsin, was described as very health conscious and
had not been ill, Klores added. The medical examiner's office
planned an autopsy for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A private funeral was to be held Sunday.

<HEADLINE> One killed, 11 injured in fight at Pennsauken nightclub  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENNSAUKEN, N.J. (AP) - One man was killed and 11 people injured
in a fight that began inside the Woodbine Inn early Friday and
spilled into the parking lot, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest incident at a nightclub that police Capt.
Robert Brandt described as ''problematic at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Camden County Prosecutor Lee Solomon said his office will seek
to close the club for at least a year. He was unsure whether it
could operate while the action was pending.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said the club has been fined twice in the past two years
for violating public nuisance laws. Some 34 people were arrested
there from February 1998 to March 1999, he said. Problems abated
until this March, when at least two people were shot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's melee, Damon Frazier, 23, of Camden, was pronounced
dead of gunshot wounds at Cooper Hospital-University Medical Center
in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   As he was in the ambulance, others involved in the altercation
tried to enter the vehicle, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the injured were Pennsauken police Lt. Robert Morley, 40,
and paramedic Steve Quinn, 28, of Turnersville, who were hurt while
keeping people away from the ambulance. They were hospitalized
briefly and released.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Rutherford, 21, of Camden, and Terrell Baker, 24, of
Lawnside, were arrested and charged with assaulting the officer and
the paramedic.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said about 1,000 people were attending two private
parties at the club when the fight broke out about 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said the cause of the fight was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting sketchy and conflicting information,'' he said.
''We're unable to corroborate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the club's owners were unsuccessful on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone number listed as that of the Woodbine Inn was not in
service.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control lists the owner
as Penn 73 Restaurant Inc., which is half-owned by president
Francis A. Cerchiaro, of Delran, who has no published phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kouvatas, of Moorestown, is listed as vice president
and 12.5 percent owner. A message left on a Moorestown listing
under that name was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining partner was listed as Michael Kouvatas, of Cherry
Hill. A phone in that name rang unanswered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Six people suffered stab wounds and four people were shot in the
fight, including Frazier, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Most were treated and released from Cooper Hospital-University
Medical Center and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden,
with one or two admitted at Cooper, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Lessons from Floyd help officials manage floods in two N.J. counties </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - State emergency workers say lessons learned
from Tropical Storm Floyd are helping them manage rebuilding
efforts after downpours devastated parts of Morris and Sussex
counties.
</P>
<P>
   After President Clinton declared the two counties federal
disaster areas Thursday, state emergency officials and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency quickly worked to organize relief
assistance for flood-ravaged communities.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, towns will receive federal funds
quicker, making immediate repairs for roads and bridges possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned from Floyd that we had problems getting money to
people who needed it because of the paper work,'' said Captain
Dennis Quinn, chief of the State Police emergency management
office. ''After Floyd, we critiqued our administration plan and
policy procedures. We didn't change any policy procedures, but we
enhanced it to take advantage of technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the long process of getting checks to local
municipalities, federal funds will be electronically transferred to
local accounts, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The faster we move along, the faster the communities get back
on their feet,'' Quinn said. ''It cuts down many days of handling
paper work.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference here Friday, FEMA and state emergency
management officials announced that a FEMA and state emergency
management headquarters in Sparta has been set up to process fund
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said field offices to help residents and towns assess
damages will be set up soon.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials advise residents to register by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who suffered flood damage can apply for grants for
temporary housing, home repairs or unemployment, or low-interest
loans for home repair.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can receive up to $200,000 for repairs and up to
$40,000 to replace personal property. Renters can receive up to
$40,000 to replace personal property.
</P>
<P>
   Small business owners can receive low-interest loans of up to
$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA funds will also be available to pay for 75 percent of the
cost of rebuilding bridges and roads that washed way. The state
will pay for the remaining 25 percent and the remainder of some
FEMA grants that cover home repairs, destroyed personal property or
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Downpours on Saturday and Monday damaged thousands of homes,
wiped out dozens of bridges and roads and forced hundreds to flee
the rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials said 1,000 Sussex County residents were
evacuated at some point between Saturday and Monday. And about
2,700 homes in Sussex and Morris counties suffered some
flood-related damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police are scheduled to resume the search in Hunterdon County
Saturday morning for a missing kayaker who went out on the swollen
Musconetcong River. Police are looking for Charles Weaver, 58, of
Riegelsville, Pa., whose kayak was found on the river Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers didn't search Friday because of unsafe water conditions
on the river, Holland Township Police Chief Arthur Cyphers said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and business owners can register with FEMA at
1-800-462-9029 between 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week. The
reference number is 1337. Hearing- or speech-impaired residents
should call 1-800-462-7585.

<HEADLINE> Safir bids adieu to NYPD  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Feted on the Intrepid, cheered by children and
his top chiefs, Howard Safir's last day as police commissioner was
a loud send-off. His last official act on Friday as the city's top
cop: ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a lingering question as Safir rode off into the
sunset to a job in the private sector: who will replace him? Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said he planned to make that announcement on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a decision,'' Giuliani said. ''I haven't told anyone
... just all of a sudden it occurred to me that this was the right
person and that it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made the statement after walking with Safir through a
gauntlet of top chiefs and other commanders outside Police
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani would not divulge his choice, but the top two
contenders are Chief of Department Joseph Dunne and Corrections
Commissioner Bernard Kerik. Dennison Young Jr., a close friend of
Giuliani's for more than 25 years and currently the mayor's
counsel, reportedly took himself out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Also retiring on Friday was First Deputy Police Commissioner
Patrick Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Giuliani would only talk about Safir, his longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bittersweet day,'' the mayor said. ''I am very happy
for Howard because the opportunities he has are so good. I am very
sad because I am going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir's last day began with a visit to the Intrepid Sea Air
Space Museum for a salute at the start of Police Appreciation
Weekend. Then it was back to Police Headquarters where he presided
over a graduation ceremony for 200 children in the Law Enforcement
Explorers program, where the youngsters cheered loudly for him.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carol, came in for lunch, then joined him at a
promotion ceremony for 123 officers. Safir gave his last speech to
his troops, expressing his gratitude to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past four years and four months, I have had the
privilege of serving as the police commissioner of the best law
enforcement organization in the world,'' he said. ''I want you to
know that the overwhelming pride that I felt upon my appointment is
only surpassed by the pride that I have experienced each and every
day it has been my honor to stand at the helm of this outstanding
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Safir, never a fan of reporters, also took the opportunity
to criticize the media for its coverage of the department. Three
incidents occurred under Safir's watch that will always be linked
to him: the police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, and
the fatal police shootings of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo
and Haitian-American Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Safir left Police Headquarters by walking through a flank of his
top chiefs and borough commanders, to the sounds of bagpipes as a
handful of people watched. He then went to the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no down time for Safir, who starts his new job on
Monday as an adviser for ChoicePoint Inc., an Atlanta-based firm
that is a credential, verification and identification service
provider. Safir will work from Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Council asks indicted Camden mayor to resign  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Camden's City Council has had enough of
no-show Mayor Milton Milan and told him Friday to resign, a move
applauded by state administrators who said the indicted mayor is
''an obstacle'' to reforms.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Milan hasn't shown up regularly for work in
months. City Council members cited that and other reasons in saying
Milan must go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was non-productive of the council to keep supporting the
mayor,'' Councilman Ali Sloan-El said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan does not have public support and he shouldn't have the
backing of the council, Sloan-El said. Twice before council members
did not approve a resolution asking Milan to resign, Sloan-El said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had to see for themselves. Now they see that the mayor is
not supported by the people and they had to act,'' Sloan-El said.
''They had to cut the cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan has not cooperated with state officials working to
revitalize New Jersey's poorest city, said Ulrich ''Al'' Steinberg,
director of the state Division of Local Government Services, which
oversees city operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They recognized the mayor as someone being an obstacle in the
effort to provide services to the residents,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   State supervisors rarely see Milan in his City Hall office and
he often does not work with them on city business, Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for a leadership role in some way and his
absence is causing a serious effect on the operations of the
city,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In March a federal grand jury returned an indictment naming
Milan. He is charged with corruption and laundering drug money and
has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Whitman administration has moved to assume
complete control of the city and its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote is the latest public dispute between the
mayor and the council.
</P>
<P>
   City attorney John A. Misci Jr., 36, resigned this week, saying
the council had created an ''unhealthy, openly hostile, racist and
retaliatory workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan named Misci as the city's chief municipal judge. The mayor
provoked the council by swearing in Misci on July 24 without
council approval.
</P>
<P>
   A state Superior Court judge on Aug. 2 ruled that appointment
invalid because the council had not approved it and because Misci
was not sworn in by a Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Milan also recently directed city department heads not to talk
to council members. Instead, council members must go through
business administrator Preston Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was unavailable for comment Friday, a secretary in his
office said. Milan was ''out of the office at a meeting,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not attend the City Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-El said he does not expect Milan to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll stay there until his trial,'' Sloan-El said. ''After
that the justice system will take their turn at removing the
mayor.''

<HEADLINE> Sub Blast's Magnitude Like Quake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Seismic experts said Friday that an
explosion detected near the Russian nuclear submarine when it sank
had a magnitude of 3.5, equivalent to a small earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Seismic Array, or NORSAR, said it registered a
smaller explosion followed by a much more powerful one Saturday in
the Barents Sea, near where the Kursk sank with 118 sailors on
board.
</P>
<P>
   NORSAR's seismic monitors recorded an explosion with a magnitude
of 1.5 near the stricken submarine Saturday morning and then the
more powerful blast 2 minutes and 15 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we found in our preliminary analysis was a small
explosion followed by a larger one,'' NORSAR's Frode Ringdal said
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The Helsinki University Institute of Seismology in nearby
Finland also said Friday that their sensors registered two
explosions last Saturday. The stronger of the two had a magnitude
of 3.1 on the scale also used to measure earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Norway's stronger measurement of 3.5, Pekka
Heikkinen, head of the Finnish institute, said such small
discrepancies are common between seismographic stations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Adm. Vyacheslav Popov said Friday that the submarine
suffered a violent explosion inside the hull but the cause was
unclear. It could have been triggered by a collision with an
unspecified object, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts have said one or several of the submarine's
torpedoes could have exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was caused by an explosion, it must have been quite
violent. The signal was registered at all seismographic stations in
Finland,'' Heikkinen said.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators cite progress in talks as outage hits  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Having stepped back from their threat to break
off contract talks, negotiators for 87,000 striking Verizon
Communications telephone workers expressed optimism Friday that a
revised company proposal could end a two-week strike.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up bargaining came as Verizon reported its first
major system outage since the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going in the right direction,'' said Jeff Miller of the
Communications Workers of America, the larger of two unions
negotiating to replace contracts that expired Aug. 6. He said the
unions were ''beginning to see more substantive bargaining'' on key
union concerns, including mandatory overtime and the movement of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The unions fear that Verizon, the product of a summer merger
between Bell Atlantic and GTE, will shift work within its expanded
region to areas where labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, which represents about 14,700 workers, said it looked
forward to reviewing Verizon's latest offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted progress to be made and progress, in fact, has been
made,'' IBEW spokesman Jim Spellane said Friday afternoon.
''There's still much to be done, though. We're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The progress Friday persuaded union representatives to stay at
the table despite earlier threats to abandon the talks at 12:01
a.m. EDT Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has affected repairs, installations and directory
assistance in a dozen Eastern states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of talks came just as Verizon customers in
northern New Jersey experienced the system's first failure since
Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon blamed a malfunctioning telephone switcher for an
overnight outage knocking out long-distance service to hundreds of
thousands of customers in and around Bergen County, N.J., from
midnight to 8 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since then, it's been fine,'' said Jane Valente, of Hoboken,
N.J., in nearby Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   But repair calls continued to build up, Verizon spokesman Eric
Rabe said, with 100,000 repairs pending Friday. He estimated that
about 50,000 customers were without basic phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Piana of Huntington Station, N.Y., said Friday he and his
neighbors had been without telephones in their homes for nine days
because of a line break that hasn't been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ''This puts an unfair burden on the population,'' he said. ''It
could be dangerous if you can't dial 911 and you're having a
coronary or if there's an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects 25 million Verizon consumers in Delaware,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia
and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Survivor Member Chats on '700 Club'  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Dirk Been, the Bible-toting
''Survivor'' contestant, said Friday that he was voted off the
island because the other castaways were intimidated by the strength
his Christianity gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Been made the comment while taping an appearance on Pat
Robertson's ''700 Club'' talk show on the Christian Broadcasting
Network. The interview will be broadcast Tuesday, the day before
CBS airs the finale of ''Survivor'' and reveals which of the 16
contestants marooned on a deserted tropical island lasted the full
39 days and won $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants voted someone off every three days, and Been was
the fifth to go. CBN interviewer Gordon P. Robertson, son of the
religious broadcaster, asked Been whether he thought he was voted
off because he was a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt,'' Been said. The other contestants saw
''there's real power in this guy, we don't know what it is, but if
we want to win the game, we have to get rid of him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, Been explained that he did not think he was
voted off because of his religion but because of the strength he
derives from his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Been, 24, holds a bachelor's degree of arts in religious studies
from Seattle Pacific University. He said he left Seattle in October
and was returning to his native Wisconsin when he lost his ATM card
and someone swiped his life savings from his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   With $16 to his name, Been heard about ''Survivor'' and decided
to apply, saying he believed ''the Lord had a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Been said his objective was not to win the $1 million but to
have fun and share the gospel. On the CBS show, he talked freely
about being a virgin and was seen reading a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted contestant Rudy Boesch, 72, who remains on the
island, to remark: ''The only reason I'd bring a Bible out here is
if I needed toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Been said he was disappointed by the comment but that he and
Boesch had a good relationship and that the comment probably was
taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Been held a Bible on his lap during the interview, but not the
one he had on the island. He said he left that one behind and other
contestants told him it was read extensively.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know what ultimately happened to his Bible but said
he hopes to find out when the castaways reunite next week in Los
Angeles for a one-hour town hall meeting after the final episode
airs.

<HEADLINE> McCain's Skin Cancer Has Not Spread  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tests so far have found no evidence John McCain's
skin cancer has spread, and the Arizona senator said he's confident
he will win his second battle with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A beaming McCain met with reporters outside his home Friday
wearing an Arizona Diamondbacks cap. His wife, Cindy, brought a
basket filled with sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in a number of fights in my life. This is just
another one, and I'm sure I will prevail,'' the former Vietnam POW
and former GOP presidential candidate said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will have surgery Saturday to remove more skin around the
spots of melanoma, which is the most serious form of skin cancer.
Doctors also plan to test lymph nodes near the lesion on McCain's
temple to determine if the cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
   The McCains met with doctors for about 3&AMP;frac12; hours Friday at the
Mayo Clinic in suburban Scottsdale to review the results of tests
he took Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The tests did not find any signs of cancer in other areas of
McCain's body, such as the lungs or liver, the doctors' statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma experts say that's good news, meaning there's a much
better chance that the Saturday surgery will cure him. McCain had a
similar lesion removed from his shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But some questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not say how thick the cancer lesion on
McCain's face was. That's one key to his prognosis, since thicker
cancers are more likely to spread through the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The tests on the lymph nodes near the melanoma also will help
determine whether surgery will be the final treatment. If the lymph
nodes are clear, then the outlook for a surgical cure is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But if microscopic cancer has reached one or more of the lymph
nodes, treatment is more complicated and less likely to cure the
cancer, melanoma experts say. Options include using anti-cancer
drugs and stimulating the immune system to try to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook would have been much worse if the cancer had spread
to McCain's organs, since that stage of melanoma is extremely
difficult to treat, said Dr. John Glaspy, a researcher at UCLA's
Jonsson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Glaspy said the kind of surgery McCain will have Saturday takes
only one or two weeks to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having an inch divot missing from your skin is not nothing,
but you can hurt yourself worse falling off a bicycle,'' Glaspy
said. ''It's not like you're removing organs. It's not a major
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he planned to spend Saturday night at the Mayo
Clinic after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found the melanoma after McCain left the Republican
National Convention to have biopsies performed at Bethesda Naval
Hospital near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who turns 64 on Aug. 29, said he has seen his doctor for
checkups every three or four months since he had the lesion removed
from his shoulder seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is usually caused by exposure to the sun. Those like
McCain who have fair skin have a higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent hours in the Arizona sun campaigning for Congress
in 1982 and subsequent years. McCain said reports he spent long
periods outdoors while imprisoned as a Vietnam POW were false.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing I wanted to do as a prisoner of war was to see
the sun,'' McCain said. ''I went for years without seeing the
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has canceled about a dozen campaign events with GOP
congressional candidates since learning of the skin cancer
diagnosis. Republican leaders had counted on McCain's help to win
over independent voters and keep the GOP majorities in the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Friday he planned to board his ''Straight Talk
Express'' bus for more campaigning by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The news of McCain's cancer came during the Democratic National
Convention and just days after he toured Western states with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the victor in a spirited Republican nomination
campaign in which McCain won seven primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had learned of the diagnosis Aug. 10, and he
regretted the timing of the news leak about his melanoma. He said
he did not want to take attention away from Democrats and
particularly vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman, a Senate
friend and colleague.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Friday in another session of tepid
trading ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.16 to 11,046.48.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 10.53 at 3,930.34 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell
4.35 to 1,491.72.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has been extremely light this week as most companies
have completed issuing second-quarter earnings reports and
investors await Tuesday's meeting of Fed policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Most traders expect the Fed to leave interest rates alone,
believing the Fed's six rate increases since last summer have
sufficiently slowed the economy and eliminated any inflation risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was somewhat predictable that we'd have a slowdown in
trading prior to the Fed's meeting,'' said Gregory Nie, senior vice
president for technical research at First Union Securities in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, it's a ''summer Friday,'' said Nie, meaning that
many traders are away on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors shares rose $3 to $68.438 amid reports that
financier Carl Icahn intends to buy more than $15 million of the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tech bellwethers continued their upward momentum from the day
before. Intel was up 50 cents at $70.563 and Sun Microsystems,
which declared a 2-for-1 stock split Thursday, rose $2.937 to
$122.375. Texas Instruments rose $3.329 to $70.563.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers were broadly lower, a day after Al Gore chided the
industry in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National
Convention. Merck, down $2.313 to $71.625 and Pharmacia, down
$1.688 at $58, were among the biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 4-to-3 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 812.69 million
shares, well below Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.95 points at 515.51.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.74 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 0.63 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
0.39 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.62 percent.

<HEADLINE> US:No Summit Unless Treaty in Reach  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. envoy told Palestinian negotiators
Friday that President Bill Clinton will not convene a second
Mideast summit unless there is a real chance it will produce a
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross did not deliver new proposals in his two-hour
meeting with the Palestinians, said one of the participants, Saeb
Erekat.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials had said earlier they expected to hear new
American ideas on how to resolve the two most difficult disputes,
over control of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ross also held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
was expected to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat on Friday accused each other of intransigence.
Barak said there is no point in holding another summit as long as
Arafat remains inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who was in Japan, one of the last stops on this world
tour, blamed Barak for the breakdown of last month's Camp David
summit and warned that there would be an ''explosion'' in the
Middle East if negotiations failed altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with Barak, Ross ''emphasized the time factor and
said there was only a very narrow window of opportunity,'' Barak's
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said Clinton would meet with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders separately when they attend the U.N. Millennium
Summit in New York in early September.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, negotiators reached some understandings on the
borders of a Palestinian state and Jewish settlements, but gaps
remained and nothing was put on paper.
</P>
<P>
   In those talks, Barak for the first time offered the
Palestinians control over parts of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, but Arafat insisted on full sovereignty over the eastern
sector, which is home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian
shrines.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Barak delivered his clearest statement yet on
Palestinian independence, saying he was ready to agree to a state
if they formally ended their conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Mohammed Dahlan said the Palestinians had
no objections to doing so, provided all disputes were resolved in a
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While holding out the prospect of statehood, Barak warned the
Palestinians not to declare a state unilaterally. Arafat has said
often that he has the right to make such a declaration after Sept.
13, a target date the two sides set for completing a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Ross was to fly on Saturday to Egypt, which in recent
days has taken on a more active role as a mediator.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Mexico Election Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico (AP) -- Rival neighborhood groups exchanged
gunfire, hurled rocks and set fire to cars Friday in a
post-election battle that left at least two people dead and 14
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting erupted in the city of Chimalhuacan in Mexico state
between two groups, both allied with the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of one group, apparently upset that her son had lost
the party's mayoral nomination, is being investigated for allegedly
urging her supporters to attack loyalists of the winner, said
Santos Montes Leal, assistant attorney general for the area.
</P>
<P>
   She could not be reached for comment Friday. Her son went on to
win a city councilor's seat in Chimalhuacan in the July 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out as a crowd of about 3,000 gathered at the
city hall to inaugurate PRI Mayor Jesus Tolentino. Armed men fired
shots, rocks and sticks at Tolentino's supporters, who themselves
had engaged in street battles during support rallies for the mayor
immediately after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties claimed fraud in the election.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the mayor's supporters were killed in Friday's
violence, and 14 other people were injured, said Santos Montes
Leal, assistant attorney general for the area. Authorities were
searching hospitals and homes for more wounded, some of whom were
taken away from the scene by family members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montes said 28 members of the rival group had been detained.

<HEADLINE> Bridgeport fisherman makes rare find -- twice  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Forgive Larry Fernandes if his newest
pet goes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial fisherman recently hauled a rare blue lobster out
of the Long Island Sound, the second one he's harvested in the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   His first such find had it made for a while. Fernandes built a
special tank for it, fed it a regal diet of protein-rich minnows
and then introduced a second lobster for company. The problem:
Lobsters are cannibals. His rare catch became the tankmate's
blue-plate special.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got over to the tank, all that was there was the top
part of him,'' Fernandes says. ''I guess it's true: Even lobsters
prefer the tails.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pet will remain solo, Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   The blue hue is caused by genetics, said John Volk, director of
the state bureau of aquaculture. Chances are Fernandes' catch has
some blue brothers and sisters crawling around the Sound floor,
Volk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, once a year somebody encounters some unusual
colors,'' he said. ''We've seen other lobsters that come up
yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one lobsterman brought the Milford lab a
yellow-orange critter that was trapped the week of Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought that was pretty appropriate,'' said Volk.
</P>
<P>
   Diet also can influence color, but Volk said that usually occurs
under controlled laboratory conditions and is only a temporary
effect. He estimates the chances of a blue lobster birth is little
under one in a million.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes trapped the recent blue lobster off the Stratford
shore in about 200 feet of water. It found its way into one of his
2,000 traps.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people keep asking me what are you gonna do with him?
But I have no idea,'' Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, sent Fernandes a letter Friday asking him to put the
lobster back in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that you will not condemn him to a sad, lonely life in
a viewing tank,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-pound lobster give Fernandes hope for a better season.
Nearly 90 percent of lobsters in the western part of the Sound died
off last summer due to a parasitic virus. Researchers continue to
investigate whether other factors were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I've found one of these, maybe it means that it will be a
good season - or at least not a bad one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The novelty aside, Volk said the blue ones don't taste any
differently. And in the end, there's just one color that matters to
lobster lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody is pretty happy throwing the green lobster
in the pot and having it come up orange,'' said Volk.

<HEADLINE> Questions raised about cranberry grower's deal with state  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The company owned by J. Garfield DeMarco,
the Pinelands cranberry grower and longtime Republican power
broker, earned more than $661,000 selling the development rights on
land he later gave control over to the state as part of a penalty
for illegally digging up freshwater wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials defend the penalty, saying it does
not matter that DeMarco diminished the value of his land before he
agreed to a deed restriction. The land still retained enough value
to represent a sizable enough penalty for creating new cranberry
bogs without a state permit, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental critics of the Whitman administration were
critical of the settlement even before it became known that DeMarco
had sold off his development rights on the 591-acre parcel in
Tabernacle Township, Burlington County. Now, they are livid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This goes from just a slap on the wrist, to 'We're giving him
a check instead,''' said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole process is just an outrageous abuse of the whole
enforcement and protection system within the Department of
Environmental Protection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco, former chairman of the Burlington County GOP and a
generous Republican campaign contributor, was cited for digging up
22 acres of wetlands in Woodland Township to create cranberry bogs
without a permit. The state last week announced it had reached a
settlement with the grower, under which his company would agree to
a deed restriction on land he owns in Tabernacle, among other
terms.
</P>
<P>
   DEP officials estimated the penalty represented a $300,000 loss
for DeMarco, largely in the form of lost development potential on
the Tabernacle parcel.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after the settlement was announced that
environmentalists learned that the grower's company, A.R. DeMarco
Enterprises, had earlier pocketed $661,000 by selling the
development rights on the land to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Before he sold the development rights, the land was zoned for
one house every 40 acres. After the sale, DeMarco could only cut
trees or grow berries on the land. Under the deed restriction, he
can't even do that, according to William Harrison, assistant
director of the Pinelands Commission, which calculated the value of
the sale in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't worth much, then even less, then even less than
that,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our perspective, his selling (development) credits and
getting the land permanently protected is a good deal for the
state,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Cantor, assistant DEP commissioner in charge of land use
management, said he was not aware that DeMarco had already sold his
development credits when he brokered the settlement deal last week.
But he said it did not matter; that the state still extracted a
penalty in proportion to the freshwater wetlands violation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking for a penalty in the neighborhood of
$300,000,'' Cantor said. ''We believe that's what this type of
violation deserved.''

<HEADLINE> US Arrests Man Wanted in Argentina  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. agents have arrested a Pakistani man who
Argentine sources say is wanted for questioning in the bombings of
the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 and of a Jewish
cultural center there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   An Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman, Nancy
Cohen, confirmed on Friday the arrest in Los Angeles of Mohammad
Abass Malik, on grounds that he was in the United States without
proper documentation. Cohen had no additional information on the
man.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Argentina's intelligence service, Fernando de
Santibanes, disclosed the arrest to The Associated Press on
Tuesday, the day Malik was taken into custody, but there was no
confirmation by any U.S. government agency until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes, who is in the United States for a speech, said
Argentine authorities believe the detainee ''is related'' to the
embassy bombing and ''may have a connection'' to the bombing at the
Jewish center.
</P>
<P>
   Malik was being held at the INS' detention facility in San Pedro
for alleged immigration violations, said Sharon Gavin, a
spokeswoman for the INS Western region. He is waiting for a hearing
before an immigration judge, and it has yet to be scheduled, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources said an official of Argentina's Supreme Court
planned to fly to Los Angeles to question Malik but this could not
be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
the Jewish center Thursday during her five-country swing through
South America.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini and
Jewish leaders to pay homage to the 86 victims of the July 18,
1994, bombing. The 1992 embassy bombing killed 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes said the alleged linking of Malik to the bombings was
based on information obtained by Interpol.
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. officials have agreed not to release Malik pending
a determination of the facts. If circumstances warrant, he said,
Argentina will seek Malik's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The twin bombings have been a high priority of American Jewish
leaders for years. At the time of the Washington visit of Argentine
President Fernando de la Rua in June, Abraham Foxman of the
Anti-Defamation League, said it was ''really important to see when
and if the Argentine government can bring to justice those who
perpetrated the bombing of the Jewish community center and embassy.
There still is no closure on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina initially blamed Iran for the 1994 bombing but later
withdrew the accusation. Iran has denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes said Argentina is committed to finding the
perpetrators of both bombings and is cooperating with the CIA,
Israel's intelligence service and similar services elsewhere
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that this new cooperation will bear fruit,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is home to some 300,000 Jews, the second-largest such
community in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Probe continues after toddler's death is linked to tainted burger  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Health workers seeking the source of
contaminated hamburgers linked to a Morris County toddler's death
also are studying other food-poisoning cases involving the same
bacteria, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nicolaus Brayton's death on Aug. 1, health investigators
have determined the 20-month-old Parsippany boy was infected with
the identical strain of bacteria later found in hamburger patties
still in his family's freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing does not kill the bacteria, called E. coli 0157:H7, a
particularly virulent strain of Escherichia coli. Normally, it
lives without problems in the intestines of healthy people and
animals. In small children, the elderly and others with weak immune
systems, though, it can cause intestinal illnesses and result in
hospitalization and occasionally death.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will trace the product to its source and look at other
cases'' to see if they involve the same strain, said Dennis
McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior
Services. ''We do have isolated cases of E. coli infection that
cannot be traced back any more.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, McGowan said, nearly 50 cases of E. coli
infection have been reported in New Jersey, but the boy's death is
the first one in about 18 months. The number of cases fluctuated in
the late 1990s, but is up sharply from only 11 cases each in 1992
and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this year's cases ultimately may be linked to the same
beef wholesalers or processors responsible for the tainted burgers
Nicolaus ate.
</P>
<P>
   According to his mother, Lorraine Brayton, he became sick with
diarrhea and a light fever a few days after the family ate
hamburgers. The patties, which had been purchased about two months
ago, also sickened the mother and the boy's twin sister, Samantha,
but they both recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolaus deteriorated rapidly after developing a complication
called hemolytic uremic syndrome in which the kidneys fail and
anemia or bleeding problems develop. He was hospitalized for a few
days, but suffered several strokes that caused brain death, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Ehmer Meats Inc., the Lake Hiawatha butcher shop where his
family bought the hamburger patties implicated, then voluntarily
recalled all ground beef products recently sold there and
re-sanitized all its meat processing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Croughn, the Parsippany Township health officer, said
the Ehmer butcher shop has never failed a health inspection in its
two decades operating. State officials say no other E. coli
infections have involved meat from the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they can track down the source'' of contamination,
Croughn said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is tracking the frozen
patties from the butcher back through the distribution chain, Beth
Gaston, spokeswoman for the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 73,000 E. coli infections occur each year in the
United States. Symptoms include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting and dehydration, but less than 1 percent of
patients die.
</P>
<P>
   The infection usually is associated with eating undercooked or
contaminated ground beef. However, contaminated water also has
caused outbreaks, and the infection has been transmitted from
person to person in families, day care centers and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main way to prevent infection from E. coli is to cook the
food properly,'' McGowan said, ensuring meats reach an internal
temperature of 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also must wash hands frequently while handling foods
and prevent juices from raw meats and vegetables from contaminating
cooked ones.

<HEADLINE> Cable company pulls Democratic congressional ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A cable television company has yanked a
campaign ad off the air, saying Democrats were wrong about 12th
District Republican candidate Richard Zimmer's record.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, prepared by the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, says Zimmer ''never voted for a single education
spending bill - not one,'' when he was a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, who is seeking to retake his seat from the Democratic
incumbent, U.S. Rep. Rush Holt, actually voted for some education
spending bills during his six years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attack ads were a lie and Rush should be embarrassed for
staunchly defending them,'' the challenger said in a statement
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At Zimmer's request, Comcast Cable Communications Inc. pulled
the ads from the airwaves Friday. They had been running about one
week.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the DCCC, Comcast lawyer Douglas Gaston IV wrote
that his company could not continue airing the ad as is.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear from the materials that the unequivocal statement
contained in the ad is not supported by the record,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston did not return a telephone message left on his voice mail
Friday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Holt said in a statement he welcomes any changes to the ad by
the DCCC ''so that voters can get a full understanding of just how
bad Dick Zimmer's education record is.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt campaign manager Mark Matzen said Zimmer is splitting
hairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my standpoint, a vote that slashed education funding is
not a vote for education funding,'' he said. ''This is a debate
over the definition of 'for.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for a media outlet to pull a campaign ad at
the request of an opponent, according to Rider University political
science professor David Rebovich.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations may refuse to aid a commercial if it is
deemed racist or offensive to women or people of a particular
religious background for example. ''Those are pretty much
untouchables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are so many ads that don't tell the whole story,'' he
said, adding he has not seen the offending Democratic ad.

<HEADLINE> SUNY professor resigns, will pay back money he stole  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - An award-winning Binghamton University
faculty member who admitted stealing $31,088 from the Research
Foundation of the State University of New York avoided prison time
by paying the money back and resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Lewis, a finance professor with the School of Management
and former associate provost for budget and planning, pleaded
guilty in June to third-degree grand larceny. He admitted he handed
in 12 vouchers with false information to the research foundation
between Oct. 1, 1998 and Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Before sentencing Lewis, Broome County Court Judge Martin E.
Smith told him he deserves public humiliation for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''You took a position of trust at Binghamton University and used
it to your own advantage. It doesn't get much lower than that,''
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   He told Lewis he couldn't understand why a man who was held in
high esteem by the university and community, ''would stoop so low
to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said nothing during sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Until the investigation began last fall, Lewis earned $106,775
per year as associate provost for budget and planning. In October,
he was relieved of those duties.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is a past recipient of a State University of New York
Chancellor's Award and University Award for Excellence in Teaching.
He already has paid the money back and signed his resignation
letter Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Suspends Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A Colombian army investigator announced
Friday he was suspending 41 officers and soldiers who were
allegedly involved in the shooting deaths of six schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The killings Tuesday of the children hiking with their
classmates shocked the nation and forced the military to explain
how such a tragedy could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the police said two other children were killed,
and five people injured, by a bomb planted by the Revolutionary
Armed Forces Colombia, the country's largest guerrilla army.
</P>
<P>
   The homemade bomb went off Thursday night in the village of
Carmen de Bolivar, 70 miles from the port city of Cartagena which
President Clinton will visit Aug. 30, police said. The rebel group
has not commented on allegations they were behind the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Military investigators are examining the claims of top army
officials who say the six students were shot during a firefight
between rebels of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, and
government troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Jairo Duvan Pinada's announcement of the suspensions of
five noncommissioned officers and 36 privates came hours after the
ELN denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the ELN called for an international
investigation of the deaths of the children, aged 6 to 15. Four
children were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN statement said its combatants were not in the area when
the shootings occurred outside the town of Pueblo Rico, about 125
miles northwest of the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The claims by the ELN, the second largest Marxist group in
Colombia, back up the account of an adult witness who has said
government troops fired on the children without provocation and
that no guerrillas where in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Pinada told reporters that he was treating the deaths of the six
children as homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The military investigation comes as some 43 investigators from
Colombian state prosecutors' offices and from an autonomous
Colombian human rights watchdog group, the People's Defense
Council, are conducting separate inquiries into the children's
killings.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana has vowed to uncover the truth behind
the deaths.

<HEADLINE> Putin Defends Sub Crisis Handling  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Responding to criticism over his handling of the
Russian nuclear submarine sinking, President Vladimir Putin said
Friday that rescue efforts swung into action almost immediately
after the disaster occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became clear that the military had an extraordinary
situation on their hands,'' Putin said of the sequence of events
when the submarine failed to appear on Aug. 12. ''At once, I would
like to underline at once, immediately all the necessary measures
were taken...''
</P>
<P>
   ''But of course the information about what had happened came to
the mass media later,'' Putin told reporters in Yalta, Ukraine.
''You can criticize this if you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been sharply criticized by many Russians for failing
to cancel the vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first public statement only on Wednesday and stayed
at the resort in Sochi until Friday. He then went to Yalta,
Ukraine, for a meeting of heads of former Soviet republics. He cut
short that meeting on Saturday and returned to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said his first impulse was to interrupt a vacation at the
Black Sea and fly to a naval base on the Barents Sea, the waters
where the submarine Kursk sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just restrained myself from doing this and I think I acted
correctly because arrivals at the place of the accident of
high-ranking officials and bureaucrats of various kinds ... doesn't
help rescuing people and equipment and in many cases actually
hinders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident, Putin had made high-profile appearances
that bolstered his image as a tough leader well-disposed to the
military -- including an overnight trip on a submarine. There was
widespread surprise and disappointment that he did not head for the
Northern Fleet's home base to personally monitor the Kursk rescue
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said that when he first asked officials about the
prospects of rescuing the trapped crew, he was told ''the chances
are extremely low -- but they exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was emotionally affecting, Putin said, especially
because he knows the ship's commander, Gennady Petrovic.

<HEADLINE> Special prosecutor takes assault case against deputy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALLSTON SPA, N.Y. (AP) - A special prosecutor has been
appointed to the case of a Saratoga County Sheriff's deputy accused
of breaking two bones in his wife's face during a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Polly Hoye of neighboring Fulton County will take the case
against Lt. J. Craig Doherty, charged with felony assault in
connection with an Aug. 3 fight at his home. Doherty, 35, is
charged with punching his 36-year-old wife in the face, breaking an
orbital bone and a sinus wall.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga County District Attorney James A. Murphy III asked for
a special prosecutor because Doherty - a 14-year veteran who is an
accident reconstruction specialist - is a witness in at least two
vehicular manslaughter cases involving drunk drivers. He also has
provided assistance on several other cases pending in Murphy's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethically we cannot call a witness to testify for us in a very
serious case and at the same time be prosecuting this same witness
for a violent assault,'' Murphy said. ''The only appropriate action
we can take is to have a special prosecutor appointed so there is
no appearance of bias, favoritism or conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty is on unpaid suspension.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nigeria Head Named Congo Envoy  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Friday appointed Nigeria's former military ruler as a special envoy
with a mandate to get Congo's government to honor a year-old
agreement to halt the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who will travel to the region in the
next few days, is expected ''to make clear once more'' to the
Congolese government the U.N. Security Council's position that
fighting must stop and U.N. observers must be allowed to move
freely, U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar's appointment comes two days after Annan told the
Security Council that he wants to extend the mandate of the U.N.
mission in Congo, which expires on Aug 31, for another month.
</P>
<P>
   A summit of African leaders in Zambia last week failed to agree
on measures to revive the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The United States introduced a draft resolution Friday that
would extend the mandate for 45 days, saying it would give the
council time for further diplomatic efforts to back the cease-fire
and for council reflection on the mandate of the U.N. mission ''and
possible adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the U.N. said it was investigating the death of
a U.N. official sent to evaluate war damage in the town of
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Comerford of Britain was found hanged in his hotel room,
officials said. ''At this point we don't know whether it is a
suicide or a murder,'' U.N. representative Kamel Morjane said in
Kinshasa, the Congolese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Congo started two years ago when rebels backed by
Rwanda and Uganda tried to oust President Laurent Kabila, who had
support from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Last year, the warring
parties signed a peace agreement in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, 5,537 U.N. observers were to supervise the
cease-fire. So far, only 264 observers and about 15 staff have been
deployed because the violence has continued and Congo has failed to
ensure their safety.

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A 23-year-old man from New York drowned at a
Canal Street hotel, the Orleans Parish coroner's office says.
</P>
<P>
   Mamadou Fofana, 23, was taken from the Marriott Hotel pool to
Charity Hospital about noon Wednesday, and died there about 21/2

<HEADLINE> Kozmo.com withdraws IPO plans  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Kozmo.com Inc. canceled plans Friday for an
initial public offering of its stock and cut about 40 more
employees from its headquarters staff, the latest in a series of
shakeups at the online convenience retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The company sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange
Commission Friday withdrawing its IPO registration ''because of
unfavorable market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the company said Kozmo intends to register
for a new stock sale early next year, and will take the extra time
until then to focus on making its business profitable in some
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the capital on hand and the confidence in our model to
go public when it makes the most sense for our company,'' Matt
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the job cuts, representing about 1 percent of the
company's total work force, were made Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at Kozmo come a week after it cut about 275 workers
from its dispatch, warehouse and delivery operations in New York
and Los Angeles. Earlier this year, the company cut 24 employees
from its headquarters staff.
</P>
<P>
   The past few months also have seen Kozmo's founder and CEO
Joseph Park step down, although he continues to serve as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But company officials say, despite all the changes, they remain
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''In today's dynamic marketplace, the mark of a successful
company is one that faces challenges head on,'' CEO Gerardo Burdo
wrote in a letter sent to all employees this week. ''Fortunately,
we are making the decisions today that will put us on the road to
success tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo filed to go public in March, with plans to raise up to
$150 million. But reports have circulated frequently in recent
weeks that the New York-based company, which offers one-hour
delivery of videos, snack food and other items, had decided to
delay its stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the cancellation of the stock sale does not signal
deeper-seated problems at the company, which has raised $250
million in capital from investors including Starbucks Corp. and
Amazon.com Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it's a sign of strength that we can wait until we
feel the time is right'' for an IPO, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman declined to comment on recent reports that Kozmo
is considering a merger with New York-based rival Urbanfetch.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said Kozmo, which serves 11 cities, expects to start
turning a profit in its initial markets early next year.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Manhattan public school teacher arrested on drug charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A veteran Manhattan public school teacher has
been arrested on charges of selling drugs, including heroin,
cocaine, Ecstasy and Viagra, out of her car.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they arrested Veda Kaleya, 51, and her driver, Oleg
Zhdanov, 30, at 10th Avenue and 54th Street shortly before 10 p.m.
Thursday after they saw what appeared to be a drug transaction.
</P>
<P>
   After they pulled the car over, police found 86 bags of cocaine,
12 bags of heroin, 15 bags of opium, 16 bottles of crystal meth, 31
tabs of Ecstasy, and 17 bags of marijuana in a purse on Kaleya's
lap, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The purse also contained more than 100 assorted pills that
included Quaalude, Valium, and Viagra, and $1,084 in cash, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Kaleya, of 60 Gramercy Park, and Zhdanov, of
320 W. 56th St., include criminal possession of a controlled
substance in the second degree, which is punishable by a maximum
sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Gabriel Gorenstein set bail for
Kaleya at $100,000 cash or bond and scheduled the teacher's next
appearance for Aug 23.
</P>
<P>
   Kaleya's attorney, Harlan Greenberg, said his client will plead
innocent to the charges. Greenberg also expressed concern about the
legality of the car search.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say they observed a small object being passed between the
front and rear seats in exchange for money at 10 o'clock at night
from a distance away,'' Greenberg said. ''I'm questioning where
they were and how they saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhdanov, who was awaiting arraignment, could not immediately be
reached for comment. His telephone number was unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela McDonnell, a spokeswoman for the city Board of Education,
said Kaleya has been a New York City public school teacher since
1974, working most of those 26 years in District 4 in East Harlem.
Since January 1993, she had been a special education teacher at
P.S. 146 on East 106th Street.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said she did not yet know what effect the drug arrest
would have on Kaleya's employment.

<HEADLINE> Police: No Charge in Ant Bite Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH PORT, Fla. (AP) -- Criminal charges will not be filed in
the case of a nursing home patient stung to death by fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators and the Florida attorney general's office
said they found no crimes were committed. The nursing home still
faces fines from the Agency for Health Care Administration and
Medicaid officials for their treatment of Mary Gay.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, 87, died in May at Quality Health Care Center after being
stung more than 1,600 times by fire ants that burrowed from an
outdoor nest into her room. State regulators said the nursing home
did not provide proper care because nurses did not tell a doctor
how serious the attack was.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home has since changed its policies and is appealing
a $3,000-a-day fine levied by state regulators.

<HEADLINE> Wedding plans almost disrupted by Clinton's campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - For the past three days, Heather Lee
thought she might have to share her wedding reception with
reporters covering Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The family had booked the ballroom at the Holiday Inn in Auburn
for the Sept. 2 reception in August 1999. But on Wednesday they got
a phone call from the hotel: ''We've got a problem,'' said an Inn
employee.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn had apparently told the White House Travel
Office that part of the ballroom would be available for a press
room set-up during a potential visit by President Clinton and his
wife to the Finger Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked,'' said Lee, 24, of Auburn. ''Of all the people
getting married, why is this happening to me, two weeks before my
wedding?''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lee, Heather's father, said the family had already paid
about $8,000 in a down payment to secure the entire facility to
accommodate 220 guests when they were told they may have only
two-thirds of it.
</P>
<P>
   The family's fears were assuaged Friday, when the White House
withdrew its request and the hotel decided to give Lee the entire
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in the process of trying to accommodate with two
customers, but the parents feel strongly they need the entire
ballroom,'' said Richard Duda, director of corporate marketing at
the Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my daughter's wedding. You only do it once, and we're
doing it right,'' Lee said. ''I'm not looking for a freebie. I'm
looking for what I paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is not registered in any political party, said his
family was upset with the hotel, not the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't hold Hillary or Bill responsible because they probably
don't even know about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, her husband in tow, was flying into the Lake
Placid area Friday afternoon to spend a long weekend at a private
home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, Clinton's Republican opponent, Rep. Rick
Lazio, attacked the first lady over the issue of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio claimed Clinton's failed health care initiative would have
denied mammograms to women younger than 50 and would have allowed
mammograms every other year instead of annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only one candidate in this race that was out there
that voted to assure that women who are 40 and over could have
access to mammography screening, mammograms, only one,'' Lazio said
after touring the National Women's Rights Historical Park Museum in
Seneca Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said: ''Once again,
Rick Lazio is misleading New Yorkers about his own record and
distorting Hillary's. Just this week, the National Breast Cancer
Coalition honored Hillary for her work to eradicate breast cancer.
Who will New Yorkers believe - the National Breast Cancer Coalition
or Rick Lazio?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said Lazio's vote to abolish a Suffolk County office
that provided an early breast cancer detection program and his
support of the 1995 budget that cut Medicare by $270 billion showed
his hypocrisy on the issue. Wolfson also said the 1993 health care
initiative championed by Clinton would have provided mammograms to
at-risk women under 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio's press release is a joke,'' Wolfson said. ''Once
again Rick Lazio is demonstrating his hypocrisy by attacking
Hillary for a position he himself supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton say she may return this year to the Finger
Lakes region and again visit the State Fair, which runs from Aug.
24 to Sept. 4. She and the president attended the fair last year.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Sarah Gegenheimer said the Travel Office
was not aware that there was a wedding reception planned for that
day at the Holiday Inn in Auburn, about 30 miles west of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as they were made aware that there was a wedding
planned, they immediately withdrew the request,'' Gegenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were to celebrate the president's 54th birthday
Saturday in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, the first lady and the president planned to
attend a $25-a-person Democratic barbecue at the Saranac Lake Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the Clintons planned to spend a quiet weekend in Lake
Placid, site of the 1980 and 1932 Winter Olympics, after the Friday
night event. On Sunday, the first lady was to be back on the
campaign trail with an afternoon visit to a Polish festival in
Cheektowaga near Buffalo. Lazio is also expected to attend the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a nice long weekend. I'm really looking
forward to it,'' the first lady said in an interview late last week
with The Associated Press in Los Angeles, where she spoke to the
Democratic National Convention on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even before her arrival in Lake Placid, Clinton was raving about
the private home the first family would be using. It is owned by
Arthur Lussi, who runs the Lake Placid Holiday Inn resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen the property but it's described to me as very
beautiful - lots of woods and water,'' she told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady found herself in some hot water with Adirondack
residents last year after an unidentified adviser told the New York
Daily News the Clintons would never vacation in the
''fly-infested'' Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the first lady has made several campaign swings
through the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp tried to remind New Yorkers Friday of the black
fly comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope she finds the place without trouble and that she can
steer clear of the black flies or any other troublesome New York
state insects she may not be familiar with,'' Lazio campaign
spokesman Dan McLagan said.

<HEADLINE> The Anonymous Get Their Shot  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- We already know who can't beat Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The names had their chances in the two previous majors and
through two rounds of this one. So, there should be no more
questions about what comes next: It's time for the anonymous to
take their shots.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of guys auditioned for the role Friday in the PGA
Championship. The first to amble out of the scorer's tent within
shouting distance of Woods goes by the handle of J.P. Hayes. He
qualified for the spoiler role on the spot, since almost nobody had
any idea what either the J or the P stood for.
</P>
<P>
   ''John and Patrick,'' Hayes patiently explained to a reporter
for the Irish Times mining the golfer's brief bio for an angle.
Hayes was only too happy to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family,'' he offered cheerfully, ''comes from Limerick.''
</P>
<P>
   But his story comes right off the pages of one of those
self-help manuals that are all the rage at the moment, a tale of
hard work and perseverance that reminds us what's so wonderful
about golf.
</P>
<P>
   So are the stories attached to Scott Dunlap and Bob May, two
other 30-somethings who scuffled to reach The Show and scuffle
almost daily to stay there. And don't forget their patron saint
this week, 44-year-old Fred Funk. He quit his job as golf coach at
Maryland in 1989 to test the waters on the PGA Tour and despite
five wins since, he's still better known as the darling of the two
dozen-strong, pink-shirted ''Funk's Punks'' who double his gallery
at The Players Championship every year.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that should have catapulted all of them into the
headlines this week is their presence on the leaderboard in the
season's final major. That won't happen because of the guy who sits
at the top -- Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap learned that the hard way a day earlier, when his 66
earned him a half-share of the opening-day lead but no more than a
sliver of the attention. He shot 68 in round two to continue
lurking just off Woods' shoulder at 10 under, proving just how
unshakable Dunlap can be. In fact, anybody who knows anything about
him knows the sponsor on his cap should be ''Dramamine'' instead of
''Titleist.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about fighting jet lag: Last year, Dunlap owned a playing
card on five tours covering three continents and somehow finished
ranked 87th in Europe, the United States and the world. The good
news is that Dunlap doesn't have far to go to get his shot at No.
1; Saturday, after playing golf with lions, hippos and elephants
nearby, he goes off in the final pairing with a Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's won more majors than I made cuts in,'' Dunlap said. ''It
should be some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes had some day Friday, following up his 69 with a 68. Even
so, he had no trouble containing his excitement at being the leader
in the clubhouse. That was likely because Woods had yet to tee off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fully expect he will be ahead of me when the day is over,''
Hayes predicted correctly. ''But I might be closer to him than I
was when the day started.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned out to be half-right. Some 90 minutes later, Woods
reclaimed the lead at 8 under with his second birdie of the day at
No. 5, but didn't stop there. He made four more to offset a lone
bogey and returned to Valhalla's clubhouse at 11 under, then took
his first long look at the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   The only face most people could attach to the five names just
below Woods belonged to Davis Love III, but he hardly scares anyone
anymore. Love was already winless for a year when he got clocked in
a series in head-to-head duels with Woods, and hasn't been the same
since.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither have any of the other golfers we expected to
rise to the challenge Woods has thrown down. Instead, they've
become the Washington Generals of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, second in this season's three previous majors, was at
142 and in need of a miracle two-day run to get there in the
fourth. David Duval never left his home in Idaho because of a bad
back. Phil Mickelson was at 140, and Justin Leonard and Colin
Montgomerie at 146. Hal Sutton missed the cut and two of the other
guys who stood up to Woods during this latest run -- Darren Clarke
and Lee Westwood -- will have trouble finding him now with a map.
Sergio Garcia, who challenged Woods in the PGA last year, was at
143.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, Woods is turning major championship golf into
something reminiscent of those exhibitions chess champion Bobby
Fischer used to love to put on. Having worn out the serious
competition, Fischer would take on a dozen anonymous comers all at
once, moving from board to board at a clip fast enough to keep
himself interested.
</P>
<P>
   He almost never lost, but the strength those numbers afforded
gave everybody facing him the least little glimmer of hope. So it
will go Saturday, this time in the rolling hills outside
Louisville.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Rocks Center of Pristina  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A grenade attack left nine Serb
children with minor injuries in a Kosovo village Friday, hours
after an explosion in the province's capital injured one woman and
damaged several political offices, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were injured when unidentified assailants threw two
hand grenades into a basketball court from a car and the children
played, said Lt. Tim Serrell-Cooke, a spokesman for the NATO-led
peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in the village of Crkven Vodica, about
seven miles northwest of Pristina. The children were treated at a
hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Pristina damaged offices of Serb, ethnic
Albanian and other political parties all housed in one building.
</P>
<P>
   One woman suffered cuts and bruises and several other people
were in shock, said Serrell-Cooke. NATO officials said the
explosion appeared to have been caused by a bomb planted behind the
office building.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just exploded from the middle of nowhere, and we didn't
know what hit us,'' said Linda Spahiu, who worked for the party
representing Kosovo's Turkish minority. Her face was cut from the
blast.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs claimed the blast was an attack on their liaison
office housed in the same building. The head of Yugoslavia's
liaison office in Pristina, Stanimir Vukicevic, accused the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo and the international peacekeeping force of
condoning the attack, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Vukicevic said the attack was aimed at ''ethnically cleansing
and eradicating the presence of Yugoslavia from Kosovo.'' Kosovo, a
southern Yugoslav province, has been run by the United Nations
since the end of a 78-day NATO bombing campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kosovo was handed over to the NATO-led peacekeeping force
and U.N. administrators, Serbs and other minorities have come under
attack by revenge-minded ethnic Albanians who associate them with
the crackdown against led them by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion shattered window panes in the area. U.N. police
and NATO peacekeepers cordoned off the area.
</P>
<P>
   The building is run by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE is in charge of democracy building
in the province, still wracked by ethnic hatreds and lawlessness
more than a year after the NATO bombing forced an end to the Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, Kosovo's chief U.N. administrator, said the
bomb was planted by ''enemies of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A bomb is a very undemocratic means'' of expressing an
opinion, he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Judge Was Grand Jury Story Source  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray confirmed
Friday that he has impaneled a grand jury to resume investigation
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal as a federal judge said he
inadvertently released that information a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate Court Judge Richard D. Cudahy, one of three judges on
the panel that supervises Ray, said in a statement that it was he
who disclosed the information. He said it occurred in a
conversation with a reporter who called to ask about the panel's
decision to grant an extension to Ray's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement of his own, Ray said the disclosure was a
setback. ''The timing of yesterday's disclosure of the existence of
a grand jury considering evidence in the Lewinsky investigation
undermines our ability to complete this matter in a prompt,
responsible, and cost-effective manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Cudahy, a veteran jurist appointed to the bench by
President Carter in 1979, said that ''the timing resulted solely
from the press inquiry following on the issuance of the special
division's order.''
</P>
<P>
   While discussing the extension, which was released Thursday by
the three-judge panel, ''the judge inadvertently referred to the
existence of a newly-empaneled grand jury,'' Cudahy's statement
said. ''This fact, previously undisclosed, has led to considerable
controversy, based on its timing.'' Indeed, Democrats criticized
the timing of the legal developments involving President Clinton
because they were made public on the day Vice President Al Gore was
accepting his party's nomination at the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy on Friday disclosed his role, ''with apologies to all
concerned,'' said the statement released by Cudahy's office. He
came forward because of ''the nature of the controversy,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement given to reporters in Lake Placid, where Clinton
is vacationing with his family, presidential spokesman Jake Siewert
said: ''Wherever the information came from, even after $50 million,
an 800-page report and proceedings before both houses of Congress,
the independent counsel seems to want this investigation to go on
and on and on. The American people have put this behind them, and
they must be wondering why the independent counsel can't do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press first reported the new grand jury on
Thursday, citing legal sources. On Friday, the three-judge panel,
at Ray's request, authorized to Ray to make public letters to the
court that confirmed the existence of the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Smith Tunney, director of corporate communications for The
Associated Press, said, ''We are aware of the judge's statement,
but we don't discuss reporter's sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy was the lone dissenting voice a year ago when the panel
decided to let Ray go ahead with the probe, saying ''an endless
investigation'' served no goal and imposed a needless burden on
taxpayers. The judge, based in Chicago, agreed with the order
issued this week.

<HEADLINE> Blue Lobster Found Off Long Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Forgive Larry Fernandes if his newest
pet goes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial fisherman recently hauled a rare blue lobster out
of the Long Island Sound, the second one he's harvested in the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   His first such find had it made for a while. Fernandes built a
special tank for it, fed it a regal diet of protein-rich minnows
and then introduced a second lobster for company. The problem:
Lobsters are cannibals. His rare catch became the tankmate's
blue-plate special.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got over to the tank, all that was there was the top
part of him,'' Fernandes says. ''I guess it's true: Even lobsters
prefer the tails.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pet will remain solo, Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   The blue hue is caused by genetics, said John Volk, director of
the state's bureau of aquaculture. Chances are Fernandes' catch has
some blue brothers and sisters crawling around the Sound floor,
Volk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, once a year somebody encounters some unusual
colors,'' he said. ''We've seen other lobsters that come up
yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one lobsterman trapped a yellow-orange lobster the
week of Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought that was pretty appropriate,'' said Volk.
</P>
<P>
   Diet also can influence color, but Volk said that usually occurs
under controlled laboratory conditions and is only a temporary
effect. He estimates the chances of a blue lobster birth is little
under one in a million.
</P>
<P>
   The novelty aside, Volk said the blue ones don't taste any
differently. And in the end, there's just one color that matters to
lobster lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody is pretty happy throwing the green lobster
in the pot and having it come up orange,'' said Volk.
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, sent Fernandes a letter Friday asking him to put the
lobster back in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that you will not condemn him to a sad, lonely life in
a viewing tank,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Quiet Birthday Weekend  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton passed up a roadside
sign offering ''Free Ribs for Bill'' on Friday, but couldn't resist
another, held aloft by a group of children, that wished him a happy
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was so nice of you to do that,'' Clinton said as he,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, daughter Chelsea and family dog
Buddy posed for a picture in front of the large, multicolored sign
that read ''Happy Birthday President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his family are spending a quiet weekend away from
Washington to celebrate Clinton's 54th birthday on Saturday and to
lie low while Vice President Al Gore makes his maiden political
trip as the official Democratic Party presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The only official outing for the weekend was a rally Friday
evening sponsored by three local Democratic parties, including the
one from Clinton County, that drew an estimated 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for Senate in New York,
spoke before the president. Clinton listened intently, hands
clasped beneath his chin, and studied his wife at the podium. When
it was his turn, he struck a thoughtful tone.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family has a new candidate, and my party, as of last night,
has a new leader,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   That brings him back full circle to when he started in politics,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm coming back to where you are. I'm going to be a
citizen-activist, and I'm trying to be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has kept a low profile since a symbolic joint meeting
with Gore on Tuesday in Michigan. Clinton had addressed the
Democratic National Convention on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has canceled at least one event next week that
Gore advisers worried might steal headlines from Gore's
post-convention campaign tour.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had planned to mark the fourth anniversary of the
signing of his welfare-to-work program with a political rally
Tuesday in Atlanta. Instead, he will meet privately at the White
House with CEOs who have advised the White House on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cleaned out some important events on the schedule next week
so we could keep the spotlight on Gore,'' a Clinton administration
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were made ''after we talked with their campaign,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will make two fund-raising trips, one to Michigan and
one to New Jersey. He will also meet with Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox at the White House on Thursday. On Friday, he leaves
for a four-day trip to Nigeria and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack weekend is the family's first vacation trip to
the Adirondack Mountains, which lie several hours drive upstate
from New York City. The trip represents something of a
reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, before her Senate candidacy was official, Mrs.
Clinton angered some Adirondack residents when an anonymous aide
sarcastically ruled out a family trip to the region because it has
too many black flies.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little evidence of bad feeling as the Clintons
arrived. Well-wishers lined their route, and many held signs
welcoming the family. A roadside barbecue joint called Tail O' The
Pup tried to lure Clinton to stop with the free ribs offer.
</P>
<P>
   When he stopped en route to shake hands, someone handed Clinton
a tiny American flag, which he held aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend trip marks the family's second short vacation this
summer. They visited the Massachusetts resort island of Martha's
Vineyard earlier this month, as they have done nearly every summer
of Clinton's presidency.

<HEADLINE> Jalapeno sushi? Entrepreneurs feed quirky U.S. appetite for raw fish </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Day after methodical day, a ''sushi robot'' in a
factory here squirts spots of green horseradish on thousands of
bite-sized rice cakes as they proceed along a conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   Workers wearing hygienic gloves and smocks cover the concoctions
with slices of tuna from the Philippines, salmon from Chile and
shrimp from Indonesia - all flash-frozen and shipped thousands of
miles to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind nostalgic visions of traditional Japanese cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The same technique that made McDonald's popular in Japan - mass
marketing - will help ''spread Japanese food throughout America,''
said Takehisa Takayama, proud owner of the factory that produces
7,000 box lunches daily for 16 Daikichi Sushi fast-food outlets
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Courting an American yen for exotic tastes, a growing class of
entrepreneurs like Takayama apply assembly line efficiencies,
disciplined marketing and go great distances - literally - to adapt
Japan's uncooked fish dish to the peculiarities of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   They're tantalizing the U.S. palate with innovations like raw
yellowtail with jalapenos, fake seaweed made of flour. They're
considering rice balls with ketchup. Far-flung supply lines are
feeding an unprecedented U.S. boom in sushi consumption well into
the heartland - thousands of miles from any ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The number of traditional sushi bars across the United States
has quintupled to an estimated 5,000 these past 10 years. Sushi is
readily available at supermarkets, hotel receptions and even
professional sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with Americans, so we have to adapt,'' said
Seicho Fujikawa, vice president of Mutual Trading Co., a Los
Angeles-based distributor of ''rainbow seaweed.'' The paper-thin,
flour-based wrap is an alternative to dried seaweed, which some
Americans sniff at. It comes in yellow, pink, green, white and
orange.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, sushi is a natural for the U.S. market. Low in
fat, calories and cholesterol, it fits with health-conscious diets.
It's exotic and easy to eat, making it popular with lunchtime
crowds in bustling cities such as New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But fickle habits demand astute marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting demand for ready-made food, Advanced Fresh Concepts
Corp. runs 900 sushi counters in supermarkets in the United States
and Canada and posts more than dlrs 100 million in annual sales.
Chefs, each trained for a month, prepare sushi for customers on the
spot. Boxes go for as low as dlrs 5.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing Rancho Dominguez, California company also sells
a ''sushi kit'' that rides on the do-it-at-home movement - equipped
with rice vinegar, dried seaweed, bamboo rolling mat and other
basic needs. Only the raw food is left out.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi's invasion began in California in the 1960s, spawning a
unique U.S. sushi adaptation - the California roll, which contains
avocado, cucumber and imitation crab, but no raw fish. Yet the
nation's melting pot of cultures is fertile ground for more exotic
variations.
</P>
<P>
   Nobu Matsuhisa, a top sushi chef, does a booming business by
adding a Latin American twist. After living several years in Peru
and Argentina, Matsuhisa uses flavorings like garlic, cilantro,
tomatoes and olive oil to concoct seafood dishes. His menu includes
fresh yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and raw oysters with salsa.
</P>
<P>
   While purists may object, his restaurants - seven in the United
States and one each in London and Tokyo - are wildly popular,
generally requiring bookings at least a month in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to have a traditional Japanese style
restaurant,'' Matsuhisa said. ''I need more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such successes, sushi makers face daunting challenges in
the United States. Working with raw fish is tricky, and it must
often be transported great distances to the vast U.S. interior.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional sushi bars earn their reputation on the freshness of
their catch. Many have fresh fish flown in special delivery from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But mass producers like Daikichi and Advanced Fresh Concepts
must rely on freezing to keep fish from spoiling. For them it's the
only safe and economical option, even though thawing can make fish
limp and lose flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Hauled in from the ocean, the seafood is flash-frozen at sea or
when it reaches port. It then goes through a complicated network of
wholesalers, trading companies and preparers before ending up in a
Daikichi or AFC lunch box.
</P>
<P>
   Osamu Corp., a Los Angeles-based trading company that contracts
with Daikichi, cuts up imported fish, still frozen, into small,
rectangular slices. Sealed in plastic, the fish is then shipped
rock hard to Daikichi's factory in the Queens section of New York.
</P>
<P>
   With many competitors jumping in, however, concerns are growing
that fish handlers aren't getting proper training - which could
increase health risks. In most areas, no special certification is
required to prepare sushi, other than a regular restaurant license.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration gives guidelines on handling
raw fish, but local authorities must draw up and enforce
regulations. So codes vary from region to region. A key guideline -
which both Daikichi and AFC follow - is chilling fish on display to
41 degrees or less.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi-linked outbreaks in the United States are rare, said Dr.
Robert Tauxe, chief of the food-borne and diarrheal diseases branch
at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. ''I doubt there have been more than five in the last 10
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi entrepreneurs show few signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Takayama, for his part, wants to use sushi's popularity to
introduce a variety of easy-to-eat Japanese foods. Next on his list
is frozen onigiri, or rice balls, that can be warmed up in the
microwave. Traditionally, these are made with dried plum or fish
flakes in the center, but Takamaya is already thinking of ways to
adapt to American taste.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plain white rice may be hard for Americans to eat,'' he said.
''I'm thinking of mixing in salmon, corn - or even ketchup.''

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Jail For Columbine Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A man was sentenced Friday to seven months in
prison for mailing threats to Columbine High School and to the
sheriff who led the investigation of the shootings there.
</P>
<P>
   He was also sentenced to three years probation, including seven
months of home detention with the requirement that he stay off the
Internet. Arthur Leon Thomas, 19, must turn himself in to
authorities by Sept. 21 in Houston, his home.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Thomas mailed a threat to Columbine that said:
''Death for Columbine. RIP. .... I'm the ghost of Eric Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people and then committed
suicide at the high school April 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A threat mailed to Sheriff John Stone said: ''You're next.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Thomas' guilty plea in May, prosecutors dropped
a charge involving an Internet threat sent to a former girlfriend
of Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is the second person to plead guilty to making threats
involving Columbine. Michael Ian Campbell, 18, is scheduled to be
released Monday from a Florida prison after completing a four-month
sentence for e-mailing a threat to a Columbine student.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis S. Rubin, Campbell's attorney, released a statement Friday
saying his client ''again apologizes for his actions and especially
seeks the forgiveness of those in Colorado and elsewhere that he
may have offended.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Free Some Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Negotiators flew to the remote
Philippine island of Jolo on Saturday for the expected release of
hostages held for nearly four months in the jungle by Muslim
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the help of the Lord, we should be able to finish the
recovery within today,'' said chief government negotiator Robert
Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels have been holding 12 Westerners, three
Malaysians and 13 Filipinos captive in primitive jungle huts.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said the status of the three Malaysians was unclear
early Saturday, although he had received a report the previous day
that they had been released to an envoy and were on their way back
from the guerrillas' hide-out.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy ordeal for the hostages has frightened both tourists
and investment away from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Once released, the hostages were expected to be flown from Jolo
to nearby Zamboanga City and presented to diplomats from their home
countries. The Western hostages are then expected to fly aboard a
Libyan-chartered plane to Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played a high-profile role in the negotiations for the
Western hostages and is believed to be paying millions of dollars
for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Separate negotiators working for the three Malaysians' freedom
said Friday they had reached an agreement on a guerrilla demand for
an additional $1-million ransom payment, but did not provide
details.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5.5 million was paid last month to the Abu Sayyaf
group for the release of six other Malaysians and a German,
according to military officials. That payment was supposed to cover
the three remaining Malaysians as well, but the guerrillas reneged
at the last moment and demanded more.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels released a Filipino woman on Wednesday, leaving three
French, two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and one Filipino
still in captivity from an original group of 21 people abducted
April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort and brought to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels later seized three French journalists, and a dozen
Filipino Christian evangelists who visited the rebels' hide-out to
pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hostages had been expected to be freed Thursday. But
bad weather and an order by President Joseph Estrada that all
captives be freed at one time delayed the release, negotiators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The instruction of the president is for us to secure their
release in one batch. Nobody should be left behind,'' Aventajado
said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's instruction prompted speculation he might order a
military attack on the rebels soon after the hostages are freed.
Several senators called Friday for tough action and warned the
rebels were likely to use ransom money to buy more weapons.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 villagers from Bandang near the Abu Sayyaf's camp on
Jolo have fled their homes, fearing some kind of military
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Former Libyan Ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a member of the
Philippine negotiating panel, has insisted the money from his
country will fund development projects instead of going directly to
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Libya hopes its prominent role will enhance its international
image and has flown dozens of journalists from the hostages'
countries to Tripoli to cover the release.
</P>
<P>
   In Tripoli on Friday, Libyan Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassouna
el-Shawish did not say exactly when the release would occur. ''We
expect that in the coming hours, or the next two days at the latest
... to end this process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   El-Shawish said all the Western hostages would stop in Libya for
what he called a happy humanitarian event. ''Without exception, all
the hostages must be here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Libya has helped mediate between Muslim guerrillas
and the Philippine government and helped build schools and mosques
in the impoverished south, home to the heavily Roman Catholic
country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, another separatist group fighting for an
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Innocent to Abduction  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. (AP) -- An ex-convict with a history of abusing
women pleaded innocent Friday to charges he abducted and molested
an 8-year-old girl in a beat-up car.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Dean Anderson, 39, faces life in prison if convicted on
the kidnapping and sexual assault charges. The victim was missing
for three days before she escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The case has prompted police to search for evidence linking
Anderson to the disappearance in December of another little
brown-haired Vallejo girl, 7-year-old Xiana Fairchild.
</P>
<P>
   Police are also trying to reconstruct his movements while out of
prison, to discover possible links to other similar missing child
cases in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very somber and I think he's actually shocked at the
misrepresentations of his prior record and the efforts to link him
to almost every unsolved lost child case in the western United
States,'' said deputy public defender Mark Roelke.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was considering seeking a gag order in hopes of
reducing the negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's prior record includes a long history of abusing women
and girls. He served time for kidnapping a woman in 1991 and was
paroled in August 1995. He returned to prison four times thereafter
for parole violations -- including exposing himself to two children
and locking a woman in a room after she refused to have sex with
him.

Judge Was Source for Grand Jury Story
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray confirmed today that he has
impaneled a grand jury to resume investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal as
a federal judge said he inadvertently released that information a day earlier.
Appellate Court Judge Richard D. Cudahy, one of three judges on the panel that
supervises Ray, said in a statement that he disclosed the information. ''The
judge inadvertently referred to the existence of a newly-empaneled grand jury,''
Cudahy's statement said. Democrats criticized the timing of the legal

Putin Defends Sub Crisis Handling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Responding to criticism over his handling of the Russian
submarine sinking, President Vladimir Putin said today that rescue efforts swung
into action almost immediately after the disaster. ''It became clear that the
military had an extraordinary situation on their hands,'' Putin said of the
sequence of events when the submarine failed to appear on Aug. 12. ''At once, I
would like to underline at once, immediately all the necessary measures were
taken.'' Putin has been criticized for failing to cancel his vacation. The
nuclear-powered Kursk and 118 crewmen remain trapped at the sea bottom, 350 feet
below the surface of the Barents' Arctic waters. All rescue attempts have been
unsuccessful due to powerful currents and poor visibility.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having stepped back from their threat to break off
contract talks, negotiators for 87,000 striking Verizon Communications telephone
workers expressed optimism today that a revised company proposal could end a
two-week strike. The stepped-up bargaining came as Verizon reported its first
major system outage since the strike began. ''We're going in the right
direction,'' said Jeff Miller of the Communications Workers of America, the
larger of two unions negotiating to replace contracts that expired Aug. 6. He
said the unions were ''beginning to see more substantive bargaining'' on key

Poll Site: Race Tighter After DNC

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Early poll evidence hints that Al Gore may be off to a
good start winning over voters. A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll released
today had Gore within 5 points of Republican George W. Bush, 45 percent to 40
percent. Bush had an 18-point lead in the tracking poll after the GOP
convention, and was 11 points up as recently as yesterday. At the beginning of
the week, four of 10 said they didn't like Gore personally, but that had been
trimmed slightly by week's end. ''Democrats clearly had a successful
convention,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who conducts the bipartisan
poll with Republican pollster Ed Goeas. ''Everything suggests the race has

offered $100 each for New York and California, which together have 87 of the 270
electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Federal and state laws prohibit

He was at 11-under 133, tying the 36-hole mark for relation to par last set by

''You're not going to have it every day,'' he said. ''I didn't have it

<HEADLINE> Convention over, Clinton back to campaigning  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - Senate Candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton hit the campaign trail again Friday with President Clinton
and daughter Chelsea in tow.
</P>
<P>
   In a 26-minute speech to more than 1,000 Democrats in a small
skating rink in Saranac Lake, the first lady said her campaign to
date had ''been a joy.'' But Clinton told her supporters ''the real
hard work is only beginning now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first lady finished speaking, President Clinton told
the crowd ''my family has a new candidate and my party, as of last
night, has a new leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Clinton's vice president for eight years, and Joseph
Lieberman make up the Democratic ticket in November's presidential
race against Republicans George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was ''looking forward to an election where
I can support a man I believe in for president, a man I believe in
for vice president and a woman I think will be one of the great
United States senators of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more-than nine minute speech at the Saranac Lake Civic
Center, Clinton told Democrats from Clinton, Essex and Franklin
counties that he was ''coming back to where you are. I'm going to
be a citizen activist.''
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded the crowd of the success Democrats have had in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank all the people of New York state for voting
twice in 1992 and 1996 for Bill Clinton and Al Gore,'' the
president said. ''I want to say a particular thank you for 1996
when we carried 52 of the state's (62) counties, including
Franklin, Essex and Clinton. Now that we know you can do it, I hope
you'll do the same thing for Hillary and Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic Democrats paid $25 each for a barbecue and to
listen to the president and first lady. The money raised went to
the local Democratic party organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' appearance came as they began a three-day visit to
the Adirondack Mountains, a trip that started with some controversy
over a hotel booking the White House Travel Office made and then
withdrew when it was discovered it conflicted with a wedding
reception.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Heather Lee had booked the ballroom at the Holiday
Inn in Auburn for the Sept. 2 reception in August 1999. But on
Wednesday they got a phone call from the hotel: ''We've got a
problem,'' said an Inn employee.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn had apparently told the White House Travel
Office that part of the ballroom would be available for a press
room setup during a potential visit by President Clinton and his
wife, expected to be in the Finger Lakes region to visit the State
Fair as they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked,'' said Lee, 24, of Auburn. ''Of all the people
getting married, why is this happening to me, two weeks before my
wedding?''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lee, Heather's father, said the family had already paid
about $8,000 in a down payment to secure the entire facility to
accommodate 220 guests when they were told they may have only
two-thirds of it.
</P>
<P>
   The family's fears were assuaged Friday, when the White House
withdrew its request and the hotel decided to give Lee the entire
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lee, who is not registered in any political party, said
his family was upset with the hotel, not the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Sarah Gegenheimer said the Travel Office
was not aware that there was a wedding reception planned for Sept.
2 at the Holiday Inn in Auburn, about 30 miles west of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as they were made aware that there was a wedding
planned, they immediately withdrew the request,'' Gegenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, Clinton's Republican opponent, Rep. Rick
Lazio, attacked the first lady over the issue of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio claimed Clinton's failed health care initiative would have
denied mammograms to women younger than 50 and would have allowed
mammograms every other year instead of annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only one candidate in this race that was out there
that voted to assure that women who are 40 and over could have
access to mammography screening, mammograms, only one,'' Lazio said
after touring the National Women's Rights Historical Park Museum in
Seneca Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Lazio's vote to
abolish a Suffolk County office that provided an early breast
cancer detection program and his support of the 1995 budget that
cut Medicare by $270 billion showed his hypocrisy on the issue.
Wolfson also said the 1993 health care initiative championed by
Clinton would have provided mammograms to at-risk women under 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio's press release is a joke,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the Clintons planned to spend a quiet weekend in Lake
Placid, site of the 1980 and 1932 Winter Olympics, after the Friday
night event. Saturday, they'll celebrate the president's 54th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the first lady was to be back on the campaign trail
with an afternoon visit to a Polish festival in Cheektowaga near
Buffalo. Lazio is also expected to attend the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady found herself in some hot water with Adirondack
residents last year after an unidentified adviser told the New York
Daily News the Clintons would never vacation in the
''fly-infested'' Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has made several campaign swings through the
Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp tried to remind New Yorkers Friday of the black
fly comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope she finds the place without trouble and that she can
steer clear of the black flies or any other troublesome New York
state insects she may not be familiar with,'' Lazio campaign
spokesman Dan McLagan said.

<HEADLINE> Woods Takes PGA Championship Lead  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Only the cast of challengers has changed.
Not that Tiger Woods even noticed.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes locked on a third consecutive major, Woods tied the
36-hole scoring record in the PGA Championship on Friday with an
emotionless 5-under 67 to take a one-stroke lead over unheralded
Scott Dunlap into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Woods holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th and extended his
streak to 13 rounds of par or better in the majors. He was at
11-under 133, tying the 36-hole mark for relation to par last set
by Mark O'Meara and Ernie Els in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's a better player than I was,'' Jack Nicklaus
conceded after two days of playing with the man whose sole purpose
in golf is to break his majors.
</P>
<P>
   Woods already has won the career Grand Slam. Now, he is two
rounds away from joining Ben Hogan as the only players to win three
professional majors in one season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's won more majors than I've made cuts in,'' said Dunlap,
who had a 68 and went 12 holes at rain-softened Valhalla Golf Club
before giving up the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That just about sizes up the rest of the players trying to catch
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the next dozen behind him as the second round was wrapping
up, only 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III knows what it's like to
win a major. Love hasn't won a tournament of any kind in over two
years, and he didn't do himself any favors on the last two holes.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to edge closer to Woods, he bogeyed the last two
holes -- the 18th in near darkness -- for a 69 to finish at 137.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Funk, a five-time winner but never close in the biggest
tournaments, birdied the last two holes for a 68 and was at 137. He
was joined by J.P. Hayes (68), whose only PGA Tour victory came two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another stroke behind was Bob May, who finally got his PGA Tour
card this year after four years on the European tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we're scared of Tiger. We're amazed at Tiger,''
Funk said. ''He has taken the game to a whole new level that nobody
has ever seen. He is a special one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Woods cares who is chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone else looks at him, and you can just tell that he's
not looking at anybody else,'' Hayes said. ''It's just Tiger and
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   He destroyed the field at Pebble Beach, where he became the
first player to win the U.S. Open in double digits under par (12).
Ditto for St. Andrews, where he became the first player in major
championship history to finish 19 under.
</P>
<P>
   He set the record in the Masters three years ago with an
18-under 270. The only major in which he doesn't own the scoring
record is the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Give him time. Like two more days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing with majors ... the better plays relish those
moments,'' Dunlap said. ''It's not that their games are that much
better, it's that they are so much better in that situation. And
that's why Tiger will be so difficult to beat. That's what he lives
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA record is 17 under set by Steve Elkington and Colin
Montgomerie in 1995 at Riviera, where Elkington won in a playoff.
Woods needs only two more rounds in the 60s, which doesn't seem
like too much ask because he has done that his last seven rounds in
major championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''My game is coming around,'' he said. ''I'm starting to hit
more solid shots every day. If you can keep managing your game, you
never know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a pretty good idea.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third straight major in which Woods has led after 36
holes -- by six strokes in the U.S. Open and three strokes in the
British Open. Woods joked that such a small margin at Valhalla must
mean that ''I'm getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   His only mistake was a three-putt on the 17th for his only
bogey, which dropped him into a tie with Dunlap. Woods responded
with a bunker shot to 18 feet and a putt that capped off an
emotional scene on the 18th.	   Playing in his final PGA, Nicklaus nearly holed
a sand wedge for
eagle that might have enabled him to make the cut. He finished with
a birdie for a 1-under 71, only the third time he has broken par
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just played brilliantly,'' Nicklaus said. ''He can control
the golf course. He made the golf course look like a pitch-and-putt
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Appleby, who missed eight straight cuts in the majors
until breaking the streak in the British Open, had a 69 and was at
139.
</P>
<P>
   Els, among those who suffered late Thursday afternoon on baked
out greens and a torturously slow pace, had a 68. All that got him
was within nine strokes of Woods, and his best chance might be to
rally for another runner-up finish in a major.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson again failed to take advantage of the par 5s --
only 1 under on them through two rounds -- and was among those at
140. Masters champion Vijay Singh missed the cut for the first time
since the 1999 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after play ended Thursday night with 18 players
still on the course, a violent thunderstorm dumped 3 inches of rain
on Valhalla that delayed the start of the round by an hour and
again forced suspension of the round because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven players will have to finish the second round Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the rain drastically softened the course,
making it play longer but also allowing the pins to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, vintage conditions for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''A guy like Tiger, this is right up his alley,'' Els said. ''He
can really pull away from the field and play his normal game.''
</P>
<P>
   Others made their moves, just not the players anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was the first to give an indication of the low scoring. He
chipped in for birdie on the third hole, made a couple of
30-footers and stumbled only when he fired over the flag into the
rough on the 18th, taking a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   He held the lead at 137 -- for just more than hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap made a couple of scrambling pars and birdied No. 3 to
catch him and slowly built on a solid round. But Hayes is not the
name whose Dunlap sought out on the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   Woods teed off a short time after Dunlap, and the only question
was how long it would take him to assume the lead. Woods missed
only one fairway and hit every green on the front nine, going out
in 4-under 32 and leading alone for the first time in the
tournament when Dunlap bogeyed the 12th from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap is holding out hope that a PGA tradition will continue.
No one has repeated as champion in 73 years, and 10 of the last 12
champions won their first major in the PGA. And he has some
experience playing with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   They were paired on the weekend at Congressional in the 1997
U.S. Open, where Woods finished 10 strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen so many people on a golf course in my entire
life,'' Dunlap recalled. ''I guess tomorrow will be a similar
situation. But it wasn't on the line like it will be now.''

<HEADLINE> Governor Abandons Public Funding  </HEADLINE>
By WILSON RING
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Gov. Howard Dean on Friday abandoned
public funding for his re-election campaign, saying he couldn't
take the chance he would be outspent 4-1 by his Republican
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly financed campaigns were part of strict campaign finance
reform legislation championed by Dean, who signed it into law in
1997. Much of the law was overturned last week by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, a Democrat, said he would spend as much money as it takes
to counter what he called the ''fear-mongering'' campaign of likely
opponent Ruth Dwyer. ''I am not going to fight this campaign with
one hand tied behind my back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said that if re-elected he would work with the Legislature
to correct flaws in the law. ''I regret this,'' said Dean. ''I
believe in public funding of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized as ''hateful'' comments Dwyer made Thursday on a
radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed the National Education Association -- the
union that represents most Vermont teachers -- was promoting the
''homosexual agenda.'' Dwyer also said she didn't think Vermont
needed a hate crimes law because such crimes could be prosecuted
under other statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of subtexts in this campaign and I don't like
them,'' Dean said. ''It's about fear mongering and picking on
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer was in Maine for a political fund-raiser and not available
for comment. Her campaign manager, Kathleen Summers, said Dean's
comments showed he was running scared.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like somebody who has some competition and doesn't
know how to handle it,'' Summers said. ''This is a governor who has
abandoned what has supposedly been a staple of his policy, which is
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The law limited campaign contributions and spending and offered
public financing to candidates for governor and lieutenant
governor. It also targets so-called soft money by limiting indirect
contributions and out-of-state contributions to 25 percent of a
candidate's total campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive Party gubernatorial candidate Anthony Pollina, the
only candidate now using public funding, criticized Dean's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not surprised. In some way it shows his true colors,''
Pollina said. ''Ultimately, it's a victory for big money and bad
for average citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Supreme Court overturns conviction of former gang member  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The Alabama Supreme Court on Friday
overturned the conviction of a former New York street gang member
who had been sentenced to death for a 1992 murder at an Avondale
game room.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Griffin was convicted of capital murder in the slaying of
Christopher Lynn Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said Griffin served as ''director of security''
for the New York street gang 142nd Lynch Mob Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men were initially arrested in connection with the
killing. Anthony Embry pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced
to 20 years in prison, while Falanda Miles was tried and acquitted
by a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The case remained closed until April 1996, when Griffin pleaded
guilty in federal court in New York to violations of federal
anti-racketeering law. As part of that plea, Griffin stated that he
had participated in Davis' death.
</P>
<P>
   Embry was then cleared of the crime, and Griffin was charged
with murder in Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, however, Griffin claimed that he had lied to the
federal court to receive favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's lawyers argued to the state Supreme Court that they
were not allowed to present an adequate defense, because the trial
court did not admit Embry's plea and Miles' indictment into
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Embry's plea, along with the evidence of the arrests and the
exoneration, is some of the strongest evidence Griffin could
present to the jury to prove that someone else committed the
crime,'' Justice Gorman Houston wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The court voted 6-3 to reverse Griffin's conviction. Justices
Ralph Cook, Harold See, and Jean Brown dissented.

<HEADLINE> Extinct Tribe Reappears in Amazon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Indians belonging to a tribe believed
to have been decimated 80 years ago have been located in the
jungles of western Amazon state of Acre, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Indian Bureau said some 250 Indians of the Naua
tribe were ''rediscovered'' living in the Serra do Divisor National
Park, some 2,000 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthropologists have studied the group and have determined
that they are definitely Nauas, a tribe given as lost in 1920,''
said Antonio Regis Moraes, a Funai spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said experts believed the Nauas, who once occupied large
parts of the state, had been decimated by disease and clashes with
rival tribes and workers on rubber plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials trying to resettle people living in the 2,200-acre
national park discovered the tribe when they came across a woman
''who said she was a Naua,'' Moraes said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the woman told officials that the Nauas should not be
forced to leave because they have always lived in the region.
Although the government does not want anyone to live in the park,
Funai may create a Naua reservation inside the national park,
Moraes said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nauas in Acre were ethnically related to tribes in
neighboring Peru and Bolivia, said Moraes, citing anthropologists
and other Indian experts.

<HEADLINE> Ilitch's Medical Tests Delay Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Medical tests on Detroit Red Wings owner Mike
Ilitch have delayed the $12.3 million arbitration case with
defenseman Uwe Krupp for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing, scheduled for Thursday in Detroit before arbitrator
Lawrence Holden, was adjourned so Ilitch could undergo tests at a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ilitch was not listed as a witness in the case but wanted to be
part of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a very involved, very concerned owner,'' team lawyer Bob
Batterman said. ''He thinks, and I think, that the club is being
taken advantage of, and he wants to be involved in taking care of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Detroit suspended Krupp -- eight months after
he sustained a back injury that prevented him from playing hockey.
The Red Wings said Krupp endangered his recovery by dogsledding two
weeks after being hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Krupp dispute the argument and say Krupp's
dogsledding was well known to the Red Wings, who made it the cover
story in the December 1998 issue of Inside Hockeytown, the official
team magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Krupp's position is that he was injured while playing, which
obligates the Wings to honor the $12.3 million that remains on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ilitch will not be admitted to the hospital for the tests,
spokesman Al Sebastian told the Detroit Free Press. The newspaper
did not give the nature of Ilitch's health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a completely normal thing; everything is fine. It's no
big deal,'' Sebastian said.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Women's Hoops Player Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ayesha Rembert, a reserve forward on the UCLA
women's basketball team, was sentenced to 90 days in jail Friday as
part of three years of formal probation for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Rembert, 22, pleaded no contest last month to one count of
burglary and two counts of theft. She was arrested and charged Jan.
19 after the burglary of a neighbor's residence the previous month.
Authorities said a computer, jewelry and other items were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was imposed by Airport Branch Superior Court Judge
Stephanie Sautner, who also ordered Rembert to make restitution to
the victim. That amount will be determined by the probation
department.
</P>
<P>
   Rembert, suspended from the UCLA team after being charged,
played in 10 games for the Bruins as a junior and averaged 1.0
points and 1.0 rebounds. She appeared in 28 games as a reserve in
1998-99, including two NCAA tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Rembert's father, Freddie Goss, played on UCLA's 1965 NCAA
championship team.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia End Arms Talks Round  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Top U.S. and Russian arms negotiators Friday ended
a round of talks aimed at making further cuts in nuclear arsenals
and improving safeguards against triggering a nuclear war,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides said the three days of talks ended as
scheduled at midday, but declined to say whether any progress had
been made.
</P>
<P>
   A key goal of the session was to build on commitments by
President Clinton and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to cooperate on
strategic stability, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin said in Okinawa, Japan, last month that they
planned within a year to set up a joint U.S.-Russia center to
exchange data from early warning systems in the event of a missile
launch.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva session was to work on implementing the commitment,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda was a second project, proposed by the Clinton
administration, on ways to advise each other that a test missile or
a space rocket has been launched without setting off alarm bells in
the other capital.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were the latest in a series that began a year ago and
have evolved into work on a third Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
or START III, to cut down on long-range nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also is trying to persuade Russia to amend the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit deployment of a shield
against limited missile launches by ''rogue'' nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been reluctant to change the ABM treaty on
grounds that it is a keystone of the global effort to reduce the
risk of nuclear war.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Love got lost in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III tried to squeeze in a full round Friday in the
PGA Championship and it might have cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Already reeling from a bogey at No. 17, Love and playing
partners Paul Azinger and Nick Price elected to play No. 18 in
near-darkness. Love made a second bogey to finish the day with a 69
that left him four strokes behind leader Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Love hit his third shot, a bullhorn sounded,
signaling play had been suspended for the second straight day. But
with the group ahead waving them onto the green, Love's threesome
hit their approaches into 18. Unfortunately, he three-putted from
25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm at 7 under and not real happy about it,'' said Love, the
1997 champion.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some consolation. ''It's nice not to have to come
out and finish and then wait until late to play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven players, including Notah Begay, will finish their second
rounds early Saturday morning. Begay was 4-under with Nos. 17 and
18 left to play.
</P>

<P>
   OUCH!: A freak injury forced Rocco Mediate to withdraw from
the PGA Championship on Friday, virtually ending his chances of
making the Presidents Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate, the winner of last week's Buick Open, was injured
before his first round Thursday morning when a chair he was sitting
in outside the clubhouse at Valhalla Golf Club collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from his management group, Gaylord
Sports Management, Mediate injured his right wrist, right shoulder,
neck and lower back when the chair broke and caused him to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Stiff and extremely sore, he played the opening round and
struggled to a 5-over-par 77.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rocco's win at the Buick Open placed him on the threshold of
making the Presidents Cup team, something that had been a career
goal of his since the event began,'' said Steve Loy, president and
CEO of Mediate's management group.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when we all knew Rocco was at a career high, and the
healthiest he could possibly be both physically and mentally, we
find it incredible that a major championship run by the PGA of
America would be the setting for something like this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate did not comment on the incident Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was a sharp turn from the good fortune Mediate
encountered at the Buick. He never led, then birdied the last hole
to tie leader Chris Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Perry's first bogey in 29 holes gave Mediate his
fourth career victory.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ALSO GONE: Several other prominent players withdrew from the
tournament before their second rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw, who shot an 83 Thursday, dropped out without
giving a reason. Tom Lehman also dropped out after shooting an
opening-round 82. Lehman, who had knee surgery Aug. 7, cited pain
in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DALY MELTDOWN: Continuing a trend in recent major tournaments,
John Daly threw up some big numbers and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, the 1991 PGA champion, kept ahead of the field on Thursday
when his 74 was a few tenths of a stroke better than average. And
he held it together through the front nine Friday, playing even
par.
</P>
<P>
   But the wheels started rattling on the back with a double bogey
on 13 and triple bogeys on 17 and 18 to finish with a 10-over 82.
</P>
<P>
   Daly turned in his score card and quickly left the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   GUTSY MOVE: Give Hal Sutton extra points for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The 1983 PGA champion completed his second round despite a
painful right hip that made it difficult to walk and swing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was bothering me all day (Thursday), and they worked on it
for three hours before I played,'' said Sutton, 42. ''I've had
tendinitis in my left ankle and it has been killing me. So I've
been favoring it and probably walking funny on it, so that's
causing my right hip to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a birdie at the 10th hole, Sutton couldn't even bend
down to remove his ball from the cup. Instead, he motioned for his
caddie to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to go that back nine at all,'' he said. ''That
would have been a good spot to quit after walking up that ninth
fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimacing as he traversed Valhalla's trademark hills and swales
for another 2&AMP;frac12; hours, Sutton gamely finished his round with a blast
out of the sand on No. 18 within 6 inches for a tap-in par.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this wasn't the PGA, I wouldn't have even started,'' he
said. ''But my dad taught me not to quit a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton shot 75 on Friday, missing the cut at 5-over 149.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ASPIRIN, PLEASE: Colin Mongomerie shot an even-par 72 Friday
despite a second day of painful headaches brought about by hours in
the intense heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hot weather gives me headaches and being out in the sun for
six hours (Thursday) certainly did not help,'' said Montgomerie,
who stood at 2 over at the tournament's midway point. ''I had
trouble focusing on the ball on the greens. I took some tablets on
the 14th and they worked for a short while, but then the headaches
came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, one of Europe's finest players who has yet to win a
PGA Tour event, said he was frustrated by his scoring problems on
the course's four par 5s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've played the par 5s 1 over, and that's why I'm over par for
the tournament,'' said Montgomerie, who has 24 career PGA European
Tour victories. ''I can reach every par 5, apart from the 18th
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've only made three birdies in two days, and that's not
enough. You can't compete having just three birdies.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Gets $67.56M in Public Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman -- the Democratic
presidential and vice presidential nominees -- will receive $67.56
million in public funds for the general election, the Federal
Election Commission said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman requested the money after receiving their
party's nomination at the convention this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under election law, major party nominees are entitled to federal
funding for the general election if they agree to national spending
limits. They may spend no more than the public funding, plus a
combined total $50,000 from their personal money.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates may also raise money from supporters for legal
and accounting expenses, subject to FEC rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney will
also receive $67.56 million in federal money. Their request was
approved on Aug. 4, following the Republican Party's convention in
Philadelphia.

Babbitt Vows to Aid Firefighters
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- With 1.1 million acres ablaze across the West, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said today that firefighters have a blank check to draw
on the federal Treasury. But he said no more manpower can be assigned because
every available fire crew supervisor is already on the job, including several
dozen from Australia and New Zealand. Sending in more troops, for example, would
be futile if no one is trained to supervise their efforts. He said it's up to
managers to use existing forces and equipment where they will do the most good.
The money from the Treasury can be used to cover overtime, lodging and
transportation for crews.

Putin Defends Submarine Handling

   MOSCOW (AP) -- After sharp criticism over his handling of the Russian
submarine sinking, President Vladimir Putin said today that rescue efforts swung
into action almost immediately after the disaster. ''At once, I would like to
underline at once, immediately all the necessary measures were taken,'' Putin
said of the sequence of events after the submarine failed to appear on Aug. 12.
The nuclear-powered Kursk and 118 crewmen remain trapped at the sea bottom, 350
feet below the surface of the Barents' Arctic waters. All rescue attempts have
been unsuccessful.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having stepped back from their threat to break off
contract talks, negotiators for 87,000 striking Verizon Communications telephone
workers expressed optimism today that a revised company proposal could end a
two-week strike. The stepped-up bargaining came as Verizon reported its first
major system outage since the strike began. ''We're going in the right
direction,'' said Jeff Miller of the Communications Workers of America, the
larger of two unions negotiating to replace contracts that expired Aug. 6. He
said the unions were ''beginning to see more substantive bargaining'' on key
union concerns, including mandatory overtime and the movement of work.

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his companion
of seven years, Calista Bisek, were married tonight in a private ceremony under
a tent in a hotel courtyard. About 150 friends and relatives attended the
ceremony at the Morrison House hotel in this Washington suburb. Gingrich, in
tails, walked smiling into the small courtyard to the strains of Pachelbel's
Canon played by a string quintet. The service was conducted by former House
chaplain the Rev. James Ford. It was the third marriage for Gingrich, 57, and

   DENVER (AP) -- A man was sentenced today to seven months in prison for
mailing threats to Columbine High School and to the sheriff who led the
investigation of the shootings there. He was also sentenced to three years
probation, including seven months of home detention with the requirement that he
stay off the Internet. Arthur Leon Thomas, 19, must turn himself in to
authorities by Sept. 21 in Houston, his home. Authorities said Thomas mailed a
threat to Columbine that said: ''Death for Columbine. RIP. .... I'm the ghost of
Eric Harris.'' Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people and then committed
suicide at the high school April 20, 1999.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- His eyes locked on a third consecutive major, Tiger
Woods tied the 36-hole scoring record in the PGA Championship today with an
emotionless 5-under 67 to take a one-stroke lead over unheralded Scott Dunlap
into the weekend. Woods holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th and extended his
streak to 13 rounds of par or better in the majors. He was at 11-under 133,
tying the 36-hole mark for relation to par last set by Mark O'Meara and Ernie
Els in 1995. ''I think he's a better player than I was,'' Jack Nicklaus conceded
after two days of playing with the man whose sole purpose in golf is to break
his majors.

<HEADLINE> Mag 7 Shine at Gymnastics Trials  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Forget age and forget rust. What's left of the
Magnificent Seven is still, well, magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the youngsters wobbling, bobbling and struggling
under the pressure in the first round of the Olympic trials Friday
night, the old gals from 1996 showed just why they have those gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Chow did some of the toughest tricks around and made them
look as easy as the stuff done in ninth-grade gym class. Despite
training seriously for only three months, Dominique Dawes was
solid. And Shannon Miller, competing in her first full meet, is
still very much in the running for her third Olympics after a
high-flying uneven bars routine.
</P>
<P>
   Finals are Sunday afternoon. Weighted scores from trials (60
percent) and last month's U.S. Gymnastics Championships (40
percent) will be combined and used to rank the gymnasts. A
committee headed by Bela Karolyi will then pick the six-woman
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray was the only member of ''Generation Next'' that came
through. The national champion was coolly efficient in every event,
finishing first with 54.081 points. Her uneven bars routine, as
always, were impressive. While other gymnasts use their hands to
pirouette on the bars, Ray took both of her hands off the bars and
flipped around.
</P>
<P>
   She only had one score under a 9.5, and that was a 9.499 on
vault.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the remaining members of the Mag Seven who captured
everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, who struggled in the finals at nationals, got things
started with her first routine, the uneven bars. She showed the
same form that won her a silver medal in the event in Atlanta,
moving fluidly between the bars with tricky releases and giants
swings.
</P>
<P>
   She scored a 9.712, her best mark of the night, and was off and
rolling. On the balance beam, she did a back somersault with a
twist, landing squarely on the 4-inch apparatus without the
slightest wobble.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, who was in sixth after nationals, moved all the way up to
second for the night, and is in third place overall with 53.045.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes was in third place for the night until her last routine of
the night, the floor exercise. She earned a 9.137 and dropped to
sixth for the night, but that's still good enough to put her
seventh overall.
</P>
<P>
   Miller competed only one routine at nationals, the uneven bars,
before withdrawing because of a nagging hairline crack in her right
leg. She still doesn't look in top Shannon Miller form, but she's
close.
</P>
<P>
   Her uneven bars routine was almost flawless, and she matched
Chow's 9.712. She had a slight wobble on the balance beam, but some
of her other moves -- like the split she does while upside down,
balancing on her hands -- drew ''Oohs'' and ''Aahs'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As she nailed her landing, Nunno threw his hands up in the air
and screamed ''Yeah!'' He ran to the side of the podium and wrapped
Miller in a bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest trouble came on the vault, where she landed on her
backside with such a resounding ''WHUMP!'' it made Karolyi wince.
But she got up and, after a long talk with coach Steve Nunno,
nailed her second vault.
</P>
<P>
   While the three remaining members of the Mag Seven were
cruising, most of the youngsters were faltering. Kristen Maloney
got into trouble on her first event, the uneven bars, when she
couldn't get all the way up to a handstand and earned only a 9.075.
She regrouped, though, and kept her No. 2 place overall.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Atler had the scariest fall of the night. Atler, who
dropped to sixth overall, appeared to slip on her dismount off the
beam and landed flat on her back.

<HEADLINE> Fox Sports Net Passes on Irvin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Irvin, the former NFL star arrested last
week at an apartment where law officers say they found marijuana
and other drugs, will not join Fox Sports Net as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ''After several lengthy conversations between Fox Sports Net and
Michael Irvin, both parties agree that given the events of last
week, it would be imprudent for Michael to begin his career as an
analyst on 'NFL This Morning' at this time,'' the network said in a
release Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The network said the show will be hosted by Chris Myers, with
analysis from Marv Levy, Jackie Slater and Chris Spielman.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net officials reached by The Associated Press
declined to discuss the announcement further. Irvin, the star
receiver who retired from the Dallas Cowboys this year, could not
immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was arrested Aug. 9 at an apartment where law officers say
they found less than two ounces of marijuana along with ecstasy
pills. He was arrested on investigation of misdemeanor marijuana
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Irvin and another woman were arrested at the
north Dallas apartment, members of a drug task force announced they
would not seek marijuana charges against Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   A drug task force had a warrant for the apartment's tenant, who
was not there. Instead, Irvin and the tenant's sister were at the
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment tenant Ronda Adham was arrested by task force agents
on Aug. 10 in a Dallas suburb. She was indicted on federal drug
trafficking charges in 1999 and had violated conditions of her
pretrial release.
</P>
<P>
   Adham was part of a group accused of selling the heroin that
killed former Dallas lineman Mark Tuinei last year, according to
published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has insisted he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
and the drugs were not his.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Irvin pleaded no contest to felony cocaine possession
in exchange for four years of deferred probation, a $10,000 fine
and dismissal of misdemeanor marijuana possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL suspended Irvin for five games. He finished his deferred
probation on the charge just before he announced his retirement in
July.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts Near Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A newly reawakened volcano erupted Friday on a
small island near Tokyo, spewing a massive column of gray-black ash
five miles into the air and forcing more than 2,000 people from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest eruption from the 2,600-foot Mount Oyama,
which dominates the resort island of Miyake, since the volcano
ended a 17-year slumber and began stirring last month. Though no
injuries or damage were reported, ash and steam rose into the sky
120 miles south of Tokyo on a day when nerves in Japan's capital
were already frayed by a series of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Miyake, which is home to about 4,000 people,
ordered 2,162 residents to evacuate to designated shelters,
including a school gymnasium, local official Yoshiko Numata said.
The evacuation came just eight days after 634 people on the
22-square-mile island were forced to leave their homes temporarily
following a smaller eruption.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuated residents began to return home Saturday, said aid
worker Norio Ooki.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility was poor Saturday morning because of cloudy weather,
but Oyama was believed to be still sending up white steam, Ooki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's was the fifth and most spectacular in a series of
eruptions that began July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was on a different scale,'' said Tadashi Sakuma, who was
helping to coordinate the island's relief efforts. ''There was lots
of ash and some cinders too.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Meteorological Agency said rising underground magma was
probably to blame. It warned that volcanic activity on Miyake may
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency also urged caution because heavy rain
was forecast for Saturday, raising the specter of mudslides racing
down the volcano's ash-covered slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake is one of the largest of the Izu islands, a chain of
volcanic islands off Tokyo that stretch 335 miles from north to
south. Seismic activity has been intensifying in the area this
week, and an observatory on Miyake had recorded almost 600 tremors
since Friday afternoon, when Mount Oyama came to life.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano last erupted in 1983. Five hundred homes were
destroyed when lava flowed over its western flank, though timely
evacuations prevented any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Japan, one person was injured by a moderate tremor
that rattled central Tokyo early Friday morning, and several
islands near Miyake were struck by two more powerful quakes that
caused landslides.
</P>
<P>
   The only person injured by Friday's seismic and volcanic
activity was a 62-year-old woman in Tokyo. She broke her shoulder
when she was jolted off her sofa by the magnitude 4.0 earthquake
that struck the city during the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   That temblor was followed by two more powerful quakes, with
preliminary magnitudes of 6.0 and 4.9, near the Izu islands. There
were no reports of injuries, though the tremors triggered some
mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said the Tokyo earthquake was not
related to the quakes or eruption in the Izu islands.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth earthquake -- also not related to the activity in the
Izus -- was recorded off Japan's eastern coast late Friday. The
magnitude 5 tremor was barely felt in Ibaraki and other states
north of Tokyo, however, as the focal point was about 12 miles
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Quakes of magnitude 5 are considered strong, and those of 6 or
higher can cause severe damage near their epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most seismically active countries, Japan has
been jolted by a series of earthquakes and the eruptions of three
different volcanoes in recent months. Tens of thousands of tremors
have hit the Izu chain since the end of June. On July 1, a man was
killed by a landslide following an earthquake on the island of
Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Though injuries and material damage have been light so far in
the Izus, the continuing seismic and volcanic activity has hit
residents where it hurts most: their wallets. Summer tourism and
fishing are the main sources of income on most of the islands.

<HEADLINE> Albright Praises Bolivia Drug Fight  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
praised Bolivia's efforts to get its farmers out of the cocaine
business and promised $110 million in U.S. aid for alternative
development.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with President Hugo Banzer Suarez and other
officials Friday during a three-hour stay. She later traveled to
Ecuador, her final stop on a five-day tour that also included
Argentina, Chile and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish to express my admiration for President Banzer and his
government's impressive efforts eliminate illegal coca by the year
2002,'' Albright said during a news conference. Coca leaves are
used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The visit also included discussions of Bolivian proposals to
eliminate U.S. duties on imported textiles from Bolivia to
compensate for the income lost as a result of the eradication of
nearly all the country's illegal coca.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia says the lifting of duties on textiles would bring in
$400 million to the Bolivian economy and create at least 30,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the issue of lifting duties is ''a complicated
problem in terms of trade relations with any country'' but said the
administration will work on it.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then flew to Ecuador, where she said the Clinton
administration would ask Congress for $15 million in additional aid
to help the small Andean nation handle any refugees displaced by
U.S.-funded anti-drug efforts in neighboring Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already approved $20 million for Ecuador as part of
the $1.3-billion package designed to equip and train Colombian
forces to fight drugs and leftist rebels. U.S.-trained and equipped
troops are to take control of drug-growing areas so planes can
destroy crops by aerial spraying without being shot down by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Ecuador fear the effort will make Colombia's internal
strife spill over into their country.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Hideo Nomo returned from the disabled list to
allow two hits in seven innings, and Rich Becker hit a three-run
homer as the Detroit Tigers won their fifth straight, beating the
Oakland Athletics 10-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson homered and Damion Easley added two RBI doubles
for the Tigers, who have won eight of their last 10 to move to the
fringes of wild-card contention.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve homered for the Athletics, whose lead in the
wild-card race was cut to one game ahead of Boston. Detroit is six
games back.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo (5-10), activated before the game after going on the DL on
July 30 because of inflammation of his right hand, struck out eight
and walked one. He didn't allow a hit until Grieve's leadoff double
in the fifth and also gave up Grieve's homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo supported by a 17-hit attack that included three hits each
from Becker, Juan Gonzalez and Brad Ausmus. Becker scored three
times for the Tigers, who have scored 81 runs in their last eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson (13-5) was rocked for six runs -- five earned -- and
seven hits in just 3 2-3 innings. Hudson had been 4-0 with a 1.86
ERA in four previous career starts against Detroit, including two
this year. But the Tigers were on him from the first inning, when
Higginson hit his 23rd homer for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Becker made it 4-0 with an opposite-field homer on a 3-0 pitch
in the second after Brad Ausmus' two-out infield single and a walk
to Jose Macias.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley hit an RBI double in the third, and Juan
Encarnacion's sacrifice fly finished Hudson in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez doubled off Omar Olivares in the fifth and scored on
Easley's double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez added an RBI groundout and Easley a run-scoring double
to make it 9-0 in the sixth. Becker scored on Billy McMillon's
single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hudson has a 10.80 ERA (16 earned runs in 13 1-3 innings)
in three August starts. ... The Tigers placed RHP Doug Brocail on
the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Monday. Brocail, Detroit's
eighth-inning setup man for closer Todd Jones, has been bothered by
bone chips in his right elbow. ... Nomo won consecutive starts for
the first time since July 1999 with Milwaukee. ... Oakland has a
season-high, six-game road losing streak. .... Oakland committed
five errors, but only one of the runs was unearned.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago White Sox rookie pitcher Jon Garland left
Friday's game with a bruised right forearm after he was hit on the
right arm by a line drive by Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   Garland fell to the ground immediately. X-rays were negative and
the team said the rookie had a bruised forearm near his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The ball deflected off Garland and was retrieved by third
baseman Herbert Perry, who threw out McGriff at first. Tampa Bay
first base coach Jose Cardenal argued the call and was ejected by
second-base umpire Brian Runge.
</P>
<P>
   Garland left with a 4-1 lead. He gave up four hits, including
Gerald Williams' leadoff homer in the sixth, in 5 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Ole Miss Flag Ban  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY R. BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The University of Mississippi has the
legal right to ban spectators from waving Confederate flags at
campus athletic events, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the New Orleans court came three years after
Richard Barrett, a lawyer for the white supremacist Nationalist
Movement, sued over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers Jr. in 1999 ruled that the ban,
which limits Confederate flags in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, is a
reasonable limitation.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett claimed the ban violated his First Amendment Rights.
</P>
<P>
   University officials cited safety concerns for the ban, saying
the stick on the end of the flag could be considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit said it found nothing wrong with ''the
university defendants' game management policies, which prohibited
spectators from carrying sticks and large flags or banners into the
university's football stadium during athletic contests.''
</P>
<P>
   It also said Biggers' dismissal of the case ''was not an abuse
of discretion.'' The court did not get into the details of
Barrett's case.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said he will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is ironic that burning a flag is called free speech, but
waving it is not,'' Barrett said. ''I'm sticking in this ring until
I knock the flag haters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss officials adopted the stick flag policy in fall 1997,
weeks after former football coach Tommy Tuberville asked fans not
to wave Confederate flags at games. Tuberville said he didn't want
the flag associated with Ole Miss because of mixed perceptions of
its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss Chancellor Robert Khayat and members of the student
government were unavailable Friday for comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Umbrellas, alcoholic beverages and flags no larger than 12x14
inches also were part of the university's ban.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said in the lawsuit that he and two friends were
attempting to display a 3-inch by 5-inch Confederate battle flag
when they were ordered to stop.

<HEADLINE> Accused Scientist Passes Polygraph  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A fired nuclear scientist could help
someone build a bomb or help a country's nuclear weapons program if
he is released from jail, a federal prosecutor told a judge at a
bail hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hundreds of millions of people could be killed,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis said. ''The breadth of the
potential harm is so great that ... even a reduced risk is too
great to take that gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee is charged with illegally transferring top-secret
nuclear weapons files to unsecure computers and computer tapes at
Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis urged U.S. District Judge James Parker to again
refuse bail for Lee, who has been in custody since December. Lee,
60, could face life in prison if convicted of the 59 counts
involving the file transfers.
</P>
<P>
   He is not accused of espionage. Instead, the prosecution has
suggested Lee meant to use the files to help get a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Mark Holscher said: ''There is no evidence in
the record that Dr. Lee has the political motivation, the financial
motivation or the destructive intent'' to do anything harmful with
the material he is accused of downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said, however, that Lee was ''naive'' and had made some
stupid mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   After court adjourned Friday, the scientist's daughter, Alberta
Lee, said: ''I think the notion of my father having the intention
to kill hundreds of millions of people is completely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker indicated Friday afternoon that he would rule later,
possibly next week, on whether to grant bail. Holscher said $2.2
million in bond money has been assembled by Lee's family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-day hearing, including several hours of
closed-door sessions to consider classified information, the judge
went point by point through December's detention order, comparing
any new information in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Attorney John Cline said the material Lee allegedly
downloaded was not the ''crown jewels'' of American science. He
said the information could not be used to build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Cline added that the information was not even classified secret
by the government. He said such material is allowed to be mailed
through public mail.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, an FBI agent whose testimony was key in denying
bail to Lee said that the scientist passed non-FBI polygraph
examinations with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   However, Agent Robert Messemer said the polygraphs administered
by Wackenhut Corp. on behalf of the Department of Energy did not
follow guidelines accepted by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer said the FBI does not agree with the Wackenhut
polygraph outcome, even though they were double-checked by an
independent polygrapher and a polygraph supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer said under questioning by Holscher that he was aware
Lee had some of the highest possible polygraph scores for
credibility when Lee denied in 1998 ever passing secrets,
contacting anyone for the purpose of espionage or intending to harm
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, however, insisted on conducting its own polygraph
examination. Messemer said he believes Lee was ''deceptive'' during
the FBI examination. Holscher said the FBI questions were framed in
a manner that could rattle someone and make them seem deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer was also asked about contacts Lee had with Chinese
scientists in China in 1988. He said two high-ranking Chinese
nuclear officials visited Lee in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer said Lee did not mention the contact in a debriefing,
but Holscher said Lee included it on a written report. Holscher
said the discussion concerned information in the public domain
since 1969, so Lee did not consider it an approach for classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   But Messemer said Lee should have told the debriefer anyway. He
said it was significant because the scientists ranked so high in
China's nuclear establishment, and it would have been useful to
know what Lee was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer acknowledged Friday that during a March 7, 1999, FBI
interrogation, Lee was threatened with a potential death penalty if
he did not cooperate. Messemer said he was aware of the threat but
not present.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis objected that the defense implied Lee was
threatened with death if he didn't cooperate. Stamboulidis asked
Messemer if the interrogation implied Lee would be murdered if he
didn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I concluded he was not under any immediate threat of death if
he did not cooperate and he was free to leave at any time,'' the
agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Another FBI agent withdrew from the Lee investigation after the
interview, but Messemer said he could not confirm that she quit
over the death penalty issue. He said he understood the agent
withdrew because she became ill.

<P>
   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) -- Lawrence H. Cooke, who presided over the
unification of New York's courts as chief judge of the state's
highest court, died Thursday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Cooke was known as one of the more liberal
voices on the court. Decisions he wrote included those recognizing
due process rights and right to counsel of defendants under the
state constitution, which exceed those the federal courts had
recognized under the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He angered upstate judges in 1979 by transferring 242 of them
temporarily to reduce backlogs in downstate courts. In 1981, Cooke
removed 97 acting state Supreme Court justices in New York City
because of concerns over favoritism -- a move that was challenged by
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled the chief judge had exceeded his constitutional
authority.
</P>
<P>
   During Cooke's tenure as chief judge, the state was also in the
process of unifying New York's court system above the level of town
and village courts.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Ethel Eveline Beieler Gould, a teacher who won
national recognition for her volunteer work on behalf of seniors
and Hmong refugees, died Sunday after a fall. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Gould founded the Sno-Valley Senior Center, which she
established as an outgrowth of a hobby club.
</P>
<P>
   When her church sponsored a Hmong family in 1979, Gould helped
the refugees adjust to life in America and helped them win
acceptance from their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 President Reagan honored Gould with a President's
Volunteer Action Award Citation for more than 9,000 hours of
volunteer work with the senior center and Hmong families.
Grace Halsell:
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Grace Halsell, a journalist and author
known for disguising herself and then writing about the results,
died Wednesday from complications of multiple myeloma. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell worked at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram during World War
II. In the mid-1960s, she had a stint as a White House staff writer
for President Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the White House, Halsell wrote a best seller,
''Soul Sister,'' about her experiences disguised as a maid in
Harlem and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell later adopted the identity of a Navajo woman and worked
for a white family to write ''Bessie Yellowhair.''
</P>
<P>
   Halsell eventually wrote 13 books, including an autobiography,
''In Their Shoes,'' in 1996.
Hassen Mall:

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Judge Hassen Mall, South Africa's
first black acting judge who was at the forefront of efforts to
bring about racial reconciliation, died Friday after suffering from
a heart and kidney condition. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mall was a senior member of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, a body set up to probe apartheid-era crimes and give
victims a forum to tell of their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   He headed the commission's most controversial committee, which
heard amnesty applications from those who committed crimes
enforcing white rule and those trying to overthrow it.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment in 1988 as the country's first black acting
judge caused a stir within conservative legal circles.

</P>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Michael S. Reynolds, who wrote a
critically acclaimed five-volume biography of Ernest Hemingway,
died Aug. 12 of pancreatic cancer. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Reynolds wrote 10 books on Hemingway, who became his
life work after he discovered Hemingway's books as an undergraduate
at Rice University in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   His Hemingway biography is comprised of ''The Young Hemingway,''
published in 1987; ''Hemingway: The Paris Years,'' in 1989;
''Hemingway: The American Homecoming,'' in 1992; ''Hemingway: The
1930s,'' in 1997; and ''Hemingway: The Final Years,'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the editorial board of the Hemingway Review. He
also helped establish the Hemingway Society, which presents the
annual Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award for the best first work of
fiction published in the United States.
Milt Rosen:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Milt Rosen, who crafted one-liners for Milton
Berle, Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities and wrote books

</P>
<P>
   Among the books written or edited by Rosen were ''A Treasury of
Sports Quotes and Wisdom'' (1999) and ''The Second Book of
Insults'' (1985), which included the jibe ''She's not very
photogenic, especially in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen co-wrote the screenplay for the 1965 Doris Day movie ''Do
Not Disturb'' and wrote for TV series including ''CHiPs,'' and
''Mr. Novak.'' He and Robert Foster were nominated for a Mystery
Writers of America award in 1976 for a ''Kate McShane'' episode.
Dorothy Mae Taylor:
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Dorothy Mae Taylor, the first woman on the
City Council and the sponsor of a bitterly debated 1991 law banning
racial discrimination among Mardi Gras parade clubs, died Friday
following a long illness. She was between 68 and 72.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor served as a state representative in the early 1970s. She
was one of the first blacks elected to the Louisiana Legislature
and was the first black woman elected to serve there. In 1976, she
left the Legislature and became director of a health clinic. She
moved on to head the city's Department of Urban and Community
Affairs in 1984, then won her seat on the City Council in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   She attracted national attention with her challenge of
membership policies of the century-old, tradition-bound Carnival
''krewes'' that annually stage elaborate parades during the city's
pre-Lenten Mardi Gras season.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance forbade parade permits to organizations that
practiced discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion or
ancestry.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Capsule Reaches Russian Sub  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Exhausted Russian rescue workers in escape
capsules finally reached an escape hatch on a sunken Russian
submarine Friday, but the hatch was badly mangled and they failed
to get into the vessel sitting in the cold, black depths of the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia vowed to continue to try to reach the nuclear-powered
Kursk, and high-tech foreign rescue teams were expected to reach
the disaster Saturday afternoon. But mounting evidence that the
Kursk suffered massive damage darkened hopes that any of the 118
crewmen could still be alive after almost a week in the submarine's
shattered hulk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is extremely grave,'' said Adm. Vyacheslav
Popov, commander of Russia's Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk is lying at a sharp angle on the sea bottom, 350 feet
below the surface of the Barents' Arctic waters. Despite earlier
navy claims that sounds of knocking had been heard from inside the
vessel, Popov said there had been no contact of any kind with the
submarine since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue capsules, which have been working around the clock
since Tuesday, could not latch onto the escape hatch, which was
buckled and torn, officials said. Ten times the vessels reached the
hatch, but they could not dock.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Babenko said rescue efforts were
continuing and a docking was still possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still not losing hope,'' he said. ''Experts say this is
possible and that is the only reason why this work does not stop
for a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The capsules were driven back earlier in the week by strong
currents and blinding clouds of silt on the sea floor. Navy
officers said milder weather on Friday made it easier for them to
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Friday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
the United States was assembling a small team of technical experts
just in case Russia sought the help. Cohen said U.S., Russian and
NATO officials were to talk Saturday morning about whether Moscow
wants to go ahead with some form of NATO help on top of assistance
already sent by Britain and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had no insight into how likely the Russians
believe it is that some members of the stricken sub's crew are
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that they are agreeable and willing to have NATO
assistance, should it be necessary in their judgment, is some
indication that they still feel that there are sailors alive,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia resisted offers of help from countries with sophisticated
equipment for days, but relented Wednesday and accepted an offer of
a British rescue mini-submarine and a Norwegian diving team. The
British submarine is aboard a transport ship that was expected to
reach the site Saturday afternoon -- a week after the Kursk went
down -- and the divers were not expected until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater inspections of the Kursk show massive damage reaching
from the bow to the conning tower -- much more extensive destruction
than earlier thought, officials said. Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov said there was a ''terrifying hole'' on the starboard
side of the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ''A rather big part of the crew was in the part of the boat that
was hit by the catastrophe,'' Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has given wildly contradictory estimates of how long
the Kursk's emergency oxygen supplies could last, ranging from a
few hours to two weeks. Officials admit they have no idea of
conditions inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Popov, the Russian admiral, said the Kursk was crippled by a
huge internal explosion when it went down Aug. 12. Officials said
Thursday the Kursk had been in a collision, but Popov said the
explosion could have been triggered from inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be two causes of the explosion -- an external impact,
that is to say a collision, or internal,'' he said on the RTR
television channel.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of other vessels in the area at the
time with which the Kursk might have collided. A likely scenario
was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward torpedo compartment
exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion in the compartment,
which is packed with torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines monitoring Russian Navy exercises when the Kursk
was lost last Saturday detected two explosions at the time, the
second much larger than the first, U.S. officials said. A Norwegian
seismic center said it detected two explosions in the Kursk's
vicinity -- the stronger of them registering at magnitude 3.5,
equivalent to a mild earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are distressed that the military was slow to
accept help. They are also angry and disappointed that President
Vladimir Putin has kept a low profile in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Moscow Saturday amid criticism of his decision
to stay on vacation when news of the disaster broke. He said he did
not fly to the rescue site because ''The arrival of non-specialists
and high-ranking officials to the scene of disaster does not help,
but usually interferes.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said that when he first asked officials about the
prospects of rescuing the trapped crew, he was told ''the chances
are extremely low -- but they exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Further angering many, the navy has not officially said who is
aboard. The Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper on Friday published a
special issue with a list of the crew, claiming it paid navy
officials $650 for the names.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of hearsay about what's going on,'' said Irina
Lyachina, wife of the Kursk's commander. ''I hope they will tell me
the truth when the time comes.''

By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Athletics-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND: OF Ben Grieve has hit into an Oakland record and AL-hh
26 double plays. ''Sometimes he rolls over the ball, and when he
does hit it sharply, it's often at somebody,'' manager Art Howe
said. ''He hits the ball hard, and on our club, there's not a lot
of team speed, so we don't move runners that much. We don't have
good foot speed, and that makes for more opportunities for double
plays.'' ... The A's entered Friday with a 30-27 road record,
third-best in the AL. But they had lost 15 of 21, including their
last five.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Doug Brocail, the Tigers' eighth-inning setup man
for closer Todd Jones, went on the 15-day disabled list Friday with
inflammation of his right elbow. ''It's a big blow,'' manager Phil
Garner said, ''because our bullpen is so good at turning a
nine-inning game into a six-inning game.'' Garner said RHPs Nelson
Cruz and Danny Patterson, and LHP C.J. Nitkowski would fill
Brocail's role. ... The Tigers entered Friday with a 4.78 team ERA,
the AL's fifth-best. Detroit hasn't ranked in the top five since
1988. ... RHP Brian Moehler will seek a career-best fourth straight
win when he starts Saturday against Oakland. Moehler has won three
straight three times.
Rangers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: RHP Ryan Glynn, who passed out last Friday after leaving
his start against the Red Sox and spent two days in a Texas
hospital undergoing tests, was cleared Friday to resume baseball
activity. Glynn, on the 15-day DL, was diagnosed with a fainting
condition that is treatable by medication and a high-salt diet. He
is expected to make a rehab start with Oklahoma City next week. ...
The Rangers matched their worst record of the year with Thursday's
heartbreaking 8-7 loss to the Red Sox, dropping them nine games
under .500. ... Texas has not won consecutive games since July
27-28.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: SS Nomar Garciaparra was still somewhat upset before
Friday's game for what he perceived were ''negative'' comments by a
team's TV broadcaster. After Thursday's comeback win, Garciaparra
told the Boston Herald, ''What I was most fired up about was
hearing our negative commentator say how much we sucked, and then
have it shoved down his throat. That's what fired me up.''
Garciaparra, who was given most of Thursday's game off before
entering in the late innings, was back in Friday's starting lineup.
... Carl Everett's next homer will be his 30th, making him the
first Red Sox OF since Tony Armas in 1984 to reach that plateau.
... LHP Pete Schourek, on the DL with shoulder soreness, threw
three innings in a simulated game.
White Sox-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Ken Hill was signed to a minor league contract and
will start Saturday for Triple-A Charlotte. If all goes well, Hill,
who was released by Anaheim on Aug. 7, could make one more minor
league start before joining the White Sox. Manager Jerry Manuel
said he would consider a six-man rotation, which would give the
starters an extra day as they head into the stretch run. ... RHP
Cal Eldred, who has an irritated nerve in his elbow, will throw
from the mound for the first time Saturday. He has not done so
since July 14, his last start. ... RHP James Baldwin has been shut
down because of a tired arm. Because of off days, he might just be
pushed back a few days before making another start.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Friday marked the Devil Rays' first trip to Comiskey
Park since June 16, 1999. Only nine current Devil Rays were on that
trip. ... Former White Sox SS Ozzie Guillen returned to Comiskey
Park for the first time since April 29, 1998, when he was with the
Orioles. ... INF Bobby Smith, who has been on the disabled list
since July 6 because of a sprained right knee, will make another
rehab start Friday and could rejoin the big league team this
weekend.
Twins-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: RHP Matt Kinney made his major league debut Friday.
Kinney, one of the Twins' top prospects, went 5-2 with a 4.25 ERA
at Triple-A Salt Lake City. Kenney was acquired from Boston along
with OF John Barnes and RHP Joe Thomas for LHP Greg Swindell in
1998. ... Kinney wears glasses when he pitches. ... 1B Denny
Hocking has a career-high 10-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays, who had Thursday off, entered the game
1-11 after an off day. ... RHP Joey Hamilton, who had shoulder
surgery last September, will make his first start of the season
Saturday.
Angels-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: C Matt Walbeck was placed on the 15-day DL with
tendinitis in his right knee. C Shawn Wooten was called up from
Triple-A Edmonton to take Walbeck's place. ... RHP Brian Cooper
will be recalled from Edmonton on Saturday to start against New
York. ... A few of the Angels were playing catch in the rain two
hours before the game. Others stayed dry and watched Tiger Woods in
the PGA Championship. ... The Angels, the only team to beat the
Yankees in the season series the past two years, have lost four of
the first seven matchups in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 2B Chuck Knoblauch is throwing from 50 feet as he
tries to recover from a strained right forearm. Despite reports
saying the Yankees might consider moving Knoblauch to the outfield,
manager Joe Torre said there are no plans for Knoblauch to take fly
balls. ... Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre could rejoin the team for
one day this weekend as he continues his recovery from cancer
treatment. ... Glenallen Hill, with nine homers in 43 at-bats with
the Yankees, started at DH and homered in two of his first three
at-bats Friday. ''He's hot right now. That's why he's playing,''
Torre said. ... LHP Allen Watson underwent arthroscopic surgery on
his left shoulder.
Mariners-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners entered Friday night's game clinging to a
three-game lead over Oakland in the AL West. Seattle's five-game
losing streak is its longest since dropping five in a row Aug. 4-8,
1999. During the skid, Mariners pitchers have a 7.80 ERA. ... It's
been tough for Seattle to get started on the road. In their first
eight road trips this season, the Mariners are 0-8 in the first
game of a series and 7-1 in Game 2. ... DH Edgar Martinez played in
his 1,500th game Friday night with Seattle. He is second on the
team's list, behind Ken Griffey Jr., who played in 1,535. ...
Kazuhiro Sasaki's 28 saves are second-most for an AL rookie.
Toronto's Billy Koch set the record with 31 saves in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Jaret Wright had successful surgery on his right
shoulder Thursday in Los Angeles and will not be able to pick up a
baseball until Dec. 1. Angels team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum
repaired a tear in Wright's labrum and cleaned up some fraying on
his rotator cuff. Indians manager Charlie Manuel said Wright should
be back for the start of training camp. ''He shouldn't miss much
time if he misses any at all,'' Manuel said. ... LHP Ricardo
Rincon, who had elbow surgery in May, pitched a simulated game
Friday and will be sent to Triple-A Buffalo on Sunday to begin a
rehab assignment. Rincon is expected to pitch three times for the
Bisons and could be back with the Indians by the end of next week.
... With 45 games left entering Friday night, Manuel knows now is
the time the Indians have to make a move if they want to make the
postseason for the sixth straight year. ''Time's running out,''
Manuel said. ''It's time for us to kick it.''
Royals-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals placed LHP Paul Spoljaric on the 15-day
disabled list and recalled RHP Jose Santiago from Triple-A Omaha.
Spoljaric was called up from Omaha a week ago, but was unable to
pitch because of a back strain. ... The four-game series that began
Friday was Kansas City's only visit to Baltimore this season. ...
OF Johnny Damon is on pace to break the club record of 133 runs,
set by Willie Wilson in 1980. ... KC batters have the fewest walks
and strikeouts in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Beau Hale, the Orioles' top draft pick in the
June draft, signed a one-year contract, the team announced Friday.
... Pat Rapp, the Orioles' starter Friday, made his first
appearance since Aug. 8. He missed his last start to be with his
critically ill father in Louisiana. ... SS Melvin Mora had seven
errors in his first 20 games with Baltimore, including four in his
last four games.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: A cameraman fell into the stairwell at the end of
the Pirates' dugout a half-hour before the game. The cameraman
walked to a cart on the field and was given a ride to a medical
station. ... Jimmy Anderson, who will start Saturday against
Cincinnati, has given up only one homer in his last seven starts
and a total of six this season. The Pirates' staff gave up that
many Wednesday night in Houston. ... Seven of Brian Giles' last
eight hits went for extra bases. He was in an 8-for-15 spurt with a
double, three triples and three homers in the last four games. ...
At 49-70, the Pirates were 21 games under .500 for the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: 2B Pokey Reese, in a 9-for-59 slump, was back at
leadoff Friday when the lineup was posted. A few minutes before the
first pitch, he was scratched because of a tight left hamstring.
... OF Dmitri Young was out of the lineup with a bruised right
shoulder, injured Wednesday night. ... SS Barry Larkin was two hits
shy of 2,000. He would become the first major league shortstop with
2,000 hits, 170 homers and 350 steals. ... Umpire Terry Craft was
ill, leaving three umps to work the game.
Brewers-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: INF Mark Loretta came off the disabled list for the
Brewers after completing a 20-day rehab assignment in Indianapolis.
Loretta hit .240 with five RBIs in 10 games at Indy. ... To make
room for him, the Brewers optioned INF Santiago Perez to
Indianapolis. Perez hit .191 with two RBIs in 20 games with
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Roger Cedeno, who has missed 75 games with a broken
left hand, returned to the lineup Friday, batting leadoff and
playing LF, which he didn't do in any of his first 39 games. Cedeno
takes the place of Lance Berkman, hitting .304 with 17 homers and
55 RBIs. ''With his speed,'' manager Larry Dierker said of the .258
hitting Cedeno, ''he may end up being better in left field than
anybody we've had out there.'' ... C Mitch Meluskey, who has missed
17 games with right biceps tendinitis, also came off the DL. He
started in place of Tony Eusebio, who is on a career high and club
season- best 18-game hitting streak during which he is batting
.385.
Marlins-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: SS Alex Gonzalez (sprained MCL) and LF Cliff Floyd
(sprained knee) are on the DL, but accompanied the team to Denver.
The left knee continues to bother Gonzalez enough to keep him
sidelined. Floyd took batting practice Friday. ... The Marlins
(60-60) have a .500 record after the All-Star break for just the
second time in their history. ... 1B Derrek Lee increased his
batting average from .250 to .289 over the past 66 games. ... 2B
Luis Castillo is 38 hits shy of matching the franchise high of 175,
set by Jeff Conine in 1996. ... Florida will play 27 of its final
42 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: RHP Kevin Jarvis threw a simulated game Friday at
Triple-A Colorado Springs and without pain in his lower back that
required him to go on the DL. ... RHP Giovanni Cararra was reported
to still have stiffness in his right elbow. Manager Buddy Bell said
he didn't expect to activate either before the Sept. 1 callup date.
... Bell said the Rockies are being cautious about the progress of
RHP Jerry Dipoto, who threw a simulated game Friday at Coors Field.
''We don't want to get too carried away with his progress. We want
to make sure he is all right before we go any farther.'' ... 1B
Todd Helton finished the nine-game road trip 19-for-29 with three
homers and 10 RBIs. ... When asked about the pressures of his run
at .400, Helton, hitting .396 said, ''There isn't any more pressure
on me than usual. I've felt pressure on every at-bat since I was
12.''
Phillies-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: RHP Robert Person, who started Friday, did not
allow a run in nine innings his first two games at Busch Stadium.
Person is from suburban University City. ... LHP Omar Daal, who
opposes RHP Pat Hentgen on Saturday, is coming off his worst outing
since joining the Phillies in a July 26 trade from Arizona. He
lasted four innings in a loss to Houston on Aug. 13, allowing nine
runs on eight hits. ... The Phillies and Rockies were tied for the
NL lead in doubles with 233. ... OF Pat Burrell, who didn't join
the team until May 24, led NL rookies with 13 homers, 54 RBIs and
32 extra-base hits. He was second with 18 doubles and third with
125 total bases.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals did not consider giving RHP Matt
Morris, in the bullpen after missing all of last season due to
elbow surgery, a shot as the replacement for injured RHP Andy Benes
in the rotation. ''We feel right now for Matt, the best place is
the bullpen,'' general manager Walt Jocketty said. But Jocketty
didn't rule out Morris starting at some point this season. ... OF
Eric Davis is holding the LifeRace, a 5K run-walk, Saturday morning
as part of his continuing effort to promote colon cancer awareness.
... Jocketty said the Cardinals won't call up a lot of players from
Triple-A Memphis on Sept. 1 when rosters can be expanded. ''We want
to leave that team pretty much intact,'' Jocketty said. ''We've
already destroyed it taking (Gene) Stechshulte and (Eduardo) Perez
out of there.'' Memphis was 75-52 and closing in on the Eastern
Division title in the Pacific Coast League.
Cubs-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Manager Don Baylor said RHP Kerry Wood will not start
Sunday against Arizona. Baylor put off Wood's start until Tuesday
night in Houston. Wood has been sidelined since July 30 with a left
oblique strain. LHP Daniel Garibay will start Sunday, with Randy
Johnson going for Arizona. ... In their just-completed six-game
homestand, the Cubs scored just 14 runs. ... With 41 stolen bases,
Eric Young has topped the 40-mark in steals for the sixth time in
his major league career. He has been successful in his last 15
attempts, a career high.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Manager Buck Showalter went against his usual tendency
Friday and started right-handed hitters Greg Colbrunn at first base
and Danny Bautista in right field against RHP Ruben Quevedo.
Showalter usually starts lefties Erubiel Durazo at first and Jason
Conti in right against right-handers, but Colbrunn has hit .452 in
his last 10 starts. Bautista hit .412 on the just-completed
six-game road trip. ... The series against Chicago is always a big
draw at Bank One Ballpark because of the popularity of the Cubs,
who have held spring training in Arizona since the 1950s.
Mets-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Mets pitchers Turk Wendell and Rick Reed probably
won't ever complain about New York cab drivers again after Friday's
1&AMP;frac12;-hour odyssey between their hotel and Dodger Stadium. Their taxi
had a flat on the freeway and the driver pulled over to change
tires, but he then had to make a detour to a service station
because there wasn't enough air in the spare tire. Wendell had to
sit with his feet and knees together the entire time because the
cab driver was driving with the front seat as far back as it could
go. ... Mike Hampton had treatment on the stress fracture in his
right rib cage, which forced him out of Thursday's game and could
keep him from starting on Tuesday at San Diego. ''If he misses any
time, it won't be very long,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ''The
doctors say you can't make the situation worse, but if you waited
(the proper time) for the stress fracture to heal, they said he
couldn't do anything for three months.'' ... The Mets are staying
in the same hotel the New York delegation was headquartered for
this week's Democratic National Convention. Among the crowd at
Friday night's game was Dan Malloy, the mayor of Valentine's
hometown of Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: With 11 victories and about nine starts remaining,
Chan Ho Park is the only Dodger with a mathematical chance of
winning 20 games. If he doesn't, it would be the first time in the
franchise's 111-year history that the Dodgers will go 10
consecutive seasons without a 20-game winner (Ramon Martinez, 20-6
in 1990). ... Switch-hitter Devon White, who has started only six
times in CF since Tom Goodwin arrived in a trade from Colorado on
July 31, was penciled in Friday night's starting lineup. But
manager Davey Johnson scratched him after White told him he wasn't
able to swing left-handed. ''It's just a little soreness. It's not
from the (rotator) cuff, it's the back of the (left) shoulder,''
said White, who missed more than 11 weeks because of a partial tear
in his left rotator cuff.
Braves-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Catcher Javy Lopez did not start for the third straight
game Friday because of a sore right elbow. He is day to day. ...
Until winning his previous start, Greg Maddux had lost four
straight starts, though he posted a 2.80 ERA in those games. The
Braves were shut out in two of the games and lost another 3-2 in 10
innings. ... Maddux leads all active pitchers with at least 10 wins
per year in 13 straight seasons. Atlanta's Tom Glavine has 12
straight seasons of 10 or more wins, and Baltimore's Mike Mussina
has eight.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP Joe Nathan, who went on the disabled list
July 14 with right shoulder inflammation, is expected to be
activated Saturday. Manager Dusty Baker said there are no plans to
put Nathan in the rotation. ''Everybody's going good,'' Baker said.
''There's no need to change.''. ... RF Ellis Burks was a late
scratch from the lineup Friday. He had flu-like symptoms and
Armando Rios replaced him. ... Kent is only the seventh Giant to
with four straight 100-RBI seasons, joining George Kelly, Irish
Meusel, Bill Terry, Mel Ott, Willie Mays and Barry Bonds. Ott and
Mays each did it for eight straight seasons.
Expos-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: C Lenny Webster was placed on the 15-day disabled list
with a sore right elbow. The move on Webster, hitting .205 with no
homers and five RBI, was retroactive to Monday. Brian Schneider was
recalled from Triple-A Ottawa to replace Webster. ... LF Peter
Bergeron is still nursing a bruised left thumb and was held out of
the starting lineup. Bergeron came out of Thursday's game in the
fourth inning. ... Schneider collected his first major league hit
off Friday night's starter, Matt Clement, in San Diego on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Tony Gwynn took batting practice for the first time
in more than seven weeks since surgery on his left knee. Gwynn, who
last appeared in a game on June 23 as a pinch hitter at Cincinnati,
has been hitting off a tee and is scheduled to begin running next
week. Although he said he'd like to return to play in September,
the odds favor the eight-time NL batting champ missing the
remainder of the season. ... With a 10-6 record in August, the
Padres need only five wins in their next 13 games to register their
first winning month since June 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Valentin and Chris Singleton each hit
two-run homers and Carlos Lee added a solo shot, leading the
Chicago White Sox to a 5-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got a scare in the sixth inning when rookie
starter Jon Garland (3-4) was struck on the right forearm near his
elbow by Fred McGriff's line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Garland fell to the ground immediately, clutching his arm.
X-rays were negative and the team said he sustained a contusion.
His status was day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Garland gave up one run on a solo homer by Gerald Williams, four
hits and one walk in 5 2-3 innings. He struck out four to win for
the first time in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin set a club record for homers by a shortstop, hitting
his 21st in the first inning to break the old mark of 20 set in
1964 by Ron Hansen. Singleton hit his ninth homer in the fifth, and
both blasts came after failed bunt attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Lee led off the seventh with his 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Buehrle pitched one inning of relief, Bob Howry went 1 1-3
innings and Keith Foulke worked the ninth for his 22nd save in 26
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Rekar (4-8), a native of Oak Lawn, Ill., a Chicago suburb,
took the loss, giving up five runs on eight hits and one walk in
seven innings. He struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hit his second homer in as many days in the first. Ray
Durham singled leading off and Valentin, who bunted foul twice,
then hit a 1-2 pitch from Rekar out.
</P>
<P>
   Lee doubled leading off Chicago's fifth and Singleton showed
bunt on the first pitch, then drove the next one over the
center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit the first pitch from Garland leading off the sixth
for his 19th home run to make it 4-1. Russ Johnson hit an RBI
single in the Devil Rays seventh to cut it to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Valentin has hit in eight straight games. He is closing in
on his career high of 24 home runs, set in 1996 with Milwaukee. ...
Singleton's homer was his first since July 27. ... Williams, whose
previous career home run high was 17 last year, also homered off
Garland last Sunday in Tampa Bay. ... Devil Rays first base coach
Jose Cardenal was ejected in the sixth by second base umpire Brian
Runge after arguing a play at first. ... Friday's game marked Tampa
Bay's first visit to Comiskey Park since June 16, 1999. Only nine
current Devil Rays made that trip.

<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Blake Stein pitched an eight-hitter for his
first complete game in the majors, and Johnny Damon tripled in two
runs to snap an eighth-inning tie as the Kansas City Royals beat
the Baltimore Orioles 4-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stein (4-3), who allowed eight runs in 2 1-3 innings to
Baltimore last Saturday, struck out six and walked none in his 20th
major league start.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who missed the first half of the season
because of a fractured bone in his right forearm, came in with a
7.14 ERA in eight starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Stein outdueled Pat Rapp (6-10), gave up singles to two of the
first three batters he faced before holding the Royals hitless over
the next six innings. He walked Gregg Zaun with two outs in the
second and retired the next 17 batters before Zaun walked on a 3-2
pitch with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reboulet then reached when shortstop Melvin Mora dropped a
potential double-play relay at second base, his fifth error in as
many games. Damon followed with a liner into the gap in
right-center, and Rey Sanchez chased Rapp with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp was pitching for the first time in 10 days after missing
his previous start to be with his ailing father in Louisiana. The
right-hander enjoyed one of his best performances of the season,
but dropped his fourth straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Fordyce had two hits and scored a run for the Orioles, 1-6
against Kansas City this season.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, who had half the Royals' four hits, is 72-for-154 (.468)
since the All-Star break. He scored twice and has 105 runs, just 28
short of the team record of 133 set by Willie Wilson in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City got a run in the first when Damon singled, took
second on a grounder and scored on a single by Mike Sweeney, his
108th RBI of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore pulled even in the third on a double by Fordyce and a
single by Luis Matos.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles put runners at second and third with one out in the
fifth before Stein struck out Ryan Minor and retired Matos on a fly
ball.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was interrupted in the bottom of the fifth inning
when a water sprinkler went off behind the mound. ... The Royals
placed LHP Paul Spoljaric on the 15-day disabled list and recalled
RHP Jose Santiago from Triple-A Omaha. ... Fordyce has hit in 12 of
15 games since joining the Orioles on July 30. ... Albert Belle
went 0-for-4 and is 21-for-102 (.206) in his last 25 games.

<HEADLINE> Chargers 28, Falcons 14  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ryan Leaf, whose first two seasons were plagued
by inconsistent play, temperamental behavior and injuries, took a
major step toward reclaiming his job as San Diego's No. 1
quarterback Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The former No. 1 pick -- making his first start since Nov. 8,
1998 -- passed for 167 yards and a touchdown in the opening half as
the unbeaten Chargers handed the Atlanta Falcons their first loss
of the preseason, 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson, coming back from a knee injury, played the first
two quarters for the Falcons and seemed to have no problems. He
rushed six times for 17 yards and dragged along would-be tacklers
on a couple of runs.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had a miserable night, managing as many turnovers --
seven -- as points.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf connected on his first nine throws and finished his stint
14-of-20, including a 14-yard touchdown to Jeff Graham and three
completions of at least 21 yards. Overall, Leaf is 32-of-50 (64
percent) for 350 yards during the preseason, with two touchdowns
and one interception. He has overseen six scoring drives in 17
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ryan looked real sharp and had a good feel for the ball
game,'' coach Mike Riley said. ''He had quite a few nice drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf lost the starting job midway through his rookie season and
didn't play at all last year after shoulder surgery. Besides going
through rehabilitation, he served a four-week suspension for
insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf got a chance to recapture the No. 1 job when 14-year
veteran Jim Harbaugh struggled in the first two preseason games.
Riley would like to have a starter in place before the final
exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf credited the offensive line for giving him plenty of time
to throw and said his shoulder feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could throw it 36 more times if I wanted to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers' victory was marred by injuries to starting
defensive end Raylee Johnson and quarterback Moses Moreno, who took
over for Leaf in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went down after scooping up a fumble by Chris Chandler
in the final minute of the first half. Just a couple of yards short
of the end zone, the defensive player was blindsided with a low
tackle by Falcons fullback Bob Christian.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego safety Rodney Harrison went after Christian, feeling
he had delivered a cheap shot to the knees though no penalty was
called. Johnson had to be taken off the field on the cart; there
was no immediate word on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno completed 4-of-6 passes for 61 yards, throwing a 20-yard
touchdown to Mikhael Ricks. Then, while trying to slide at the end
of a scramble, Moreno was hit in the head by Falcons safety
Johndale Carty and had to leave the game with a concussion. Carty
was flagged for unnecessary roughness.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh, who was supposed to get the night off, and JaJuan
Seider finished up at quarterback for the Chargers, who got their
other points on five field goals -- two by John Carney and three by
Jose Cortez.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler threw a 62-yard touchdown pass to Tim Dwight but also
fumbled twice after blindside hits. The Falcons fell apart in the
second half, fumbling on two of their first four offensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani, battling for the No. 2 job behind Chandler,
didn't help his chances with three interceptions. He was picked off
in the end zone on first-and-goal at the San Diego 1, but also was
hurt by several dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani had one bright spot: a 55-yard touchdown pass to Eugene
Baker with 51 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers improved to 3-0 in the preseason for the second
time in three years. The Falcons (3-1) were trying for their first
4-0 mark since 1990.

Babbitt Vows To Aid Firefighters
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- With 1.1 million acres ablaze across the West, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said today that firefighters have a blank check to draw
on the federal Treasury. But he said no more manpower can be assigned because
every available fire crew supervisor is already on the job, including several
dozen from Australia and New Zealand. Sending in more troops, for example, would
be futile if no one is trained to supervise their efforts. He said it's up to
managers to use existing forces and equipment where they will do the most good.
The money from the Treasury can be used to cover overtime, lodging and
transportation for crews.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having stepped back from their threat to break off
contract talks, negotiators for 87,000 striking Verizon Communications telephone

two-week strike. The stepped-up bargaining came as Verizon reported its first
major system outage since the strike began. ''We're going in the right
direction,'' said Jeff Miller of the Communications Workers of America, the
larger of two unions negotiating to replace contracts that expired Aug. 6. He
said the unions were ''beginning to see more substantive bargaining'' on key
union concerns, including mandatory overtime and the movement of work.

streak to 13 rounds of par or better in the majors. He was at 11-under 133,
tying the 36-hole mark for relation to par last set by Mark O'Meara and Ernie

<HEADLINE> Diving to Estonia Stirs Talk  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE PANDOLFI
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The plans by an American diver and a
German television producer to dive to the Estonia shipwreck are
stirring emotions and government protests in Sweden as the
expedition's starting date draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Estonia ferry, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm,
went down in a storm off the Finnish coast on Sept. 28 1994,
killing 852 people in one of Europe's worst maritime disasters.
Since the accident, speculation has been rife about why it sank,
including theories of explosions and sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Bemis Jr. of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and independent
producer Jutta Rabe were assembling a team of German, American and
Czech divers and planned to start diving sometime next week, saying
it would provide closure.
</P>
<P>
   The government opposes the dive, citing an international
agreement -- signed also by Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Lithuania,
Russia and Britain -- declaring the area a final resting place and
criminalizing activities that would disturb it.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been front-page news here this summer, and a poll
published Friday indicated that most Swedes agreed with the
government, with 49 percent of the 1,000 people interviewed saying
they did not want Bemis to dive at the wreck. It had a margin or
error of about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The group cannot be prevented from diving since the Estonia sits
in international waters, although divers could risk fines or up to
two years in jail if they enter a Swedish harbor. The other
signatories have passed similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Swedish-Finnish-Estonian commission blamed the
ferry's German builder, Meyer Werft, for poorly made bow lock doors
and criticized the crew for a slow response.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer Werft, based in Hamburg, Germany, commissioned a separate
report that claimed poor maintenance of the locks was the cause of
the accident. The shipbuilder also said a bomb could have exploded
on board, a possibility ruled out by the three-nation commission.

<HEADLINE> Jets 27, Giants 24  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Two familiar weapons from their
late-season surge of 1999 got the New York Jets headed into the
regular season on a positive note.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas threw for three touchdowns and Curtis Martin dominated
on the ground Friday night in a 27-24 victory over the New York
Giants. It was the Jets' fifth straight win in the annual preseason
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets led most of the way in their final preseason game --
they have a bye next week. But the Giants tied it with 2:25
remaining in the third quarter on Kerry Collins' second touchdown
pass of the night, a 10-yarder to Ike Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets (2-2) responded behind Martin, who finished with 107
yards on 18 carries, and Lucas, the keys to their four-game winning
streak to end last season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has looked sharp throughout the preseason, went over
100 yards rushing with a 24-yarder late in the third quarter. That
set up Hall's 39-yard field goal for a 20-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas stayed in to lead an 81-yard drive, hitting first-year
tight end Jermaine Wiggins on a 30-yard scoring pass against Giants
backups. He finished with 19 completions for 286 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants fell to 0-3 with a sloppy effort that had coach Jim
Fassel seething on the sideline. Collins, however, threw for 275
yards on 16 completions, but the Giants had 16 penalties for 105
yards.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining first quarter degenerated in the second period.
Turnovers and penalties slowed things to a crawl; the Giants alone
had 10 penalties for 61 yards in the second quarter and cost
themselves at least a field goal try in the dying seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had trouble holding onto the ball. Martin and Richie
Anderson lost fumbles for the Jets, while Tiki Barber bobbled the
ball away at the Jets 5 and Collins was intercepted by Marcus
Coleman in the end zone on the final play of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   There also were some fireworks, including Lucas' perfect 52-yard
touchdown pass to Wayne Chrebet on a flea-flicker. Lucas handed off
to Martin, who flipped the ball back to the quarterback, who found
Chrebet well behind double coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants answered just 1:25 later as Amani Toomer toasted
Coleman for a 73-yard bomb, bringing the Giants within 14-10. John
Hall's 26-yard field goal capping a drive on which the Giants had
three straight penalties made it 17-10 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' first scoring pass, on the opening series, was a 6-yarder
to Richie Anderson that capped a precise 66-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jurevicius caught a 16-yard TD pass from Jason Garrett with
15 seconds remaining to close the scoring for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets scratched No. 1 quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who
sprained the big toe on his right foot last week. The wet
conditions at Giants Stadium might have had something to do with
benching Testaverde, who is coming off a torn Achilles' tendon.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan's Gall Bladder Removed  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan successfully had his gall bladder surgically removed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was admitted to Washington Hospital Center after
experiencing repeated episodes of stomach pain during the last few
months, according to his sister Bay Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan had known he had gallstones, and was waiting until
after the November election to have them removed. But after an
episode of discomfort last week he decided to remove the gallstones
Thursday. During the surgery doctors decided to remove the entire
gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to return home Saturday morning to continue
recuperating, hospital spokesman Leroy Pinder said. Buchanan's
doctors anticipate a speedy and complete recovery, his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan joked that Shelly Buchanan, the candidate's wife,
''is the proud owner of his gallstones, which we may have to put on
the market to raise some money for this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac beneath the liver where
bile, a liquid produced by the liver to help break down fats during
digestion, is stored. Disease is frequently characterized by
gallstones, which can grow up to an inch across and cause severe
abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   The usual treatment for painful gallstones is removal of the
gall bladder; about 500,000 Americans have their gall bladders
taken out each year.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan recently returned to Washington from Long Beach,
Calif., the site of last week's contentious Reform Party National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, the party essentially split in two because of
Buchanan's controversial candidacy. One camp nominated Buchanan and
the other group, made up of supporters of party founder Ross Perot,
nominated physicist and Natural Law Party founder John Hagelin as
their candidate.

<HEADLINE> Angels 9, Yankees 8  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Darin Erstad made a spectacular, game-saving
catch in the 10th inning and followed it with a game-winning homer
in the 11th as the Anaheim Angels rallied from five runs down in
the ninth to beat the New York Yankees 9-8 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Held in check for eight innings by Roger Clemens, the Angels
rallied in the ninth to tie the game at 8, capped by Mo Vaughn's
three-run homer off Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees appeared to have won the game in the 10th before
Erstad took it right from them. With runners on second and third
and two outs, Jorge Posada hit a drive to the gap in left-center.
Erstad got a good break on the ball, and made a full-extension
dive, catching the ball after it appeared to have gone past him for
a game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   A few Yankees had run up on the dugout steps, pumping their
fists, thinking they won the game. But it was the Angels who came
out of the dugout celebrating and eventually ended up with the win.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the 11th, Erstad hit a high fly off Mike Stanton
(2-2) that just cleared the right-field wall for his 21st homer and
major league-leading 189th hit.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 12 years the Yankees wasted a five-run,
ninth-inning lead, since Detroit overcame a 6-1 deficit to win 7-6
on June 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-2) pitched three innings for the win,
extending his scoreless streak to 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill homered twice for the Yankees, who were 138-4
when leading after eight innings the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens retired eight straight batters entering the ninth,
before allowing back-to-back singles to Troy Glaus and Bengie
Molina. Jeff Nelson came in and walked No. 9 hitter Kevin Stocker
with one out, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels drew within 8-5 on Erstad's RBI groundout and Orlando
Palmeiro's run-scoring double off Rivera. Vaughn then hit an 0-1
pitch into the upper deck in right field for his 30th homer, tying
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's fifth blown save in 31 chances denied Clemens his
seventh straight win. Clemens, who is 6-0 with a 2.54 ERA in his
last 11 starts, allowed five runs and nine hits in eight-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hit a solo homer in the fourth and a two-run shot in the
fifth off Ramon Ortiz to give him nine homers in his first 43
at-bats with the Yankees since being acquired four weeks ago from
the Chicago Cubs. He has 12 career multihomer games.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon hit a solo homer in the fourth for Anaheim. It was
his 27th of the season and 223rd career homer, breaking Brian
Downing's franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, the only team to win the season series from the
Yankees the past two seasons, are 4-4 against New York with two
games remaining in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ortiz allowed eight runs and 11 hits in 5 2-3 innings. ...
Erstad went 2-for-5 to give him a major league-leading 61 multihit
games. His 189 hits are the most for an Angels' left-handed hitter.
... Vaughn went 1-for-4 against Clemens and is 3-for-25 in his
career against his former Boston teammate. ... Vaughn has at least
30 homers for six straight seasons. ... Jeter is 20-for-47 in 11
games as a leadoff hitter. ... New York's Bernie Williams is in a
3-for-32 slide.

<HEADLINE> Indians 9, Mariners 8  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Travis Fryman's RBI single in the ninth inning
Friday night sent the Cleveland Indians to a crucial 9-8 victory
over the Seattle Mariners, who lost their sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians blew a four-run lead before tying it in the eighth
on Kenny Lofton's two-run homer. They won it when Fryman's hit
scored Roberto Alomar from third.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, reeling after blowing a big lead and losing in
Oakland on Wednesday night, moved within two games of the Athletics
in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen hit a two-run homer and Edgar Martinez, Dan
Wilson and Al Martin hit solo shots for the Mariners, who haven't
lost six in a row since July of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar walked to open the ninth off Arthur Rhodes (3-6) and
Manny Ramirez followed with a grounder to third that Guillen
butchered for his second error of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar went to third on the play, Ramirez to second and Seattle
manager Lou Piniella to the mound to figure out how to get out of
the jam.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella decided not only to bring his infield in, but he also
brought in his center fielder, moving Mike Cameron in front of the
bag at second with Jim Thome due up.
</P>
<P>
   Thome walked to load the bases before Rhodes got David Segui to
pop to short right. Kazuhiro Sasaki came on and Piniella sent
Cameron back to center before Fryman pulled a ball inside the bag
at third to score Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians poured out of the dugout to greet Fryman, knowing
they'd dodged a devastating loss.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's fans were desperate for a spark, and Lofton gave
them one in the eighth with his two-run shot to left.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland trailed 8-6 after blowing a 6-2 lead when Fryman
singled leading off. With two outs, Lofton fouled off three
straight pitches before driving Rhodes' outside fastball over the
wall in left-center for his eighth homer and first since July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle looked like it was done in the fifth, trailing 6-2
against Bartolo Colon. But the Mariners scored four times in the
inning to tie it and took the lead in the sixth on Martinez's 29th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Martinez drove 3-1 pitch from Justin Speier over
the wall in right-center for his major league-leading 117th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle made it 6-6 in the fifth against Colon, who had just
beaten the Mariners on Aug. 12 with seven dominant innings.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez walked and scored from first when Martinez
singled and Ramirez booted the ball in right. John Olerud followed
with a two-run double, and one out later, Guillen connected for his
fourth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get the clutch hit during their recent road trip, the
Indians got a two-run double from Segui and some help from starter
Paul Abbott and the Mariners to score four runs and open a 5-1 lead
in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners are 0-9 in the first games of road trips. ...
Martinez's homer matched his career high. He also hit 29 homers in
1995 and '98. ... Garcia had 45 career starts before coming out of
the bullpen to replace Abbott, who came in 4-0 with a 0.64 ERA
against the Indians. ... Former Indians pitcher Mark Langston
watched the game from the press box. He's in town for a charity
rock concert featuring some Indians players. ... Injuries have
contributed to Cleveland using 52 players, one shy of the club
record (1991).

<HEADLINE> Chavez's Birthday Made a Holiday  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a festive ceremony hailed by hundreds of
Hispanics, Gov. Gray Davis signed into law a bill declaring March
31 a state holiday marking Cesar Chavez's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Viva Cesar Chavez!'' the governor declared Friday as hundreds
who had gathered under a hot sun at Los Angeles' historic Olvera
Street cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Many who stood on the tiny cobbled street that marks the city's
birthplace wore red and black T-shirts and waved the red and black
United Farm Workers flag, symbols of the union Chavez founded.
</P>
<P>
   A mariachi band played as Davis stepped to a microphone and
declared that Chavez was ''one of the most important labor and
civil rights leaders in our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The law provides a paid day off for 210,000 state workers and
requires a ''day of service and learning'' in public schools, with
students studying Chavez's legacy and participating in public
service projects.
</P>
<P>
   Texas made March 31 an optional state holiday in honor of
Chavez. Arizona celebrated its first official Cesar Chavez Day this
year, although it is considered a recognition day rather than a
paid state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who died in 1993 at age 66, has long been revered by the
Hispanic community for his struggle on behalf of Hispanic and
immigrant people who work harvesting the nation's crops.
</P>
<P>
   Over strong opposition from the agricultural industry, Chavez
founded the United Farm Workers Union, struggling for years to
unionize laborers and then win contracts for them. He led a
nationwide grape boycott in the 1960s and frequently went on fasts
to draw attention to his cause.

<HEADLINE> Eagles 34, Titans 32  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- David Akers kicked a 48-yard field goal as
time expired to lift the Philadelphia Eagles to a 34-32 victory
over the Tennessee Titans on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (2-1), playing its second game in five days, rested
many of its regulars, including quarterback Steve McNair, running
back Eddie George and defensive end Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (1-2) played its starters the entire first half,
and led 21-6 at halftime and 31-19 midway through the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan McNabb completed 15 of 23 passes for 163 yards, three
touchdowns and no interceptions. He ran for 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans rallied in the fourth behind quarterback Billy Volek
and running back Mike Green. Volek threw two touchdowns and Green
ran for a pair, including a 4-yarder with 1:38 left that gave
Tennessee a 32-31 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Notre Dame star Ron Powlus drove the Eagles 30 yards in
eight plays to set up Akers' winning field goal. Powlus' 19-yard
pass to Alex Van Dyke on fourth-and-10 preceded the kick.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who has been nursing a sore right shoulder, played in
Tennessee's 30-3 victory over the Super Bowl champion St. Louis
Rams on Monday night. Neil O'Donnell started in his place and led
the Titans to a field goal in one series.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's go-ahead drive was set up by a 5-yard punt from Will
Brice. The Titans drove 64 yards on five plays to take the
one-point lead. A 23-yard pass from Volek to Isaac Byrd gave
Tennessee the ball at the 4, and Green ran in from there.
</P>
<P>
   The two-point conversion was intercepted by James Darling, who
started running the other way with a convoy of blockers before
realizing past midfield that the play was dead once he caught the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took a 7-3 lead on its first possession as McNabb
tossed a 9-yarder to Cecil Martin, capping a nine-play, 73-yard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb connected with Charles Johnson on a 46-yard pass to give
the Eagles a 14-6 lead with 9:17 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who worked out regularly with McNabb in the offseason,
streaked down the right sideline, beat backup corner George
McCullough and caught the ball in stride.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, an elusive runner, displayed his scrambling ability in a
two-minute drill capped by a 5-yard shovel pass to Duce Staley that
gave Philadelphia a 21-6 lead with 16 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb gained all of his rushing yards in the 57-yard drive,
including a 7-yard run in which he collided with an official en
route to a first down.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, McNabb dodged tacklers and hurdled defenders for
a 21-yard run that set up the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's first-team offense had 231 total yards in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans drove 53 yards on 14 plays to start the game and took
a 3-0 lead on a 40-yard field goal by Al Del Greco with 7:53 left
in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Thomas, starting for George, gained 32 yards on the
drive, including 16 on the first play from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year quarterback Kevin Daft replaced O'Donnell and played
into the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-yarder by Del Greco cut the deficit to 7-6 just 23 seconds
into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee made it 21-13 on a 2-yard run by Green with 13:04 left
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Powlus, fighting for a roster spot on the Eagles, threw a
35-yard touchdown pass to rookie Todd Pinkston to give Philadelphia
a 31-19 lead with 9:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Volek tossed a 1-yarder to Mike Leach to cut the score to 24-19
with 1:37 left in the third. He connected with Chris Sanders on a
35-yarder with seven minutes left to make it 31-26.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 6, Rangers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Despite a communication gap, Boston right-hander
Tomo Ohka can read baseball's sign language.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka had his second consecutive strong outing, allowing just one
run in seven innings as the Red Sox defeated the Texas Rangers 6-4
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to pitch what the catcher called,'' Ohka said through
a Japanese journalist. ''I just tried to follow him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka (2-2) allowed one run and four hits. He gave up Rusty
Greer's RBI double in the third before retiring his final 14
batters.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, a 4-2 win at Texas on Sunday, Ohka gave up
two runs and five hits in 5 2-3 innings. That was his first win as
a starter, and just the second of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the universal language,'' Boston pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan said of Ohka and catcher Jason Varitek. ''I think he's
more relaxed, more comfortable on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka, 24, from Kyoto, Japan, struggled in four games with the
Red Sox last season, going 1-2 with a 4.24 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched a real strong game for us,'' Boston manager Jimy
Williams said. ''He utilized his breaking ball, too, and changed
speeds. The big key is he made them hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary hit a two-run triple that capped a four-run first
inning as the Red Sox moved within one game of Oakland in the AL's
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett had a season-high four hits, getting four singles
in five at-bats. Boston has won seven of nine, while Texas has lost
eight of 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made three errors and misplayed two other balls in a
dismal defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one night that was very ugly for us as a team,''
losing pitcher Kenny Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their first three wins on the 10-game homestand, the Red
Sox didn't have to come from behind. Boston won in its last at-bat
Monday against Tampa Bay and Thursday against Texas
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee had a one-out RBI double in the ninth off Rheal
Cormier and Derek Lowe relieved. He gave up a two-run double to
Mike Lamb, then struck out Bill Haselman and Royce Clayton for his
28th save in 33 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (11-11) gave up six runs -- three earned -- and 11 hits in
his second complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring a total of one run though the fifth inning during
its previous four games, Boston went ahead right away when Jose
Offerman walked, Darren Lewis singled and Everett hit an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis advanced to third on Nomar Garciaparra's grounder and
scored on Varitek's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek reached on the play when second baseman Luis Alicea
looked to second, attempting to force Garciaparra, but held the
ball too long before throwing to first and was charged with an
error. O'Leary then tripled down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough for Ohka.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made some good pitches, but when you're struggling ...,''
Texas manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   A horrible defensive third inning by Texas led to two more runs.
Everett singled when Scott Sheldon, who replaced Alicea to start
the inning, dropped a popup on an attempted over-the-shoulder grab.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra reached on Lamb's throwing error from third and, two
outs later, Sheldon got twisted around as Lou Merloni's pop fell
for an RBI single. Bernard Gilkey followed with a run-scoring
single for a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Alicea left with tightness in his left quadriceps after
legging out a double in the third. He's day-to-day. ... Garciaparra
had an infield hit in four at-bats, but is 2-for-16, matching his
worst stretch since opening the season 2-for-16. It's dropped his
average from .384 to .373. ... O'Leary made a nice catch in foul
territory against the railing in the fourth. ... Greer's double was
his fourth in six at-bats; he had three Thursday. ... It was a
matchup of two pitchers who have thrown perfect games, albeit one
being in the minors. Rogers pitched one for Texas against the
Angels on July 28, 1994. Ohka had one June 1 for Pawtucket against
Charlotte, only the third in the 117-year history of the
International League. ... The game was played in a light rain from
the second inning on.

<HEADLINE> Diving to the Estonia Stirs Talk  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE PANDOLFI
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The plans by an American diver and a
German television producer to dive to the Estonia shipwreck are
stirring emotions and government protests in Sweden as the
expedition's starting date draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Estonia ferry, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm,
went down in a storm off the Finnish coast on Sept. 28 1994,
killing 852 people in one of Europe's worst maritime disasters.
Since the accident, speculation has been rife about why it sank,
including theories of explosions and sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Bemis Jr. of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and independent
producer Jutta Rabe were assembling a team of German, American and
Czech divers and planned to start diving sometime next week, saying
it would provide closure.
</P>
<P>
   The government opposes the dive, citing an international
agreement -- signed also by Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Lithuania,
Russia and Britain -- declaring the area a final resting place and
criminalizing activities that would disturb it.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been front-page news here this summer, and a poll
published Friday indicated that most Swedes agreed with the
government, with 49 percent of the 1,000 people interviewed saying
they did not want Bemis to dive at the wreck. It had a margin or
error of about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The group cannot be prevented from diving since the Estonia sits
in international waters, although divers could risk fines or up to
two years in jail if they enter a Swedish harbor. The other
signatories have passed similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Swedish-Finnish-Estonian commission blamed the
ferry's German builder, Meyer Werft, for poorly made bow lock doors
and criticized the crew for a slow response.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer Werft, based in Hamburg, Germany, commissioned a separate
report that claimed poor maintenance of the locks was the cause of
the accident. The shipbuilder also said a bomb could have exploded
on board, a possibility ruled out by the three-nation commission.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels To Free Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Army troops were on high alert Saturday
as negotiators set out on foot to a Muslim rebel camp for the
expected release of 28 hostages, including 12 Westerners, held for
up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the help of the Lord, we should be able to finish the
recovery'' today, said chief government negotiator Robert
Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
   He waited at a nearby village as former Libyan Ambassador Rajab
Azzarouq, a member of the Philippine negotiating panel, and a
go-between hiked to the Abu Sayyaf rebel camp on southern Jolo
island.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions by President Joseph Estrada that all of the
captives must be freed at one time have prompted speculation of a
possible military attack on the rebels soon after the release.
</P>
<P>
   Army Col. Nur Askalani said troops on Jolo were placed on high
alert but insisted there were no troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 villagers from Bandang near the rebel camp have fled
their homes, fearing some kind of military operation.
</P>
<P>
   The extremist group has been holding six French, two Germans,
two Finns, two South Africans, three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos in
primitive jungle huts.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said the status of the three Malaysians was unclear
early Saturday, although he had received a report the previous day
that they had been released to an envoy and were on their way back
from the guerrillas' hide-out.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy ordeal for the hostages has frightened both tourists
and investment away from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Once released, the hostages were expected to be flown from Jolo
to nearby Zamboanga City and presented to diplomats from their home
countries. The Western hostages are then expected to fly aboard a
Libyan-chartered plane to Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played a high-profile role in the negotiations for the
Western hostages and is believed to be paying millions of dollars
for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Separate negotiators working for the three Malaysians' freedom
said Friday they had reached an agreement on a guerrilla demand for
an additional $1-million ransom payment, but did not provide
details.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5.5 million was paid last month to the Abu Sayyaf
group for the release of six other Malaysians and a German,
according to military officials. That payment was supposed to cover
the three remaining Malaysians as well, but the guerrillas reneged
at the last moment and demanded more.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels released a Filipino woman on Wednesday, leaving three
French, two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and one Filipino
still in captivity from an original group of 21 people abducted
April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort and brought to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels later seized three French journalists, and a dozen
Filipino Christian evangelists who visited the rebels' hide-out to
pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hostages had been expected to be freed Thursday. But
bad weather and President Estrada's order that all captives be
freed together delayed the release, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The instruction of the president is for us to secure their
release in one batch. Nobody should be left behind,'' Aventajado
said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Libyan Ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a member of the
Philippine negotiating panel, has insisted the money from his
country will fund development projects instead of going directly to
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Libya hopes its prominent role will enhance its international
image and has flown dozens of journalists from the hostages'
countries to Tripoli to cover the release.
</P>
<P>
   In Tripoli on Friday, Libyan Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassouna
el-Shawish did not say exactly when the release would occur. ''We
expect that in the coming hours, or the next two days at the latest
... to end this process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   El-Shawish said all the Western hostages would stop in Libya for
what he called a happy humanitarian event. ''Without exception, all
the hostages must be here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Libya has helped mediate between Muslim guerrillas
and the Philippine government and helped build schools and mosques
in the impoverished south, home to the heavily Roman Catholic
country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, another separatist group fighting for an
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Ravens 24, Panthers 13  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers finally gave a
glimpse of their revamped defense. But the dream team of Reggie
White, Eric Swann and Chuck Smith didn't stick around long enough
to stop the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   With the Panthers' second- and third-string players in, the
Ravens were able to move the ball just enough Friday night to pull
out a 24-13 victory, their 11th straight exhibition win.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina unveiled its new defensive line on Baltimore's second
offensive series.
</P>
<P>
   The results were just what the Panthers had in mind when they
assembled White, Swann and Smith -- all offseason acquisitions -- to
join incumbent Sean Gilbert on the line to form a dominating front.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, plagued by arthritic knees, stopped Priest Holmes after a
4-yard gain on the first play of the series. Smith, lured away from
division rival Atlanta, stuffed Holmes for no gain on the second
play.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, with Smith and White waiving to the crowd for
noise, White manhandled fourth-year guard Spencer Folau out of the
way -- clearing a lane that Swann burst through to sack Tony Banks
for a 10-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Swann celebrated with his trademark windmill arm sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Folau left the game with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   But Carolina used the foursome sparingly and Baltimore had no
trouble moving the ball in their absence.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers, though, prevented the Ravens from capitalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Banks picked apart the Panthers on the next series, completing
three long passes to Qadry Ismail and a 15-yarder to Holmes. But
Holmes fumbled on the next play and Carolina's Doug Evans recovered
the ball on the 30 to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Two series' later, Banks completed a 32-yard pass to Shannon
Sharpe to set up Obafemi Ayanbadejo's 2-yard touchdown run that
tied it at 7 with 10:42 to play in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Banks left the game after that, finishing 7-of-12 for 116 yards
and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Dilfer, his replacement, was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer played the final three series' of the first half and
failed to get a single first down. He overthrew his receivers badly
on his first six passes and was sacked once for an 8-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   On his first series of the second half, he was intercepted by
Lester Towns.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered, though, with a 28-yard run up the middle, followed
by a 17-yard touchdown pass to Billy Davis that gave Baltimore a
14-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer finished 2-of-10 with a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens also got a 4-yard touchdown run from Jason Brookins
in the third quarter, and Matt Stover kicked a 44-yard field goal
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's offense was decent early, when quarterback Steve
Beuerlein made his first appearance of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't miss a beat on Carolina's first drive, using a mix of
short, quick passes and quarterback keepers. He completed all five
of his passes and capped a 10-play drive by zipping a 7-yard
touchdown pass between two defenders to Muhsin Muhammad for a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But he left after the first quarter and Carolina's backup
quarterbacks were just as bad as Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lewis missed his first seven passes. His eighth was
miraculously caught when tight end Kris Mangum pulled the high
floater in with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   He had one decent series, a 17-play series that set up Richie
Cunningham's 30-yard field goal. Lewis finished 7-of-17 for 58
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Third-stringer Dameyune Craig finished 4-of-10 for 30 yards and
an interception.

<HEADLINE> National Zoo Applies for 2 Pandas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Zoo has submitted a 182-page
application to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to import two
pandas named Mei Xiang and Tian Tian from China.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's Panda House has been vacant since giant panda
Hsing-Hsing died last November.
</P>
<P>
   In its application for a permit to import the animals, the zoo
said it would house Mei Xiang and Tian Tian in a refurbished Panda
House, enhanced with ''cool spot'' grottoes. The enhancements cost
about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo will pay $10 million to the Chinese Wildlife
Conservation Association to rent the pandas for 10 years. Chinese
officials have said that the payment will go for research and
conservation of the endangered animals. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian
currently live in the Wolong reserve in western China.
</P>
<P>
   China will retain ownership of the new pandas, as well as any
offspring that result.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported on its Web site Friday night that
the two pandas will help answer scientists' questions about panda
stress and panda play. Thirteen research projects have been built
around the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Mei Xiang, pronounced ''my sh-ong,'' is female, turned 2 years
old on July 22 and weighs about 115 pounds. Her name means
''beautiful fragrance.'' Tian Tian, pronounced ''t-yen t-yen,'' a
male, will turn 3 on Aug. 27 and weighs about 203 pounds. His name
means ''more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's Panda House has been empty since the elderly
Hsing-Hsing, suffering from terminal kidney disease, was
euthanized. His partner, Ling-Ling, died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The pair produced several cubs, but none survived more than a
few days. The new pandas have different mothers, increasing their
value as a possible breeding pair.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Confederate Flag Ban  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY R. BROWN

   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The University of Mississippi has the
legal right to ban spectators from waving Confederate flags at
campus athletic events, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision from the New Orleans court comes three years after
Richard Barrett, a lawyer for the white supremacist Nationalist
Movement, sued over the issue, claiming the ban violated his First
Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling upheld a decision last year from U.S. District
Judge Neal Biggers Jr., who called the ban a reasonable limitation.
</P>
<P>
   The ban covers umbrellas, alcoholic beverages, flags, and all
banners -- flags without sticks -- larger than 12 by 14 inches. The
ban was intended to keep the Confederate banner out of
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   University officials had cited safety concerns for the ban,
claiming the stick on the end of the flag could be considered
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased to learn of the court's decision,'' said
University of Mississippi attorney Mary Ann Connell.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said he will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is ironic that burning a flag is called free speech, but
waving it is not. I'm sticking in this ring until I knock the flag
haters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss officials adopted the flag policy in 1997, weeks after
former head football coach Tommy Tuberville asked fans not to wave
Confederate flags at games. Tuberville he didn't want the flag
associated with Ole Miss because of mixed perceptions of its
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Deuce McAllister, a senior running back at Ole Miss who is
considered a Heisman Trophy candidate, said he hoped the ruling
would end the fight over the flag because it hurts the university's
image.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely think it hurt recruiting,'' he said. ''It hurt
the chance of the school to advance to that next level.'' Coach
Tuberville really stepped up. He and Mr. Kyahat took firm stands in
their position on the flag.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings 35, Cardinals 17  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings beat Arizona 35-17
behind Daunte Culpepper's 311 yards passing and two touchdowns on
Friday night and seven Cardinals players left with injuries,
including receiver Rob Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Moore tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and
cornerback Coby Rhinehart tore two ligaments in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Johnny Rutledge sprained his knee in the first
quarter, according to initial reports from team officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Tom Knight injured his left hand in the first
quarter. In the third quarter, cornerback J.J. McCleskey broke his
right ankle and linebacker Ronald McKinnon bruised his right thigh
and didn't return. In the fourth quarter, Arizona linebacker Ray
Thompson sprained his left knee and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Knight, Thompson and McKinnon's was not known.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (1-2) built a 28-0 lead in the second quarter, on a
pair of rushing touchdown runs by Robert Smith and long scoring
passes from Culpepper to Randy Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (1-2) didn't score until 1:55 was left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Starters for both teams played until just a few minutes were
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper, anointed the starter by coach Dennis Green in the
spring after he was the No. 3 quarterback last season, had his best
game of the preseason, going 13-for-23 passing. Culpepper, who
threw three interceptions in Minnesota's first two preseason games,
also rushed for 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Moss had five catches for 164 yards and Carter caught two passes
for 81 yards. Smith rushed eight times for 53 yards before giving
way to Moe Williams in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' first-string offense struggled with quarterback
Jake Plummer, who was playing behind a patchwork offensive line.
Center Mike Gruttadauria and right guard Lester Holmes were
scratched with knee injuries and left guard Matt Joyce looked rusty
as he made his first appearance of the preseason after coming back
from rib and chest injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was sacked twice and knocked down several times in the
first quarter and Arizona went nearly 15 minutes without a first
down before its final drive of the half, which ended with a 49-yard
field goal by Cary Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Thomas Jones, battling Michael Pittman for the starting
job at running back, scored on a 4-yard run with 3:46 left in the
third quarter for the Cardinals and backup quarterback Dave Brown
threw a 12-yard strike to Mac Cody in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Minnesota's backup kicker Andy Crosland
had his 23-yard field-goal attempt blocked by Jordan Younger, but
the Vikings recovered when Mark Maddox blindly tried to lateral the
ball behind him and Nick O'Brien recovered the loose ball at the
24.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona did not commit a penalty.
