<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fund-inspired "window dressing"
and another massive surge in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp shares
helped the share market close the financial year on a high note
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
News Corp provided much of the boost after announcing earlier
Tuesday that it would float off a part of its U.S. entertainment
business under the Fox Group banner which analysts suggested could
raise up to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars for debt repayment and
possible acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
News' two shares surged over eight percent (ordinary shares up
1.08 Australian dollars to 13.18 Australian dollars and preferred
ones up 94 cents to 11.44 Australian dollars) after a bigger rise
in the U.S. market overnight.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index ended 47.3 points firmer at 2,668.4,
all industrials jumped 86.9 to 4,689.0 and all resources managed
to climb 14.8 to 1,037.4.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the broad gains were inspired by "window dressing"
by the major funds which drove up leading share prices ahead of
Tuesday's close of the financial year.
</P>
<P>
The bank sector was mixed, however, with leader National
Australia Bank down five cents at 21.30 Australian dollars,
Westpac bank up seven cents to 9.85 Australian dollars, the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia up 41 cents at 18.84 Australian
dollars and ANZ bank down nine cents at 11.14 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Diversified resources and mining company BHP was the only major
firms to enjoy a benefit from window dressing Tuesday, with a rise
of 46 cents to 13.65 Australian dollars, after renewed speculation
that embattled chairman Jerry Ellis may resign.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto shed much of Monday's boost with a 34
cent fall to 19.20 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were the exception after broad rises in the
mid-ranking producers in line ahead of the 3.30 U.S. dollar rise
in gold bullion by 16:20 (local time) Tuesday to 295.80 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall 553.9 million shares changed hands worth 716 million
U.S. dollars, with rising stocks outnumbering falling ones by 729
to 584.

<HEADLINE> Israel Calls for Direct Talks With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
Tuesday urged the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to resume
direct negotiations with Israel to discuss implementing the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Israeli Foreign Ministry Eitan Bentsur
issued the call when he signed here an agreement with PNA chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat on extending the Temporary International
Presence in Hebron (TIPH) in the West Bank city Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur said that while the international community is helpful,
the two sides should develop "various channels for dialog at
different levels" to move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We should not transfer our dialog and mutual contacts to
countries that are far away, nor to mediators, but we should
choose the path required by peace -- the path of direct
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the just-signed agreement, Israel and the PNA agreed to
extend the participation of Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland and Turkey in TIPH operations for a period of three
months starting on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The task of the 122-member TIPH, established in January 1997
under the Hebron agreement, is promoting a feeling of security for
the Palestinians in Hebron, assisting the execution of projects
initiated by the donor countries and encouraging economic
development and growth in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel handed over 80 percent of Hebron to the PNA in January
last year, but it has retained control over the rest of the city
to protect 450 Jewish settlers living in the center.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur praised the TIPH for its role in helping "overcome the
rivalries (between the Israelis and the Palestinians) of the past
and the friction of the present."
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also PNA minister of local governments, urged Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to "respond to the American
initiative positively" to reach an agreement "bigger" than the one
he signed with Bentsur.
</P>
<P>
"We have no other choice but to exert every possible effort to
revive the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that Israel withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a tougher
PNA crackdown on terrorism. Despite the PNA's acceptance of the
plan, Israel has rejected it citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled since
March last year due to Israel's settlement expansion and delay in
carrying out the further troop redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Chechnya Membership in U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday strongly opposed
Chechnya's entry into the United Nations, saying it merely a
member of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Only states recognized internationally can claim membership in
the body, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for the Russian
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Chechnya cannot be regarded as such state for it is an
integral part of Russia -- that is the stance of the Russian
Foreign Ministry" he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remark came in reaction to Chechen Foreign
Minister Movladi Udugov's announcement Monday on Chechnya's
intended application for U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
Udugov said a package of documents had been compiled confirming
Chechnya as an independent state. The documents included the
Chechen Constitution and a peace treaty signed last May between
Russia and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya won de facto independence from Moscow in the wake of
the 1994-1996 war, which officially ended with the signing of a
peace accord in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin wants Chechnya to stay within the Russian
Federation and only offers autonomous status for the volatile
region, while the Chechnya leadership insists that the region is
already an independent entity.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams stormed into the
Wimbledon quarterfinals Tuesday by trouncing the Virginia
Ruano-Pascual who knocked her sister out the tournament a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Williams used an all-court game to route Virginia Ruano-Pascual
6-3, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a fourth-round meeting between Venus and her
sister was dashed Monday when 16-year-old Serena Williams failed
to get past Ruano-Pascual. Citing a calf injury, Serena quit the
third-round match while trailing 7-5, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
The other quarterfinalists were defending champion Martina
Hingis, last year's runnerup Jana Novotna and French Open champion
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Hingis beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3,
6-2, No. 3 Novotna downed No. 10 Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 and No. 5
Sanchez Vicario rallied for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Dominique Van
Roost.
</P>
<P>
Williams will face Novotna in the quarters, while Hingis will
play Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras was scheduled to
face French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean in a fourth-round match.
Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, was due to
face Wayne Ferreira for a place in the quarters.

<HEADLINE> Teen Girls Take Great Sex Risks in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian teenagers are at greater
risk than ever in the past from unsafe sex, "The Globe and Mail"
newspaper on Tuesday quoted a panel as warning.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which was
holding its annual meeting in Victoria from Monday, announced that
the number of teenage pregnancies in Canada rose 18 percent from
1987 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend is continuing, and as many as 50 percent of
teenage pregnancies are unintended, figures from the meeting
showed.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of abortions for young women between
15 and 19 is 50 percent higher than the increase among women aged
20 and older.
</P>
<P>
Teenage girls had the highest rates of sexually transmitted
diseases of any group, and the rate of chlamydia in the 15 to 19
age group was nine times the average among all women, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended that parents should be just as involved
as teachers and doctors in teaching their children about sex and
contraception.
</P>
<P>
The panel requested that doctors make sexual health a central
part of basic health care, and the use of condoms be promoted for
all sexual encounters.

<HEADLINE> GM1 Could Slow Parkinson's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A naturally occurring substance
shows promise of slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease,
says a report by Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Jay S. Schneider of the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, and colleagues, tested an
experimental drug known as GM1 ganglioside on 45 patients with
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
After 16 weeks of receiving the drug, those taking the
substance scored better in tests that measure stiffness and other
physical variables compared with patients who received a placebo.
Those who took the real drug said they were better able to perform
basic daily activities such as dressing themselves and handling
utensils.
</P>
<P>
The new drug is a normal part of the cell membrane that plays
an important role in cell growth, development and repair.
Parkinson's is caused by the death of cells in the brain that make
the chemical messenger dopamine.

<HEADLINE> China Spends Nearly 5.6 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's central government has
spent nearly 5.6 million U.S. dollars in the prevention and
control of HIV/AIDS in the past decade, said a Chinese official
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1987 the central government established a special fund for
HIV/AIDS prevention and control, vice health minister Yin Dakui
told the 12th World AIDS Conference being held in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The central government provided 1.3 million dollars for the
period 1987-1994, and another 4.28 million from 1995 to 1997,
according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, all levels of government have been required
to include in their financial budgets the resourcing necessary to
implement HIV/AIDS prevention plans and to increase this financial
input if it is required as a result of changes in the epidemic
situation.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted the principle of government as the primary
provider of the resources, with financial burdens distributed
among different levels and funding from multiple sources, Yin
said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the international community for its assistance in
the HIV/AIDS prevention work in China.
</P>
<P>
China has established cooperative relationships with
international organizations like the Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS, The U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Children's
Fund, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the U.N. Fund
for Population Activities, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations resident coordinator in China
Arthur Holcome, the cumulative total support from international
organizations to China was 17.4 million dollars up to 1996.

<HEADLINE> Duisenberg: Euro Not Cure-All for European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, June 30 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Central Bank (ECB), Wim Duisenberg, warned Tuesday that the single
European currency, the euro, is not a cure-all for economic
problems of many European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony in Frankfurt marking the founding of the
ECB, Duisenberg said the new central bank had a clear mandate of
maintaining price stability in the whole euro area which includes
11 EU countries that will adopt the euro in the first wave in
January next year.
</P>
<P>
"By fulfilling its mandate it will contribute to creating the
appropriate conditions for sustainable growth of incomes and
employment: the ultimate goals of economic policy," Duisenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also stressed that the monetary policy of the ECB
must be supported by sound fiscal and economic policies of
national governments of euro member states.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, price stability can only be maintained at a high
cost in terms of lost income and employment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar view was also voiced by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
in a speech to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It is without doubt that the euro is not a magic prescription
which can solve the problem of high unemployment in many European
countries overnight," Kohl said, adding that what were necessary
were to achieve more flexibility on the job markets and to conduct
more structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"When everyone of us does his national homework, the euro will
open the great chance for new economic dynamic, sustainable growth
and secure jobs in the 21st century," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
As a historic project of the European integration, the euro is
to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 11 EU countries to join the euro on that date are Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted not to join the club in
the first wave while Greece has failed to meet the membership
criteria set by the EU Maastricht Treaty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. F-16 Fires Missile on Iraq Radar Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A United States F-16 fighter
fired a missile at an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in
southern Iraq early on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at about 5:30 GMT near Basra in southern
Iraq. Coalition aircraft were conducting Operation Southern Watch,
the name given to the deny-flight mission which dates from the
aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi radar at the site had illuminated four British Tornados
patrolling the no-fly zone, signaling its intention to fire on the
jets, said Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges. That act
prompted the American response.
</P>
<P>
"Coalition aircraft pilots assigned to Joint Task
Force-Southwest Asia received cockpit indications that they were
being targeted by a missile site," said Navy Lt. John O'Neal,
spokesman for the U.S. Command, the joint military headquarters
responsible for the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"This is considered an action requiring aggressive defensive
measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
The missile fired by the F-16, which accompanied the flight of
British Tornados, was a high-speed anti-radiation, or HARM missile.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the coalition flights returned safely to their
bases in Saudi Arabia without further incident.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant O'Neal said he had no reports of any further hostile
activity by Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Advance with 1-0 Victory over Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BORDEAUX, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Croatia advanced into the
quarter-finals after beating Romania 1-0 in a match far below
expectation.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played cautiously in the first half and the pace
was slow, perhaps because of the heat. The Romanians dominated the
first 10 minutes of play but soon gave the advantage to the Coratian
team.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian team had their first shot at the 10th minute and
since then they never looked back.
</P>
<P>
Aljosa Asanovic outshone Romanian playmaker Gheorghe Hagi who
looked tired in the match while Davor Suker and Zvonimir Boban posed
greater threat to the Romanian goal.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock was broken at the 44th minute when the Croatians
were awarded a penalty kick. Suker made no mistake in converting
the shot to put his team 1-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian team made three substitutions in the second half,
trying to get an equaliser. But their efforts were all let down by
their poor finishing.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian team had several more scoring chances in the second
half, but the shots from Boban, Asanovic and Suker were all blocked
by the brave Romanian goal-keeper Bogdan Stelea.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian team were disallowed at least two Penalty shots in
the last minutes by the Argentine referee and had to settle for the
1-0 defeat.

WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New york Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and his entourage came to China's
largest city Monday evening. To put his finger on the vibrant
pulse of modern China, his aides said, Mr. Clinton will spend two
days and three nights here talking to regular people.
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of Serbian special police units and troops, backed
by artillery, tanks and other heavy armor, opened a series of
attacks against separatist rebel positions Monday morning. The
Serbs reported that an eight-year-old ethnic Albanian boy had been
killed and a man wounded. More than 8, 000 people were forced to
flee their homes in Belacevac and take refuge in nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Washington and Baltimore will make an unprecedented joint
bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, organizers are set to announce
Tuesday, hoping to resolve a bitter behind-the-scenes battle over
the right to lead an effort that could bring billions of dollars
to the region.
</P>
<P>
-- The effort to reduce mother-to-child transmission of the
AIDS virus in poor African countries may be harder than people
think, and one of the main obstacles may be the pregnant women
themselves. Information presented at the 12th World AIDS
Conference Monday suggests that fear of rejection, and even of
physical harm, by family and neighbors may keep many women from
learning whether they are infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Two Midwestern banks are close to a merger that could be
valued at 5 billion or more dollars in stock, say people familiar
with the situation. A merger of Cincinnati's Star Banc and Firstar
of Milwaukee would create a company with about 625 branches in
eight states.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's President Weizman urged early elections because of
a deadlock in peace talks with the Palestinians, but Prime
Minister Netanyahu dismissed the idea. Israel's President has no
authority to set elections, but his call could affect public
opinion.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to Keep HIV Infections Below 1.5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China will try to keep the number
of HIV infections below 1.5 million by 2010, said vice health
minister Yin Dakui here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Provided that HIV prevalence among the adult population in
China can be kept below 0.2 percent, the best achievable target by
2010 is to keep the number of HIV infections below 1.5 million,"
Yin told the 12th World AIDS Conference being held in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The medium and long term plan for the prevention and control of
AIDS (1998-2010) has been formulated by the departments under the
State Council. Its objective up to the year 2010 is to keep the
prevalence of HIV infection in the Chinese adult population at a
relatively low level for the global context.
</P>
<P>
As for the medium objectives for HIV prevention and control by
2002, those outlined in the plan include halting the transmission
of HIV through blood collection and supply; controlling the rapid
spread of HIV in intravenous drug users; and bringing down the
increasing annual rate of sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
incidence to under 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The goal of AIDS prevention and control is to establish a
comprehensive prevention and control system and to disseminate
information about HIV/AIDS prevention among the Chinese
population, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the above-mentioned goal, he said, China will
intensify publicity and education on HIV/AIDS by using all forms
of press media.
</P>
<P>
Yin said that knowledge of AIDS prevention and control should
be integrated into the curriculum in high schools and
universities. Condom promotion should be encouraged according to
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The law on AIDS infection control should be established and the
formulation of regulations and rules should be sped up, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
From the identification of the first case of HIV infection in
China in 1985 to the end of March 1998, a cumulative total of more
than 10 million people underwent testing for HIV antibodies, 9,970
cases of HIV infection were reported in individuals in 30
provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities, according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been 290 cases of AIDS, and 173 deaths
in China. HIV infections in ethnic minorities account for 36.3
percent of the total cumulative reported infections for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug users account for 66.9 percent of all those
infected with HIV, Yin said. The proportion attributable to sexual
transmission is rising annually.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Favors Full Partnership Ties With Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June, 30 (Xinhua) -- The visiting French President
Jacques Chirac said here Tuesday that France wishes to establish
"all-round economic partnership ties" with Angola.
</P>
<P>
At a special parliamentary meeting held in his honor, Chirac
said that the French government would like to offer aid for the
development of Angola, adding that he also wishes Angola to
become a "all-round economic partner", in which the private
sectors are a dynamic in investment and promoting the diversity
of trade.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that his government would continue to aid Angola
in its economic and social development. During Chirac's current
visit, the two sides decided to strengthen cooperation in
education, health, culture, and rural development.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Angolan counterpart
Eduardo dos Santos, the French president said that it is
necessary to reach certain agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) when a country is faced with a crisis or
difficulty, though the agreement might be conditioned.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he would try to persuade IMF to take a
flexible attitude toward Angola.
</P>
<P>
On Angola's 800 million French Franc debt, Chirac called for
the joint effort by the the international community to write off
Angola's debt.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is on Angola's side in this issue.
</P>
<P>
France and Angola signed a guiding agreement for the two
countries' future cooperation, a press cooperation accord on
training Agolan journalists, a trade accord and an Agreement on
civil aviation cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The French president arrived in Luanda for a two-day visit to
Angola with an aim to boost economic ties with Angola.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Too Much to Expect From Indo-Pak Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- How much should people expect
from next month's meeting between Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the
fringes of a SAARC summit in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka?
</P>
<P>
Sharif and Vajpayee would be sitting together in Colombo in
late July at the 10th summit of the seven-nation South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Both Pakistan and
India have announced the two leaders would hold an important
bilateral meeting there.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting between the two leaders after
India conducted five nuclear tests and Pakistan responded with six
of its own last month, causing increased tension between them and
in South Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests have added heat to the unresolved Kashmir
dispute and the deep animosity and distrust between Pakistan and
India which had already fought three wars since their independence
some 50 years ago, putting the region under the threat of nuclear
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests, which have also put a strong global
nonproliferation regime at risk, have again highlighted the
immediate need for the two arch-rivals in South Asia to solve the
problems bedeviling their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The international community, while condemning the shocking
actions by India and Pakistan, has been urging the two countries
to take urgent and effective steps to improve their strained ties
for the sake of a peaceful, stable and prosperous South Asia.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy,
Alvaro de Soto, is currently visiting the region to consult with
countries concerned about the role of the U.N. in reducing the
tension between Pakistan and India. Annan has expressed his
readiness to mediate between the two countries and said that he
himself will visit the region "at right time."
</P>
<P>
Most recently, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, in their joint statement on South Asia
issued in Beijing on Saturday, reaffirmed their countries'
commitment to prevent a nuclear and missile race in the region and
to "assist, where possible, India and Pakistan to resolve
peacefully the difficult and long-standing differences between
them, including the issue of Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the resumption of dialogue between the two
countries and encouraged them to continue such dialogue, saying:
"We stand ready to assist in the implementation of
confidence-building measures between them and encourage the
consideration of additional measures of this type."
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, next-month's encounter between Sharif
and Vajpayee has assumed a particular dimension as people are
pinning high hopes on the meeting to revitalize the foreign
secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India, which broke down
last September in New Delhi. The foreign secretary-level talks
have been considered essential for the improvement of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
However, some observers have cautioned people against expecting
too much from the forthcoming Sharif-Vajpayee meeting, as neither
Pakistan nor India has shown any significant change in their
positions on reopening the foreign secretary-level talks and the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir, whose sovereignty was left unresolved when India and
Pakistan became independent in 1947, is seen as the core
impediment in improving their ties.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan insists that the talks be resumed with an active
international engagement, on the basis of the agreement reached
here by the two sides last June under which eight issues including
peace and security and Kashmir would be discussed in future talks.
</P>
<P>
But India refuses any third-party intervention, and demands the
talks be held just on a bilateral basis and in light of proposals
it made to Pakistan in January which Pakistan has rejected as
"unrealistic and unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
India has refused to receive U.N. envoy De Soto, and rejected
Japan's offer to host a Pakistani-Indian meeting on Kashmir in
Tokyo and the Sino-U.S. joint statement on South Asia while
Pakistan has welcomed all these international initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan Sunday said De
Soto's visit represented "a first step towards an effective and
sustained engagement by the United Nations on the issue of peace
and security in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with De Soto Sunday
evening, Gohar said: "We hope that the Colombo meeting (between
Sharif and Vajpayee) would make some progress to resolve the core
issue of Kashmir," he said. "I don't have much hope... there will
be more or less the same in the meeting."
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that although it would be unrealistic to
expect some breakthrough in the Sharif-Vajpayee meeting, people
still hope it would generate some momentum and hope, or at least
some confidence-building measures, for the acceleration of the
reconciliation process between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have been on bad terms with each other for a
long time and both have been spending billions of dollars on their
defenses to keep themselves ready for wars.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998-1999 fiscal budget, India has increased its
military spending by 14 percent to the tune of 10 billion U.S.
dollars, and Pakistan has increased its defense outlay by 8.4
percent to about 3.3 billion dollars despite their serious
financial difficulties compounded by economic sanctions imposed by
the West for their nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
In this game of numbers and arms race, the losers are only
their already fragile economies, analysts said, adding that the
Pakistani-Indian animosity has also dented the hope of achieving
any meaningful economic cooperation among the SAARC countries.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Parliament Approves Budget for New Fiscal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's parliament on Tuesday
approved the budget for the 1998-99 fiscal year beginning July 1
through the passage of the appropriation bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill authorizes the government to withdraw a total amount
of 404.53 billion taka (about 8.79 billion U.S. dollars) from the
consolidate fund to meet its expenditure during the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the parliament passed 92 demands for grant by voice
vote, and rejected all the cut motions by the opposition members
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The budget was passed following the approval on Monday of the
Finance Bill 1998, to come into effect on July 1, after Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria withdrew or reduced taxes, duties and
value-added taxes on 16 items.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the proposals for enhanced taxes and duties
were based on the discussion on the budget by the opposition
members of parliament, suggestions offered by different business
bodies and comments made in newspapers, the finance minister told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal or reduction of the new taxation proposals would
cause a revenue loss of over 277 million taka (about 6 million
U.S. dollars), and the government would make good the loss by
initiating appropriate administrative measures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hails U.N. Resolutions on Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus applauded Tuesday the
United Nations Security Council for adopting two resolutions on
renewing the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, government spokesman
Chirstos Stylianides said Cyprus is satisfied with the two
resolutions which "confirm the framework and the principles which
should govern a Cyprus solution and the basis of intercommunal
talks."
</P>
<P>
The resolutions 1178 and 1179 were unanimously passed by the
Security Council on Monday. They renewed the mandate of the
U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) until December 31,
1998, and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission of good
offices in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the resolutions are very important because
they are "clear reference to a single sovereignty and
international personality and a single citizenship."
</P>
<P>
He termed the resolutions as a U.N. reply "to the efforts by
Turkey and (Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf) Denktash to undermine the
status of the Republic of Cyprus and upgrade the self-styled
Turkish Cypriot regime."
</P>
<P>
But Stylianides expressed regret that the Security Council
refrained from blaming the Turkish side "more clearly" for its
intransigence and the lack of progress in Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, Denktash has refused to resume the
negotiations with the Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides
unless his breakaway entity in northern Cyprus is recognized and
the Cypriot government suspends its accession talks with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP was deployed in 1964, four years after Cyprus
gained independence from Britain, when inter-communal clashes
broke out between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong UNFICYP troops have been patrolling along the
180-kilometer-long buffer zone separating the Turkish troops
stationed in the north from the Greek Cypriot National Guards in
the south.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying to reunite the divided island as a
bizonal and bicommunal federation through peace talks, but so far
no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> 10 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ten members of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) were killed Tuesday in a clash with the
Turkish security forces in the southeast of the country, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that a group of PKK militants opened fire
at guards of Bagisli village in Hakkari province late Monday
night, leaving three of them dead and three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
After the clash, the Turkish security forces rushed to the
village and fought against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's National Security Council Monday decided to extend the
state of emergency for another four months starting from July 30
in the eastern and southeastern provinces, where the PKK rebels
often launch attacks on military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a war since 1984 in an attempt to
establish an independent Kurdish state in the southeast. More than
35,000 people have been killed.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ban on Fresh Fish Imports from Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union lift ban on
fresh fish imports from Kenya beginning from Wednesday, head of
EU regional delegation Luc Saltzman announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyans can export fish to the European community starting
tomorrow (July 1). The remaining health and sanitary problems
will continue being reviewed and the final decision will be made
in January next year," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission banned the imports of fresh fish from
Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique in January this year on
the account of a possible contamination with cholera.
</P>
<P>
The ban does not affect frozen fish which are subject to
"systematic six-day laboratory testing," according to the EU
office here.
</P>
<P>
It's not known so far if the EU has lift the similar ban on
the other three African countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, EU's Permanent Veterinary Committee recommended the
ban be lifted as early as July 1.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's fishing industry is based at Kisumu on Lake Victoria
and at the coast. With water hyacinth already clogging up
Kisumu's port, the EU ban dealt a major blow to the area's
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that in 1996, Kenya exported 12 million
kilograms of fresh and frozen fish valued at 18.7 billion
Shillings (315 million U.S. Dollars) to EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands was the largest market, taking 843 million
Shillings (14.1 million Dollars), with France, Germany and Italy
next in line.
</P>
<P>
The problem started last year when a bacterium called
salmonella was detected in some imported Lake Victoria Nile Perch
in Spain and Italy. EU then tightened its checks on imported fish
from this region.

<HEADLINE> Interview: SAARC Countries Make Progress in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Great progress has been made in
the field of agriculture in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region on account of cooperation
among the member countries, a SAARC official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liaquat Ali Choudhury, director at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat, said SAARC has two technical committees separately on
agriculture and rural development through which it formulates and
undertakes programs.
</P>
<P>
In the field of agriculture, a priority area of cooperation
among the member countries which are basically agricultural
countries, the emphasis has been placed on production of food
grains, cash crops, livestock and fishery as well as preservation
of natural resources such as land and water which are vital for
the sector, he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said great progress has been made in the field with food
production having been increased manifold.
</P>
<P>
Though some member countries are still not self-sufficient in
food due to overpopulation, the SAARC countries have avoided any
major famine. "This is really a great achievement for all the
SAARC countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Food Security Reserve, which serves as a
cushion against food shortage in the region, became operational in
1988. Though no major food crisis has hit the region since then,
all the member countries have food reserves at specific locations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that there are still scopes for boosting
agricultural production, so nowadays the emphasis is being placed
on development of indigenous technologies and their wide
dissemination.
</P>
<P>
He said that in its meeting held last October in New Delhi, the
technical committee on agriculture conducted a major thematic
discussion on agricultural perspective for South Asia to the year
2020.
</P>
<P>
The meeting underscored the need for realization of the full
potential of science and technology for sustained growth in
agricultural production in the region.
</P>
<P>
It also highlighted the importance of promoting intra-regional
cooperation to raise productivity in the member countries to the
world level.
</P>
<P>
In September in Dhaka, Bangladesh, there will be a workshop on
transfer of technology, to be organized by the SAARC Agricultural
Information Center, he said. The workshop, the first of its kind
in the region, will focus on replicable technologies in the region
and new and frontier technologies on agriculture in the world.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC region is one of the poorest in the world and the
majority of its 1.2 billion population live in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
On rural development, the concerned technical committee has
accorded priorities on how to eradicate poverty from the rural
areas of member countries, how to generate employment in the most
cost-effective manner and how to best develop the rural
infrastructure, Director Choudhury said.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, more and more emphasis is being placed on making
rural credit available on a wide scale to the rural poor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the member countries also cooperate in providing
housing and skill-oriented training to them.
</P>
<P>
Under the SAARC youth and volunteers scheme, youth and
volunteers are brought together in a member country where there
are successful programs. In this way, they can help member
countries share the experience and draw the lessons, he said.
</P>
<P>
While great progress has been made, only 10 to 20 percent of
the huge potential has been tapped by member countries for
cooperation in agriculture and rural development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"SAARC is only now beginning to realize the potential of
regional cooperation," he explained. "Since the SAARC
institutional structure is still not that elaborate, we could not
achieve what we should have. But I think gradually, if we can put
our efforts together, we can achieve much more."
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote economic and trade
cooperation among its seven member countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> UK Home Price Rises Slow As Mortgage Lending Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain rose by an
average of 11.3 percent in the year to June, down from an annual
rate of increase of 11.9 percent in May, Nationwide, Britain's
largest building society said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of property transactions in May totalled just
108,000, the lowest figure in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
David Parry, Nationwide's divisional director of planning,
said: "Supply shortages are still dogging the market, with estate
agents recording very low levels of stock."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts fear that, with the Bank of England considering
further interest rate rises and unemployment likely to rise later
this year, the market could even go into reverse.
</P>
<P>
Separate figures published by the Bank reveal that much of the
activity in the mortgage market is a result of existing homeowners
taking advantage of some competitive deals to remortgate their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Net mortgage lending fell sharply from 2.3 billion pounds (3.68
billion U.S. dollars) in April to 1.8 billion (2.88 billion U.S.
dollars) in May and now stands below the level recorded at the
same point last year.

MAPUTO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Cars and trucks shuttled along the

Maputo, and a few youngsters bask in the sun along the street,
while businessmen were bustling in the free market Tuesday when
local elections were being held nationwide.
</P>
<P>
A woman official working at Coop polling station said that
everything seemed to have gone normally except for the unexpected

Joaquim Chissano, Chairman of the ruling Mozambican Liberation
Front (Frelimo), said after casting vote at Josina Machel
station, that there should not and could not be any turmoil for
the election.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that the government had done a lot, including
the education of voters and the preparation against violence, for
the election.

<P>
On the opposition Mozambican National Resistance Movement

said that Remano has the legal right to do so, as long as it is
doing this in a peaceful way.

Renamo's Chairman, Afonao Dhlakama, said Sunday that his

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Missile Attack Serves as Warning to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Tuesday the United States was firing a missile on
Iraq's radar site to warn Baghdad that it should not intervene
with U.S. and its allies' patrol mission over the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was commenting on the missile attack by a U.S. F-16
fighter at an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in southern
Iraq early on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly was a signal that we sent that our forces are
going to fly the no-fly zone," he spoke to a Reuters TV
interview after attending a seminar with other NATO defense
ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the situation won't escalate," he added.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman said the F-16 fired a high-speed
anti-radiation missile at the Iraqi missile battery because the
Iraqi radar at the battery site locked onto four British
Tornadoes conducting patrol mission over the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at about 5:30 GMT near the city of
Basra in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Central Command based in Tampa, Florida, which overseas
U.S. operations in the Gulf said pilots received cockpit
indications that "they were being targeted by a missile site."
</P>
<P>
"This is considered an action requiring aggressive defensive
measures," a spokesman for the Central Command said.
</P>
<P>
The F-16 was accompanied by a flight of British Tornados when
it fired the missile at the Iraqi radar site. Afterwards, they
returned safely to their bases in Saudi Arabia without further
incident.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Central Command plans to order an immediate resumption
of the patrols.

<P>
LUANDA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The visiting French President
Jacques Chirac has been asked by his Angolan counterpart Eduardo
dos Santos to do his bit for the Angolan peace process by using
his "influence and prestige".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with the visiting French
president Tuesday, Dos Santos asked the French government to take actions
to help Angolan people win final peace as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said that his government would continue to
cooperate with the Angolan joint peace committee, the United
Nations, and the three observer nations of Portugal, Russia, and
the United States, to re-start dialogue to promote peace.
</P>
<P>
On the reconstruction after the civil war, the Angolan
president said that a lot of help would be needed from the
international community for rebuilding the country, whose
infrastrcture facilities have been ruined during the 30 years of
war.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S. Missile Attack on Missile Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Tuesday slammed missile
attack by the United States on a missile site in the southern
province of Basra, saying "it is an aggressive and unjustifiable
action."
</P>
<P>
"It is another proof of aggressiveness of the Americans, and it
is a clear evidence of their aggressiveness of the security and
sovereignty of the Iraqi people," the spokesman of the Iraqi
Ministry of Information and Culture said.
</P>
<P>
An American F-16 fighter fired an anti-radiation missile at
around 0530GMT at an Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British officials said that an Iraqi radar at the
missile site illuminated four British patrol planes, prompting the
American response.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman denied the allegation, saying "no radar has
been opened at all."
</P>
<P>
"It might be a step toward planning a new all-out aggression
against Iraq by preparing the grounds for such acts," he added.
</P>
<P>
The missile fell 18 kilometers from the nearest radar, the
spokesman said, adding that it hit some water tanks that are 12
kilometers north of Um-Khasir City in Basra Province.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. F-16 fighter which fired the missile was accompanying
a flight of British planes enforcing the no-fly zone in southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
British officials have reportedly said that no further action
is planned, and that the allied flights over the southern no-fly
zone resumed normal flights.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone was imposed by U.S., British and French forces
in 1991 with a claimed aim of protecting Shiite Muslim Iraqis from
alleged government oppression. An extension of the zone in 1996
reaches the 33rd parallel.

<HEADLINE> World Steel Capacity Build-up from 1997-2000 Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- World crude steel-making capacity
from 1997 to 2000 will not exceed 56 million tons because major
steel projects in Asia have been postponed or cancelled following
the financial crisis, said the United Nations Economic Commission
for Europe (UN/ECE) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That is 32.7 million tons less than previously forecast, said
the UN/ECE in its annual review, The Steel Market in 1997 and
Prospects for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Based on a survey of the four-year period 1997-2000, the UN/ECE
review concludes that total new crude steel-making capacity in
North America and Asia should reach a maximum of 56.0 million
tons: 9.0 million tons in North America and 47.0 million tons in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE believed that these "exciting" figures show that the
world steel industry can look forward to a "positive spin-off"
from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the UN/ECE said, the United States has
continued to install new facilities on the back of good steel
demand. The country's buoyant financial markets also lent support
to raise funds for the projects.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Call for Dissolution of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Angered by the Majlis' (parliament)
dismissal of former interior minister, thousands of Iranian
pro-moderate students Tuesday called for dissolution of the
conservative Majlis.
</P>
<P>
"Majlis, Dissolve Majlis, Dissolve," the students shouted at a
rally in support of the dismissed Abdollah Nouri at the technical
faculty of Tehran University, which was arranged by a pro-moderate
students' group Unity Consolidation Office (UCO).
</P>
<P>
Holding pictures of President Mohammad Khatami, the students
also chanted "Khatami, Khatami, we support you," and "Students
Aware, Impeachment (against Nouri) Unjust."
</P>
<P>
Although Nouri and Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani strongly called on the students not to shout
radical slogans, the exciting participants condemned the
conservatives for making troubles for the government.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, speakers lashed out at the conservatives for
their efforts to weaken Khatami's government, including the
inflicting of "serious damages to the Islamic system and the
country" through ousting Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was sacked on June 21 by the conservative Majlis with
a censure motion, despite the fact that Khatami threw all his
weight behind Nouri. In a swift reaction, Khatami appointed Nouri
as vice president for development and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
A student leader said at the gathering that Nouri's dismissal
was predefined because it happened at a time "when the Iranian
people are attracted by world cup football matches and the
students are busy for examinations."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the conservative Majlis deputies for their
decision against the people's will, saying that any move against
the people's will would be detrimental to the country and the
Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
The students reiterated their support for the government of
Khatami, calling for reforms in some of the country's state
institutions, such as radio and television, the judiciary and the
police.

ATHENS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday hailed the U.N.
resolutions on the Cyprus problem as "positive".
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis said that the
resolutions passed Monday by the U.N. Security Council on the
Cyprus problem indirectly attributed responsibility for the
breakdown in talks between the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities of the island with the Turkish-Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the Security Council's insistence that any
settlement of the Cyprus problem should be based on the creation
of one state with single sovereignty, a single international
entity and single citizenship.
</P>
<P>
He said it was particularly positive that the resolutions came
at a time when Turkey was trying to reset its objectives with
respect to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey must now realize that the international community was
not willing to discuss any solution other than one based on a
bizonal, bicommunal federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive
coup-backed by Athens.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Policy on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- In response to President Ezer
Weizman's criticism on his policy, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday stressed that he will not change his
stance in the peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Television, Netanyahu said
that he is struggling for the security of the country and wants to
reach a "good agreement" with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said that Weizman should urge the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to implement the
commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman was only asking the United States to impose
pressure on the Israeli government and also expressing his
understanding with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Netanyahu added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also noted that the personal attack on him
by Weizman is not good for the country.
</P>
<P>
Weizman Monday called for the Knesset (parliament) to be
dissolved and new general elections to be held "as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to indicate a crisis of confidence between
the two leaders resulted from the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is currently under pressure from the
United States and the PNA to accept a U.S. peace initiative in a
bid to break the deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has formally accepted the proposal, which reportedly
calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians during the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But the Netanyahu government rejected the proposed scope of
withdrawal, citing that any redeployment of more than 9 percent
would endanger the security interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman accused the government of failing to make progress in
the peace process and urged Netanyahu to immediately break the
deadlock over the extent of the further pullback.

ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Parliament on Tuesday
voted to extend the mission on monitoring northern Iraq, known as
Northern Watch, for another six months.
</P>

"The government's request has been accepted," Deputy Speaker
Kamer Genc told the semi-official Anatolia News Agency following

Iraq lost its effective control of northern Iraq following the

<HEADLINE> Gore Says US to Respond "Decisively" to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
said on Tuesday that the United States would respond decisively to
any hostile acts by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to patrol the no-fly zone to reduce the
threat that Saddam Hussein poses to the region and we will
continue to respond decisively to any hostile acts that threaten
the lives of our pilots," Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Gore made the comment after a U.S. F-16 fighter fired a
missile at an Iraqi radar site near Basra in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 5:30 when pilots of four British
Tornadoes patrolling the no-fly zone in southern Iraq received
cockpit indications that they were targeted by a the Iraqi radar
at a surface-to-air missile battery near Basra. The F-16,
accompanying the flight of the tornadoes immediately responded
with firing a high-speed anti-radiation missile at the radar
site.
</P>
<P>
Gore said Washington did not know whether the incident in
which Iraqi radar "locked on" to the British aircraft was a
deliberate provocation and he urged people not to jump to
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know for certain but I would urge you not to assume
that it's a deliberate provocation. We don't know for certain,"
he told reporters. "But we do know from the history of
patrolling the no-fly zone that there are a lot of incidents
like this from time to time and there are other possible
explanations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq condemned the U.S. firing of the missile,
saying it was "an aggressive and unjustifiable action."
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official said the U.S. missile that was fired landed
at a distance of 18 km from the nearest Iraqi radar.
</P>
<P>
He said the missile attack "might be a step toward planning
for a new all-out aggression against Iraq."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businessman Deported From S. Leone for Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. businessman, Roger Crooks,
has been deported from Sierra Leone for alleged link with arms
trafficking involving Northern Ireland guerrillas, media reports
reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
James Kakanyako, a police commissioner, was quoted as saying
in Freetown Monday that last Sunday Crooks was put on a plane
which left the Sierra Leonean capital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Crooks was given 48 hours to pack his baggage, and yesterday
afternoon was escorted to Lungi airport into the plane that took
him out of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police commissioner declined to give any more details of
the alleged arms deal, but he said that "Crooks was deported for
trafficking in arms from Northern Ireland to Sierra Leone and the
other way around."
</P>
<P>
A report, however, quoted senior aides to President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah as saying that Crooks was expelled in connection
with plans to supply arms to the military junta that toppled
Kabbah in a coup last May but was flushed out in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Crooks was said to be an influential figure in Sierra Leone,
where he had a wide range of business, including operating the
country's top hotel, the Mammy Yoko Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Since Kabbah's resuming office in March, about 23 businessmen,
mainly Lebanese, have been deported for alleged links with the
toppled military junta, a report said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Ousted Minister Vows to Fight for Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's ousted Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri Tuesday vowed to continue his fight for public
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a pro-moderate student gathering at Tehran
University, Nouri said the religion of Islam is for freedom and
democracy which are legitimate rights of the people under the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised why some people who are afraid that the
constitution is implemented, and the freedom and democracy defined
by the constitution are given to the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a firm supporter of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, was impeached by the conservative-dominated Majlis
(Parliament) on June 21 in a vote of no-confidence. He was later
appointed Vice President for Development and Social Affairs by
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Since Khatami, an advocate for social reforms and freedom, was
elected president in May last year, the rift between the moderates
and conservatives has been deepened.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that the heaviest blow to Islam is depicting it
as a religion of strangulation and tyranny.
</P>
<P>
His speech was frequently interrupted by students' slogans in
support of him and Khatami.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nouri lashed out at the conservatives for limiting
the power of Khatami, saying that "they fight his programs with
ever more strength and determination."
</P>
<P>
During a farewell ceremony at the Interior Ministry, Nouri said
that he is more concerned about the future of Khatami because the
conservatives want to "throw a spoke into the wheels of the
executive."
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to show support for the president.
"Khatami is a victim of injustice, so the people must be
vigilant," he said.

<HEADLINE> Government Changes Not to Affect Economy: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Tuesday said that country's economic programs will not be
affected by the changes in the government as some people fear for.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Yilmaz made the statement to assure
the public that the early elections scheduled for April 1999 will
not bring about a negative impact on these economic plans.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the parliament building here,
Yilmaz urged the parliament to adopt laws to help make the
economic programs successful.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has worked out a series of plans
concerning balance of payments, the inflation rate and budget
targets for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The economic programs were encouraged by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) which signed a cooperation agreement with
Turkish State Minister for economic issues Gunes Taner in
Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the agreement shows that the IMF is assuring the
international financial markets as to the credibility of Turkey's
current economic programs.
</P>
<P>
"The signal which the IMF will send to international markets
concerning the realism and reliability of our economic program and
our government's determination to implement this program is
expected to affect the Turkish economy very positively," the
Turkish prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says No Plan to Boost U.S. Forces in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Tuesday that the United States has no plan to bolster the
20,000 U.S. forces in the Gulf region following an incident in
which a U.S. F-16 firing fired a missile at an Iraqi radar site.
</P>
<P>
"This will not alter our plans" to continue drawing down U.S.
forces in the region, he told reporters at the Pentagon. "I don't
think we should draw any conclusion from this particular one
incident."
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks after the F-16 fighter fired a
high-speed anti-radiation missile at an Iraqi radar site that was
said to have illuminated four British Tornado warplanes patrolling
the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he decided not to make any move to reinforce the
U.S. military presence because the incident "might be a situation
of an isolated example."
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen any evidence from the Iraqis altering their
air defense system. We have not seen any examples of higher alert.
We have not seen them moving their radars and tracking systems
around in any sort of aggressive fashion," he said. "So it might
be a situation of an isolated example."
</P>
<P>
But Cohen warned Baghdad that Washington would make vigorous
response to any Iraqi acts that constitute a threat to U.S. and
its allies' aircraft conducting patrol missions over the no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
"If our aircraft, or those of our allies, are threatened, it
will be met with a very vigorous response," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore told reporters in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House that the United States would
take "decisive" action to respond to any "hostile acts" by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to patrol the no-fly zone to reduce the
threat that Saddam Hussein poses to the region and we will
continue to respond decisively to any hostile acts that threaten
the lives of our pilots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore, however, urged people not to jump to conclusions about
the incident whether it was a deliberate provocation by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I would urge you not to assume that it's a deliberate
provocation," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi arrived here Tuesday night, leading Italy as the pioneer of
the European countries in improving relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's visit to Tehran is the first one by a western head of
government since the Islamic revolution in 1979. Both Tehran and
Rome see the visit as an important step for expansion of
Tehran-Rome relations and a further detente between Iran and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Prodi said that he has brought a message from
the EU countries to the Iranian government, Tehran radio reported,
adding that Iran plays an important role in the region and the
world.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Italy and Iran have enjoyed friendly relations for
long and they can further expand their bilateral relations in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Prodi will hold talks with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
First Vice President Hassan Habibi, Chairman of the State
Expediency Council and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani and
other senior Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to focus mainly on Iran's ties with the
EU, the Middle East peace process, terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction. But Iranian officials said that the main agenda of
Prodi's visit was to strengthen bilateral relations in political,
economic, cultural and parliamentary areas.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's trip came four months after the ground-breaking visit
by Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini who called on the west
to support Khatami's moderate government.
</P>
<P>
Dini came to Tehran, days after the EU lifted the ban on
ministerial contact with Tehran following the more than one year
freeze on the EU's "critical dialog" with Iran in a protest to
Iran's alleged support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Italy was Iran's biggest trade partner in 1997 with a trade
volume at 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces to Cut Oil Output as of Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Tuesday to
decrease oil output as of Wednesday by 10 percent in accordance
with the recent decision by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) with an aim to boost oil price.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Director
of international affairs of the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC) Hojjatollah Ghanimifard made the announcement without
mentioning Iran's current oil production and the amount to be cut
down.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said earlier that
Iran would reduce its production by 305,000 barrels per day (bpd)
according to OPEC decision. Some reports said that Iran's current
oil production is around 3.6 million bpd though its OPEC-set quota
was raised to 3.942 million bpd in November.
</P>
<P>
Ghanimifard said that the decision for lowering oil output is
based on the concept of bolstering the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
On June 24, OPEC members agreed to further reduce their
outputs by 1.355 million bpd, after oil market showed no sign of
recovery despite of OPEC's cuts in March.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh strongly urged the OPEC members to respect the
commitments to output cuts, saying that "respect of the recent
OPEC decision will be the most effective element for lifting oil
price soon."
</P>
<P>
However, many oil experts doubt if all the OPEC members would
stick to their promises. Oil price is still declining in recent
days as the world market showed no positive reaction to the OPEC
decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin Thursday
called on the Central institutions stationed in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to work together with Hong
Kong residents to overcome the current economic difficulties and
build a better tomorrow for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with leading members of the Central institutions
stationed in Hong Kong at the Bank of China Tower Wednesday
afternoon, Jiang, who came here Tuesday to attend the celebrations
to mark the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, said
he was impressed by the warm reception of the Hong Kong people and
the profound sentiment between the people of Hong Kong and the
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, said Hong Kong now faces with temporary economic
difficulties due to the impact of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Jiang commented that these difficulties came beyond people's
will and were not because of China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is more important to find out the cause of the difficulties
and the ways to overcome them through joint efforts, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of Hong Kong's advantages -- solid economic
fundamentals, abundant financial and foreign reserves, sound
economic supervision system, well educated and trained civil
servants and close links with China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"We can handle the challenges well as long as we have
confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
When told that the interest rate was lowered here Wednesday,
Jiang commented that this "is good for Hong Kong".

<HEADLINE> WHO Holds Consultation to Raise Awareness of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has held the first international consultation to launch the formal
process of classifying incontinence as a disease which has been
affecting more than 200 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts from around the world gathered in Monaco from
June 28 to July 1 to raise general awareness of all of the
symptoms of incontinence and ways to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
"This proposed change in the International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) would allow the topic of incontinence to be taught
properly in medical schools throughout the world and would also
send a signal that this very treatable disease should be taken
more seriously by the medical community," said Paul Abrams,
Chairman of the first International Consultation on Incontinence.
</P>
<P>
"One of our aims, through this meeting, is to help people with
bladder control problems realize that they are not alone, they
should know that the most common symptoms of urgency, frequency
and/or leakage are not a normal part of ageing and should not be
afraid to seek medical attention," he added.
</P>
<P>
Overactive bladder is one of the most common and distressing
causes of poor bladder control. Its symptoms include frequency
(urinating more than eight times per 24 hours); urgency (sudden,
overwhelming urge to urinate); and/or urge incontinence (sudden
and total involuntary loss of urine).
</P>
<P>
The other main cause is stress incontinence, the involuntary
leakage of urine when intra-abdominal pressure is suddenly
increased (caused by laughing, sneezing or running), due to poor
urethral functioning.
</P>
<P>
"As diseases continue to be eradicated, and as the population
matures in many developing nations as well as in the developed
world, conditions which substantially affect quality of life are
increasing," said head of WHO's Ageing and Health Program Dr
Alexandre Kalache.
</P>
<P>
"Health care systems and providers will face new hurdles in
trying to deal with these conditions; however, given the advances
in health care, we should address those health problems so that
people can live healthy, productive lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the results of a first-ever survey showed that
diagnosis and treatment of bladder control problems can be
improved through better doctor-patient communication.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 2,500 primary care physicians in the
United States, Europe and Japan revealed that 96 percent of
doctors are convinced that patients' embarrassment and lack of
understanding about bladder control problems are serious barriers
to speedy diagnosis and treatment of such conditions.
</P>
<P>
The majority of doctors, the survey found, thought their
patients believed at least one or more of commonly held myths
related to bladder control problems.

infections, said a latest study available here Wednesday.
</P>

Nearly a quarter of the inmates surveyed were found to be
homosexuals, according to a study by scientists at the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
</P>
<P>
The pilot study among 240 male and nine female prisoners at the
Ghaziabad jail also revealed a high prevalence of
sexually-transmitted diseases and blood-borne diseases like
hepatitis and HIV among the inmates. What is aiding the diseases'
spread is sexual promiscuity and drug abuse.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Wednesday urged the civil servants of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) to continue to work for Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and
principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR and noted figures here
Wednesday afternoon, Jiang thanked them for their arduous work
over the past year on behalf of the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, said that earlier in the day he witnessed the
happy life of elderly people at Sha Tin Hospital and was very much
impressed with the warm response from Hong Kong people in Sunshine
City, a shopping center at Ma On Shan.
</P>
<P>
He said that under Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's leadership,
the SAR officials and people in different quarters had worked
diligently and made great efforts to implement the principles of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy, maintain Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability, and fend off the effects of the Asian
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong met with difficulties due to the impact of
the financial turbulence, but difficulties also meant challenges.
In face of difficulties, the Hong Kong civil servants and the more
than six million Hong Kong compatriots should unite more closely
and make concerted efforts to meet the challenges.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that Hong Kong's various government
departments will perform their duties under the leadership of the
Chief Executive and, at the same time, rely on the general public
and pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone so as to overcome the
difficulties and do everything well for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang came to Hong Kong Tuesday afternoon to attend
celebrations marking the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return
to China and the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen was present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes for Closer Sino-U.S. Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said today that he will work for a closer partnership and
deeper friendship between China and the U.S. and a better life for
the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed this hope today while touring this largest
metropolis in China, the third leg of his nine-day, five-city
state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
During today's breakfast, the U.S. president told more than 500
American and Chinese entrepreneurs that China is one of the major
trading partners of the United States, bringing about more job
opportunities to the U.S. and helping prosper its economy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the success of China is related
to not only its own development, but also to the prosperity and
stability of the U.S. and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At noon, Clinton visited the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) in
the company of Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
SSE General manager Tu Guangshao briefed Clinton and other
American visitors on the Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, the 4,000-sq.m.
SSE, the first of its kind in China which was set up in December
of 1990, now handles A-share, B-share, funds, treasury bonds,
enterprise bonds and financial bonds, among others.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May this year, 407 enterprises were listed on the
Exchange and 446 kinds of stocks with their combined market
capitalization reaching 1.1867 trillion yuan (about 143 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On behalf of more than 1,000 traders at the exchange, Chen
Chen, a trader with China's largest securities company,"Shenyin
International", presented President Clinton with a red vest
printed with the year "1998" as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
While he was showing around the crowd of busy traders wearing
red vests, the majority of them being young people, the U.S.
president inquired about the trading. Many of them responded in
fluent English.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised many of the traders as young and energetic. He
told SSE General Manager Tu Guangshao that "you should feel proud
of the success of the stock exchange."
</P>
<P>
About 3:00 p.m., President Clinton and other American officials
accompanying him toured a neighborhood in the western part of
Shanghai, where they were greeted by some 400 residents.
"ongradulations! Congradulations!" Clinton said to them upon
learning that they all have their own housing now. The U.S.
president also called on a resident Yu Jianyuan and his family.
</P>
<P>
Yu is just one of those in Shanghai who have benefited from a
housing reform the city launched in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was one of the pilot cities in China to carry out the
housing reform aimed at ending the traditional welfare housing
distribution and alleviating the housing shortage. Up to now,
one-third of its households have bought their own housing with
mortgage loans, or by way of paying the cost in instalments or
with housing accumulation funds.
</P>
<P>
At noon today. the U.S. president had his luncheon with 12
local private business people.

<HEADLINE> New Philippine Government to Shun Borrowings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday said his administration will concentrate on improving
the government's finances and will resort to borrowing only when
"absolutely necessary."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with newsmen, the new president said it had
been his policy even when he was still mayor of San Juan not to
borrow and "it will continue to be my policy now that I am
president."
</P>
<P>
Estrada called for belt-tightening in his inaugural speech
Tuesday in view of the current economic difficulties as evidenced
by the fact that the national government has incurred a 38 billion
peso (about 1 billion U.S. dollars) budgetary deficit.
</P>
<P>
In his directive to the new cabinet Tuesday, the president
asked them to review the remaining budget for 1998 and identify
areas for further savings.
</P>
<P>
He also asked them to review the proposed budget for 1999 of
their respective departments, including all the agencies and
government-owned corporations attached to their departments, and
to ensure that all expenses are consistent with the policies and
projects of the administration.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Can Learn From Hong Kong Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Macao can learn a lot from the
successful implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy
in Hong Kong in the past year, local newspapers and celebrities
said.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in Wednesday's Macao Daily News said that on the
first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, residents in
Hong Kong and Macao can see for themselves that the Chinese
Central Government is firm in carrying out the policy of "one
country, two systems' and "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has done nothing to interfere with the
running of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and
instead has done its utmost to support Hong Kong in maintaining
its financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong SAR Government has taken appropriate
measures to stimulate the economic growth after it was confronted
with unexpected difficulties in the wake of the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's economy will gradually revive in two to three
years," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Correio Sino-Macanese Daily said in a commentary Wednesday
that the experience over the past year in Hong Kong since its
handover has proved that the policy of "one country, two systems"
is "correct, scientific, and practical."
</P>
<P>
The commentary described the first year of the HKSAR as a total
success
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has fully exercised its rights of administration,
legislation and independent jurisdiction, and the freedom
protected by the Hong Kong Basic Law has been fully guaranteed and
respected, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Hong Kong and its residents can feel the dignity
and pride which they could not enjoy before its return to the
motherland, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of some grass-roots organizations in Macao
said the success in Hong Kong has boosted the confidence of Macao
</P>
<P>
Vitor Ng, president of the Macao Exporters and Importers
Association, said Macao can learn a lot from the successful
experience in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said Macao residents' confidence in the policy of "one
country, two systems" has been boosted by the fact that it has
worked well in Hong Kong, and that the Central Government has
never tried to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Infrastructure Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday announced
the establishment of an Infrastructure Development Fund to help
revive infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim told a press conference that the fund with an initial size
of 5 billion ringgit (about 1.25 billion U.S. dollars) would help
revive infrastructure projects which had been deferred or
abandoned but were deemed to be critical and should be revived
immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said the fund would also help projects already in progress
so that they could be speeded up or completed, especially those
which can help the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
It would provide adequate funds for these projects and details
were being worked out by the Finance Ministry, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the critical areas identified under this fund are
public transport, sewerage, solid wastes and water supply.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the fund would be raised through issuing bonds at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said a committee would be established to manage the fund
which would disburse the money in the form of loans and not
grants.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the establishment of the fund showed Malaysia is
loosening its monetary policy, Anwar said: "It is not necessarily
so because our (monetary) policy is quite consistent but of course
now we are grappling with some immediate problems."
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going projects have to be continued and the
government does not want Bank Negara (state bank)'s credit plan of
a loan growth of 15 percent for this year to be affected.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Urges Duma's Support for Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko appealed to the State Duma (lower house) on Wednesday
for support for an austerity package by the government to halt the
decline of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said Russia must carry out a stabilization program to
cooperate with the International Monetary Fund in resolving the
economic problems of the country.
</P>
<P>
The package includes measures to cut the country's spending by
about 42 billion rubles (6.77 billion U.S. dollars), and increase
revenues by about 20 billion rubles (3.23 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Russia's gross domestic product lost 0.2 percent during the
first five months of this year, a contrast against the 0.8 percent
growth registered last year.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko highlighted reform of taxation as the basis for
boosting Russia's economy. He said a new tax code should be
adopted and "the tax burden should be shifted from the production
to the consumption sector".
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to reduce the profit tax and lift the turnover
tax, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the problem of repayments to the coal industry,
Kiriyenko said the wage debts are being cleared and the government
is meeting the timetables of debt repayment to the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Private Firms Contribute to Anti-Poverty Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1997, 2,296 private
entrepreneurs had participated in a nationwide anti-poverty
campaign known as the Glorious Cause, which was launched by the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 2,731 Glorious Cause projects had been
implemented involving 5.16 billion yuan. The projects helped
547,100 poor people rise above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
A large number of laborers also have found jobs because of
Glorious Cause. This was learned from an international symposium
on non-governmental poverty-eradication programs held in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the United Nations Regional
Development Center, the State Council Research Center on
Development, and the China Council For Promotion of Glorious Cause
(CCPGC).
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the national committee of the
Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and Chairman of CCPGC, told the
participants that China has made great achievements in eliminating
poverty since the country started its reform, opening-up and
modernization drive in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The four years' experience of Glorious Cause shows that the
program is an effective, vigorous non-governmental way to fight
poverty in coordination with the governmental poverty-eradication
programs, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's symposium was Jing Shuping,
vice-chairman of CPPCC and chairman of ACFIC.

</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The Tunisian Investment Promotion Foundation expects
an increase of 345 million U.S. dollars in investment in the

<P>
TOKYO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- An affiliate of China's Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) gave a grand banquet here
Wednesday evening to mark the first anniversary of Hong Kong's
return to China.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 guests, including Japanese government officials,
business leaders and representatives from all walks of life in
Japan attended the banquet hosted by the Economic and Trade Office
of the SAR in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Paul Leung, Chief Representative of the trade office, said in a
speech that transition in the SAR was smooth and seamless after
Hong Kong's return to its motherland last July.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the obvious visible changes, such as the new flags
and the new symbols, the majority of the people (in Hong Kong)
would not have noticed any change at all" over the past year. This
was because the "one country, two systems" concept was fully
implemented, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"The principal officials who were in place before the handover
are still there running Hong Kong under a high degree of
autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent economic downturn following the Asian
financial turmoil, Leung expressed his belief that the SAR would
surely overcome the short-term difficulties to scale even greater
heights as the new century approaches.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Visits Shanghai Private Housing Estate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A visit to individual homeowners
in this industrial and financial hub in China has revived U.S.
President Clinton's happy memory of buying his first house and
marrying Ms. Hillary two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say to all of you who are moving into new
home: Gong Xi! Gong Xi! Congratulations!" the President made a
bilingual greeting to a gathering of some 400 residents when he
visited Jinhui Gardens, a private housing estate in southwest
Shanghai, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"So I hope that your homes bring you as much joy as mine did 20
years ago," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Most of the nearly 7,000 residents who have moved into the
Jinhui Gardens, where a private apartment costs between 350,000
and 800,000 RMB yuan (42,200-96,500 US dollars), are
middle-level-income people, including office workers, businessmen
and relatives of overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has a tight schedule for his two-day stay in
Shanghai, arrived at the estate at about 3:00 p.m., and was warmly
received by the family of Yu Jianyuan, an average household at
Jinhui luckily chosen as host of the presidential visit to a home
apartment.
</P>
<P>
Yu, 35, purchased the four-bedroom, two-sitting-room apartment
in 1997 with family savings, 60,000 yuan (7,500 US dollars) of
provident fund loans and a bank mortgage for 300,000 yuan (36,000
US dollars). She now lives in it with her husband, their
ten-year-old son and her mother.
</P>
<P>
The president had a close look at each room in Yu's apartment,
and praised that they have all been very nicely decorated. He was
quite impressed by the elegant wooden floor in the rooms, saying
that even back in the U.S. not many households have floored their
houses with wood because of its high cost.
</P>
<P>
In the family kitchen, Yu told President Clinton that the
Chinese way of cooking, mostly frying, often causes a lot of
fumes, making everything in the kitchen easy to get dirty.
Clinton said that no wonder they have fixed a fume extractor.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the U.S. president show great interest in a set of
body-building equipment in the study, Yu explained that her
husband is a bit overweight and needs more physical exercises.
Clinton beamed and said that maybe he also needs to buy one when
he is back home.
</P>
<P>
Yu has provided her son with the largest bedroom in her
apartment. Seeing this, Clinton said that it was the same
treatment he received from his mother during his childhood.

When he was about to leave, President Clinton signed autographs
on a family photo of his hostess, as well as on a group photo of
Yu's son and his classmates.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also posed for a picture with the Yu family, saying
that he hopes they will remember this day whenever they see this
photo.
</P>
<P>
The president was then escorted by the family to the courtyard
of the estate, where a makeshift stage had been erected for him to
deliver a speech to the nearly 400 Jinhui residents and a group of
local bankers and real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that owning their own homes would prompt the
people to work harder, thus contributing to a country's prosperity
and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Muyao, deputy mayor of Shanghai who accompanied Clinton to
the estate, told the president that Shanghai started to reform its
residents' housing system in the early 1990s, being one of the
country's earliest.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1993, one third of the local families have bought their
own houses by means of seeking bank loans, paying in installments
or joining the Provident housing fund scheme," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced at Jinhui that the U.S. and China
are creating a joint residential building counsel to promote new
technology that is needed for a better and more spacious living
environment for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the U.S. Ministry of Commerce has been
discussing with related Chinese government agencies the matter on
offering mortgage management expertise to China.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in this respect focuses on "how to finance people
to buy home from strengthening property rights to developing the
mortgage market," according to the president.
</P>
<P>
"I'm determined to build strong partnership and friendship
between the United States and China that will absolutely make a
positive difference in people's life," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Reform Needs $2.2bn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's land acquisition program
will need 40 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 2.2 billion U.S.
Dollars) to resettle more than 100,000 families on one million
hectares annually over five years, a cabinet minister said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister without Portfolio Joseph Msika said the program would
focus on communal farmers interested in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Msika said this during a press conference here when he
unveiled the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
He said the 40 billion Zimbabwean Dollars would cover
compensation, infrastructural development, input and extension
support.
</P>
<P>
The government, Msika reiterated, would not compensate farmers
for the land, but infrastructural developments on the farms.
</P>
<P>
"We will only consider paying them full compensation after the
donor conference to be held early october if it yields some
seeds," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tax our people to pay for the land that was not
bought from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Msika said the British government was now expressing the
desire to help Zimbabwe with its land reform program.
</P>
<P>
The donor conference was postponed from June to September to
allow donors, especially in the European Union, to discuss the
government's policy document on land.
</P>
<P>
The government had also finalized a document with guidelines
to assist resettled farmers to borrow money from banks for
development projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The land reform and resettlement program will start
immediately without waiting for the donors conference, Msika
said.
</P>
<P>
He said so far 111 farms covering 239,203 hectares had since
been made available to the government, with resettlement already
underway on 12 farms which had been serviced.

CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The Tunisian Investment Promotion Foundation expects
an increase of 345 million U.S. dollars in investment in the
chemical industry in the next two years, namely, the last two
years of the ninth development plan (1997 - 2001).

JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A general election will be
held in the tiny kingdom of Swaziland on October 9, the country's
electoral authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll will be held at 55 constituency centers to elect
deputies to the national assembly, the lower house of parliament,
South African Press Association quoted chief electoral officer
Robert Thwala as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nominations of candidates would be submitted at community
meetings on August 8 in each of the country's 350 chiefdoms,
Thwala said. Parliament would be dissolved before the nomination
date to enable parliament members and present ministers to
participate in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
Primary elections in the chiefdoms would take place on
September 12, Thwala said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Swazi constitution, the functions of the country's
bicameral legislature are confined to debating government
proposals and advising the king, who is the head of state and has
supreme executive and legislative power.
</P>
<P>
The national assembly comprises 65 deputies, of whom 55 are
directly elected from candidates nominated by traditional local
councils and 10 appointed by the king.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has 30 members, 20 of whom are appointed by the
king and 10 are elected by the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Thwala appealed to all Swazis at and above the age of 18 to
register as voters before the registration period ended on July
16.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to political movements, and those calling for a
boycott of the elections in protest to a ban on political
parties, to use their chance to vote for the people they wanted
for the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only country in southern Africa not to have

<HEADLINE> Yangtze's Water Flow Hits Second Historical High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Water flow on the main stream of
the section of the Yangtze River running through east China's
Jiangsu Province reached a second historical high for 50 years
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces and other
localities on the middle reaches of the Yangtze since mid-June
have immensely increased the river's water flow.
</P>
<P>
On June 30, the Yangtze's water flow reached 77,600 cubic
meters per second, an amount smaller only than the water flow in
1954 when there were exceptionally severe floods.
</P>
<P>
The water level along the Yangtze's Jiangsu section exceeded
the warning line on June 30, with the tidemarks at Nanjing and
Zhenjiang reaching 9.88 meters and 7.97 meters, about 1.38 meters
and 1.17 meters above their respective safety levels.
</P>
<P>
The high- water level has been further compounded by pouring
rains during what is called the plum rain season on the Chinese
lunar calendar, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Official forecasts say that the Yangtze's water flow will
continue to increase in the near future, making the already severe
task of flood control even more formidable.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu provincial government has issued an urgent circular
urging all areas to take prompt measures to counter
floods. Currently, the province's eight cities and 21 counties
along the Yangtze have mobilized a total of 300,000 people for the
flood-control endeavor.

<HEADLINE> 5000 Somalis Attend Peace Rally in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A large peace rally was held
Wednesday in Mogadishu, aimed at praying Allah to bring peace and
stability to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The rally were attended by more than 5000 people including the
most popular religious scholars from Islamic courts
and intellectuals in the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the former chairman of north Mogadishu's
collapsed lslamic courts, Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud (Sheikh Ali
dhere), who addressed the crowd, the gathering was organized so
as to revive the spirit of reconciliation among the Somalis in
the capital and the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali Dhere said it's now time that the Somalis are
to forgive each other and work together towards the
reconnaissance of the law and order.
</P>
<P>
The dignitaries who also addressed the crowd include Mrs
Ruqia sheikh Abdullahi who recited an emotional poem over the
grievances of the civil strive and the consequences of the lack
of law and order.
</P>
<P>
Ruqia was followed by Maki Hagi Banadir, a famous comedian,
who also read a Rer Hamar poem over the current status of the
capital which the people had applauded for.
</P>
<P>
The religious scholars have appealed the faction leaders to
honor their words and fulfill their agreements especially the
establishment of an all inclusive administration for the
capital including the re-opening of the air and seaports which
remained out of use since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rally, sponsored by the recently formed peace Network and
pressure groups, was earlier planned to take place at
Mogadishu's largest mosque near the parliament at the heart of
the city.
</P>
<P>
The rally, the largest peace rally after the consecutive peace
demonstrations that followed the arrival of the faction leaders
from Egypt following their agreement in Cairo late December last
year, coincided with the Independence Day of Somalia, July 1,
(when the Somali-Italians of the South had united with the
Somli-Britain of the North in 1960).

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Think-Tank Tries to Revamp Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's big figures in the tourism
circle gathered Wednesday to find ways to reverse a three-year
downward trend in the sector and to restore the prestige of Kenya
as one of Africa's most attractive destinations.
</P>
<P>
"The downward trend of the sector has been evident for the
last three years" and now it's the time to seek "ways and means
of providing a turn-around point for Kenya's tourism and charting
the way forward," said Kenyan Tourism Minister Henry Kosgey.
</P>
<P>
He told 155 delegates at the Kenya National Tourism Conference
that security, road mending, market research and promotion, as
well as the diversification of product range and source markets
should be listed among top priorities in such bids.
</P>
<P>
"This conference is taking place at a time when we have
experienced the worst tourism decline in the history of our
tourism industry," he sighed.
</P>
<P>
Tourism in Kenya has suffered a lot due to political riots
prior to December's multi-party poll, the post-election tribal
killings in the Rift Valley, disease outbreaks and a general
breakdown of the infrastructure caused by El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Tourist Board predicted losses amounting to some 283
million Dollars by this month, but industry sources said the
figure could be even higher.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, considered a modest year, the industry raked in 433
million Dollars, but this fell o 133 million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
At the conference to end Thursday, Kosgey also called for more
attention paid to the environmental issues in attempts to
"cultivate a newly defined image of Kenya's tourism."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government "has set a new target of over two
million visitors by the year 2002. We should all suggest ways of
protecting our environment to make it possible to sustain such a
number of tourist," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the meeting suggested setting up a tourism
investment fund, speeding up road repairing, putting an end to
visa fees, drawing up a code of conducts, and giving land rights
to scheduled international airlines.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Tuesday released a long-term financial
support plan worth two billion Shillings (333 million Dollars) to
help get the country's tourism back on normal track.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent EU survey, Kenya's tourism industry
generates 18 percent of exports and foreign currency earnings,
9.2 percent of gross national product and 11 percent of tax
revenues. It also creates some 56,000 job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> E.U. Moves on Ozone Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive arm of the European Union, adopted a proposal on
Wednesday for a new regulation on ozone depleting substances
(ODS), as a final step in eliminating ODS.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which needs approval by the European council of
ministers and the European Parliament, seeks to ban, by the year
2001, production and use of the pesticide methyl bromide.
</P>
<P>
European Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard described
the proposal as the E.U.'s final step in eliminating all ozone
depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation is expected to bring about significant
environmental benefits through reduced future emissions of ODS.
</P>
<P>
Despite a global consensus on the first controls over the ODS,
under the Montreal Protocol ten years ago, ozone losses of up to
40 percent have been observed over northern Europe during recent
winter seasons.
</P>
<P>
Ozone depletion leads to increased ultra-violet radiation which
can cause skin cancers and cataracts, reduces growth of crops and
harms both aquatic and terrestial ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
Ozone depletion is expected to peak during the next decade.
but recovery will not take place until after 2050.

PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Danmark trounced the more fancied
Nigerian team 4-1 and set up a quarter-final clash with Brazil, a
match that the Danish players want to win.
</P>
<P>
Peter Schmeichel, goal-keeper of the Danish team, said a victory
over Brazil would be a sensation of the century:"I think it's
fantastic for a small country like Denmark, and especially because
for the first two or three games, we didn't play that well. But we
got through to the next round and now we're in the quarter-finals."

"We played exceptionally well against Nigeria, and now we have a

Forward Brian Laudrup said:"We now face Brazil, the absolute
favorites, and we're the underdogs as we like to be."
</P>

"We'll certainly be trying hard, because you only play perhaps

of chances. The problem is if Brazil go 1-0 or 2-0 ahead, then the
game will be very difficult to get back."

<HEADLINE> Nepal Committed to Regional Cooperation: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- King Birendra said Wednesday that
the Nepali government will remain committed to both regional and
sub-regional cooperation within the framework of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Presenting the annual policies and programs of the government
at the joint session of the bicameral parliament, Birendra said
Nepal will remain effortful to reorient SAARC as a viable
instrument for promoting economic, technical, commercial and
investment cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal will also remain committed to promote, with the SAARC
framework, the concept of sub-regional cooperation with a view to
achieving the common objective of rapid economic development in
the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote economic and trade
cooperation among its seven member countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, Nepal initiated the concept of Growth
Quadrangle comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal with a
view to jointly developing the eastern Himalayan rivers for rapid
economic development.
</P>
<P>
At their ninth summit held in May 1997 in the Maldives, the
SAARC leaders encouraged the development of specific projects
relevant to the special individual needs of three or more member
countries.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra also told the joint session of parliament that
the government will continue to follow the fundamental objective
of its foreign policy of establishing and consolidating friendly
relations with all countries on the foundation of the United
Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
He said the concept of economic diplomacy, formally launched in
June 1996, will be given a concrete shape to promote the economic
interest of the country through investment and tourism promotion
by making the Nepalese embassies and missions abroad more
effective.
</P>
<P>
On the refugee issue, the king said that taking into account
the economic, social and environmental problems his country is
faced with due to the influx of a large number of Bhutanese
refugees and the humanitarian problem facing them, the Nepali
government will continue to seek all possible efforts to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eastern Nepal
in eight U.N.-run camps after they were forced to flee Bhutan in
1989 and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks and lower-level contacts
between the two Himalayan kingdoms had failed to produce any
result on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala told the press
recently that he would ask Bhutanese King Jigme Singye Wangchuck
to resolve the issue as soon as possible on the sidelines of the
10th SAARC summit slated for July 29-31 in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- An American F-16 jet fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi

southern Iraq, officials in Washington said.

Minica S. Levinsky's laments about an alleged affair with

counsel Kenneth W. Starr, made her long-anticipated debut before a
grand jury Tuesday in the investigation she set in motion five
months ago.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A set of porcelain kettles made to
commemorate the return of Hong Kong was added to the collection of
the prestigious National Museum of Chinese History here today.
</P>
<P>
The kettles, collected on the occasion of the first anniversary
of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, were made by China's
leading porcelain artisans based on paintings and calligraphy by
more than 50 celebrities from China's social sciences and arts
community.
</P>
<P>
The kettles, a set of 62 in different sizes, are a combination
of such famous porcelain as blue and white and soft colors.
</P>
<P>
The idea of making the kettles came from a Singapore
businessman whose ancestors are from China.

<HEADLINE> Another 65,000 Angolans Rendered Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Unstable situation in Angola has
rendered another 65,000 people refugees in last two months,
according to statistics of the United Nations Humanitarian Aid
Coordination Institution.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Strippoli, representative of the UN organization,
said the new refugees, are mostly from Bengo, Huila, Malanje,
Lunda-norte, Lunda-sul, Huambo and Uije provinces where the
situation is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected refugee problem created more difficulties for
the UN organization, which along with some non-govermental
organizations, has offered aid to only 33,000 of the 654,000
refugees, Strippoli said.
</P>
<P>
The situation might get worse as the UN organization has an
emergency aid of only 2.1 million U.S. Dollars available, and
most donor nations found that many repatriated refugees have
turned back to the refugee status again, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN organization, he said, has decided to hand over the job
to its branch organizations at the grass-root units and the
Angolan social welfare departments.
</P>
<P>
The mounting destructive activities by the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) are said to
have forced many villagers to flee their homes, with 70,000
refugees created in the January to April period alone.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Celebrates Its First Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Various celebrations were held
here Wednesday to mark the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return
to China and the founding of the Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
A grand carnival was held Wednesday afternoon. Braving
scorching summer sun, thousands of Hong Kong residents flocked to
the Happy Valley, the only ground for horse racing on Hong Kong
Island and now the venue of the carnival.
</P>
<P>
Starting at 3:00 p.m. local time, the carnival featured various
stalls, where people were queuing up for games and small
souvenirs, visited an exhibition on the Basic Law, and watched the
performance by a police band.
</P>
<P>
The games were designed to help Hong Kong people have a better
understanding of the motherland, the "One Country, Two Systems"
principle and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
A jigsaw puzzle was designed to familiarize people with the map
of China. There were also questions such as "how many
nationalities are there in China?"
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 people were already waiting outside the venue an
hour before the beginning of the carnival.
</P>
<P>
When night falls, there will be a choir staged by teachers and
students, a show by popular singers and the performance by the
band of the People's Liberation Army's Hong Kong Garrison. The
carnival is due to end at 10:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Provisional Regional Council organized a
sports and games carnival in the "New Territories" to celebrate
the first anniversary of Hong Kong's historic return to China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 leisure facilities in the region were opened to some
80,000 residents. A mass tai-chi, Chinese flag dance and
percussion music performances were staged.
</P>
<P>
A double-deck bus carrying banners with slogans reading "Warmly
celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the
HKSAR", "Hong Kong's future will be brighter" drove through
streets in the district of Kwun Tong, drawing the attention of
huge crowds of local residents all along.
</P>
<P>
Also in Kwun Tong, representatives from various sectors cut a
cake with a candle on it as a special way to mark the first
birthday of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinians Will Fight for Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian people
will fight to the end to protect Jerusalem and fight against
Israel's Jerusalem expansion plan, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the Palestinian Legislative
Council on Israel's Jerusalem plan, Arafat said the battle for
Jerusalem is one of life and death and the Palestinians will not
surrender in getting the city back to the hands of the the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war
and remains a explosive issue in the peace process. Israel regards
the whole Jerusalem as its capital, but the Palestinians want to
build their independent state with its capital in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no peace, no security and no stability in
Jerusalem without it being returned to the Palestinians," Arafat
told the session, which was also attended by the members of the
Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
This has been Arafat's sharpest reaction to Israel's expansion
plan, which passed through the Israeli cabinet June 21.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for expansion of boundaries expansion east of
Jeruesalem to include the largest Jewish settlement of Ma'ale
Adumim which is located inside the territories of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the plan, Palestinian
officials criticized it as the "declaration of war against the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian legislature's Wednesday session coincided with
the ongoing debate at the U.N. Security Council about Israel's
Jerusalem expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the U.N. said that the United States and Britain
are leading a diplomatic drive to keep the Security Council from
voting on the plan by asking the Council to issue a presidential
statement.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab member states of the U.N. had lobbied in the
Council, urging it to adopt a resolution criticizing Israel's
Jerusalem expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
According to Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is one of several key
issues to be settled by Israel and Palestinians during the final
status peace talks for a permanent peace agreement and no side
should move to change its status before that.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Hails Malawi for Adopting Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson has hailed the
Malawian government for its "clear commitment to the ideals of
democracy and human rights."
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to Malawian President, Bakili Muluzi,
Robinson said the passing of the Human Rights Commission Bill by
Malawian Parliament last week is a clear evidence of the
"government's commitment to the ideals of human rights as
enshrined in Malawi's new constitution," the Malawian News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's 177-seat parliament unanimously passed a Human Rights
Commission Bill last week which the Ministry of Justice Spokesman
said, "marks a major development in the consolidation of the
legislative mechanisms for the protection, promotion and
enforcement of human rights in Malawi."
</P>
<P>
"With the establishment of the Human Rights Commission under
the constitution and with the passing of the supportive bill,
Malawi joins the list of a few democratic countries in
sub-Saharan Africa with an internationally recognized legislative
and institutional framework for national realization of human
rights," said the Justice spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Robinson expressed satisfaction by saying that the Human
Rights Commission Bill is "among the best pieces of legislation
in current international practice governing the status and
functions of such national institutions."
</P>
<P>
She therefore, gave assurance of the United Nations pledge to
assist Malawi through the technical cooperation program already
concluded with Malawi and to support the human rights commission.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Weizman Decide to End Row in Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and President Ezer Weizman decided Wednesday to stop
accusing each other in public and to discuss their differences in
the future in private.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders made the remarks in a joint statement after
their meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two leaders also agreed to meet more
regularly in the future so as to reach understanding in dealing
with sticking political issues.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Weizman and Netanyahu soured when Weizman,
accusing the government of failing to make progress in the Middle
East peace process, called Monday for the Knesset (parliament) to
be dissolved and new general elections held "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The call was seen as an attempt to depose Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu accused Weizman of siding with the Arabs
and placing himself at the head of the left-wing camp by his call
to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also stressed that he will not change his stance in
the peace talks, which has been deadlocked for more than a year
over the long-delayed Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government, citing security reasons, rejected a
U.S. initiative to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians during the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The compromise formula, widely seen as a way to bring the
Israeli-Palestinian talks back on track, has been accepted by the
Palestinians.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) - Tanzania needs some 20
million U.S. Dollars to revamp the economic and social
infrastructure damaged by the just ended El-Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
A report, prepared by the Planning Commission, said that funds
are needed to repair roads, bridges, railways, harbors, airports
and power supply lines which are critical to the national
economic development, media here quoted the report as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rains severely damaged nine trunk road corridors,
sweeping away about 20 bridges," the report said, giving an
example of the El-Nino destruction.
</P>
<P>
It calls for permanent measures to be taken to upgrade the
infrastructure installations including the capacity to respond to
emergency situations to prevent or minimize damages in disasters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report projects that the economic growth for
1998/99 fiscal year would not rise above 3.5 percent, a steep
fall from the earlier forecast of about five percent.
</P>
<P>
"Also forecast is a significant drop in the production of cash
crops like coffee, cashewnuts and cotton," the report said.
"However, there could be a bumper food crops harvest,
particularly for maize, rice, bananas, potatoes and beans."
</P>
<P>
The production of livestock and by-products like milk and
skins is expected to register a significant growth following the
availability of adequate pasture and water, the report added.

<HEADLINE> More Palestinians Growing Frustrated: Poll Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the Palestinians
are now frustrated with the stalled peace process and support
violence against Israelis, which is a four-year high, a
Palestinian poll indicated.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Nablus-based Center for Palestine
Research and Studies (CPRS) last week, showed that as many as 49.7
percent of the people questioned support "armed attacks against
Israelis."
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspaper Haaretz Wednesday quoted CPRS Director Khalil
Shikaki as saying that the support for hardline stance jumped 10
percent in the last six months alone and more than doubled the 22
percent before Likud coalition government took power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Shikaki said the poll, whose results will be formally released
soon, indicated the growing frustration among the Palestinians
over the stalled the peace process,
</P>
<P>
He said the poll demonstrates a regression in Palestinians'
acceptance of the idea that non-violence means will move the peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
"Between 1994 and 1996, the peace process transformed the
Palestinian psychological environment, leading more and more
Palestinians to support negotiations and oppose terrorism. This
has now been reversed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a clear trend that a majority of Palestinians do
not believe that the peace process alone - though it still has 68
percent support - will bring about the resolution of the
conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shikaki noted that between 1994 and 1996, 44.8 percent of
the Palestinians public opposed terror attacks against Israel and
in early 1996, 68 percent of Palestinians supported a crackdown
against Hamas after a wave of terror against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The survey, interviewing 1,300 Palestinians from the West Bank
and Gaza, also showed 50.5 percent of the Palestinians opposed the
U.S. initiative calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli troops
withdrawal from the West Bank, while 43 percent supported it.
</P>
<P>
With this 13.1 percent, the Palestinians will have under their
control 40 percent of the West Bank. But the growing discontent
showed "Palestinians think it is too little, too late," Shikaki
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) may also be somewhat
at fault, since it built up expectations that it would obtain 90
percent of the territories. So there is disappointment," he added.
</P>
<P>
And only 6 percent of the Palestinians believed in the
sincerity of the current Israeli government, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poll indicated that support for the reelection
of PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat dropped by 10 percent over the last
six months to 61 percent, but he still dwarfed Hamas leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, who commands a paltry 2 percent of support.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the poll showed that Hamas has not benefited from
the anti-Israel mood, as its support rate remains basically
steady at 13.5 percent in comparison with the equally stable 43
percent of support rate for Arafat's Fatah, the mainstream of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization.

HANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of children expressed
their amazement at the gigantic man-made caterpillars, spiders and
other insects, which are hundreds of times bigger than the real

<P>
The exhibition, with the theme "human and nature," began this
morning at a science museum in Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Those gigantic insects were designed for such American films as
"Jurassic Park." Because they are a combination of advanced
techniques with perfect artificial models, these insects can mimic
the movements of real ones.
</P>
<P>
Also on display are rare conches from the Mediterranean Sea,
the West Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, as well as
performing parrots.

<HEADLINE> China Committed to Eliminating Poverty Before Century Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said here today that China is committed to eliminating
poverty by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar on non-governmental
poverty-relief efforts that opened here today, Wang said
eliminating poverty and realizing common prosperity have been two
goals long pursued by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government unveiled in 1994 a state strategic plan
to ensure that the impoverished have the basic means of
subsistence -- to be able to feed and clothe themselves -- by
2,000.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, Wang said, the poor rural population in
China has been reduced to 50 million from around 80 million in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Apart from government endeavors, various social groups have
played a significant role in reducing poverty, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also president of the China Association for the
Promotion of the Glorious Cause, a non-governmental
poverty-alleviation organization set up in 1995, said the
association has attracted about 2,300 private business people who
have started 2,700 projects in poor areas and helped lift more
than 500,000 out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed his hope that international organizations like
the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank and
humanitarian bodies should continue their support for China's
poverty-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 people -- including experts, scholars and
entrepreneurs from the United Nations, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, the Philippines and India -- were present at the seminar
to discuss issues and exchange experiences concerning poverty
elimination.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls on U.S. to Match Words With Deeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday called on the United States to take actions to prove its
goodwill gesture to Iran, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Khatami said that "changes are seen in their tone,
but we judge their sincerity by actions and not only words."
</P>
<P>
"We hope this change of tone is a sign of better understanding
of American politicians from the status of the Islamic Republic of
Iran, the Iranian nation and the global situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first reaction by head of the Iranian government to
recent statements by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Washington's willingness to explore
ways to rebuild confidence between the U.S. and Iran in order to
resume diplomatic relations after nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Clinton said in Shanghai during his tour to China,
that he hoped the recent U.S.-Iran football match in the World Cup
would help reach rapprochement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed belief that Khatami has the intention to have
a "more regular relationship with the rest of the world in
accordance with international law."
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami said that it is not the time to raise the
issue of Tehran-Washington ties. "Naturally, our foreign policy
bodies will make further comments on the issue, if necessary," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has also stressed that
the U.S. should take practical actions, instead of good words, to
back up its offer.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is obliged to adopt a more realistic
position" by lifting an oil embargo on Iran, Kharrazi said, "This
is the easiest move to ease the situation."

BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters has called for provincial and
municipal governments in in the Yangtze and Huaihe River valleys
to immediately implement flood control measures to ensure safety
in mainstream areas.
</P>
<P>
The lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River have been
subject to rising water levels in recent weeks due to the heavy
volume of water in Boyang and Dongting lakes. Numerous sections of
the river have water levels either approaching or exceeding record
highs. Weather forecast calls for even more heavy rain in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze and Huaihe river valleys in coming
days.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have been urged to remain alert for
flooding and ensure coordinated flood control efforts. The
circular issued by the headquarters also calls for the
construction of extensive water conservation projects.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union-Moldova
partnership and cooperation agreement came into force on
Wednesday, furthering EU support to the country's transition to a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Moldova has thus become the third country among the former
Soviet republics to have a partnership and cooperation accord with
the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and this year, overall EU financial support to
Moldova amounted to 126 million ECU.
</P>
<P>
The partnership and cooperation agreement, reached in November
1994, is to focus on further developing political and economic
dialogue between the EU and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
It aims to foster trade and investment by reciprocal
commitments to ensure freedom of trade, non-discrimination of
foreign companies, liberalization of capital transfers and by
providing groundwork for cooperation on the environment,
cross-border and customs issues, transport, education and
intellectual property protection.
</P>
<P>
In support of these aims, the EU promised to continue with
technical assistance to Moldova, with a focus on human resources
development, private sector development and food production,
processing and distribution.

way of expanding relations with Iran, and the friendship between
the two countries will help promote cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Iran's First Vice President Hassan Habibi,
Prodi said the two countries have always had good relations,
especially in the economic fields, the official news agency IRNA

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Banquet Marks Handover Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
joined some 1,000 Hong Kong people at a banquet here Wednesday
evening hosted by the Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) marking the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. (local time), Jiang and his wife Wang Yeping walked
into the banquet hall at the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention
Center Extension in the company of SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa and his wife Betty Tung.
</P>
<P>
Both Tung Chee Hwa and Vice Premier Qian Qichen spoke at the
function.
</P>
<P>
Tung recalled that one year ago, President Jiang solemnly
announced to the world the formal establishment of the Hong Kong
SAR at this very building.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, he said, there was a growing number of Hong
Kong people who came to realize from the bottom of their heart the
mutual dependence and important relationship between Hong Kong and
its motherland through the implementation of the concept of "one
country, two systems" and their fight against the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "Hong Kong is able to ride one storm after the other
in the turmoil because we have huge fiscal reserves, robust
monetary system, prudent financial management and most important
of all, the backup of our motherland."
</P>
<P>
"The strong support we have from our country makes us feel more
strongly the care and warmth of the big family of our motherland,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the concept of "one country, two systems", Tung said,
"we have the opportunity to meet new challenges that no one
generation in the past has ever met and the opportunity to take
part in the great and exciting mission of the revival of the
Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
"We are now faced with financial difficulties, and the
difficulties are considerable. But I believe that with courage,
confidence and composure, Hong Kong will firmly tide over this
difficult time and will have a bright future ahead, " he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Qian Qichen extended festival congratulations to
the people from all walks of life in Hong Kong on behalf of
President Jiang and the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that since the SAR was founded last July, more than
six million Hong Kong compatriots have successfully written the
first page for "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy backed by
the Central People's Government and the people of all
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
This is a good beginning, he said. It testifies that the
concept of "one country, two systems" is completely workable and
the Hong Kong people are able to administer Hong Kong well.
</P>
<P>
Qian reaffirmed the Central People's Government's resolve to
implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and act
strictly in accordance with the Basic Law and go all out to
support Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the SAR Government and
do its utmost to safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the banquet were Henry Ying-tung Fok and Ann
Tse-kai, vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), as well as SAR
principal officials, members of the executive and legislative
councils and well-known figures.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from foreign consulates-general in Hong Kong
were also on hand.

<HEADLINE> Amended Forestry Law Going Into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The amended Forestry Law of the
People's Republic of China went into enforcement today to
replace the old law in place for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Administration,
said that the new law will not only contribute greatly to the
protection and development of China's forestry resources, but will
also improve the nation's.
</P>
<P>
China adopted a pilot forestry law in 1979, with the old
forestry law going into effect on January 1, 1985.
</P>
<P>
The amended forestry law underlines the protection and
management of forestry law resources, and will both establish a
compensation fund for forest ecology and provide new financial
sources for reforestation and landscaping programs, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the amended law also strengthen protection
of the nation's precious plant species.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang acknowledged that the amended law and the new
Criminal Law stipulate heavy penalties for the destruction of
forestry law resources.
</P>
<P>
The director urged the related forestry law departments to
amend existing codes and regulations to coincide with the new
forestry law law, and to "enforce their work to protect the
nation's forestry law resources".
</P>
<P>
China's forest coverage currently stands at 14 percent,
according to a recent government bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also announced a decision to halt
timbering in natural forests.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights (UNHCHR) Mrs Mary Robinson has expressed deep concern
over the continuing expulsion of Eritrean nationals from Ethiopia,
saying the actions are serious violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply concerned by the violation of human rights of
Eritrean nationals being expelled from Ethiopia, and particularly
by the fact that their passports are being stamped 'expelled,
never to return'," Robinson said in a statement issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, others who had been trying to leave have had
their identity cards confiscated, she said..
</P>
<P>
"These are serious violations of the rights and freedoms set
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as in
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which
Ethiopia is a party," she said.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner appealed to the governments of Ethiopia
and Eritrea "to look urgently at ways of restoring dialogue with
each other".
</P>
<P>
"I also call upon the government of Ethiopia to respect the
rights of non-discrimination and freedom of movement, and to meet
its obligations under the international covenants and other human
rights treaties it has ratified," she said.
</P>

thousands of others in the two countries.

<HEADLINE> New Members of Indonesia's People's Consultative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 39 new members of
Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) were sworn in at
a ceremony here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday appointed 41 new members of
MPR to replace those retired by him or who had resigned or passed
away. However, two of them refused to accept the appointment.
</P>
<P>
There was no explanation about the decision to retire the old
members, all of whom were selected by former president Soeharto
from functional groups to represent the ruling Golkar party.
</P>
<P>
But the decision was seen by the local press as a surprising
political move aimed at restructuring the MPR, the country's
highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
A number of MPR members have resigned following public pressure
to cleanse the assembly of all elements of corruption, collusion
and nepotism. Those who already tendered their resignation include
the wives and children of serving or former government officials.
But the children of Soeharto have resisted calls for them to
resign.
</P>
<P>
The 41 nominations were within the 100 which the president has
the right to empty or fill under existing laws. The 1,000-member
MPR is made up of elected parliamentarians and a slightly greater
number of appointed members.
</P>
<P>
Names of the new members listed by Habibie include several
ministers from his cabinet, two prominent figures from the ethnic
Chinese Indonesian community and a human rights activist, among
others.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Successful Year for Hong Kong SAR: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The past year has seen a very
successful implementation of the concept of "one country, two
systems," Hong Kong newspapers said Wednesday, the first
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to the motherland a year ago is a major
event in the history of the development of both the Chinese nation
and the world," the Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po said
editorially.
</P>
<P>
"Inspired by the strengthening of the overall power of the
motherland and increase of its international fame and influence
and fully backed by the central government, the Hong Kong people,
under the effective leadership of the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government, have successfully implemented the concept
of 'one country, two systems'," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The historic concept has won increasing support from the Hong
Kong people. And more and more people at home and abroad have come
to understand and accept the concept raised by late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping, and it has become a common treasure for the whole
mankind," the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The paper listed the factors behind the successful
implementation of the concept, which are the central government's
full support, the effective administration by the SAR government
led by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the involvement and
participation of the Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the concept in the Hong Kong SAR is believed to
help push Macao's return next year to the motherland and more and
more compatriots in Taiwan will come to believe that the concept
is also applicable there," the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
"A recent survey carried out in Taiwan showed more people than
ever before there have come to believe that the concept is
applicable in Taiwan. And some organizations have called upon the
local authorities to begin negotiations with the mainland on the
country's reunification in accordance with the concept," another
Chinese language paper Ta Kung Pao said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Reunification is an irresistible historical trend and the only
way out for Taiwan is a peaceful reunification (with the mainland)
through implementing the concept of 'one country, two systems',"
the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR has in the past year withstood the impact of
the Asian financial turmoil and consolidated the foundation for
its prosperity and stability, to the satisfaction of the Hong Kong
residents, the central government and the international
community," Hong Kong Commercial Daily commented in an editorial
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China's central government is fully confident of the Hong Kong
people, believing that they love the motherland and Hong Kong,
they are serious in implementing the concept of 'one country, two
systems' and they are capable of managing local affairs," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the efforts of the Hong Kong people, the local economy
will recover soon," the paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> China Investigates Grain Bureau for Fund Diversion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A grain bureau in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province has been investigated for misusing grain
procurement funds and two officials found accountable have been
dismissed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Investigations based on clues provided by the public have shown
that the Suihua City Grain Bureau, in Heilongjiang Province,
diverted a total of 91.91 million yuan in funds for purchasing
grain and edible oil between September 1996 and May this year.
</P>
<P>
A news release on the investigation said that, in September of
1996, the grain bureau decided by itself to move some 100,000 tons
of grain, including 970,000 tons of corn, from its subsidiary
storages to be stored in Dalian, a coastal city in Liaoning
Province. The grain was valued at 120 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To hide the facts, the bureau did not make any financial
booking about the grain movement or entered the transfer into the
account book. Instead, it opened an account at the city branch of
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in violation of
government rules.
</P>
<P>
Later the bureau sold the corn, at prices lower than the
purchasing prices, to the Guangdong Huaqiao Youyi Corporation, in
southern Guangdong Province, to Harbin Daoli District Food Market
and to some other buyers, and then deposited into its bank account
the 95.87 million yuan obtained from the deal.
</P>
<P>
Of the cash amount, the bureau used 40.99 million yuan to
construct a hotel, an office building and residential housings,
lent 48 million yuan to its subsidiary grain enterprises and goods
and materials companies, used 936,000 million yuan to buy
automobiles, and spent the remaining 1.92 million yuan for other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Besides fund diversion, the bureau has also been found to buy
goods and materials for construction of grain storage facilities
in excess of the official limit in exchange for 276,900 yuan in
kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang provincial government has paid close attention
to the fund diversion issue. It has decided to auction off the
hotel and residential housings built with the diverted funds and
use the money from the auction to pay back loans from the local
branch of the Agricultural Development Bank of China, a policy
bank specialized in the extension of loans for grain procurement.
</P>
<P>
The director of the grain bureau and the president of the
branch bank have been dismissed from their posts. Investigation of
the bureau's problems will continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers from
Portuguese-Speaking African countries who were meeting in Sao
Tome &AMP; Principe have expressed worries over the current situation
in Angola and Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Tuesday after the one-day meeting, the
ministers called for a complete disarmament by the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and an unconditional
demobilization of its remnant militiamen, the Angola News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also appreciated the Angolan government's
flexibility in postponing the deadline to June 30 for UNITA to
finish the tasks prescribed in the Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
They believed that if UNITA fails to meet the deadline, the
United Nations Security Council sanctions will immediately take
effect.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also expressed their deep condolences to
the death of Alioune Blondin Beye, the U.N. special envoy to
Angola in a plane crash, appealing to the international community
to redouble efforts to ensure the peace agreement in Angola be
implemented so as to avoid a reoccurrence of civil war there.
</P>
<P>
The meeting condemned the armed mutiny in Guinea Bissau,
stressing that dialog should be a first choice in dealing with
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged that a rule of law must be restored in the
west African country in a bid to respect the democratically
elected government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said the funeral ceremony of Beye was held
Tuesday in his home country of Mali. Angolan government, the
opposition UNITA, United Nations, and Portugal, United States and
Russia and some African countries have sent representatives to
pay their last respects to Beye who had devoted his life to the
peace in Angola.

</P>
<P>
Amid the applause of more than 1,000 traders wearing red vests,
Clinton entered the major transaction hall of the stock exchange
at about 12:10 (local time) in the company of Shanghai Mayor Xu

bonds, enterprise bonds and financial bonds, among others.
</P>
<P>

and showed him the way of operation on a computer in front of
him.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Henan Reports Successful Grain Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has been successful in procuring and storing summer grain,
official statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Henan, one of China's leading grain producers, had stored 1.598
billion kg of wheat by June 25, about 48 percent of the official
quota this year.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to unsmooth circulation and marketing, Henan's
storage of grain has totaled 18 billion kg this year, about 10
billion kg more than the normal years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful implementation of the national grain
circulation system, Henan has taken all possible measures to
expand its grain storage capacity. The current storing capacity of
10 billion kg is largely enough to store newly procured grain.
</P>
<P>
No IOUs have been issued to farmers in exchange for their grain
harvest, a provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has also revoked the licenses of some
private grain peddlers to ensure order in grain procurement.

SHENYANG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province expects the output value for its marine industry to grow
dramatically to over 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The booming marine industry has emerged as a new area of
growth in Liaoning's economy," according to Zhang Hongsheng,
director of the provincial marine and aquatic products industry
department.

<P>
The industry recorded a 1997 output value of 35 billion yuan

Liaoning, one of China's leading industrial centers, introduced
plans to develop its marine industry in 1986, with the sector
having since recorded average annual growth of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
To date, off-shore Fishing still accounts for a 45 share of
the marine industry, down dramatically from 70 percent in 1985,
Zhang said, adding that the maritime travel industry currently
accounts for 20 percent of the total output value for the marine
industry.

<HEADLINE> Ford to Further Increase Presence in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The world's second largest auto
manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, will expand its cooperation
with Chinese partners in developing alternative fuels and cutting
down auto pollution.
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Koshkarian, Ford vice president and Ford China chairman
and CEO, told Xinhua in an interview today that Ford will further
expand its business presence in China.
</P>
<P>
"Ford has a long history in China, and the cooperation between
Ford and Chinese partners over the past few years have resulted in
outstanding achievements. We very much want to support and
participate in the growth of China's auto industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far Ford has set up five joint ventures in China, producing
air conditioners, electronics products, glass, plastic ornaments
and other products used in automobiles, and it also holds shares
in China's Jiangling Motors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ford has also built a nationwide service network
with 44 servicing centers throughout China, providing
comprehensive after-sale services for customers.
</P>
<P>
Koshkarian cited Transit, Ford's jointly developed vehicle with
Jiangling, as an example of successful cooperation with Chinese
partners.
</P>
<P>
"The participation of local engineers in auto development very
much helps develop the capability of local manufacturers," he said.

He said that Ford has been involved in a lot of research
programs in China, many of which are related to fuel availability,
alternative fuels, rare earth catalysts and environmental
concerns.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is rich in coal resources, and currently
Ford is doing a research study jointly with Chinese partners on
the use of coal as a fuel for transportation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that China cherishes a huge market for alternative
fuels. Ford has more than 30 years' experience in developing clean
gaseous fuel. This advantage will benefit our Chinese customers
and partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ford also pays attention to the training of local technicians,
he said. So far Ford has sent more than 100 people from its
Chinese joint ventures to the United States, Europe and other
locations for training.
</P>
<P>
Ford has also set up technician training schools in Beijing and
Nanchang to train local employees.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that, considering the huge population of
1.2 billion, China has great potentials for auto industry
development. In the foreseeable future, China is going to be the
third or fourth largest auto producer in the world, or even the
largest at some points.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Fifty billion Uganda shillings (50
million U.S. Dollars) spent by the government and departments in
excess of what had originally been budgeted in the 1997/98
financial year ending Tuesday has been endorsed by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
A New Vision paper report said Wednesday that the government
had budgeted 647.7 billion shillings (647 million Dollars) for
recurrent spending and 749,7 billion shillings (749 million
Dollars) for capital development.
</P>
<P>
It spent 680 billion shillings (680 million Dollars) in the
first field and 755 billion shillings (755 million Dollars) in
the latter, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Although parliament passed the supplementary expenditure
without a quorum, the members of parliament took the Minister of
State for Finance and Economic Planning, Mr. Sam Kutesa, to task
over the excessive spending incurred by State House on President
Yoweri Museveni's foreign and inland travels as well as fuel and
lubricants.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs said the president's trips had increased the State
House expenditure by 4 billion shillings or four million Dollars,
almost one third of the oral budget.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry was also criticized for some inefficiency
in budget management and for preferring to incur supplementary
spendings instead of seeking approval from parliament in advance.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Market anticipation of a package
to fix the ailing Japanese banking sector drove the Australian
dollar almost one U.S. cent higher on the first day of the new
financial year (1998-99).
</P>
<P>
The fickle local currency Wednesday night closed above 62.00
U.S. cents for the first time in over a month. It ended the day
here at 62.27 U.S. cents, from 61.47 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"To have an Australian dollar closing in Sydney above 62.20
U.S. cents is a strong signal," Commonwealth Bank senior manager
of foreign exchange Kurt Magnus said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Australian dollar was stronger because of four
factors.
</P>
<P>
"The yen is stronger, the prospects for a China devaluation are
much lower, commodities are stronger and there is a better
prospect for Australia's current account," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We see those four things as being critical in keeping the
Australian dollar at some level of support above 62.00 U.S.
cents."
</P>
<P>
Magnus said "the market is concentrating on what the Japanese
yen does and is very closely watching any news on the possibility
of income tax cuts, corporate tax cuts and a rigid, structured
program to bail out their banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign exchange market was skeptical as to
whether Japan would make the necessary reforms, Magnus said.
</P>
<P>
If suitable reforms do not eventuate, then the downside risk
will return for both the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"If the Japanese don't come up with the goods, then we are back
to the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen going lower."
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar was trading at 85.79
Japanese yen from 86.14 and 1.1251 German marks from 1.1111.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Taiwanese companies have been
increasing their investment in southwest China's Sichuan Province
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese have funded approximately 900 enterprises in Sichuan,
with a total of 800 million U.S. dollars worth of investment, more
than in any other provinces and regions in the central and western
parts of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
A local official says that Taiwanese have also diversified and
improved their investment, with more money going into chemicals,
electronics, and other high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Some large companies from Taiwan are also investing in
Sichuan. High-tech Taiwanese-backed firms in Chengdu, the
provincial capital, had 480 million yuan (57.8 million US dollars)
in combined output value and 15 million yuan (1.8 million US
dollars) in profits.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese businesspeople have also made investment in some
relatively remote areas which abounds with natural resources.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- All importers and exporters
of foodstuffs are requested to send their samples to Tanzanian
National Radiation Commission (NRC) before they are cleared for
distribution in a bid to protect consumers against radiation.
</P>
<P>
A statement reaching here by NRC based in northern Arusha said
Wednesday that the Commission will issue certificates to those
whose products meet its conditions under a Tanzanian Act set to
control radiation contamination on foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Non-compliance of importers and exporters with the regulations
will be liable to a minimum fine of 10,000 Tanzanian Shillings
(about 15 U.S. Dollars) or a six-month jail sentence, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission strongly appeals for your close and maximum
cooperation in the implementation and enforcement for effective
compliance with these regulations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by the NRC registrar Abraham Nyanda,
said that the existing free market economy allows imports and
exports of foodstuffs, but most of them lack expiry dates or are
poorly packed.
</P>
<P>
"Neither do they have radiation levels marked on the
containers nor radiation clearance certificates issued," the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Starts 5-Year Health Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government on
Wednesday started a health and population sector program aimed at
raising efficiency and effectiveness of primary health-care at the
grassroots level across the country.
</P>
<P>
The program was approved recently by the country's Executive
Committee for National Economic Council following negotiations
between the donor consortium led by the World Bank and Bangladeshi
government.
</P>
<P>
The first year of the program, at a cost of 2.9 billion U.S.
dollars, would be a transitional period both in terms of
structuring and functioning.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, 2.1 billion dollars would come from the
government's revenue and development budget while the rest would
be funded by the donors.
</P>
<P>
A recent review of the Fourth Population and Health Project,
which officially ended on June 30 this year, by the World Bank
mission in the country said the project has achieved most of its
objectives, particularly those related to reducing fertility,
child mortality, malnutrition and controlling communicable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, routine administrative weaknesses, such as frequent
transfer of key officials, delay in releasing of funds, and
inappropriate use of expensive specialized training still
constrained the performance of the project at least in the initial
years, the review said.
</P>
<P>
And little progress was made in such areas as maternal health
service and human resource development which had a "serious effect
on efficiency of service implementation and training program," the
World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that effective implementation and close
monitoring of the new program is needed to see continued progress
in maternal health care, human resources development and
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's poorest countries, child malnutrition is
very common in Bangladesh with nearly half of its 127
million-population living in poverty and a child mortality rate
of about 76 per 1,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Natural Science Fund
Committee (SNSFC) plans to provide five million yuan for
scientific studies to curb desertification.
</P>
<P>
Desertification represents a major ecological problem which has
attracted global attention. Problems related to expanding
desertification currently affect some 2.6 million sq.km., or
27 percent of the nation's total land area.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists point out that desertification has seriously
affected many aspects of the national economy, degraded the
productivity of land, decreased crop yields and threatened the
nation's transportation, water conservation and national defence
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The SNSFC project will place priority on research related to
the balance between water and other natural materials in the
ecological system, as well as the causes of desertification in
different climate zones and regions. The project will establish a
comprehensive system to curb desertification involving different
climates and land-use characteristics.

just as dangerous."

Zagallo mentioned the injury of Ronaldo but said he was not
really worried:"I'm not very worried about Ronaldo's physical

up the muscles in that area."

aiming to counter-attack. I think we've already shown that we don't
consider this much of a problem."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends His China Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
defended his China trip here today by saying that Americans "go
around the world telling people that no one has a monopoly on the
truth...we don't either."
</P>
<P>
There are some people who actually question whether Clinton
ought to have come on this trip and who had prescriptive advice,
"which would have completely undermined the effectiveness of the
trip," according to the president.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to explain to American colleagues and friends
back home the importance of our engagement with China," said
Clinton, who is on the third leg of his nine-day state visit to
China, while meeting a group of entrepreneurs in the largest
Chinese economic center, Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He has cited in today's as well as earlier talks many important
agreements he reached with his Chinese counterpart, President
Jiang Zemin, during their official talks on June 27 on security
and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
He particularly stressed the important role China has played in
maintaining Asia's economic stability.
</P>
<P>
"I must say that I appreciate the very constructive role China
has played in promoting financial stability in the region, through
direct assistance, multilateral cooperation, participation in the
international institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We live in a world where the unique position of the United
States...with all our economic strength, is such that we can
maximize our influence only by reaching out a hand of cooperation
as well as standing strong when the moment requires it," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make most of our progress with most people by
working with them, and that requires us to seek to understand and
communicate and reciprocate and to live by the values we espouse,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot to do to help America and China reach their full
potential in the 21st century," the president noted.

<P>
TOKYO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices gained for the sixth
consecutive trading day Wednesday in Tokyo with the key Nikkei
index climbing above 16,000 for the first time since late April.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors rushed to buy steel, banking and construction
issues after a Japanese daily reported that a permanent income tax
cut of 2 trillion to 4 trillion yen (about 14.5 billion dollars to
29.0 billion dollars) is likely next year as part of the
government's effort to boost the sluggish Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 532.62 points, or 3.36
percent, from Tuesday's close to finish at 16,362.89.

</P>
<P>

million shares from Tuesday's 576.30 million shares.

The yen's recent recovery against the U.S. dollar in currency
markets, as well as the permanent tax cut report, triggered
massive net buying by foreign brokerages, traders said.

<HEADLINE> East China City Planning Large Urban Construction Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The capital of east China's Shandong
Province has plans to spend 28 billion yuan (3.37 billion US
dollars) on urban development in the next five years for more than
20 key construction projects, according to the deputy mayor, Tao
Anling.
</P>
<P>
The projects are expected to greatly change the old industrial
city's infrastructure and urban setting, Tao said. One is a
73-km ring road, with an estimated cost of five billion yuan (600
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other projects include expansion at the airport, water and gas
facilities, developing green areas and parks, and building several
large residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
Tao went on to say that housing construction alone will use 15
billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars) during the five-year
period. Funds will come from state and local coffers, bank loans,
real estate development, and foreign government loans.
</P>
<P>
Far-sighted overseas investors are welcome to invest in Jinan's
urban construction, Tao says.
</P>
<P>
A number of large companies from the United States and Britain
have already invested in water and power plants.

<HEADLINE> Danish Coach Tips Jorgensen As Star of Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Swedish coach Bo Johansson
said Martin Jorgensen would be a star of the future for Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Jorgensen plays for Italian club Udinese and
holds a record of 34 caps for the Danish under-21 team.
</P>
<P>
Johansson didn't start Jorgensen in Denmark's matches in the
France'98 World Cup finals, but as a substitute, Jorgensen has proved
that he has the ability to be the new prince of Denmark football.
</P>
<P>
"It is wonderful for Danish football that there is a player like
Martin coming through just as Michael Laudrup retires," said
Johansson.
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about Martin is his versatility. Michael
Laudrup is one of the greatest footballers of his generation, but I
think Martin's all-round game is even better." Johansson said.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said:"It is certainly fair to say that we see him as
Michael's natural replacement. There are a lot of similarities
between the two of them."
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen has always played on the right wing for Denmark, but
Johansson said he was even betteron the left from where he loves to
cut inside from the wing and run at defenders.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if Johansson would put Jorgensen in Denmark's
starting line-up for the quarter-final match against hosts France.

the whole Kosovo province. It also exports coal to Greece and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman expressed his lack of

intervention by the president of Israel in the history of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
--The Islamic militant group of Algeria, the Armed Islamic
Group, has claimed responsibility for last week's assassination of
the singer Matoub Lounes. Algerian security forces sealed off the

</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:

Jospin have attained record high, according to latest polls. The

percent in May, and that of Jospin is 66 percent.
</P>

PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Italian team are worried about the
return of French playmaker Zinedine Zidane when the two teams clash
in the quarter-finals in Paris on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zidane will be available in the match after serving a two-match
ban for stamping an opponent in a group match.
</P>
<P>
Italian midfielder Dino Baggio, who is expected to be assigned
the job of marking the gifted French playmaker, said:"It's very hard
to get the ball off him. Zidane is a very important player, an
exceptional player. He is the one who makes things happen."
</P>
<P>
Defender Alessandro Costacurta said:"You can't stop him by
marking him. All you can do is to limit what he does. But then even
if you did that, there's also Trezeguet, Djorkaef and the others to
look after."

Striker Enrico Chiesa said:"Zidane is one of the best players in

<HEADLINE> One Million Dollars Invested in Tobacco in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- About one million U.S. Dollars has
been ploughed into various tobacco-related projects in Zambia
this year, according to the International Tobacco Growers
Association (ITGA).
</P>
<P>
The latest ITGA newsletter said that many tobacco farmers,
including small-scale producers, have invested in various
projects, giving a total investment of around one million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the current season, five tobacco growers commissioned
new irrigation systems, doubling the previous irritated crop.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it said, five new forced-air curing systems were
also commissioned.
</P>
<P>
The new systems are an interesting development that will
contribute a great deal to the financial viability of tobacco
production.
</P>
<P>
Each development represents an investment of 75,000 to 150,000
Dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
Many small-scale producers have also invested in
infrastructure to expand their crop programs, according to ITGA.
</P>
<P>
Considering the country's small commercial tobacco-producing
community, Tobacco Association Zambia said these investments are
a notable development reflecting on the confidence of Zambian
farmers on their crop as well as the nation.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Mozambicans Legalized in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 8,000 Mozambicans have
been given a legal working status in the past six years in South
Africa, according to Petro Taimo, Mozmabique's Labor Ministry
representative in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African authorities are considering legalizing
another 4,000 Mozambicans currently living and working in
Transvaal, in the northern part of South Africa, Taimo was quoted
by Wednesday's Noticias newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mozambicans often complain of their detention in South Africa
and that they could not take back their properties after being
expelled from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Taimo believed that the detention and expulsion cases of
Mozambicans illegally working and living in South Africa are
increasing, due to poor coordination with the South African
Ministry of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The properties of the expelled should be well handled," he
said, noting that another worrying issue is that the detained
were not given humanitarian treatment in the transition center,
and that South African police were quite ill-mannered with
detained Mozambican citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, Taimo added, he is now consulting with South African
Ministry of Home Affairs and trying to reach an agreement in this
regard.

<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- British press rush to blame David
Beckham's madness in the match against Argentina which possibly cost
England's World Cup glory.
</P>
<P>
Beckham was sent off in the match after making a rash
over-reaction to being fouled. England were beaten in the penalty
shoot-out and were eliminated from the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Britian's biggest selling paper The Sun described Beckham's
actions as "a moment of madness".
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail said it was a "Moment of lunacy that cost cup
hopes". It argued that had Beckham stayed, "Hoddle's men must have
great chance of winning".
</P>
<P>
Another British tabloid Daily Star saw Beckham's red card as the
result of a "stupid retaliation".
</P>
<P>
But former England star Sir Bobby Charlton pleaded for
understanding. He said:"He is going to have to bear the brunt of it
for some time. David Beckham will take the blame this thime but he
has a lot of support and he will get over it. He will be ok."

by the new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar, local media said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sack of Wada Nas, Wole Oyelese and Lazarus Unaogu with

Idris, the secretary to the Government of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "The Head of State thanked the former
Special Advisers for their past contributions to the nation's

</P>
<P>
The three special advisers were appointed by Abacha early this
year following their removal as special duties ministers last
November in a major cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The special advisers, especially Wada Nas, played a major role
in the campaign for Abacha to succeed himself as a civilian
president in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Idris announced the sack of National
Security Adviser Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo. He was replaced by
retired Major-General Abdullahi Mohammed, the first

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cloning Bill Passes First Reading in Knesset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (Parliament) has
passed the first reading of a bill that would prohibit genetic
cloning in Israel and impose a punishment of up to three years in
prison for violating the law, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which cleared its first reading in the Knesset
Science Committee Tuesday, states that "authorization shall not be
granted to any drug, radiation, or chemical, biological,
radiological or pharmacologic material that ... is intended to
affect the health, body or mental state of a person or a fetus or
any part (of either), including genetic material."
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset member Haggai Merom, who introduced the bill in
the wake of the successful cloning by Scottish scientists of the
sheep named Dolly early last year, said he was motivated to submit
the bill by growing fears of the possibility of cloning human
beings.
</P>
<P>
Some of the scientists who participated in Tuesday's committee
meeting expressed concern that the legislature has the power to
restrict scientific freedom. But the newspapers quoted Merom as
emphasizing that he had spent much time listening to many
scientists who were invited to help formulate the draft law.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the wording of the bill provides a
response to the threat while enabling scientists to continue with
their work," he said.

<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Dutch defender Michael Reiziger may
miss the quarter-final match against Argentina in Marseille on
Saturday as he broke a bone in his foot.
</P>
<P>
Reziger sustained the injury in the first half of their 2-1
victory over Yugoslavia but played on until the end.
</P>
<P>
Guus Hiddink, coach of the Dutch team, said:"I hope nothing is
broken but I fear the worst."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Dutch goal-keeper Edwin van der Sar threw a
blow at defender Winston Bogarde during their celebrations of
victory and Hiddink denied the report.
</P>
<P>
"We all laughed about the incident before training," said Hiddink,
"We know that there are a lot of people around and if there is nothing
else to do it is interesting to make a lot of fuss about nothing."
</P>
<P>
Captain Frank de Boer said the team had learned the lessons of
1996 European Championships and would not be disturbed by any
incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said today that China will join Belarus in effort to further
the overall development of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks this morning during a meeting with visiting
Belarussian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich. He said China fully
respects the development path Belarus has adopted in accordance
with its own national conditions and attaches great importance to
furthering relations with the country.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that Sino-Belarussian relations have grown steadily
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties, with constant
high-level contacts and positive results in bilateral exchanges
and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also enjoyed good cooperation in
international affairs, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the achievements Belarus has recorded
in recent years and expressed hope that the country and its people
will enjoy continuing prosperity and happiness.
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said his country values its relations with China and
appreciates its monumental achievements since the introduction of

GUANGZHOU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Guangdong

general public to act promptly to battle flooding which has
devastated major portions of the province and continue threatening
well-being and property of local residents.
</P>

Torrential rains since the middle of June have filled
reservoirs to capacity and caused flooding along all major
rivers. Some 81 people have either died or are missing, with
direct economic losses estimated at 1.64 billion yuan (205 million
US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Better Life For Tibetans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zhabsang, a 57-year-old Tibetan
woman, who moved out of her low cramped house with her sister and
nephew into a bright three-room flat equipped with telephone and
gas stove, says, "I never imagined that I could live in such
comfort."
</P>
<P>
This is Zhabsang's third move. Before 1959, her parents were
servants of a local landlord at a time when eight family members
were crowded into a dark nine-square-meter room on Bargor Street.
</P>
<P>
But, when compared with those people sleeping out in the open,
even that was considered lucky, she says bitterly. Local archives
showed that, in 1950, those people without their own housing
accounted for 90 percent of the people.
</P>
<P>
After the 1959 democratic reforms in Tibet, Zhabsang's big
family was given three single-storey dwellings that were dark.
</P>
<P>
But, things are changing now, according to Pasang, of Lhasa's
housing bureau. In the past five years, Tibet has spent 1.77
billion yuan (213 million U.S. dollars) on housing. Lhasa tore
down 208,400 square meters of old buildings and helped more than
4,000 families move to new apartments equipped with running water.
</P>
<P>
Urban per capita floor space has been 14 square meters in Tibet
since the 1990s, which is more than the amount of many developed
coastal cities, Pasang says.
</P>
<P>
Today's Lhasa has 51 square kilometers of downtown area, with a
population of 130,000, as opposed to only 3 square kilometers and
30,000 people half a century ago.

chief Arnaldo de Oliveira Sales, star cyclist Wong Kam-po and
Wushu expert Ng Siu-ching were included in a 230-strong local

</P>
<P>
Sales, former president of the Amateur Sports Federation and
Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, will be awarded the
top-honored Grand Bauhinia Medal while Wong and NG would both be

</P>
<P>
This was the first full Honors List since Hong Kong's handover

</P>
<P>
Sales is awarded a Grand Bauhinia Medal "for his outstanding
contribution to the development of amateur sports and the Olympic
movement in Hong Kong," a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
Wong, 24, earned the medal for his outstanding performance in
cycling and contribution to the development of the sports in Hong
Kong. Wong became the hero of the Hong Kong SAR team at the Eighth
National Games last year in Shanghai, where he won the men's
158-kilometer individual road race. He was the first ever
gold-medalist from Hong Kong at any National Games.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Wooden Boat Discovered In Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a vessel that was built more than 870 years ago at the
Cangzhou section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal in Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The 15-meter boat was found while the navigation channel of the
canal was being dredged. The timbers have not rotted even though
it has been submerged for more than 870 years.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have concluded that the ship is from the Song
Dynasty (960-1127) because of its design and the relics found with
it, like pottery, iron and bronze tools, and coins used during the
Song.
</P>
<P>
The 1,789 kilometer-long Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal was built
during the Sui Dynasty (518-618) and was expanded during the Tang
(618-907) and Song (960-1279). The canal is the world's longest
and serves as a major water course connecting northern and
southern China.

<P>
CHENGDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- An agricultural resources
development project on the Anning River watershed, in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, is being appraised by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The 2.4-billion-yuan (290 million US dollars) project, with 130
million U.S. dollars from the World Bank, will be decided on by
the bank in December.
</P>
<P>
The Anning is a tributary of the Yangtze, on the upper reaches,
and covers a 3.4 million-hectare area.
</P>
<P>
The project was listed last year as a state-level experiment in
comprehensive agricultural development, mainly focusing on using
biological resources.
</P>
<P>
It will involve 15 counties and 3.4 million people with its
projects in water conservation, grain and fruit production, and
farm product processing. It also aims to help 500,000 needy
farmers, and relocate 400,000 rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had used World Bank loans
worth 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in 32 projects.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Radio: U.S. Wants to Keep Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's state-run Tehran radio said
Wednesday that the United States intended to stand in the way of
lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq by creating new tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a first reaction to the U.S. missile attack on an Iraqi
radar station on Tuesday, Tehran radio said that the attack was
aimed at postponing the lift of sanctions, imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The attack, taking place after Iraq and the chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler reached an agreement to try to finish the
U.N. arms inspections in Iraq within two months, dampened the
prospect, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. F-16 fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi radar station
Tuesday, on the excuse that the radar locked on four British
patrol planes enforcing the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The zone was imposed by the U.S., British and French forces in
1991 with the claimed aim to protect Shiite Muslim Iraqis. An
extension of the zone in 1996 pushed its northern boundary to the
33rd parallel.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said that the radar unit was not working at the
time when it was raided, and it reserved the right to defend.
</P>
<P>
There is so far no official Iranian comment on the attack.
Tehran radio said the latest attack caused great concern about
tension in the region, and called on Baghdad to show
self-restraint in order to prevent a new crisis.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Orders Probe Over Senior Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
was so angry with the alleged smuggling activities of senior army
officers that he has ordered an investigation into the issue.
</P>
<P>
Col. Geoffrey Taban, the commanding officer of the Third
Division, and his second-in-command Lt. Col. Levi Karuhanga were
said to have been involved in a case of smuggling goods from
neighboring Kenya, Wednesday's Monitor paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Their trouble began when a Tata lorry of the Uganda People's
Defense Forces (UPDF) was impounded transporting smuggled goods
at a Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) check point in east Mbale
district on June 15, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Taban had allegedly gone to the check point dressed in
civilian attire to negotiate the release of the smuggled goods,
and the lorry from URA customs officials, it added.
</P>
<P>
The impounded goods include 121 cartons and 18 packets of
Kenya-made Supermatch cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner-General of URA, Elly Rwakakooko, said
investigations are being conducted into the matter, adding that
the authority does not accuse anybody until it has proved with
solid evidence that someone had a hand in the smuggling scandal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
troops that have been stationed in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) as of July 1 last year have won praise
from the SAR government and the local people.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhenwu, commander of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, said that
his troops are responsible for defending the "one country, two
systems" policy and to see that it strictly follows the law.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Garrison Law exempts servicemen from customs
inspections while on duty, but they follow strict rules and pass a
security check and examine all vehicles and men, whether on duty
or on holiday. No discipline problems have been reported, even
though several thousand officers, enlisted men, and vehicles have
been checked.
</P>
<P>
All officers and enlisted men have two books: the Basic Law and
the Garrison Law. They are required to be familiar with each
article of the two laws, and to act in accordance with them.
</P>
<P>
Because of their rigorous adherence to this, the PLA troops
have impressed many Hong Kong residents. Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the HKSAR, said on the eve of the Traditional Spring
Festival in early this year that with such disciplined troops
responsible for the defence of Hong Kong, the central government,
the SAR government and its people can all rest assured.

The growth in industrial exports, excluding diamonds, was
mostly boosted by increased sales of telecommunications,
surveillance, medical and scientific equipment, the newspaper
quoted statistics of the Industry and Trade Ministry as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech products accounted for half of the overall
increase in industrial exports.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there was a decline in exports in traditional
sectors, especially food and jewelry, and a slowdown in growth of
sectors such as minerals and plastics. The overall exports were up
5.8 percent in the first five months this year from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Industry and Trade Ministry said the growth in high-tech
exports was better than expected in light of the Asian financial
crisis, global trade conditions, and the rise in wages in the
sector in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, however, warned that these factors, including
the devaluation of Asian currencies, could result in a decline in
high-tech exports in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months, imports were down 1.7 percent,
resulting in a 22.6 percent reduction in the trade deficit,
compared with a year earlier.

JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Likud coalition chairman Meir Sheetrit met
President Ezer Weizman Tuesday in an effort to mediate between
Weizman and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to lower "the
unnecessary tension." Sheetrit said Weizman told him he had
nothing personal against Netanyahu, and his critical statements
derived from his deep concern for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Britain are leading a diplomatic
drive to keep the U.N. Security Council from voting on a
resolution condemning the planned expansion of Jerusalem by
asking the council to issue a presidential statement instead.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu Tuesday accused Weizman of siding with the Arabs,
a day after Weizman's unprecedented call for early elections.
Netanyahu hoped that Weizman would work toward widening the
consensus in the nation and helping the government in its
"international struggle" to achieve peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Mapping System for S. Africa's 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has spent
millions of U.S. Dollars preparing an electronic mapping system
to position 12,000 voting districts around the country for the
general election next year.
</P>
<P>
The system was jointly compiled by the Independent Electoral
Commission (IEC), the Land Affairs Department, the Central
Statistical Service and hundreds of outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
The system, a computerized geographic and population database,
constitutes the first comprehensive electronic map of every town,
informal settlement, agricultural area and rural village in South
Africa, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IEC deputy chief electoral officer Norman du Plessis said the
country had been divided into 12,000 voting districts on a
political basis and the size of each district would be determined
by the walking distances to its polling station -- 7.5 kilometers
in urban areas and 10 kilometers in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
Urban voting districts would be limited to a population of
3,000, and those in rural areas to 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
The delimitation process should be completed by the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu said the districts would
be the framework upon which the national common voters' roll
would be compiled. Eligible voters would have to register and
vote in the voting district they live in. The registration of
voters was scheduled to start in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
At the launch of the geographical information system Tuesday,
Australian consultant Jim Howell said the IEC had to use
guesswork in 1994 to estimate the number and places to position
polling stations because it was impossible to determine
population densities over the entire country.
</P>
<P>
"There had never been a formal census population count across
the whole nation, no national voters' roll, and there was no
homogeneous map of the country that would permit election
planning to be performed," Howell said.
</P>
<P>
He added the system is already acknowledged by international
experts as one that could be exported to other countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had achieved in 15 months what it took the U.S.
six years to do, said Howell.
</P>
<P>
Du Plessis said the system had a host of wider applications
and could be used effectively to determine the country's
development needs.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's Sichuan Province spent 44.8
billion yuan (5.4 billion US dollars) on infrastructure like water
conservation, transport, communications, and power projects in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Zou Guangyan, Sichuan's deputy governor, said that his province
had 78 major infrastructure projects, costing 148.3 billion yuan
(17.9 billion US dollars) from 1996 to 1997. By the end of last
year, 13 key projects were in operation.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan increased water conservation work, adding 62,000
hectares of irrigated area, contributing tremendouly to easing
drought problems in the eastern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
Zou noted that the opening of the 340-km Dacheng Railway in
December last year brought railway service to central and eastern
parts of the province. Highways also got a boost with the
Chengdu-Mianyang and Neijiang-Yibin expressways.
</P>
<P>
Post and telecommunications services were also improved with
the addition of 5,400 km long-distance optical cable, 567 km of
microwave trunk lines, and 105,000 long-distance telephone
terminals.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sichuan also succeeded in building power plants with
a technology improvement project at the Baima Power Plant and
three 175,000-kw units at the Baozhusi hydro-electric power plant
bringing the total installed generating capacity in Sichuan to
11.1 million kw, Zou said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Insurance Industry Provides On-Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has became the first
Asian country to get its insurance industry
electronically-connected through the Central Administration Bureau
(CAB) for its facultative reinsurance business.
</P>
<P>
A total of 58 insurance and reinsurance companies based in the
country have gone on-line since Wednesday morning, a statement
issued by CAB said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CAB will handle all administration and central settlement
of the facultative reinsurance business and offers benefits in the
form of increased productivity, faster settlements, reduced
operating costs and improved quality services, it said.
</P>
<P>
The CAB system was an achievement in information technology
which Director of the General Insurance Regulation Department at
Bank Negara (State Bank) Muhammad Ibrahim said could dramatically
change the way the insurance business is conducted in the country.
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry is now looking at a borderless
reinsurance market that is accessible from the office, with CAB
operating as a clearing house for regional insurance exchange, the
official said at the official launching of the CAB system here
Tuesday, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
He called on the industry to explore the possibility of
expanding the scope of the CAB system to include the electronic
settlement of other faculties such as treaty business and
knock-for-knock motor claims.
</P>
<P>
The CAB network can also be utilized to establish a system for
verification of "No Claim Bonus" among insurers, and for the
distribution of circulars to the industry and submissions of
statistics to the General Insurance Association of Malaysia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The CAB is being developed in two phases, with phase one to
take on the function of actual placement of reinsurance and phase
two to extend its services to handle electronic placements and
acceptances.
</P>
<P>
It will also build up historic data on risks to serve as aid
for underwriting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Using Cheaper Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Gasified straw fuel is being seen
as an environmentally friendly and cheap source of energy in
China's rural area.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in China's Shandong Province held by the Ministry
of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the
State Bureau of Environmental Protection, participants explained
that gasified straw fuel can avoid waste and pollution.
</P>
<P>
Straw has long been burnt as fuel in rural China, which
produces 600 million tons of straw every year, 200 million tons of
which is used for cooking fires.
</P>
<P>
And, in some of the more developed parts of the countryside
where gas is becoming more popular as fuel, straw that is left in
the field is just burnt on the spot, with 100 million tons going
up in smoke every year.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke produced in this way in Chengdu, the capital of
Sichuan Province caused 61 flights at Shuangliu Airport to be
suspended or cancelled in May, the most man-made cause of flight
delays in China.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the state environmental protection department has
decided to encourage the use of straw gas. According to one
estimate, a million tons of dust and 600,000 tons of sulphur
dioxide could be eliminated if a tenth of China's villages were to
burn straw gas instead of coal.
</P>
<P>
A straw gasification plant consumes 200 tons of straw and
generates 400,000 cu.m. of gas fuel a year, which is equivalent to
the energy produced by 192 tons of coal or 36 tons of LPG. The gas
costs a household 33.9 yuan a month, which is nearly as cheap as
coal and 40 percent less than LPG.
</P>
<P>
A recent Shandong study showed that 75 percent of the farmers
surveyed preferred straw gas, and the province has set up 54
gasification facilities, which help 8,000 households.

value of 500 U.S. Dollars or more. It was calculated at the rate
of five percent of cost, insurance and freight value of imports,
Zambia Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mark Odonnel, chairman of Zambia Association of Manufacturers,
said manufacturers have been waiting for the IDF to be scrapped.
"We now foresee a stabilization and drop in the prices for goods
in shops."
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers will now be more competitive as raw materials
will cost less, he said, adding that Zambians will join the
export arena on a stronger point.
</P>
<P>
The IDF complete cancellation was projected in the 1998 budget
and among other innovations in the budget were the rejected
increment of the minimum duty on second-hand clothes from 1.50 to
five Dollars a kilogram, reduction of duty on a number of raw
materials and the increase of duty on second-hand vehicles.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has said that the U.N. and the international community
is ready to help Nigeria in its transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived in Nigeria Monday for a four-day visit,
made the remarks Tuesday in Nigerian capital Abuja, at a dinner
hosted in his honor by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according
to reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said his mission in Nigeria is to explore avenues where
the U.N. and the international community could assist Nigeria in
its reconciliation and democratization efforts.
</P>
<P>
He told his host that the U.N. has "no magic formula and we
have not come to dictate, but to offer assistance, if need be."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said he is encouraged by what the new
leadership of Nigeria under General Abdulsalam Abubakar has done
in a very short period, meaning mainly the release of 26
political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Nigeria has a key role to play in Africa and the
world at large, for which it should first get its house in order.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great potential in this country, a country with
very talented people, some here, many outside, but the planes fly
both ways, they can come back and help reconstruct," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. chief, it is a consensus that the new
leadership should move ahead to establish a democratic
government.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is this desire to go through a peaceful,
democratic, credible transition that every Nigerian wants and it
is shared and supported by the international community," he
added.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The summit meeting between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton has been a
mutual triumph for the leaders determined to make friends and make
progress, according to an article published Wednesday by a leading
national newspaper The Australian.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Chinese presidents "have put their trust in each
other and, so far, they have delivered, taking the U.S.-China
relationship onto a new level, an event of great importance for
Australia," Paul Kelly, international editor of the newspaper
wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton's apparently successful visit to China has changed
forever the dialogue between America and China," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Chinese leaders "have built a mutual trust

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Import More Rice, Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has been
advised to import 700,000 tons of rice and 300,000 tons of corn in
the third quarter of 1998 to have a safer buffer by end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday that this will
bring total rice and corn imports in 1998 to 1.77 million tons and
1.15 million tons, which are estimated to cost 680 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Economist Rolando Dy as saying that domestic
production of rice is projected this year to decline by at least
12 percent compared to 1997's, similar to that of 1993 when the El
Nino hit the country.
</P>
<P>
"Rice imports of 1.06 million tons during the first half of
1998 is not sufficient because of the one-month delay in the
harvest. Theoretically, harvest would be (starting in) late
September," Dy said.
</P>
<P>
The projected 700,000 tons of rice imports in the next three
months are intended for the one-month delay in the harvest
assuming a minimum of 22,000 tons of daily consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dy said the government must also import 300,000 tons of corn in
the third quarter to solve the expected supply problem because of
delayed planting harvest.

<HEADLINE> Successful Year for Hong Kong SAR: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The past year since Hong Kong's
reunification with the motherland has proved very successful in
implementing the concept of "one country, two systems," Hong Kong
newspapers said here on Wednesday on the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's reunification with the motherland a year ago is a
major event in the history of the development of both the Chinese
nation and the world," an editorial of the Chinese-language
newspaper Wen Wei Po said.
</P>
<P>
"Inspired by the strengthening of the overall power of the
motherland and increase of its international fame and influence
and fully backed by the central government, the Hong Kong people,
led effectively by the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government, have successfully participated in and implemented the
concept of 'one country, two systems'."
</P>
<P>
"The historic concept has won increasing support from the Hong
Kong people. And more and more people at home and abroad have come
to understand and accept the concept raised by late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping and it has become a common treasure for the whole
mankind," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial cited as the reasons for the success of the
concept the central government's full support, the effective
administration by the SAR government led by Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa and the involvement and participation of the Hong Kong
residents .
</P>
<P>
"The past successful year for the Hong Kong SAR in the
implementation of the concept of 'one country, two systems' is a
good beginning and it has far-reaching influence on Hong Kong's
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the concept in the Hong Kong SAR is believed to
encourage and help push Macao's reunification next year with the
motherland and more and more compatriots in Taiwan will come to
believe that the concept is also applicable there," the newspaper
added.
</P>
<P>
"The unprecedented concept of 'one country, two systems'
created by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was once doubted by
many. But the Hong Kong SAR government and residents, backed by
the central government and people of the mainland, have carried
out the concept creatively to make it a reality in Hong Kong,"
said an editorial by another Chinese-language newspaper, Ta Kung
Pao.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the past year has not only consolidated Hong
Kong people's confidence in the concept of 'one country, two
systems," but also set an example.
</P>
<P>
"A recent survey carried out in Taiwan showed more people than
ever before there have come to believe that the concept is
applicable in Taiwan. And some organizations have called upon the
local authorities to begin negotiations with the mainland on the
country's reunification in accordance with the concept," the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"Reunification is an irresistible historical trend and the only
way out for Taiwan is a peaceful reunification (with the mainland)
through the implementation of 'one country, two systems' which has
proved to be successful in Hong Kong," the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR has in the past year withstood the impact of
the Asian financial turmoil and consolidated the foundation for
its prosperity and stability, to the satisfaction of the Hong Kong
residents, the central government and the international
community," Hong Kong Commercial Daily commented in an editorial
Wednesday. "The year since Hong Kong's reunification with the
motherland has proved to be successful."
</P>
<P>
"China's central government has a high degree of confidence in
the Hong Kong people, believing that Hong Kong residents love the
motherland and Hong Kong, they are serious in implementing the
concept of 'one country, two systems' and they are capable of
managing local affairs," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The past successful year has laid a solid foundation for the
future development of Hong Kong. Through the efforts of the Hong
Kong people, the historic concept will surely be implemented in a
better and mature way and Hong Kong's economy will recover soon to
bring a new look to the Hong Kong SAR when it enters the 21st
century." the paper concluded.

WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Four members of the U.S. World
Cup soccer team showed their sympathy Tuesday to their ex-coach
Steve Sampson, who resigned yesterday after the team wound up the
last among 32 teams in France.
</P>
<P>
Several veteran players of the U.S. team had blamed Sampson for
his poor strategy in the games as well as leaving them on bench.
</P>
<P>
But Brian McBride, who scored the U.S. team's lone goal in the
tournament, said: "I look at it as a whole. It was everybody's
fault, not one person."
</P>
<P>
Sampson, the first American-born coach of a U.S. World Cup
team, was forced out Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the team's veteran players were angered by a lack of
playing time and called for his dismissal in the wake of the
team's last-place finish.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team lost 2-0 to Germany, 2-1 to Iran, and 1-0 to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Sommer, a member of the 1994 U.S. World Cup team who
was a backup goalkeeper this time, said:"The little mistakes are
what cost us dearly."
</P>
<P>
Forward Eric Wynalda, midfielder Tab Ramos and defender Alexi
Lalas and Jeff Agoos have criticized Sampon's strategy, handling
of personnel and player rotation.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Brunei Strives to Diversify Economy (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metali called human resources central to the successful
transformation of Brunei into a diversified industrial economy.
The main areas of interest in human resources development are
managerial and industrial skills, with particular emphasis on
entrepreneurial skills as well as vocational and technical
training, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that currently, local expertise and resources in
training and development are limited. "There are only four
vocational schools to train our future workers and a resources
center to retrain our new entrepreneurs," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we are inviting people from overseas to train
existing entrepreneurs in the managerial skills, in how to be more
commercialized and how to be more globalized in their operations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the diversification of its economic
activities, Brunei opened its doors to foreign investors who can
participate in the above-mentioned four sectors to help transform
its economic landscape.
</P>
<P>
"We consider foreign investment and participation as pivotal
factors in the success of Brunei's aim of diversifying its
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investors, the government has introduced
various incentive programs and foreign investors can enjoy among
other benefits tax incentives and pioneer status; excellent
transport and communications infrastructure; and flexible labor
policy.
</P>
<P>
On the effects of the current regional financial crisis on
Brunei's economy, the official said Brunei, like Singapore, is not
seriously affected. "We do not have that kind of serious effect
like Thailand and Indonesia experienced. But because of the
economic situation around us, we have to be a little bit prudent
in our spending. We are very careful about our spending. In fact
our development spending is also being scaled down so that we do
not fall into the trap like other countries in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
So Brunei is very careful about this year's development
projects, especially new ones. "We are reducing new projects, but
those on-going ones are still going," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if other countries in the region show good
improvements, Brunei is bound to be sharing those good things.
</P>
<P>
Supported by an open economic policy and pursuit of liberal
trade at regional and global fora, Brunei aims to become a service
hub for trade and tourism and is moving forward in that direction
by improving its sea ports, airport and telecommunications system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Crossing Yarlung Zangbo Gorge By Balloon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists and
adventurers plan to cross the world's longest, deepest and perhaps
the most dangerous gorge on the Yarlung Zangbo River by balloon.
</P>
<P>
The 496-km gorge in Tibet has an average depth of 5,000 meters,
and is a challenge to any adventurer. Several Chinese and foreign
teams had tried to go through it, but have all failed, or in some
cases, been killed.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yong, head of the new team, says that there is not enough
information about the dangerous section of the river, so they
decided that it would be best to see the whole gorge from in the
air first, then use a boat team later. The balloons will help
obtain scientific data about the environment and geographic
conditions, he explains, and can be used in rescue operations in
an area where few people live.
</P>
<P>
Yang is an environmentalist who was a member of a Yangtze River
expedition in 1986, in which 11 people were killed in the floating.
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, floating China's big rivers has become a
popular sport for people who want to test their courage.
</P>
<P>
The Yarlung Zangbo starts on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the
highest river in the world, and has a lot of rapids and shoals.
</P>
<P>
Yang's 30-member team was selected from hundreds of volunteers
nationwide, and is being supported by Tibet autonomous regional
government. They will head for the gorge this autumn.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Brunei Strives to Diversify Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metali said that for the primary resources sector, the Brunei
government has a keen interest in maintaining an efficient and
export-oriented agricultural sector with the strategy focusing on
the production of selected priority products such as poultry,
tropical fruits and vegetables and that of orchid and other
high-value ornaments.
</P>
<P>
Venturing into downstream activities like food processing,
repackaging and redistribution of agricultural produce has also
been encouraged, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the fisheries sector, there are three areas --
capture fishing, aquaculture and fish processing -- which are
extremely promising revenue earners.
</P>
<P>
For forestry development, he said, more than 80 percent of
Brunei's land area is covered by forest, giving rise to forestry
as one of the major economic activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Considering the environmental and social needs, he pointed out,
the government has acted to conserve some 320 square kilometers or
about 5.5 percent of the country's land area as forest reserves
and allocated 500 square kilometers for a national park and a
further 20 square kilometers of the forest-covered land to be
turned into recreational facilities. In addition, 3 percent of the
country's total land area has been designed as protection forests.
But still 38 percent or 2,200 square kilometers of the country's
land area has been set aside as production forests, he said.
</P>
<P>
In manufacturing which is a high-priority development sector
under the IDP, identified to receive immediate attention are food
and beverage, silica and clay products, textiles and apparel,
electrical appliances, electronics and hi-tech industry, building
materials, processing and repackaging activities, metal and
non-metal products, furniture, biotechnology-based industry, and
downstream oil and gas manufacturing activities.
</P>
<P>
For services development, he said, Brunei is actively promoting
and encouraging high value-added activities such as tourism,
consultancies, construction, maintenance, air and sea linkages,
telecommunications, insurance and re-insurance.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Brunei Strives to Diversify Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANDER SERI BEGAWAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Brunei, always
associated with lucrative oil and gas industries, has been making
great efforts to diversify its economy by developing non-oil and
-gas industries and has been reaping the benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Brunei is on the track of diversifying its economy. We are
looking into non-oil sectors now," Metali Bin Haji Damit, head of
the Industry Promotion Unit of the Ministry of Industry and
Primary Resources, told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview
here.
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, Brunei's seventh National Development Plan
(NDP) (1996-2000) is aimed at diversifying the economy, he said,
adding that with a budget allocation of 7.2 billion Brunei dollars
(about 5 billion U.S. dollars), it focuses on the development of
infrastructure and social and human resources as a basis for
industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
And to supplement the NDP, the government endorsed a five-year
Industrial Development Plan (IDP) two years ago, which mainly aims
at promoting growth of the private sector for a wider economic
base and a number of sectors have been identified for fast track
implementation, Metali said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the IDP, which shares 12.6 percent of the total budget
allocation, we are encouraging and promoting four sectors --
primary resources sector which includes agriculture, fisheries and
forestry; manufacturing; services industries, especially tourism;
and human resources development to complement the existing
contributions of oil and gas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brunei is an oil-rich sultanate, located right in the heart of
Southeast Asia, with a land mass of 5,765 square kilometers and a
population of 314,400. In its economy, the oil and gas industries
have long been the dominant sector, accounting for more than 50
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Since the Brunei government's move to promote non-oil and -gas
activities, some promising results have been shown with the
non-oil and -gas sector taking a bigger share in the GDP, Metali
said.
</P>
<P>
The non-oil sector grew at an average rate of 5.7 percent per
annum during the sixth NDP period (1991-1995), with its
contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices
increasing from 46.4 percent in 1990 to 64.1 percent in 1995, and
the non-oil and
-gas sector in 1997 grew further to take up about 64.4 percent of
the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Brunei has enjoyed a steady economic growth in the past few
years with its real GDP growth rate in 1997 standing at 4 percent
against 3.5 percent in 1996 and 3 percent in 1995, according to
the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyzstan is set for a boom period
in the next century as long as it maintains its cooperation with
China, Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
China's prosperity would lead to development and progress in
Kyrgyzstan, said Akayev shortly before attending a meeting of five
leaders from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tadzhikistan, Russia and
China, in Alma-Ata on July 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
He told Chinese correspondents that China had a vital role in
promoting regional peace, stability and security.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to have established personal ties with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. We keep regular contacts and understand
each other," said Akayev.
</P>
<P>
"It is very precious for statesmen. Without mutual trust, it is
difficult to resolve some interstate issues. I think mutual trust
and friendly relations lay a good foundation for expanding
friendship between peoples and economic and trade cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan appreciated the implementation by Chinese leaders of
a policy of good neighborliness, he said .
</P>
<P>
Akayev praised Chinese President Jiang for fully demonstrating
his wisdom with regard to border issues.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that, at Jiang's suggestion, China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan had signed an agreement in
Shanghai on April 26, 1996, on establishing military confidence in
border areas.
</P>
<P>
"This was a historic event, making the longest border in the
world a peaceful and cooperative border, thus setting a good
example for the international community," said Akayev.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visit to Kyrgyzstan two years ago, the two
countries signed historical agreements, removing all political
obstacles to better relations.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation showed great potential, said
Akayev adding that China was Kyrgyzstan's third biggest trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for opening road and air services to
Kyrgyzstan. China and Kyrgyzstan started direct air service
between Bishkek and Beijing on May 16, cutting the flight, which
previously went via Moscow, by half.
</P>
<P>
The building of the Osh-Kashi road link was in full swing and
the second border port between the two countries would be put into
operation in autumn next year, according to Akayev.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Akayev restated there was only one China,
the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan was an inalienable part
of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
He said Kyrgyzstan and Chinese leaders shared the same stance
in opposing separatism. "We backed China's opposition of
separatism in the past and we continue doing so."

It was followed by chemicals with an increase of 25.8 percent,
food 10.7 percent, wearing apparel 34.2 percent, and paper and
paper products 34.8 percent, the survey says.
</P>

</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, the survey says, the VPI moved up by
1.2 percent in March as food registered an increase of 10.6

</P>
<P>
Sectors that posted significant increases were chemicals, 6

The survey also says the volume of production index (VoPI) for
manufacturing of 145.8 during the three-month period represented a
decline of 1.7 percent from last year's.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, the VoPI went up by 3.7 percent in
March largely due to the 10.5-percent increase in food
manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Freeze-Dried Sperm Works to Create New Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the U.S.
University of Hawaii have demonstrated that mouse sperm can be
freeze-dried and then used to create mice by adding water, the
Washington Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hawaii scientists first got the mouse sperm freeze-dried
and stored them at room temperature for three months. Finally
they added water with the sperm and injected then into mouse eggs,
making the eggs fertilized and injected them into surrogate mother
mice. By this way, the surrogate mice gave birth to offsprings.
</P>
<P>
This feat offers graphic evidence for the astonishing
resilience of DNA inside sperm. More practically, it could
simplify long-term storage of semen from laboratory and farm
animals, perhaps even from people.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that he was confident that Hong Kong would be able
to overcome the current economic difficulties resulted from the
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China at the Hong Kong Coliseum, Jiang said: "The
current difficulties will be overcome and there are conditions and
capabilities of doing so. We have full confidence in this."
</P>
<P>
He listed a string of Hong Kong advantages -- a solid economic
foundation with ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, a
sound regime of financial regulation and supervision, and a
contingent of high-caliber civil servants and sophisticated
businessmen with rich experience in management and in adapting to
international market changes.
</P>
<P>
Although the impact of the Asian financial turmoil has not gone
away and Hong Kong's economic difficulties will continue for some
time, he said, "Hong Kong is still one of the universally
recognized most competitive regions."
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the Hong Kong compatriots to build up their
sense of responsibility as masters of the country and their
confidence in overcoming difficulties. The great motherland would
be a strong backing for Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that Hong Kong will bring its advantages into
full play, overcome the temporary difficulties and achieve even
greater development," the Chinese leader said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand celebration meeting
marking the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and
the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) was held at Hong Kong Coliseum here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin attended the meeting and
delivered an address.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central
Military commission, said that the development in the year since
Hong Kong's return to the motherland has fully demonstrated that
adherence to the policies of "one country, two systems", "Hong
Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy
and strict compliance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR constitute
the fundamental guarantee for long-term prosperity and stability
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Practice will continue to prove that the policy of 'one
country, two systems' will help to not only safeguard the
interests of people of different social strata in Hong Kong, but
also maintain Hong Kong's status as the international financial,
trading and shipping center," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We note with pleasure that the HKSAR Government headed by Mr.
Tung Chee Hwa has administered Hong Kong capably and effectively
over the past year in vigorously resolving issues relating to the
welfare and well-being of Hong Kong residents that are of
universal concern in Hong Kong, handling its internal and external
affairs steadily and surely and taking up challenges calmly, in
particular, in fending off the impact of the Asian financial
turmoil," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the meeting, which was attended by thousands of
people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, that the situation in
China's inland areas is "good". "Despite the Asian financial turmoil,
we enjoy social and political stability and sustained economic
growth," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), said at the meeting that the "one
country, two systems " concept worked out remarkably well in the
past year. Most important of all, the successful implementation of
the "one country, two systems" concept manifests that the people
of Hong Kong have truly become masters of their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Their addresses were followed by a song and dance performance
by artists from both Hong Kong and the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the celebration gathering were Chinese
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, Member of the Secretariat of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China Zeng Qinghong, Chief of

<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the Central Government would be a strong
backing for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in
its effort to overcome the current economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a ceremony held at the Hong Kong Coliseum to mark
the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Jiang told
Hong Kong compatriots: "The Central Government will continue to
vigorously support the SAR Government in its measures to maintain
financial and economic stability."
</P>
<P>
When the regional financial storm hit Hong Kong last year, the
Central Government went all out to back the HKSAR Government in
its counter-measures, particularly in its effort to maintain the
linked exchange rate system and the overall stability in Hong
Kong, said Jiang who is also General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed: "This was a forceful demonstration that the
great motherland is the strong backing for Hong Kong."

mainland can provide Hong Kong's economy with a strong support,"
the Chinese leader said, adding that despite the Asian financial

with the rest of the international community.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Praises HK's Achievements Since Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the central government is satisfied with the
"remarkable achievements" of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) since Hong Kong's return to China a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Facts are a convincing testimony to the sound assertion made
by Mr. Deng Xiaoping that 'Hong Kong people can administer Hong
Kong well'," Jiang said at a ceremony marking the first
anniversary of Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, noted that the HKSAR government headed by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa has administered Hong Kong capably and
effectively over the past year "in vigorously resolving issues
relating to the welfare and well-being of Hong Kong residents that
are of universal concern in Hong Kong, handling its internal and
external affairs steadily and surely and taking up challenges
calmly, in particular, in fending off the impact of the Asian
financial turbulence."
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the SAR government, the executive,
legislative and judicial bodies in Hong Kong have been functioning
smoothly with a stable civil servants team, Jiang commented.
</P>
<P>
"The elections for the first Legislative Council went along
smoothly not long ago, which is an important step forward in the
democratic process in Hong Kong," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"All this testified to the wisdom and the capacity of the SAR
Government in administering the Hong Kong society and managing
complex situations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Hong Kong compatriots for carrying out the
glorious tradition of loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong
and for supporting the policy of "one country, two systems" and
the Basic Law. Also he praised Hong Kong compatriots for making
new contributions to safeguarding democracy and the rule of law
and promoting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that everybody in Hong Kong has been subjected to
the test of the changing times resulting from the "historic
turning" of the handover.
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing strange for some people to find themselves
unaccustomed to the changes, owing to the views and concepts that
they had formed over a long period of time," Jiang said. "They
will finally get accustomed to the changes if they have a deep
love for the motherland and for Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that "some evil elements have
recently perpetrated outrageous acts in Hong Kong and Macao,
causing severe damage to the people's interests and investors'
confidence."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he is "confident that the HKSAR government and
the Macao authorities have the capability of cracking down on such
criminal activities according to law and effectively protect the
personal safety of the general public and the business people as
well as the safety of their property."
</P>
<P>
"We, on our part, will also render strong support and close
coordination. We will never sit idle when these evil forces run
rampant," he added.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's labor groups Tuesday
asked the government to urgently establish a special welfare fund
for the rehabilitation of the unemployed in order to prevent
possible social unrest, the newspaper The Nation reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The groups, led by Labor Congress of Thailand President
Pratuang Saengsang, proposed that the money for the fund come from
the government's 21.6 billion baht (526 million U.S. dollars)
Social Investment Fund or from other sources without employees,
employers and the government having to contribute to the fund.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Labor and Social Welfare Secretary Phan Chantharapan
was quoted as saying there is a possibility of establishing a
special fund for the unemployed as demanded by the labor groups
since his ministry has about 2 billion baht (48 million dollars)
in loans to solve workers' problems.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million workers in Thailand have lost their jobs
since the economic crisis started last year, according to the Thai
government.

HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
the speech made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is also
general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China and chairman of the Central Military Commission, at a
ceremony here Wednesday to mark the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to the motherland:
</P>
<P>
It is my great pleasure to come here and attend the ceremony in
celebration of the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland. I have brought with me warm congratulations and best
wishes of the Central Government and people of all ethnic groups
in our country to the Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, our compatriots and people from all walks
of life in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On this very day a year ago, I solemnly announced here the
resumption by the Chinese Government of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the official establishment of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic
of China. This was a major event that is forever worth
commemorating in the history of the development of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
The developments in the year since Hong Kong's return have
fully demonstrated that adherence to the policies of "one country,
two systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a
high degree of autonomy and strict compliance with the Basic Law
of the HKSAR constitute the fundamental guarantee for long-term
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. Practice will continue to
prove that the policy of "one country, two systems" will not only
help safeguard the interests of people of different social strata
in Hong Kong, but also maintain Hong Kong's status as the
international financial, trading and shipping center. There is
every reason to believe that as long as this correct policy is
consistently followed, Hong Kong will be able to create a better
future with the support of the mainland. There is also every
reason to believe that the successful implementation of the policy
of "one country, two systems" will serve as an example for Macao's
smooth return to the motherland and for the final settlement of
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
We note with pleasure that the HKSAR Government headed by Mr.
Tung Chee Hwa has administered Hong Kong capably and effectively
over the past year in vigorously resolving issues relating to the
welfare and well-being of Hong Kong residents that are of

<P>
Owing to the Asian financial turbulence, Hong Kong is currently
faced with difficulties. In the times of difficulty, it is all the
more important for Hong Kong compatriots to build up their sense
of responsibility as masters of the country and their confidence
in overcoming difficulties. Officials at all levels of the SAR
Government and Hong Kong compatriots of different social strata or
in different occupations will be able to do a good job in managing
Hong Kong affairs so long as they rally closely together, pool the
wisdom and efforts of everyone and unswervingly support the work
of the Chief Executive and the SAR Government.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return marks a major turning point in Hong Kong's
history, and everybody in Hong Kong has been subjected to the test
of the changing times resulting from this historic turning. It is
nothing strange for some people to find themselves unaccustomed to
the changes, owing to the views and concepts that they had formed
over a long period of time. But they will finally get accustomed
to the changes if they have a deep love for the motherland and for
Hong Kong, value their status as masters of the country and
cherish their dignity of being Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Some evil elements have recently perpetrated outrageous acts in
Hong Kong and Macao causing severe damage to the people's
interests and investors' confidence. I am confident that the Hong
Kong SAR Government and the Macao authorities have the capability
of cracking down on such criminal activities according to law and
effectively protect the personal safety of the general public and
the business people as well as the safety of their property. We,
on our part, will also render strong support and close
coordination. We will never sit idle when these evil forces run
rampant.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the situation in the mainland is good. Despite the
Asian financial turmoil, we enjoy social and political stability
and sustained economic growth. People of all ethnic groups
throughout China, holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, are determined to materialize the spirit of the Fifteenth
National Party Congress and comprehensively advance the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st
century. The Party Central Committee and the State Council are
introducing a series of measures to intensify state-owned
enterprise reforms, streamline government institutions, rectify
the financial order, readjust the economic structure, expand
investment in infrastructure, further tap the domestic market,
increase export by all means and continue to maintain a stable
RMB. We are confident of obtaining this year's economic
development objectives through hard work. China enjoys a surplus
in its international balance of payment and will not devalue its
currency.

<P>
Hong Kong's destiny has always been closely linked to that of
the motherland. The reform, opening-up and modernization programs
of the mainland have created unprecedented opportunities for and
injected vigor and vitality into Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
When the Asian financial turmoil hit Hong Kong, the Central
Government went all out in supporting the HKSAR Government in its
counter-measures, particularly in its effort to maintain the
currency peg and the overall stability in Hong Kong. This was a
forceful demonstration that the great motherland is the strong
backing for Hong Kong. The correct policies we have adopted with
regard to the Asian financial turmoil showed the world once again
that China is a major stabilizing force for regional and global
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Asian financial turmoil has not gone away yet
and Hong Kong's economic difficulties will continue for some time.
Moreover, it is always better to anticipate greater problems and
take early action to address them. The current difficulties will
be overcome and there are conditions and capabilities of doing so.
We have full confidence in this. Hong Kong enjoys a solid economic
foundation with ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves as well
as a sound regime of financial regulation and supervision. Hong
Kong has a contingent of high-caliber civil servants and
sophisticated businessmen with rich experience in management and
in adapting to international market changes. Hong Kong is still
one of the universally-recognized most competitive regions. The
economic strength and sound development momentum of the mainland
can provide Hong Kong's economy with a strong support. The Central
Government will continue to vigorously support the SAR Government
in its measures to maintain financial and economic stability, the
Hong Kong business community in making investment in the mainland
and Hong Kong in its efforts to develop the tourist industry, high
and new technology industries, infrastructure, entrepot trade and
economic and technical exchanges and cooperation with the rest of
the international community. We are convinced that Hong Kong will
bring its advantages into full play, overcome the temporary
difficulties and achieve even greater development.
</P>
<P>
I sincerely hope that under the leadership of the HKSAR
Government headed by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa, Hong Kong civil servants,
entrepreneurs and other Hong Kong compatriots will unite as one
and, in the face of difficulties, make joint efforts to maintain
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. With the successful
advancement of the socialist modernization cause of the
motherland, Hong Kong, China's pearl in the lap of the South China
Sea, will shine even brighter.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Philippine Government Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Estrada has assumed office as
the president of the Philippines and analysts here said the
severest test facing his administration is to revive the economy,
which has been plagued by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Estrada does not see this as a good time for him to assume the
presidency as the country's economy has been badly battered by the
crisis. But he expressed confidence that with the help of the
business community and his countrymen as a whole, he would be able
to lead the country out of the current economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
One year after the financial crisis started, its full impacts
have become apparent in the Philippines. Data released by the
National Statistics Office show that in the first quarter, growth
of the gross national product (GNP) slowed down to 2.5 percent
while that of the gross domestic product (GDP) slid to 1.7
percent, 2.9 and 3.4 percentage points lower when compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
GDP, a measure of economic output, covers both goods and
services produced in a country while GNP includes GDP and incomes
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the agricultural and industrial sectors
has been blamed as the main reason for the economic slump as both
sectors bore the brunt of peso depreciation, runaway interest
rates, tight credit and severe drought caused by El Nino. During
the period, the agricultural sector contracted by 3.6 percent
while industry grew by a mere 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investments and exports, two engines for the economy, have also
slowed down. In the first three months, investments dropped by 7.4
percent, a sharp reversal from the 14.9-percent expansion in the
same period last year. Exports went up by 11.6 percent, lower than
the 22.3 percent recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation and jobless rates have also surged to a
high that the country had not seen for years. In April, inflation
rose to 10.3 percent due to soaring prices while the unemployment
rate jumped to 13.3 percent with 4.3 million people left without
job.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, the country's fiscal picture was also
not as good as expected. Its gross international reserve increased
to 11 billion U.S. dollars and the balance of payments showed a
surplus of 2 billion dollars, but the budget deficit and foreign
debts rose as well, to 15.4 billion pesos (370 million dollars)
and 51 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The first-quarter situation does not give us too much room for
optimism," said Shiladitya Chatterjee, a senior economist at the
Asian Development Bank (ADB). He said the Philippines' economic
slump will probably be "more painful" than forecasts made earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine economy is dependent on imports, but in the past
10 months, imports have been declining. Although this helped
reduce the huge trade deficit and current account deficit, it also
hindered the growth of exports, ADB said in an annual report.
</P>
<P>
The bank added that another factor likely to weigh on the
economy is a shortfall of credit and higher interest rates as
banks are facing rising bad loans. As of March, the banking
system's non-performing loans had risen to 8.3 percent of the
total loan portfolio and four small banks had been closed.
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee's forecast was confirmed by the reduction of fleet
size by Philippine Airlines. The company, due to the Asian crisis
and a strike by 620 pilots, tail-spun into the gravest financial
crisis in its history. It was forced to terminate leases on 27
planes ahead of time, sell off 13 aircraft and lay off 5,000
employees. Economists believe that Philippines Airlines is just
the epitome of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the poor first-quarter figures, the government
cut its GNP target for 1998 from 3-4 percent to 2.5 percent,
revising its budget spending from a surplus of 5 billion pesos
(125 million dollars) to a planned deficit of 36.4 billion pesos
(9.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The target for GDP remains unchanged, but economists believe
that even the 2.4-3.5 percent growth rate is hard to achieve and
they predict a maximum GDP growth rate of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind that hard times are still ahead, Estrada began
working for the economy after winning the presidential election on
May 11. He held talks with the business sector and won the support
of those who accused him of knowing nothing about economics.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also vowed to continue the economic reforms and
policies of the previous administration, calling on foreign
businessmen to invest more in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new government said it targets an average of 5 percent
growth rate in GDP for the next five years. To achieve this
target, it would give top priority to the development of
agriculture and aim for at least a 3-percent growth in the sector
every year.
</P>
<P>
However, although it may suffer further economic slump, the
Philippines is still in a better position than other economies hit
by the financial crisis. Economists predict that Indonesia, Korea,
Thailand and Malaysia would register negative economic growth this
year.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic to Cut Down Military Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic will reduce the
size of its armed forces from 78,000 at present to 60,000 in the
year 2003, as a major step to ease military budget demand.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Michal Lobkowicz told reporters Monday evening
that the reduction would mainly effect office staffs and
commissioned officers.
</P>
<P>
Officers account for 67 percent of the country's total armed
forces, as against an average 26 percent in NATO countries,
Lobkowicz added.
</P>
<P>
The funds saved from the reduction would be mainly used to
upgrade military equipment and improve training facilities, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the Czech military in 1997 was only 790 million
Korunas (23.9 million U.S. dollars), representing 1.66 percent of
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The percentage was remarkably lower than Poland's 2.28 percent
and Slovakia's 2.18 percent in the same year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Raises Minimum Wages by 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Tuesday
announced it will increase minimum wages by an average of 15
percent to arrest the decline in real wages caused by soaring
inflation, according to local press reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pay rise will be effective as of August 1 this year for all
companies in all Indonesia's provinces, Manpower Ministry
spokesman Syaufie Syamsuddin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the government will let companies which are
undergoing financial difficulties as a result of the prolonged
monetary crisis delay paying the increased wages to their workers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 15-percent increase, this year's new wage will only
amount to 76 percent of the workers' minimum living cost which has
been calculated at 205,000 rupiah (about 20 U.S. dollars) per
month.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government traditionally increases minimum wages
on April 1. This year, the raise was frozen by the then government
of President Soeharto because of the economic crisis, a decision
widely criticized by trade unions.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Soeharto on May 21, has
made the provision of social safety net programs his chief
priority to help the poor cope with the harsh economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The government said inflation was running at 56.7 percent in
the first six months of this year. It has predicted that inflation
will reach 80 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Syaufie said the increase was the result of negotiations
involving representatives of the government, employers and
workers, with the final proposals coming from all the provincial
governors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Nazi Gold to Fund Holocaust Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that most of the remaining gold looted by the Nazis during World
War II has now been returned and that about three quarters of it
will be donated to Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following a conference on Holocaust-era
assets here, U.S. Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said
that all claimant countries except Albania and the former Yugoslav
states had now received their shares of the gold.
</P>
<P>
He said three quarters of the gold, whose total value was put
at 41 million U.S. dollars at current rates, had been contributed
by recipient countries to the Holocaust fund.
</P>
<P>
Austria, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands have donated all of
their share to the fund, said the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the six tons of gold, last of 337 tons collected by
Second World War allies, had been left unresolved by a London
conference last December. All the rest had been progressively
handed back to the banks since 1946.
</P>
<P>
"This is, I think, a just close-out of a 50-year effort,"
Eizenstat said. "No further claims can be made once this final
receipt is done."
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat, who chaired the U.S. State Department conference on
Holocaust-era assets, said overall pledges to the fund from
various countries totalled 57.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 39 countries participating in the conference also
launched a campaign to identify some 220,000 pieces of art looted
by Nazis from Holocaust victims during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat told the meeting that the search also will deal with
unpaid life and property insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "the debate over Nazi-confiscated art
often intrudes on questions of sovereignty and the sacred ground
of national heritage."
</P>
<P>
In early June, the Association of Art Museum Directors
recommended that American art museums check their collections to
determine if any works were stolen during the war and to set up a
worldwide database for tracking.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Modern Art in New York recently stopped
prosecutors from seizing two Egon Schiele paintings on loan from
the Leopold Foundation of Vienna. Two families claim the works
were plundered during the Nazi era from relatives.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Dutch government widened its own investigation into
the ownership of thousands of artworks recovered from Nazis but
never claimed.
</P>
<P>
The 4,000 items ranged from paintings to ceramic objects and
included works by Dutch masters Rembrandt and Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Nazis also looted insurance policies,
collecting from companies on deaths and property losses. The
amount potentially at stake is incalculable.
</P>
<P>
The German insurance company Allianz is in the midst of a
research program under the direction of Gerald Feldman, a
professor of modern German history at the University of California
at Berkeley, according to press releases from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A conference will be held in Washington in November to assess
progress on the art and insurance fronts.

<HEADLINE> Tung: "One Country, Two Systems" Works Out Very Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong leader said here
Wednesday that the principle of "one country, two systems" has
been successfully implemented in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) since the return of Hong Kong one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the SAR,
announced: "The 'one country, two systems' concept worked out
remarkably well in the past year."
</P>
<P>
"Most important of all, the successful implementation of the
'one country, two systems' manifests that the people of Hong Kong
have truly become masters of their own destiny," Tung said at the
celebration gathering at the Hong Kong Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong leader noted that neither the central government
nor any mainland authorities have interfered with the internal
affairs of Hong Kong. On the contrary, the central government has
repeated its pledge to maintain the prosperity and stability of
Hong Kong at all costs when the Asian financial crisis dealt a
severe blow to Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Such an undertaking is a great encouragement to all the people
of Hong Kong," said Tung, who vowed that the SAR government would
live up to people's expectations and make vigorous efforts to help
them ride out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government announced bold initiatives in the SAR first
financial budget early this year and recently unveiled a stimulus
package to revive the economy, relieve the people's suffering and
restore confidence in the market.
</P>
<P>
Tung believed that Hong Kong would also benefit a great deal
from the rapid development and prosperity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people of Hong Kong to summon unprecedented
courage to overcome the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stand still, nor should we go backwards," the
chief executive said. "The conviction that we made in the glorious
days, i.e. 'the people of Hong Kong can definitely govern Hong
Kong well', will never be shaken by the changes of circumstances."

<HEADLINE> Jiang: "One Country, Two Systems" Safeguards Hong Kong Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that practice will continue to prove that the
policy of "one country, two systems" will help not only
safeguard the interests of people of different social strata in
Hong Kong, but also maintain Hong Kong's status as the
international financial, trading and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Tuesday from Beijing for the occasion,
made the remarks at a ceremony marking the first anniversary of
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The developments since Hong Kong's return to China a year ago
have fully demonstrated that adherence to the policies of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"
and a high degree of autonomy and strict compliance with the Basic
Law of the HKSAR constitute the fundamental guarantee for
long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, said Jiang, who
is also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who declared the resuming by the Chinese government of
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the establishment
of the HKSAR on July 1, 1997, said the handover was "a major event
that is forever worth commemorating in the history of the
development of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the policy of "one country, two
systems" is consistently followed, Hong Kong will be able to
create a better future with the support of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also pointed out that the successful implementation of
the policy of "one country, two systems" will serve as an example
for Macao's smooth return to the motherland and for the final
settlement of the Taiwan issue.

dollars, an increase of 203 percent over the same period of last
year, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Sugito Suwito, head of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS),
said here Tuesday that the country enjoyed the trade surplus due
to sharply declining imports during that period which reached 36.1
percent or 5.133 billion dollars compared with that of the
corresponding period of last year when the figure stood at 14.217
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in imports was caused by trade sluggishness
experienced by the country's business world," official Antara News
Agency Wednesday quoted Sugito as saying.
</P>
<P>
The value of the country's exports from January to April
reached a total of 16.27 billion dollars, a decline of 1.9 percent
compared with the same period in 1997 when the figure was 16.585
billion U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the total exports, the oil and gas sector contributed 2.785
billion dollars (about 17.12 percent), while the rest were non-oil
and gas commodities which totaled 13.485 billion dollars (about
82.88 percent).
</P>
<P>
The record 80-percent decline of the rupiah (national currency)
since July last year caused massive cutbacks in imports, he said,
adding that rising import costs had hit Indonesia's
export-oriented industries which have had to pay more for raw
materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian customs officers and
police detectives have arrested a Myanmar man at the Jakarta
airport for allegedly smuggling 3.4 kilograms of high-grade heroin
into the country, the local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old man was handcuffed upon arrival at the
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Monday night from Bangkok on
Thai Airways, the report quoted National Police Detective Corps
commander Brig. Gen. Da's Bachtiar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drug, which has an estimated street value here of 4 billion
rupiah (about 276,000 U.S. dollars) was wrapped in plastic bags
and allegedly strapped under the man's bag.
</P>
<P>
During police questioning, the man reportedly admitted that he
was hired as a courier to smuggle the drug to Jakarta. He was to
hand it over to the owner, a Nigerian staying here, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a prosecutor asked Central Jakarta District Court
Monday to sentence a 35-year-old Myanmar man to death for
smuggling 4.4 kilograms of heroin into Indonesia from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The man was arrested on November 14 last year at Tanah Abang

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Exports Drops by 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran exports amounted to about
1.48 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months this year, 240
million dollars less than the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications attributed the 14 percent drop
to the affects of the El Nino weather phenomenon and the fall in
world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
But exports of traditional products like shrimp and coffee went
up by 5.08 and 0.46 percent respectively in the same period.
</P>
<P>
To promote exports, the Ecuadoran government has held a series
of negotiations with the European Union (EU) to extend the
preferential tariff generalized system for another four years.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador also negotiated with the EU on the enforcement of the
World Trade Organization's free banana transactions in the
European market and on signing trade and economic agreements,
which will help Ecuador overcome economic difficulties.

MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Suspected members of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) Tuesday fired several mortar
rounds near the Sulu provincial capital of Jolo city, the Southern
Philippines, killing five people and wounding more than 40 others.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times newspaper Wednesday reported that the
attackers were followers of a defeated gubernatorial candidate and
they made the attack to stop the oath-taking ceremony of the
newly-elected governor, Abdusakur Tan.
</P>
<P>
"The attack was purposely done in order to disrupt the
scheduled inauguration ceremony of the winning gubernatorial
candidate," a military spokesman was quoted by the paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Several marine camps in Sulu Province also came under heavy
mortar fire from supporters of MNLF Commander Yusup Jikiri, who
ran for Sulu governor but lost to Tan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said five people were killed and more than 40 others were
wounded during the attack.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a peace accord with the government two years
ago to end a 30-year-old civil war in the Southern Philippines.
But some of its members have not been integrated into the

<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian police arrested 42 suspected
mafiosi in an early morning raid against the Corleone criminal
gang in Palermo, Sicily on Tuesday, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dawn operation resulted in the arrest of 42
"fully active" bosses and their henchmen on charges ranging from
homicide to drug trafficking and extortion.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the 42 arrested were suspected of
association with the Corleone clan, run by superboss Salvatore
Toto Riina, who was imprisoned in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The operation on Tuesday morning was the second such swoop
since last Friday, when more than 80 suspected mafiosi were
arrested in two raids conducted in Palermo and in the central
Sicilian city of Catania.
</P>
<P>
The Corleone clan is believed to be run by Bernardo Provenzano,
a man in his 70s, who has been hunted for by the police for 30
years. He is now considered public enemy number one.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's tourism industry will
launch a promotion campaign dubbed "Let's Go Indonesia" that will
include allowing every foreign tourist in the country to stay one
day free of the usual charges, an industry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The program will be carried out in July to fit in with the
vacation period in foreign countries, chairman of an Indonesian
tourism operators' association, Sri Mulyono Herlambang, said here
Tuesday, Antara News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners visiting Indonesia will be given a day when they can
enjoy free hotel accommodation, meals and transportation to places
of tourist interest.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Tourism Promotion Board (BPPI) said recently
that the country might lose around 30,000 foreign tourists during
the June-August period this year due to recent social unrest.
</P>
<P>
For this very reason, Sri Mulyono said, the government should
revive tourism activities.
</P>
<P>
Sri Mulyono said that only 20 percent of the country's
approximately 4,200 travel bureaus are currently still operating
amidst the protracted economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the still existing travel agencies do not sell tourism
packages anymore but tickets," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, US Begin Cornerstone '98 Joint Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and the United States
Tuesday launched their Cornerstone '98 joint humanitarian exercise
in Trun, in the northwest of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
An engineering unit of the American Army National Guard of
Tennessee and the training engineering unit No. 55 of the
Bulgarian Army are taking part in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is a step towards Bulgaria's integration into the
North Atlantic structures, said Lieutenant General Nikola Kolev,
Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army.
</P>
<P>
Since the exercise is only concerned with the repair of a local
hospital no arms will be used in the joint military campaign, the
general said.
</P>
<P>
"We are working together for friendship between our two
countries," said Colonel William Maccoy, representative of the U.S.
Army.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. servicemen will rotate in three groups of 60 at
intervals of 15 days. A contingent of 27 sergeants and officers
will stay in Trun permanently.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian contingent consists of 62 engineering troops, 26
officers and sergeants stationed permanently and a unit of 130
servicemen providing logistic support.
</P>
<P>
The three Bulgarian platoons which took part in the
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia will also participate in
Cornerstone '98, said Major General Tencho Dobrev, coordinator of
the exercise.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the only project Bulgaria is working on jointly
with the United States," Lieutenant General Nikola Kolev said.
"The country is involved in 30 exercises under the Partnership for
Peace program."

<HEADLINE> 39 Nations Vow to Search for Nazis-Looted Art Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States and 38 other
nations launched a campaign on Tuesday to identify some 220,000
pieces of art looted by Nazis from Holocaust victims during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 220,000 pieces of art, about one-quarter in
Europe, were taken from Jews at the start of World War II, said
U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat, who chaired a day-long conference at the Holocaust
Museum, told the meeting that the search also will deal with
unpaid life and property insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat acknowledged that "the debate over Nazi-confiscated
art often intrudes on questions of sovereignty and the sacred
ground of national heritage."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "We also have a great responsibility to Holocaust
survivors and their heirs" to shed light on these issues.
</P>
<P>
In early June, the Association of Art Museum Directors
recommended that American art museums check their collections to
determine if any works were stolen during the war and to set up a
worldwide database for tracking.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Modern Art in New York recently stopped
prosecutors from seizing two Egon Schiele paintings on loan from
the Leopold Foundation of Vienna. Two families claimed the works
were plundered during the Nazi era from their relatives.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Dutch government widened its own investigation into
the ownership of thousands of artworks recovered from Nazis but
never claimed. The 4,000 items ranged from paintings to ceramic
objects and included works by Dutch masters Rembrandt and Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Nazis also looted insurance policies,
collecting from companies on deaths and property losses. The
amount potentially at stake is incalculable.
</P>
<P>
The German insurance company Allianz is in the midst of a
research program under the direction of Gerald Feldman, a
professor of modern German history at the University of California
at Berkeley, according to press releases from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Research is also under way at the Generali insurance company in
Trieste, Italy. The city was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire
before the war and many Jews who lived in that area placed their
insurance with Generali.
</P>
<P>
A conference will be held in Washington in November to assess
progress on the art and insurance fronts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Joint Ventures Provide Jobs For Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A 35-year-old man who was unemployed
until just two days ago is now head of a security team of a joint
venture hotel in a Chinese port city.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hua was one of 13 lucky workers who had lost their jobs at
a state enterprise but were recently hired by the hotel in Beihai,
in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shihai, the hotel's general manager, says that they put
ads in local newspapers about openings for unemployed workers
below the age of 35, and 13 applicants passed the exam, and things
have worked out well so far.
</P>
<P>
"We welcomed the state enterprise workers because we believe
they are well-trained and disciplined," Wang says, and explains
that Chen was offered the position of head of the security team
because he had military experience and is a member of the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the 1,200 enterprises with overseas
investment in the city have already become a major source of jobs
for laid-off workers. The Beihai Tainan Biscuit Co., which is
owned by a Taiwanese businessman, now employs over 200 people, 90
percent of whom were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Liao Wei, Tainan's general manager, says that he himself was
one of the laid-off workers, but, in 1995, got work with Tainan,
and worked his way up to the present post.

GUILIN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, in south China's Guangxi

foreign trade and economic cooperation bureau. Guilin has 450,000
international tourists a year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China and Southeast Asia Cooperate in Eliminating Drug Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province,
which is on the border of the "Golden Triangle", has cooperated
with Myanmar and Laos in an anti-drug project, bringing some hope
for the peaceful elimination of drug sources in the Golden
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began six years ago, has given help to
farmers in Myanmar's Special Region 1 and Special Region 4, and in
three provinces of Laos in raising cash crops, greatly reducing
their dependence on the poppy economy.
</P>
<P>
A Yunnan official says that the Chinese have provided seeds,
techniques, and fertilizers for the farmers and have promised to
purchase their agricultural products at Chinese prices.
</P>
<P>
Police in Yunnan, which has suffered tremendously from the drug
trade, worked on 6,852 drug cases last year, and confiscated 4,073
kg of heroin and "ice", and 1,132 kg of opium, or about 70 percent
of the drugs seized in China.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has continued to come down hard on drug manufacturers,
traffickers, and drug addicts, but still hopes that its "green
anti-drug project" will fundmentally solve the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
For more than a hundred years, farmers in the Golden Triangle
have relied on the poppy economy and opium sales, and, in spite of
the fertile soil, many still live in extreme poverty as the
profits have gone to drug lords.
</P>
<P>
By planting cash crops and cereals, however, farmers have had
sufficient food and a stable income, and many have been encouraged
to stop growing opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, deputy secretary-general and executive director
of the United Nations' Drug Control Program, said in his May visit
to Yunnan that China has successfully helped its neighbours to
replace opium planting and that this achievement has even
surpassed his expectations.
</P>
<P>
Li Hanbo, Yunnan's vice-governor, says that replacing poppies
is an important link in the international anti-drug strategy
because it helps maintain living standards and economic
development in drug-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the international community should provide
funds and techniques for the project, he says.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar's Special Region 4, specialists from Yunnan are
helping the local government build power stations and reservoirs
to further improve agricultural output and facilitate the planting
of certain cash crops.

Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
With a population of more than 150 million and an annual per
capita income of 200 dollars, Uttar Pradesh is the most populous
and one of the poorest states in India. Four out of five people in
the state live in the rural areas and about three-quarters of the
state's population depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
This project supports the diversification and intensification
of agriculture by introducing new crops and better farming and
animal husbandry practices. The project will also expand farmers'
access to credit and will finance critically-needed investments in
rural roads and markets.

<HEADLINE> China: Settlement of Jerusalem Should Be Based on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The settlement of the
question of Jerusalem should be carried out through peaceful
negotiations according to the relevant Security Council
resolutions, Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, stressed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin made the remarks at the Security Council's open
debate on the Israeli decision to expand the municipal boundaries
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the Israeli governemnt's recent decisions had raised
concern among the international community because they had
occurred at a time when all sides concerned were trying to revive
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qin said changing the status quo in Jerusalem ran counter to
the peace process and would lead to further complications.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the principle of land for peace and the
effective implementation of all agreements reached between Israel
and Arab countries should guide those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Middle East peace process had come to a sensitive
and crucial moment, and the parties concerned should strictly
abide by the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Oslo
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Qin called on all parties to cease all actions that might lead
to the deterioration of the situation in order to allow the peace
process to come out of its deadlock as soon as possible, with a
view to reaching a lasting and just settlement to the situation in
the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Rescind Israeli Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Tuesday urged the U.N. Security Council to
guarantee the rescinding of the Israeli plan aimed at putting
Jewish settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people could not give up Jerusalem," PLO U.N.
Observer Nasser al-Kidwa told a council debate on the question.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan, approved by Israel's cabinet on June 21, will
expand the municipal boundaries of the city and establish an
"umbrella city" to include a number of illegal settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"That represents a concrete step towards the illegal annexation
of more occupied Palestinian lands to the already illegally
expanded Jerusalem municipality, and towards maintaining a
specific demographic composition with the aim of further
`Judaization' of the city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years, Israel has undertaken a number of illegal
and immoral policies and measures to annex occupied territories,
confiscate lands and expand municipal boundaries and to isolate
East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, Kidwa said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli measures are creating a situation that "might lead
to the explosion of the whole region at any moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kidwa said Palestine hopes that the Security Council will have
the will to finally undertake the necessary measures to guarantee
the rescinding of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor at the debate, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
Bill Richardson said the U.S. regrets the Israeli announcement.
"That decision is unhelpful at the current stage of negotiations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"All parties should refrain from any unilateral action which
could prejudge the outcome of the permanent status negotiations,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian representative Sergey V. Lavrov said Russia shares the
negative reaction of the international community to the Israeli
plan. "Those Israeli actions further complicate the Middle East
peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the European Union, British
representative John Weston said the Union is deeply concerned by
the Israeli plan as it will alter the demographic balance in the
city area.
</P>
<P>
By initiating, encouraging and endorsing settlement activity in
the occupied territories, the Israeli government is in violation
of the Geneva Convention which applies de facto and de jure to
those territories, he noted.
</P>
<P>
French representative Alan Dejammet said all legislative and
administrative measures taken by Israel that changed the character
and status of Jerusalem are null and void and should be revoked
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers, numbering close to 40, were actually all
critical of the Israeli plan.

<HEADLINE> Multiple Births Jump With Fertility Drugs in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fertility drugs boosted a
record multiple births of 6,000 babies in 1996 in the United
States, a 19 percent increase over the previous year, the
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The multiple birth rate has doubled since 1990, quadrupled
since 1980 and is five times higher than it was in 1971, said the
National Center for Health Statistics in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were 100,750 babies born as twins, 5,298 as
triplets, 560 as quadruplets and 81 as quintuplets or other
higher-order multiple births, the report said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of women undergoing fertility therapy have
multiple births in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warned that although fertility drugs help
thousands of parents to get pregnant, babies from multiple births
are much more likely to be born premature and underweight and
often leads to vision and hearing impairments, mental retardation,
developmental delays and even death.
</P>
<P>
The report said just 6 percent of single births result in low
birthweight babies, but for twins, it's 53 percent; for triplets,
93 percent. Just 8 percent of single births are premature versus
53 percent for twins and 92 percent for triplets.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 3 percent of babies died in the first month overall,
but for multiple births, it was 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that the number of women smoking while
pregnant dropped, from 20 percent in 1989 to 13.6 percent. But the
number of pregnant teenagers who smoke increased.
</P>
<P>
About 1.2 million children were born to unmarried mothers, or
about one-third of all births. But there was a 1 percent drop in
all out-of-wedlock births.
</P>
<P>
Births to unmarried black women have dropped 18 percent since
1989. A total of 7.4 percent of unmarried black women of
childbearing age gave birth in 1996, the lowest level since the
government began keeping statistics in 1969. The rate for Hispanic
women was 9.3 percent, and for white women, 2.8 percent.

WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved here
Tuesday two loans totaling 720 million U.S. dollars equivalent for
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The first loan of 700 million dollars is provided for the

reform and strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework
for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
The other loan of 20 million dollars is offered for Mexico's

<HEADLINE> Keeper Roa Becomes Hero as Argentina Beat England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, France, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Keeper Carlos Roa became
the hero for Argentina as the South Americans beat 10-man England 4-3
in the penalty shootout after two sides tied 2-2 after the extra time
in a World Cup second-round game here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina reached the last eight and will face the Netherlands in
the quarterfinals in Marseille on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Roa made the decisive diving save against England's fifth shoter
David Batty after the sides were deadlocked 3-3 even from the spot.
</P>
<P>
An earlier shot from Argentina's Hernan Crespo was saved by keeper
David Seaman but England's Paul Ince also did not convert his.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Batistuta put Argentina ahead only five minutes into this
grippling and heatly-contested game by converting a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
Seaman dived in the right direction, touched the ball but the blast
was so powerful that the ball slipped off his hands into the net.
</P>
<P>
Referee Milton Nielsen of Denmark awarded the penalty after Seaman
brought down midfielder Diego Simeone in the area.
</P>
<P>
England equalized four minutes later also on a penalty kick, which
was kicked by Alan Shearer after Nielsen judged that defender Roberto
Ayala made a foul against striker Michael Owen.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool striker Owen found the net in the 16th minute, shotting
the ball home off the far post after beating two Argentine defenders.
</P>
<P>
But Argentine forced a 2-2 tie in the injury time through Javier
Zanetti who scored with his left foot in small angle after a free
kick.
</P>
<P>
The English attacks even did not dwindle much at first after
midfielder David Beckham was sent off only one minute into the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Shearer almost netted in the 52nd minute but his booming free kick
was lifted over the crossbar by keeper Carlos Roa.
</P>
<P>
England's Sol Campbell netted in the 81st minute but the goal was
disallowed.
</P>
<P>
Ayala squandered two Argentine chances twice in the first 15
minutes of the extra time by heading the ball twice over the bar but
the 10-man England successfully hold out to the penalty shootout.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Participation of Kosovo Rebels in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States is seeking
pledges from the Albanian separatists in Kosovo to halt their
attacks on Serb civilians and to talk with Belgrade, a senior U.S.
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity,
said American diplomats have held several secret meetings with
leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which had been branded a
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoys Richard Holbrooke and Robert Gelbarde
shuttled last week between Belgrade and Kosovo to seek a
cease-fire between the rebels and the Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
The official indicated that the rebels, who are fighting to
overthrow the Serbs and declare independence, control a great deal
of territory in Kosovo and should be represented in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"They have become a significant political force as a result of
their military power," the official said in outlining the latest
American diplomatic efforts to arrange a cease-fire, and
negotiations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that there needs to be a "single
negotiating team" under the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova, a more
moderate ethnic Albanian leader who also seeks independence of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"While we obviously accept and support the idea of pluralism in
Kosovo, as everywhere else, there needs to be a common front, and
that is really quite essential for now, and they have to be
willing to accept that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to see them -- we have urged that they
oppose the idea of actions against noncombatants, both Serb and
Albanian and others," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
At least 88,000 Albanians have been made homeless, according to
State Department officials. Of these, 60,000 to 85,000 remain in
Kosovo, 15,000 are in Montenegro and 13,000 crossed into Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration opposes an independent Kosovo.
However, the administration holds Yugoslavia mostly responsibility
for the fighting and bloodshed in the province of southern Serbia.
The ethnic Albanians have been on the offensive lately.
</P>
<P>
The administration wants to nail down the pledges of the rebels
to negotiate before the Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany,
Russia, the U.S. and Italy, meets in Bonn, Germany, next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Gelbard discussed strategy for Kosovo in a video
hookup Tuesday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, in a
video hookup, the official said.

Although the country's economy is so good, the central bank
said, most loans haven't gone bad. It cautioned, "This is a
critical time for banks to maintain their lending discipline."
</P>
<P>
"The study identified noteworthy and measurable easing in bank
lending terms," the central bank said.
</P>

The Fed's concern is that borrowers who have had little trouble
making loan payments during good times, which have lowered the
nation's unemployment rate to a 28-year low, might begin to
struggle if economic growth slows down and unemployment begins to
creep higher.
</P>
<P>
"Banks should resist any tendency to assume in evaluating
credits that the unusually favorable economic environment of the
last few years will continue indefinitely," the Fed said.

Merrill Lynch economist Bruce Steinberg, for instance, is
estimating the economy's seasonally adjusted annual growth rate
has slowed from a torrid 5.4 percent in the first quarter to just
1 percent in the current quarter and will average only 2 percent
in the second half of the year.

The lending study was issued as the Fed's monetary
policy-makers are scheduled to have a two-day meeting to determine
the future course of interest rates. It compared several hundred
loans made across the country in late 1995 and late 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The study concludes that intense competition for loan
customers has led to significant easing of pricing and some
nonprice terms," the Fed said in a letter to banks' chief
executive officers.
</P>
<P>
Previous Fed reports showed that banks had tightened up
modestly on consumer lending in the face of individual
bankruptcies soaring past 1 million a year. But the same reports
also indicated a relaxation in business loan terms.

<HEADLINE> Richardson: U.S. Firing at Iraq's Radar Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. firing at a radar
site in southern Iraq was an appropriate response, Bill
Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Pentagon said Tuesday that a U.S. F-16 aircraft
fired at the Iraqi radar site after the Iraqi radar locked on to
allied aircraft patrolling a no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Richardson said, "There was a violation
of military protocol. This is simply an appropriate response to a
violation. That is the American position."
</P>
<P>
A no-fly zone in northern Iraq was imposed by the United
States, Britain and France in 1991 after the Gulf War when Baghdad
flew helicopter gunships to quell a Kurdish uprising. Another
no-fly zone was imposed in the south in 1992 to protect Shi-ite
Moslems who also rebelled against Baghdad.
