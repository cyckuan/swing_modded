<HEADLINE> Rogers Suspended From Ole Miss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi senior center Johnnie Rogers  
was suspended for the rest of the season by coach Rod Barnes on 
Wednesday night, essentially ending his college career. 
</P>
<P>
	While Barnes did not elaborate after the Rebels' 69-67 loss to  
Tennessee, others said Rogers left the team during a practice 
session Sunday. Rogers apparently got upset and talked back to an 
assistant coach who had challenged his effort during the workout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 Rogers averaged 4.1 points and 3.0 rebounds this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this season, Rogers missed several games ``due to  
personal reasons.'' He returned to the team in December. He played 
nearly three seasons at Ole Miss after transferring from Jackson 
State.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen; Down Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Wednesday as strong  
economic data boosted the U.S. currency against the Japanese yen 
and limited its losses against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was bolstered by a Commerce Department report that  
housing starts jumped 3.8 percent last month to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.80 million -- more than economists had 
predicted and the most since December 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The report helped the dollar continue its climb against the yen  
after a sharp rise Tuesday, which came on a Japanese government 
plan to reduce lower long-term interest rates. Rising Japanese 
interest rates had been supporting the yen against the dollar over 
the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the euro, the dollar fell in early overseas trading as  
dealers looked ahead to Thursday's meeting of the European Central 
Bank and hoped for an interest-rate hike. The dollar's losses, 
however, were stemmed by the encouraging housing starts report. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.02  
Japanese yen, up from 118.74 late Tuesday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1235, up from $1.1210. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4222 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4255, and 1.4955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4952. The British 
pound rose to $1.6348 from $1.6337. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7409 German 
marks, down from 1.7454; 5.8377 French francs, down from 5.8515; 
and 1,724.14 Italian lire, down from 1,727.27.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Complain About Cowens Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets vice president Bob Bass  
says complaints by coach Dave Cowens that he's underpaid and 
unappreciated were ill-timed in light of the team's early-season 
stumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens said earlier this week he didn't expect to be around next  
season because Hornets management wouldn't give him a significant 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just about feeling appreciated,'' Cowens said Tuesday in  
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets were 1-5 heading into Wednesday night's game at  
Golden State. The team's two top players, Glen Rice and Anthony 
Mason, are out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team is already wrecked with injuries,'' Bass said. '' For  
your head coach to make statements like this, he's actually damaged 
the team further. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many hits this can this team take? He's the leader of the  
team saying something like that. It's very unfortunate to me. I was 
shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Cowens would continue as coach, Bass replied:  
``He's our coach of record right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens is in the final year of a three-year contract, with the  
team holding an option for a fourth year. This season he's making 
$675,000, among the lowest in the NBA. But he said he might not be 
back for the fourth year even if the Hornets offer the option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need millions and millions of dollars,'' Cowens said  
Monday to the Winston-Salem Journal. ``I just want to get paid 
fairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens said he spoke Tuesday with Bass, who told him he was  
upset with the comments. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked before Tuesday night's 116-88 loss to the Lakers if  
he was concerned about being fired, Cowens said: ``No, I don't have 
any concern. They could, and maybe they should. I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outspoken Mason said of remarks: ``I think that's cool for  
Dave to say that if he feels that way. How are people going to know 
it if he doesn't say something? Keeping it in would be a bigger 
problem, I think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Bobby Phills added: ``He's just speaking his mind, from  
what I hear. Maybe he and the owner can work things out and see if 
they're on the same page.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Travel to West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will travel to the West  
Coast next week to attend a forum on Social Security and spend time 
with his family -- with fund raising for Democrats in between stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will fly to Tucson, Ariz., on Feb. 25 to speak with  
residents about Social Security and Medicare, followed by a 
fund-raising dinner in San Francisco for Democratic congressional 
and senatorial campaign committees, White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He flies to Los Angeles for another fund raiser on Feb. 26,  
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will stay in Los Angeles until March 2, but Lockhart  
would not say whether the trip included activities planned for 
Chelsea Clinton's 19th birthday on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect he will have some down time. I would not rule out it  
being spent with his family,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also plans to travel to Arkansas and Texas next month.  
He will formally dedicate his boyhood home in his hometown of Hope, 
Ark., on March 12. He also will attend a dinner for Rep. Max 
Sandlin, D-Texas, in Texarkana and a Democratic fund raiser in 
Little Rock before returning to Washington on March 14, Lockhart 
said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Reportedly in Talks With eBay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. stock fell as much as 4  
percent Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal reported the 
Internet giant was talking to eBay about buying a minority stake in 
the online-auction company. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently were concerned that an eBay acquisition  
would be expensive for AOL, the nation's largest online service and 
Internet access provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock in the online auction company has soared since eBay went  
public in September, giving the company a market value of about $9 
billion. That means a 10 percent stake in eBay could cost AOL at 
least $900 million, not counting any acquisition premium paid to 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL stock was down $6.43 3/4 a share at $153.06 1/4 in afternoon  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors in eBay pushed up 
the company's stock by $2.87 1/2 a share to $234 by late afternoon on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported  
Wednesday that the direction of talks between AOL and eBay could 
change. But AOL executives are seeking to build closer ties with 
eBay. Last September, eBay agreed to pay AOL at least $12 million 
over three years in exchange for getting links on AOL that send 
users to its auction site. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., said through a spokeswoman it doesn't  
comment on ``rumors or speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by eBay said the San Jose, Calif., company  
is ``always looking for ways to extend our (business) 
relationships'' but termed the Journal report ``purely 
speculative.''

<HEADLINE> Horse Tracks Begin Cooperating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As the millennium approaches, cooperation among race tracks, a  
losing proposition for much of the 20th century, is becoming a 
better bet. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is certainly the changing face of the sport, with  
dwindling on-track attendance and inroads by many other forms of 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, formed in 1998, is  
working to boost public awareness of the excitement of horse 
racing. There have been national advertising campaigns and the 
introduction this year of ``NTRA Champions On Fox,'' a series of 11 
live television stakes races, with a bonus system that could earn a 
horse a $5 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	But more and more, racing is dependent on serious horse players,  
men and women who like their action not on, or just on, the roll of 
dice, the flip of a card or the pull of a handle, but on several 
tons of horse flesh straining and driving to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	These people can't always get to the track, or if they're at a  
track, they want to bet a horse running at another track. They 
reside in the world of simulcasting that has become the world of 
thoroughbred horse racing in the age of dot com. 
</P>
<P>
	Simulcasting allows tracks and their off-track betting  
operations in one state to wager on races on out-of-state tracks. 
It also allows patrons at one track to bet on live racing at that 
track and also on partial or full cards from other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 70 percent of all dollars wagered on racing are bet in a  
simulcast environment,'' said Scott M. Finley, vice president of 
business development for Autotote Communication Services, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Bets at locations receiving simulcasts must be transmitted to  
the point where a particular race originates, and they must go 
through for simulcasting to work. Bettors don't want to hear their 
wagers were too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Transmitting bets can be expensive, especially with individual  
points each using long-distance lines. 
</P>
<P>
	So another cooperative effort in horse racing was born -- the  
North American Simulcast Racing Information Network (NASRIN), 
implemented and managed by Autotote and AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	NASRIN is roughly analogous to the Internet in that one  
connection is used to access numerous sites as opposed to requiring 
a direct line to each. The goal was to reduce dependence on long 
distance telephone calls used to transmit simulcast wagers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracks using the system ``can save in excess of 50 percent on  
transmission costs,'' Finley said. ``If 100 percent of the tracks 
used it, savings would be in excess of $20 million (a year).'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Feb. 2, there were 115 sites on the network, including  
such major players as the New York Racing Association (Aqueduct, 
Belmont Park and Saratoga), Churchill Downs, Keeneland, Gulfstream 
Park, Hollywood Park, Oaklawn Park and Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley said Autotote and AT&AMP;T have three-year contracts with  
tracks on the network and a sponsorship agreement with the NTRA. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the network is running well, but ``there's been some  
industry politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like horses, cooperation is never a sure thing in racing.

	Clinton Pushes Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton made his pitch today to save  
Social Security to 41 college campuses in 28 states. The 
satellite-linked video town hall meetings aimed at selling young 
people on his plan to shore up the retirement system using 62 
percent of the anticipated budget surpluses over the next 15 years. 
Clinton also pushed his proposals to dedicate 15 percent of the 
surplus to Medicare and to use another 11 percent to establish 
401(k)-style accounts for working Americans. Administration 
officials said the event was designed to sharpen the distinctions 
between the president's insistence on dealing with Social Security 
and the Republicans' emphasis on across-the-board tax cuts.

	3 Kurd Protesters Killed in Berlin  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Israeli security guards shot and killed three  
Kurds who forced their way into the Israeli consulate today with 
dozens of protesters. The Kurds were enraged by reports that Israel 
aided in the arrest by Turkey of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah 
Ocalan. They climbed a fence surrounding the four-story white 
building and broke through the door. At least 43 people were 
injured: 16 demonstrators and 27 police officers. Police said they 
arrested 220 Kurds. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
reiterated that Israel had no role in Ocalan's arrest and defended 
the shootings, saying the guards acted in self-defense.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg today  
announced he will not seek a fourth term in 2000, joining New York 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan as veteran Democrats opting against 
re-election bids. Lautenberg, 75, said he didn't want to spent the 
next two years raising money for another campaign. The departures 
create opportunities for the Republicans, who have a 55-45 
advantage in the Senate, to capture open seats. Also looking ahead 
to 2000 was Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Offering his strongest 
statement to date on whether he is going to run for president in 
2000, the Republican said: ``I'm warming to the task.''

	15 Die Under Oregon Suicide Law  
</P>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- In the first year under the nation's only  
assisted-suicide law, 15 terminally ill people in Oregon used it to 
end their lives, and there was no evidence they suffered painful, 
lingering deaths. In a report published in tomorrow's New England 
Journal of Medicine, Oregon health officials also said that fears 
that the law would be used as an easy way out by people afraid of 
financial ruin or extreme pain proved unfounded. Rather, health 
officials found that use of the law has so far been driven 
overwhelmingly by the desire of strong-willed patients to exercise 
some control over the way they died.

the 1968 slaying of a schoolteacher. Pratt was freed in 1997 after

he was a police informant. Yesterday, a California appeals court

<HEADLINE> Skip Away Wins Horse of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Along with winning nearly $10 million  
in his career, Skip Away has earned another distinction -- Horse of 
the Year for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, the ``horse pet'' of Carolyn and Sonny Hine, won the  
Eclipse Award on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Skippy, as he was called by owner Carolyn and her  
husband-trainer, Sonny, was a unanimous selection, getting the 
votes of the National Turf Writers Association, Daily Racing Form 
and racing secretaries of National Thoroughbred Racing Association 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been a real sadness in my heart (if he had  
lost),'' Carolyn Hine said. ``I guess I would have been numb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away finished second in Horse of the Year voting to  
2-year-old champion Favorite Trick in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gray horse, winner of his first seven starts, which  
stretched his victory streak to nine, beat Awesome Again, who won 
all six starts and beat Skip Away in the Breeders' Cup Classic on 
Nov. 7, in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were announced at the NTRA's Eclipse Awards dinner at  
Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, who was 5, also beat Awesome Again, who was 4, as  
best older horse or gelding. Frank Stronach, Awesome Again's owner, 
was voted the top owner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, 3-year-old champion in 1996 and best older horse and  
gelding in 1997, obviously won racing's top honor on the strength 
of his schedule. Of his seven straight wins, five of them were 
Grade I stakes, one of them was a Grade II and the other was a 
Grade III. He finished third in the Grade I Woodward, then sixth in 
Grade I BC Classic, finishing with $2.74 million for the year and 
$9,612,360 for his career, second only to Cigar ($9,999,815). 
</P>
<P>
	Awesome Again won two Grade I stakes -- the Whitney Handicap and  
the BC Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they couldn't give it to anyone else when his major  
competition won only two Grade ones,'' Sonny Hine said. ``He 
deserves all of his accolades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another big winner was Bob Baffert. He got an Eclipse Award as  
trainer of the year, and two of his charges won divisional 
championships -- Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness, was the top 3-year-old, and unbeaten Silverbulletday was 
the top 2-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram owns both Real Quiet and Silverbulletday, but the  
Eclipse Award for top owner went to Frank Stronach, owner of 
Awesome Again, whose stable had a big year. Pegram said the 
victories of Real Quiet, Baffert and Gary Stevens were honor enough 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, Real Quiet's rider, was voted the top jockey. It was  
the first Eclipse Award for the Hall of Fame jockey, who has won 
the Kentucky Derby three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled to finally win it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Every winner was a unanimous first-place selection of each of  
the three voting organizations. The outstanding breeder award, 
given to Mr. and Mrs. John C. Mabee, was selected by a special 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Other equine winners were Answer Lively, 2-year-old colt or  
gelding; Banshee Breeze, 3-year-old filly; Escena, older filly or 
mare; Reraise, sprinter; Buck's Boy, male turf horse; Fiji, female 
turf horse; Flat Top, steeplechaser. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Bridgmohan was honored as top apprentice jockey.

<HEADLINE> 15 Die Under Oregon Suicide Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Fifteen terminally ill people in Oregon took  
their lives during the first year the nation's only 
assisted-suicide law was in effect, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence that they suffered painful, lingering  
deaths as opponents had warned, according to the report in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. Oregon health officials also said that 
fears that the law would be used as an easy way out by people 
afraid of financial ruin or extreme pain proved unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, health officials found that use of the law has so far  
been driven overwhelmingly by the desire of strong-willed patients 
to exercise some control over the way they died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many physicians reported that their patients had been decisive  
and independent throughout their lives or that the decision to 
request a lethal prescription was consistent with a longstanding 
belief about the importance of controlling the manner in which they 
died,'' researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first report on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act showed that  
doctors prescribed lethal drugs to 23 people in 1998 but that six 
died from illnesses before using the drugs. Two others were alive 
as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the 15 who took the lethal drugs were cancer  
patients. The others were suffering from heart or lung diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of those who took their lives was 69.  
</P>
<P>
	Backers of assisted suicide said the report shows the law is  
working well and confirms their predictions that only a small 
number of people would make use of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what we expected -- a year of impeccable implementation,''  
said Barbara Coombs Lee, chief sponsor of the ballot measure that 
established the law. 
</P>
<P>
	First approved in 1994 and reaffirmed by Oregon voters in  
November 1997, the law allows a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose 
of medication to hasten the death of patients who have less than 
six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic Church and others spent millions of dollars  
to try to derail the law. They relied chiefly on the argument that 
some people would die excruciating, torturous deaths after taking 
the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Oregon's Health Division found no evidence of botched  
suicides, and no complications such as vomiting or seizures from 
the lethal doses of barbiturates. Nearly all of those who took the 
drugs were unconscious within five minutes, and most were dead 
within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Four patients died about three hours after taking the drugs and  
one died 11 hours afterward, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the apparent lack of technical problems, the leader of  
the Portland Archdiocese denounced assisted suicide as an immoral 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time a physician writes a prescription for lethal  
medication, we are confronted again with our failure to offer 
compassionate care,'' Archbishop John Vlazny said. ``In allowing 
assisted suicide to continue, the state of Oregon dismisses the 
value of human life. This thought fills me with sadness and 
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Rasmussen, a Salem oncologist who has assisted in two  
suicides, said his patients slipped peacefully into a coma almost 
immediately after eating chocolate pudding laced with barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very positive to have the relatives gather around and  
say their final goodbyes, and to reminisce about their family 
stories,'' Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not surprised by the relatively low number of  
suicides. ``In my experience with cancer patients, they want every 
day they can get,'' he said. They want to live, they don't want to 
die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the case with Barbara Oskamp, a West Linn woman who  
suffers from a terminal brain tumor. She said she doesn't know if 
she will use assisted suicide, but might if it appears she no 
longer is able to take care of herself or becomes a burden to her 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me feelings of fantastic relief to know that I will  
have a choice about how my final days will go,'' she said. ``It 
lowers my fear levels a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Arrive at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- One by one they unpacked their gear for the  
start of a new season. Time for the champions to put the 
record-smashing year behind and look to the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	In came Andy Pettitte, then Chuck Knoblauch. Nearly four months  
of celebration had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	As baseball players started to report to spring training  
Wednesday, a day ahead of the first official workouts, all but one 
of the New York Yankees were back, intent on winning the World 
Series for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to win. That's the bottom line,'' shortstop Derek  
Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York went 125-50, setting an AL record for regular-season  
wins (114) and a major league record for combined victories in the 
regular and postseason. They steamrolled San Diego in a World 
Series sweep, then brought back everyone except Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is to get back to the World Series and win it  
again,'' said Jeter, who a day earlier had won a $5 million salary 
in arbitration. ``It doesn't make a difference how many games we 
win. We want to be the champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spring training officially starts Thursday, the first day  
pitchers, catchers and injured players can work out under the 
supervision of team personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	While some players reported Wednesday to the clubhouse at  
Legends Field, others -- Jeter among them -- worked out at the club's 
nearby minor-league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Yankees already have been working out for several  
weeks. No sign of complacency here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that being a problem,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
``You really don't have to worry about any guys in this 
clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who missed the postseason  
following colon cancer surgery, feels good about his progress and 
is hopeful of being with the team on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any concerns about my health or my ability to  
play. That's not a concern at all,'' Strawberry said. ``I feel 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case Strawberry won't be ready, the Yankees took him off  
the 40-man roster in December, which would shield his salary from 
the luxury tax if he's in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down here to prove to myself that there's a lot of  
baseball left,'' Strawberry said. ``This is gravy for me. It's all 
about having fun. After what I've been through, what can I expect 
but to have fun?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who receives chemotherapy treatment once a week,  
said his weight is back up to 222 pounds. If he doesn't wind up 
fitting into the Yankees' plans, he's confident he'll play 
somewhere in the majors in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky. Most people have a hard time with chemo. It's not  
an easy thing to get by,'' he said, adding that he hasn't noticed 
any side effects from treatments that likely will continue until at 
least May. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who had been offered $3.2 million by the Yankees, said  
his teammates were supportive both before and after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all happy for me,'' Jeter said. ``Now the focus is  
on the season.''

<HEADLINE> Radio City Hall Begins Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Radio City Music Hall, home of the famous  
high-kicking Rockettes and a tourist draw for 2 million visitors a 
year, has closed for a seven-month, $60 million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark art deco hall will reopen in October in time for  
the Rockettes' annual Christmas Spectacular show, Susie Arons, a 
spokeswoman for Radio City Entertainment, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arons declined to offer details of the renovation, but said they  
would include compliance with federal laws protecting people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White had sued Radio City Production LLC  
and RCPI Trust, the owners and operators of the Manhattan theater, 
alleging it was not accessible for handicapped visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	To settle the civil action filed in federal court last week, the  
companies agreed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990 by making extensive changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, owners agreed to instal 59 new wheelchair and  
companion seating spots, add 240 sound enhancing devices for the 
hearing impaired and include audible and visual signals in the 
elevators. 
</P>
<P>
	Accessibility improvements also were planned for restrooms,  
telephones, drinking fountains, concession areas and ticket 
windows. Alarms and signs were to be installed to help those with 
disabilities find their way to service areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Arons said the renovations were planned in December 1997 when  
Cablevision Systems Corp. agreed to a 25-year lease on one of the 
city's best-known stages with a pledge to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5,901-seat theater, designed by Samuel Lionel Rothafel,  
opened in 1932 in Rockefeller Center and is known as much for its 
designs as for its more than 300 live performances. 
</P>
<P>
	The final curtain call prior to the renovations was the ESPY  
sports awards hosted by ESPN on Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Man Dies After School Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- A man died Wednesday after he lost control  
of his car and crashed through the window of a second-grade 
classroom. None of the 22 children in the class were seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7- and 8-year-old students were out of their desks on the  
other side of the room looking at a pet guinea pig when the car 
crashed into the room at Grant Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	The car landed on top of a vacant desk. Eight children suffered  
minor scrapes and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason Gene Martin, 73, was pronounced dead at University  
Hospital and Clinics about an hour after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were still investigating and did not know  
whether the driver died from injuries suffered in the accident or 
from other causes as he drove the car. They had not determined how 
fast the car was moving at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Martin had left the parking lot of a public  
library across the street from the school in his Honda Accord. The 
car passed between two trees and through a railing before crashing 
through a basement window and into the classroom.

<HEADLINE> Stewart: Formula 1 Seeks US Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart  
says Formula One, preparing for its debut at the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway next year, would welcome young American drivers to its 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Stewart said, he can't name one who might be  
willing or able to make the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who that is right now. I don't see one on the  
horizon,'' Stewart said Tuesday after touring the new Speedway 
layout for the U.S. Grand Prix in 2000. ``Jeff Gordon won at 
Daytona last Sunday. He's not going to take his bags and run over 
to the Formula One circuit while he's got himself so 
well-programmed and established over here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike the old days where a few Grand Prix drivers could come  
over and do Indianapolis, I don't think that can happen any longer. 
I don't think you're going to see too many Indy-car drivers being 
able to switch or even just come over for a year. That's not 
happening anymore, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Formula One race at the Speedway will be run on a 2 1/2-mile,  
13-turn course using part of the existing track, and the rest 
snaking through the infield. Thirty-six pitside garages with suites 
above them are being built, along with a new media center and 
control tower and a new press box with seating space for 400 
writers and 40 television broadcast booths. 
</P>
<P>
	The date for the race next year has not been set.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' the 59-year-old Scotsman said of the  
Speedway renovation. ``First of all, there's so much of it already 
there, the bleachers, the grandstands, the suites. ... Obviously, 
the pit area and garage area is going to be totally different, but 
I've been around the whole circuit and it looks good to me. The 
design looks good, the viewing facilities will be excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the race at Indianapolis would be received well  
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indy 500 has been going since 1911. There's an immense  
amount of heritage, and history is quite important to the 
Europeans. They like that. They're going to come and they're going 
to see a ready-made race track,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Indy knows how to put on events of this kind. That is  
quite an important element. We go to some remote areas that have 
never put a motor race on, for example we're going to go to 
Malaysia this year. Next year, we're going to go to China. They've 
never put a motor race on. This is the first time there will be a 
Formula One race in Indy, but it sure as hell isn't the first time 
they've run a motor race in Indy. I think that Indianapolis as a 
community can probably service the Formula One Grand Prix better 
than any new track we would ever go to in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was 26 years old and in his second season of Formula One  
racing when he first came to Indianapolis in 1966. He led 40 laps 
and was within 10 laps of victory when he lost oil pressure and 
finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was 18th in his only other Indy appearance in 1967.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then the next year, I decided I was going to concentrate on  
Formula One to try to win the world championship. I decided then 
that it had gotten to the point where you could only focus and 
connect to one formula at that time,'' he said. ``I think that 
realization was pretty accurate, and it didn't do me any harm 
because I won three world championships.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Rejects Foreign Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic dealt a blow today  
to prospects for a Kosovo peace deal, rejecting a 
take-it-or-leave-it proposal that foreign troops enforce any 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav president's defiance increased chances of NATO  
intervention, with only three days remaining until a deadline set 
by world powers for Serbia and ethnic Albanians to reach an 
agreement at talks in France. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who met with Milosevic in the  
Yugoslav capital Tuesday night, and Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright both warned Milosevic that he will suffer airstrikes if he 
doesn't accept an agreement by Saturday at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yugoslav leader showed no signs of budging.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued in Yugoslavia today by the official Tanjug  
news agency, Milosevic said ``our negative stand on the presence of 
foreign troops is not only the attitude of the leadership, but also 
of all citizens of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top Western diplomat at the talks in France, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said mediators were ``not surprised'' by 
Milosevic's defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	International mediators, led by the United States, brought Serbs  
and secessionist ethnic Albanians to the negotiating table to end a 
conflict that has cost an estimated 2,000 lives and left hundreds 
of thousands homeless in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, the 
dominant of the two Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment of an international force is the key element of  
the deal proposed by the United States and backed by other powers 
at the conference outside Paris. As many as 30,000 NATO troops, 
including some 4,000 American soldiers, would be sent to Kosovo to 
police the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to forge a deal, British Foreign Secretary Robin  
Cook and his French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, today came to the 
14th-century chateau where the talks have been held since Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright telephoned Milosevic from Washington on Tuesday and  
told him the Kosovo Albanians appear ready to sign the agreement 
and she expects him to do the same, State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic showed no more willingness to do so than the  
Serbian officials at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Milosevic reiterated the Serb stand that there  
can be no independence for Kosovo and that all ethnic communities 
in the province should have the same rights. Ethnic Albanians make 
up 90 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our delegation in Rambouillet is negotiating in good faith,''  
declared Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	His statement, along with other defiant signals sent by his  
government, seemed to offer little hope the Serb delegation would 
back down and sign the peace deal despite the danger of NATO 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Komnenic, Yugoslavia's information minister, told  
reporters today the Serbs are willing to make ``major concessions'' 
to Kosovo Albanians, but would never allow foreign troops on their 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they bomb Serbia, there will be no more negotiations and a  
solution for Kosovo would be postponed for several years,'' 
Komnenic said in front of the Rambouillet chateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug quoted Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as  
warning that NATO attacks on Yugoslavia would mean the end of any 
negotiations on the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian state television, which reflects Milosevic's views,  
aired defiant statements from government officials and statements 
by ordinary Serbs saying the government should not back down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs had counted on Russia to back up their rejection of  
foreign troops. But a NATO source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the Russians have told the 16-nation military 
alliance they are willing to go along with a NATO deployment as 
part of a three-year interim peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The source also said Russians may eventually participate in a  
peacekeeping operation, as they do in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior Russian Defense Ministry official said NATO's  
insistence on sending troops was the ``most crude and simplistic 
way'' of solving the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no diplomatic, legal, political or especially  
economic levers in the alliance's arsenal, just naked military 
force,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, one of Russia's most 
outspoken critics of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials still oppose NATO airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia in the event the peace talks fail.

<HEADLINE> Simpson's Heisman Sold for $230,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sitting in the front row, the father of  
Nicole Brown Simpson watched as O.J. Simpson's Heisman Trophy and 
other memorabilia were sold to the highest bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Tuesday night's auction totaled $430,000, a  
fraction of the $33.5 million Simpson owes the families of Ms. 
Brown and Ronald Goldman for their 1994 slayings. The 1968 trophy 
fetched $255,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Louis Brown was not complaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``It could have gone better, but it could have also gone a hell  
of a lot worse,'' said Brown, who noted the proceeds were needed to 
pay legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Simpson items sold at the Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield  
auction house went from $400 to $10,000 to bidders making offers by 
phone, in person and over the Internet. On top of any winning bid, 
a 15 percent bidder's premium was added, with the additional money 
going to the auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items were a life-size metal statue of Simpson that  
went for $3,738; a glass University of Southern California Hall of 
Fame award for $2,070 and a player of the year trophy give by ABC 
Wide World of Sports in 1973 for $1,955. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceeds would barely ``put a scratch'' in the judgment owed  
to the estates of the victims, said Gary Caris, a lawyer for the 
Goldmans. A small amount of money has been collected in a private 
settlement, but Caris said he could not reveal how much. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment stemmed from a civil wrongful death suit in which a  
jury found Simpson liable for the killings of Ms. Simpson and 
Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder in an earlier criminal 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning Heisman Trophy bidder is an East Coast collector who  
wanted to remain anonymous, said George Noceti, a vice president at 
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield. The winning bid was made by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier estimates had the Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to  
the top college football player, selling for as much as $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Cohen of Cleveland came close to buying the Heisman  
Trophy, but his $220,000 bid was overtaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got real sweaty at the end. ... I was going to put it in my  
house,'' said Cohen, who is in the real estate business and 
collects sports memorabilia as a hobby. ``But then you consider, 
that's the cost of a real house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another bidder, Bob Enyart of Denver, told reporters afterward  
that he spent $16,000 and plans to burn everything, including a 
$10,000 Hall of Fame plaque and two No. 32 jerseys. The Web site 
operator, who said he raised the money from site visitors, plans to 
destroy the items on the steps of the Los Angeles County 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's possessions were seized and stored in a sheriff's  
warehouse while lawyers battled over what could be sold and when. A 
baby grand piano used by Simpson's mother was seized and then 
returned when a judge ruled it was her property. 
</P>
<P>
	His home also went into foreclosure and was sold at auction. It  
subsequently was demolished by the buyer who wanted to build a 
different style house on the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson lives in Los Angeles with his two children and is  
fighting a custody battle with his former in-laws, Louis and 
Juditha Brown. They want the children to live with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil trial verdict is still on appeal.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Boxcar Willie says his latest battle against  
leukemia has left him unable to perform at his theater this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old country singer was scheduled to open his season  
March 27, but he announced Tuesday that he wouldn't be able to do 
the shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxcar Willie, whose real name is Lecil Martin, was hospitalized  
last week in Springfield for his third round of chemotherapy. The 
leukemia was diagnosed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just doesn't know when he'll be able to be back performing,  
so we didn't want to leave people hanging,'' said his daughter, 
Tammy LaCore. ``We're hoping he can at least make some guest 
appearances later.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Chip Identifies Fingerprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A newly developed computer chip can quickly  
identify fingerprints to help safeguard electronic money cards, 
portable phones and other electronic devices, the chip's creator 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chip, developed by Japanese telecom giant NTT Corp.,  
takes just 0.5 seconds to match fingerprints with those registered 
in advance with a slight touch on the chip's surface, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chip is 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inches) square and 0.5  
millimeters (0.02 inches) thick. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Telegraph and Telephone plans in a couple of years to  
commercialize the new chip, estimated to cost one-tenth as much as 
earlier models, said Hiroshi Takahashi, of NTT Corp.'s corporate 
strategy planning office. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, several chips were needed to identify fingerprints  
and could not be used on small electronics devices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new chip can be widely used in note-type personal  
computers, portable phones and other information-related devices to 
prevent unauthorized people from using them, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Takahashi said the new chip was to be shown at an international  
meeting on solid circuits held in San Francisco this week.

	After continuing to drop early in the day on worries over the  
lack of export demand, wheat for March delivery rallied on news 
that the U.S. Department of Agriculture may meet with Russian 
officials to discuss another food-aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	March soybeans also fell in response to reports of continued  
good weather in South America. The market has already been 
pressured by predictions of near-record crops in Brazil and plans 
to plant more soybean crops in Argentina -- all of which would 
compete with U.S. crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, March corn finished slightly lower, though the drop  
in grain futures prices was softened a bit as the dollar finished 
lower against major currencies in European trading. Gold prices 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, wheat for March delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to  
$2.54 3/4 a bushel; March corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.13 1/2 a bushel; March 
oats finished up 1/2 at $1.01 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 1 1/2 cent 
to $4.86 1/4 a bushel.

	Cattle and live hog futures also fell on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies finished up.

	April live cattle fell .95 cent to 66.62 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell a cent to 73.62 cents a pound; April lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Block Ohio's Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal appeals court refused Wednesday to  
block what would be Ohio's first execution since 1963 -- that of a 
baker's handyman who has volunteered to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a plea from  
public defenders representing Wilford Lee Berry Jr.'s mother and 
sister and refused to reconsider his mental competency. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 36, wants to waive his appeals and die for the 1989  
shooting of Cleveland baker Charles Mitroff during a robbery of 
$140. Berry's lethal injection is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio Supreme Court has decided Berry was competent to drop  
his appeals. But his family's lawyers claim to have new evidence 
that Berry might be incompetent because of possible brain injuries 
he suffered during a 1997 fight on death row. Berry has been in a 
prison hospital since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said any such evidence must first be presented  
in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Jets Won't Match Offer for Brady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Tight end Kyle Brady is headed for the  
Jacksonville Jaguars after the New York Jets declined to match a 
$14.4 million offer Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady signed a five-year deal with the Jaguars earlier in the  
week, which the Jets had the right to match because they placed a 
transition player tag on the four-year veteran. A team spokesman 
said Wednesday that the Jets notified both the NFL and the Jaguars 
about not matching. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract calls for a $4 million bonus and a salary cap hit  
of only $1.3 million next season, but the Jets opted to sign Eric 
Green away from Baltimore and let Brady go. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, 27, had his best season under coach Bill Parcells in  
1998. A solid blocker, Brady also made 30 receptions and had five 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was signed to a $7.5 million, four-year contract with a  
$1.2 million signing bonus. He caught 34 passes and had one 
touchdown for the Ravens, but has a history of injuries.

<HEADLINE> Leyland Ready To Lead Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Within two hours of arriving in Arizona,  
Colorado Rockies manager Jim Leyland was touring his new spring 
training home and planning meetings with his players. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying message: Camp Leyland will be all business when  
pitchers and catchers hold their first workout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of work to do here,'' Leyland said Wednesday.  
``We're not going to give jobs away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who guided the Florida Marlins to a World Series title  
in 1997, is the second manager in Colorado's six-year history. He 
replaced Don Baylor last fall after the Rockies went 77-85 and 
finished fourth in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Colorado's season was a disappointment, it paled in  
comparison to what Leyland endured during his final season in 
Florida. The Marlins lost 108 games after their championship team 
was dismantled by owner Wayne Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we knew we weren't going to win,'' Leyland said.  
``There were a lot of games that we lost, but we played good. We 
just weren't good enough. We were overmatched. I felt bad for those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After filling a starting lineup with young players better suited  
for Triple-A, Leyland inherits a Colorado team loaded with veterans 
such as outfielders Dante Bichette and Larry Walker and third 
baseman Vinny Castilla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies also have their share of youth in Todd Helton, who  
was runner-up in the NL Rookie of the Year voting, third-year 
shortstop Neifi Perez and starting pitchers Jamey Wright and John 
Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to see these guys managing them rather than seeing  
them from the other side,'' Leyland said. ``We're coming in here 
like rookies. We want to make sure everything is perfect for the 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who inspected training fields in shorts, tennis shoes  
and knee-high socks, was not even close to being the first member 
of the Rockies to arrive at Colorado's training complex at Hi 
Corbett Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief pitchers Jerry Dipoto, Curtis Leskanic, Mike DeJean and  
Dave Veres started working out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We missed each other,'' Dipoto said.  
</P>
<P>
	All four relievers will be given a chance to be the closer,  
which the Rockies handled by committee last season. Dipoto won the 
job out of spring training, but the other three filled the role for 
stretches when Dipoto struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever gets the shot gets the shot,'' Dipoto said. ``We're as  
close as brothers. We just want to win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a stopper and arranging the order of his starting  
rotation will be among Leyland's priorities. He also wants to make 
sure his team is mentally and physically ready to go when the 
season opens April 4 against San Diego in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are going to play a lot in spring training,''  
Leyland said. ``I do things a little bit different. I'm not going 
to take Dante Bichette on a two-hour road trip, give him two 
at-bats and take him out. It's not some kind of punishment. It's to 
get them ready. Guys say they can subconsciously turn it on and 
turn it off. There aren't a whole lot of guys who can do that.''

<HEADLINE> Family of Boy Accused in Death Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The family of one of two young boys initially  
charged with killing an 11-year-old girl for her bicycle have sued 
Chicago police for $100 million, saying detectives framed the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 7 and 8, had been accused of beating Ryan Harris,  
suffocating her with her panties and molesting her last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dropped on Sept. 4 after semen was discovered in  
the girl's underwear. Experts said it was unlikely that boys so 
young could produce semen. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has since been charged in the crime.  
</P>
<P>
	R. Eugene Pincham, a former judge representing the 8-year-old's  
family, said Wednesday that detectives pinned the murder on the 
children despite evidence indicating that an adult committed the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by the 8-year-old's family contends Allen  
Nathaniel and James Cassidy falsely arrested the boy, interrogated 
him without his parents or a lawyer present and intimidated him 
into a confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for Nathaniel and Cassidy at their district  
headquarters were not returned Wednesday. Officials at the police 
department and for the city of Chicago, both named as defendants, 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Grant, another attorney representing the family, said the  
boy, once a model student, now is failing in school, suffers from 
nightmares and is afraid to leave his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a child who has been severely traumatized,'' Grant  
said. ``It's state-sanctioned child abuse.''

<HEADLINE> USDA Recalls Specialty Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chicago company has recalled 2,600 pounds of  
headcheese, a type of seasoned meat sold by Asian specialty stores, 
because of concern that it might be contaminated with listeria, the 
Agriculture Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The product distributed by Ba Le Meat Processing &AMP; Wholesale  
Inc. was produced between Jan. 7 and Feb. 5, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Subject to recall are packages of ``Ba Le Gio Thu (Headcheese)''  
between 1 and 8 pounds. Headcheese is a seasoned loaf made of the 
head meat of a calf or pig. The packages bear ``Est 18442'' in the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The product was distributed to Asian specialty stores in  
Philadelphia; New York; Chicago; Houston; Austin, Texas; Garland, 
Texas; Rochester, Minn.; Raleigh, N.C.; Oakland, Calif.; Tampa, 
Fla.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Orlando, Fla.; Coral Springs, Fla.; 
Silver Spring, Md.; Dorchester, Mass.; and Doraville, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria bacteria can cause a flu-like illness called  
listeriosis, which is especially dangerous in newborns, pregnant 
women and people with serious illnesses such as cancer or AIDS who 
have suppressed immune systems.

<HEADLINE>  Leftist Congressman Shot in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Gunmen waiting in ambush assassinated a  
leading Ecuadorean politician and former presidential candidate 
Wednesday as he left the legislature in Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Hurtado, 62, a Marxist congressman and vocal opponent of  
President Jamil Mahuad's economic austerity plans, died an hour 
after gunmen ambushed him while he walked to his car. Two 
assistants also were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deputy left the building with his two bodyguards when they  
were intercepted by three subjects who fired six shots with their 
guns,'' Lt. Luis Padilla, head of Congress' security, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen have not been captured and no one has claimed  
responsibility for the attack, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado, who devoted much of his life to union causes, lost a  
presidential bid to conservative Leon Febres Cordero in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a congressman for the Marxist Popular Democratic Movement  
party, and was just returning from a news conference criticizing 
the government for its treatment of striking teachers under the 
austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and union members have staged often-violent street  
protests with dozens of arrests to force the government to repeal 
the measures, which included ending subsidies on electricity, 
diesel oil and cooking gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's largest labor federation had called two general  
strikes against the austerity measures, which Mahuad has argued 
were necessary to rescue this poor Andean nation from bankruptcy 
and its ``worst crisis in 70 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To protect its dwindling foreign reserves, the government last  
week eliminated the band within which the national currency was 
allowed to be traded, effectively devaluing the sucre. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls showed Mahuad's popularity falling and the protests  
gaining support among Ecuadoreans as prices rose and the austerity 
measures took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Hurtado's party and union leaders blamed government  
supporters for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the stone in the shoe of this government,'' a weeping  
Maria Eugenia Lima, a congresswoman for Hurtado's party, said after 
hearing of his murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Jose Gallardo condemned the attack, but the  
government has not released an official response to Hurtado's 
murder.

<HEADLINE> 1960s Guru Ram Dass Has a Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ram Dass is known as the man who went to  
India to find enlightenment and then returned to share it with 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Markers of his life straddling East and West crowd his home in  
the quiet town of San Anselmo, about 20 miles north of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese prints are propped up alongside Gauguin-inspired  
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama gazes from a framed photo on a table. A player  
piano in the corner churns out ``The Way We Were'' next to a 
child-sized statue of Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
	And everywhere -- lounging, standing at attention, holding a toy  
guitar and draped with seashells -- is Hanuman, the monkey-god Dass 
reveres. In fact, the name Ram Dass, given to him by his guru, 
means ``servant of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dass was working on his new book, ``Conscious Aging,'' when he  
suffered a stroke so debilitating, so close a brush with death, 
that it cured him of his fear of death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's brought out new aspects of myself and aspects of my  
relationship to the world,'' he says haltingly. His right arm is 
strapped to his wheelchair. ``The stroke has gotten me into a stage 
of life -- this is a stage close to death, a stage which is 
inward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dass is the author of 10 books including the best-selling ``Be  
Here Now,'' published in 1971, and ``How Can I Help?'' his 1985 
guide to volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the moment I get up, I constantly look for help,'' he  
muses. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``the wheelchair and the gray'' have given him unexpected  
dignity, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this goes wisdom,'' he says with a playful smile,  
pointing to his wheelchair and his shock of white hair. ``People 
think you are wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dass, now 67, was born Richard Alpert, the son of a prominent  
East Coast attorney who was a founder of Brandeis University. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young psychology professor at Harvard University, he and  
colleague Timothy Leary conducted experiments with hallucinogenic 
mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	After experiencing an epiphany, he fed the mushrooms and LSD to  
prisoners, philosophers and students, watching to see their effect. 
</P>
<P>
	That got him and Leary kicked out of Harvard in 1963.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little too sensational,'' Dass admits, breaking out  
in a wide grin, relishing his role as the man who introduced a 
generation to psychedelic drugs. ``We were the starters of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But could he find this state of enlightenment without drugs?  
</P>
<P>
	``That made me go East,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Following Allen Ginsberg's advice, he headed to India in 1967,  
where he met the man who became his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned, Dass wrote ``Be Here Now,'' the classic  
spiritual primer that found its way into thousands of backpacks 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, he founded the Hanuman Foundation. He started the  
Prison Ashram Project to introduce inmates to spirituality and the 
Dying Project to provide a home for those nearing death. He also 
helped create the Seva Foundation, which provides eye care in 
India, Tibet and Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's serving God by serving humans,'' Dass says.  
</P>
<P>
	He suffered his stroke in February 1997. He was developing a  
talk radio show and working on his new book. Dass was paralyzed on 
his right side. For a time, he couldn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovery has been slow but steady.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like another life,'' he says. ``Before, I played  
golf and drove my car with a stick shift, (played) my cello. And 
now, I can't do any of those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wastes no time on pity.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean a lot of suffering to compare,'' he says. ``That  
was a different life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Dass was hospitalized, his friend and fellow  
counterculture icon Wavy Gravy predicted Dass would use the 
experience in his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll get good material out of this,'' he says. ``He's always  
used his experiences as a springboard. He'll use this in the same 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Dass sees the stroke as a new learning experience. He  
has given lectures throughout Northern California on what he calls 
his state of ``heavy grace'' and his new book, which is due out 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This culture is terribly frightened of death,'' Dass says.  
``Before, I focused on death. Now I'm focusing on aging. And the 
age stage is a particularly choice one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message Dass hopes to impart? That death is not to be  
feared; that there can be grace in the fine art of aging. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '60s, I was an uncle for a movement. I was always  
showing people where they could go. I went East and then there was 
a big movement East. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so the baby boomers are getting old -- and I'm learning how  
to get old for them,'' he says with a sly smile. ``That's my 
role.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Rain was spreading across much of the East early today, and rain  
and mountain snow took aim again at the Northwest. Up to a foot of 
Sierra Nevada snow was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was forecast from New England through the central  
Appalachians and into the Gulf Coast states, with thunderstorms 
along the East and Gulf coasts. Freezing rain, sleet and snow could 
make for treacherous driving from northern New York into southern 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsettled weather across the West threatened to spread rain  
from western Washington into central California, as well as 
southern Utah. The heaviest mountain snow was possible above 2,000 
feet in the Cascades and above 4,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy snow also was possible from central Montana into the  
northern Wasatch mountains and the Rockies, with 50-mph wind gusts 
that could cause snow to drift. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain showers were possible over the Ohio and Mississippi  
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	The northern Great Lakes could see snow. Otherwise, wide  
expanses of the Plains and western Great Lakes should enjoy dry 
conditions, with flurries possible across the western Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine should be abundant across most of the Southwest.  
</P>
<P>
	The nation's hot spot Tuesday in the Lower 48 states was  
McAllen, Texas, with a high reading of 84 degrees. The coldest 
place was Clayton Lake, Maine, with a low of 7 below zero. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Woos Couch Before Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- It's official: Tim Couch is Cleveland's No. 1  
pick -- as college football player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, the Kentucky quarterback who could be the expansion  
Browns' first overall selection in April's college draft, is in 
town today to be honored by the Cleveland Touchdown Club as its top 
collegiate player. 
</P>
<P>
	And as Couch arrives, Browns coach Chris Palmer is leaving.  
</P>
<P>
	Palmer is on his way to Indianapolis for the NFL scouting  
combine, where he'll interview Couch and as many as six other 
college quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will visit with him at the combine when he gets there, and  
Ricky Williams,'' Palmer said. ``We'll visit with all the major 
players in the next few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have been working around the clock to sign free  
agents, and now they'll begin the more tedious process of 
evaluating the 330 college players expected to be at the combine. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and Williams, Texas' Heisman Trophy-winning running back,  
will both be in Indianapolis, but it is doubtful that either will 
work out for scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that he'll be there for a medical (exam),'' Palmer said  
of Couch, who has made it well known that he wants to be drafted by 
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	So, is Couch the Browns' first choice?  
</P>
<P>
	``You guys are really rushing the process,'' Palmer warned  
reporters. ``The combine really starts the process. It could take 
up until April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are sure to draw plenty of attention in Indianapolis.  
After all, they hold the coveted No. 1 pick, a lottery ticket that 
could bring them a franchise player to build around. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said the Browns will definitely interview six  
quarterbacks, and among the players they're sure to talk with are 
UCLA's Cade McNown, Syracuse's Donovan McNabb, Central Florida's 
Daunte Culpepper and Oregon's Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns director of football operations Dwight Clark has said  
this year's crop of QBs is the deepest he's seen, and Palmer, a 
former quarterbacks coach, thinks as many as six could go in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the Browns could opt for Williams, a bruising runner  
who would continue Cleveland's legacy of great backs in the mold of 
Marion Motley, Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Browns could also trade the top pick.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it would take a ``real lot'' for the Browns to give up  
the pick, Palmer said: ``Define a real lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Palmer took time out on Wednesday to take his first  
inside look at the Browns new lakefront stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful,'' he said, standing outside the glassy, art  
deco main entrance of the 72,000-seat venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Once inside, Palmer and several members of his coaching staff  
were whisked all over the facility, which is now nearly 75 percent 
finished and on target for its July 31 completion date. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for his Browns windbreaker, Palmer, wearing a  
construction hard hat, corduroys and work boots, could have blended 
right in with the many workers still busy readying the Browns' new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Palmer does have a background in building. After  
losing a coaching job when the USFL folded, he served as ``a 
project engineer in charge of safety and quality control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you can motivate the New Jersey union, you can motivate  
anybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he stood on the edge of the field near one end zone, Palmer  
could only laugh as he retold stories of the drafty, dingy but 
somehow charming old Cleveland Stadium, which was razed for the new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember coming up through the dugout and how old it was,  
and how in the locker room you hung up your jacket on a nail and 
stuff like that,'' he said. ``But there was the tradition. Of 
saying to yourself, `How many other guys have walked through this 
locker room?' And that to me is what's so amazing about this 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Holmes has his own memories of the old Cleveland Stadium.  
They aren't fond ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns' new defensive secondary coach, Holmes was  
a member of the New York Jets in 1986 when they lost a 
double-overtime game to the Browns in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the water,'' said Holmes, referring to the puddles  
that were common in the visiting locker room. ``Your socks were 
soaking wet before the game. It was ugly.''

	3 Dead in Kurd Shootout in Berlin  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Three Kurdish protesters were shot and killed  
while trying to occupy the Israeli consulate today. Fourteen other 
people were injured. Officials said the Kurds were angered by news 
reports that Israel's Mossad intelligence agency helped capture 
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Israel has denied involvement 
in Ocalan's capture, but has ordered its diplomatic missions in 
Europe closed. Today's shootout came one day after Ocalan's arrest 
sparked riots and demonstrations throughout Europe. The Israeli 
Foreign Ministry said no Israelis were hurt in the violence. 

</P>
<P>
	Kurdish Rebel Leader Held in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was  
abducted by a team of Turkish commandos dispatched to Nairobi after 
intelligence officials determined he was in hiding in the Kenyan 
capital, news reports said today. The reports were the first 
details of the covert operation to capture Ocalan, who was brought 
to Turkey yesterday to face trial on terrorism charges, which carry 
a possible death penalty.

	Cleric May Be Linked to bin Laden  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- FBI and court documents show that the head of a  
suburban Dallas mosque has a decade-long history of contacts with 
front organizations for Osama bin Laden's international terrorist 
network, The Dallas Morning News reported today. Moataz Al-Hallak, 
imam of the Islamic Society of Arlington mosque, was named on 
telephone and mailing lists for a bin Laden group supporting Afghan 
guerrillas in 1990, the newspaper said.

	Clinton Pushing Social Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is hoping this week to gain  
the upper hand in the debate over how to divide the federal budget 
surplus while saving Social Security. The campaign gears up today 
with satellite-linked town hall meetings aimed at selling young 
people on the president's plan to shore up the retirement system 
and Medicare. Clinton goes to New Hampshire tomorrow to talk about 
tax credit proposals.

	Jackson Wants Shooting Probed  
</P>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson has asked state  
officials to press for a federal investigation into the police 
shooting of Tyisha Miller, a black teen killed as she sat 
unresponsive in her car. Ms. Miller, 19, was shot a dozen times by 
four officers on Dec. 28. Initially, the officers -- three white and 
one Hispanic -- said Ms. Miller fired at them with the handgun, but 
later said she grabbed at the gun after an officer broke a window.

	Milosevic Rejects NATO Troops

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic dealt a blow  
today to prospects for a Kosovo peace deal, rejecting a 
take-it-or-leave-it proposal that foreign troops enforce any 
accord. The Yugoslav president's latest defiance increased chances 
of NATO intervention, with only three days remaining until a 
deadline set by world powers for Serbia and ethnic Albanians to 
reach an agreement at talks in Rambouillet, France.

an interview published in today's Chicago Tribune, Dr. George 
Lundberg said he and his editorial staff endured constant pressure, 
including threats and intimidation, during his 17 years running the

a bitter man last night, giving the cold shoulder to his former 
teammates while getting a warm response from the crowd as the 
Knicks beat the Toronto Raptors 95-85. Oakley, still upset over the 
trade that ended his 10-year career in New York, criticized the 
organization prior to the game and then stood off to the side and 
refused to shake hands with any of the Knicks before the opening 
tipoff.

<HEADLINE> L.A. To Drop 'Geronimo' Pratt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The district attorney today abandoned any  
effort to retry former Black Panther Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt in 
the 1968 slaying of a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt was freed in 1997 after 27 years behind bars when a judge  
ruled that he was denied a fair trial because the star prosecution 
witness concealed the fact that he was a police informant. On 
Tuesday, a California appeals court upheld the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The murder at issue in this case occurred over 30 years ago,''  
District Attorney Gil Garcetti said today. ``Most of the witnesses 
are deceased. There would be no reasonable likelihood of 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcetti stood by his decision to appeal the judge's ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was our job to review the facts,'' Garcetti said. ``What we  
did not find was any new evidence indicating he was innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt's lawyers had said it was time for Garcetti to drop the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took away the best years of his life,'' Johnnie Cochran  
Jr. said Tuesday. ``Hopefully what happened to Geronimo Pratt will 
not happen to any other citizen ever again, in this county or this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt was convicted of being one of two men who robbed and  
fatally shot Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt claimed that he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings  
at the time and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly 
destroyed wiretap evidence that would prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the arrest on a campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI  
against the Black Panthers and other alleged subversives. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Everett Dickey granted Pratt a new trial in  
1997, saying the credibility of prosecution witness Julius Butler -- 
who testified that Pratt had confessed to him -- could have been 
undermined if the jury had known of his relationship with law 
enforcement.

<HEADLINE> 'Life is Beautiful' Makes $21.9M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Getting a boost from seven Oscar nominations,  
Italy's ``Life is Beautiful'' has become the highest-grossing 
foreign-language film ever in North America, earning nearly $21.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of a father who uses humor to shield his son from the  
horrors of a Nazi concentration camp, ``Life is Beautiful'' stars 
Roberto Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax expanded the film to wide release in 644 theaters for  
the four-day Presidents Day weekend. The film grossed more than 
$2.8 million over the holiday weekend, its 17th week in release in 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record-holder was ``Il Postino,'' a 1996  
best-picture nominee also distributed by Miramax, that grossed 
$21.8 million. The dollars are not adjusted for inflation or rises 
in ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of `Life is Beautiful' is unprecedented and it's  
still going strong,'' Miramax co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' received a major push from last week's  
Oscar nominations. The film was nominated for both best picture and 
best foreign-language film. In addition, Benigni was nominated for 
best actor and director and shared an original screenplay 
nomination with co-writer Vincenzo Cerami. Other nominations went 
for editing and dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni became the fourth person in the history of the Oscars to  
be nominated for actor, director and screenwriting for a single 
film, joining Orson Welles for ``Citizen Kane,'' Woody Allen for 
``Annie Hall'' and Warren Beatty for ``Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The success of ``Life is Beautiful'' follows a trend in  
foreign-language films, with audiences and the Academy responding 
most to heart-tugging tales that often involve children, rather 
than the edgier work of Francois Truffaut, Michelangelo Antonioni 
or Federico Fellini of the late 1950s through 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Another popular foreign-language film this year is Brazil's  
``Central Station,'' about an old woman who helps an orphan boy. 
``Central Station'' also received a best foreign language film nod 
and a best actress nomination for Fernanda Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Awards will be presented March 21.

<HEADLINE> Scana Buying Public Service of N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) -- SCANA Corp., which provides electric and  
gas service to customers in South Carolina and Georgia, is buying 
Public Service Co. of North Carolina for about $680 million in cash 
and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that would be created by the deal announced  
Wednesday would have about 1.2 million customers in the Carolinas 
and Georgia and generate combined annual revenue of about $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	SCANA will also assume PSNC debt that will push the total value  
of the deal to about $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the latest in a series of mergers that are reshaping  
the industry as power companies try to protect their profits in the 
face of deregulation and increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination will create a company serving 517,000 electric  
customers in South Carolina and more than 750,000 natural gas 
customers in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, but  
must be approved by state and federal regulators and shareholders 
of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	William B. Timmerman, chairman, president and chief executive of  
SCANA, said the purchase should enable the combined company to grow 
faster than the companies would have separately. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the merger is not expected to have an  
immediate effect on their customers, and isn't expected to boost 
profits until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	SCANA also announced that it is cutting its quarterly dividend  
to 27 1/2 cents a share from 38 1/2 cents starting in its second quarter. 
The company said it needed to bring its dividend payout ratio ``in 
line with that of growth-oriented utilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SCANA's shares dipped 81 1/4 cents to $26 in midmorning trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where PSNC's shares jumped almost 30 
percent, or $6.68 3/4 to $29.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	PSNC would be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of SCANA.  
Charles E. Zeigler Jr., chairman, president and CEO of PSNC, will 
become a director of SCANA and president and chief operating 
officer of the PSNC subsidiary, with responsibility for all North 
Carolina operations, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two additional PSNC directors will be named to the SCANA board.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the transaction, PSNC shareholders would receive cash or  
stock valued at $33 per share, which represents an estimated 45 
percent premium to PSNC's closing price Tuesday of $22.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	PSNC, based in Gastonia, serves 31 North Carolina counties,  
distributing natural gas to about 340,000 customers from the 
Triangle to Asheville. PSNC's operating revenues totaled about $300 
million last year. It employs about 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Columbia, S.C., SCANA generated $1.6 billion in revenue  
last year from businesses including regulated electric and natural 
gas utility operations and telecommunications. It has 4,700 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	SCANA's subsidiaries serve about 517,000 electric customers in  
South Carolina and more than 420,000 natural gas customers in South 
Carolina and Georgia. SCANA also is an investor in 
telecommunications companies with more than 350,000 customers 
across the Southeast.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- William David McElroy, former chancellor of the  
University of California, San Diego, and a scientist who broke new 
ground in figuring out how fireflies light up, died Wednesday of 
respiratory failure. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy took the helm of the UCSD campus in 1972, and served  
until 1980 when he returned to research, writing and teaching 
biology. Under his leadership, the campus research budget went from 
$40 million to more than $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps best known for isolating and crystallizing the  
compounds that allow a firefly to light up. His research in 
bacterial bioluminescence resulted in nearly 200 original 
scientific articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of research led him to conclude that the light gave them  
an advantage in mating. McElroy and his late wife, biochemist 
Marlene DeLuca, were pioneers in the field of bioluminescence. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jeter, Yankees Eye Multiyear Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter's surprising arbitration case is  
barely over, and already baseball people are looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	After just three more seasons, he'll be eligible for free  
agency. Presumably, the Yankees would like to sign the All-Star 
shortstop to a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball's in their court,'' Jeter's agent, Casey Close, said  
Tuesday after his client won a $5 million salary. ``It's an 
organization that has the resources and the opportunity to do 
something special for a special player. They've rolled those dice 
before and found out what happened with Bernie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, Bernie Williams was the last Yankee to go to  
arbitration, winning his case for a $3 million salary in 1996. 
Williams rejected several multiyear offers that he deemed too low, 
went year by year and became a free agent last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly signed with the Boston Red Sox, citing the way he felt  
the Yankees treated him, and stayed with New York only after owner 
George Steinbrenner, in the final hours of talks, increased his 
offer from $50 million for five years to $87.5 million for seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, eligible for arbitration for the first time, made  
$750,000 last year and turned down the Yankees' offer to settle for 
$3.5 million, $300,000 above their arbitration figure. 
</P>
<P>
	He can become a free agent after the 2001 season, but the  
Yankees haven't made any proposals for a long-term deal since he 
rejected a $31 million, five-year offer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek's vital to the ballclub and is a tremendous person,''  
Steinbrenner said after the decision. ``I just hope he's in the 
right frame of mind to get the job done. ... I'm not upset at all -- 
I'm very happy. A little lighter in the purse, but very happy. You 
never like to lose -- show me a gracious loser and I'll show you a 
loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners had won the first five hearings this year, defeating  
Montreal infielder Shane Andrews, Boston outfielder Midre Cummings, 
Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon, Los Angeles shortstop Mark 
Grudzielanek and Detroit outfielder Brian Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets reliever Armando Benitez, scheduled for a hearing  
Tuesday, instead settled for a one-year contract worth $1,987,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez, who made $1.1 million with Baltimore last season, got a  
deal halfway between the $2.4 million he had sought and the 
$1,575,000 the Mets had offered. Benitez, obtained from Baltimore 
during the offseason, was 5-6 with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves for the 
Orioles last season and made $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis left-hander Darren Oliver, 4-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 10  
starts last season, lost his case today and will get $3.55 million 
instead of $4.15 million, arbitrators Richard Bloch, Jerome Ross 
and William H. Holly Jr. ruled. Oliver made $3.05 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four other players remain in arbitration, with hearings  
scheduled to conclude this week. Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera 
was the only player to have a hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, St. Louis signed free agent infielder Shawon  
Dunston to a $500,000, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Close offered to settle the Jeter case before Monday's hearing  
at the midpoint of $4.1 million, but the Yankees refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a call and I was wrong,'' general manager Brian Cashman  
said, adding, ``I cost the company some money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, whose case was decided by arbitrators Nicholas Zumas, Ira  
Jaffe and Gil Vernon, matched Ruben Sierra's 1992 salary with Texas 
as the second-highest ever awarded in arbitration. The only higher 
award is the $5.3 million pitcher Jack McDowell got from the 
Chicago White Sox in 1994 -- when he lost his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with. It's the business side, the ugly part,'' Jeter  
said. ``If you play well on the field, everything will take care of 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter hit .324 last season with 19 homers, 84 RBIs and 30  
steals. He was fifth in the AL in batting average and first in runs 
with 127. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's anyone Steinbrenner is angry at, it probably is  
Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won, I lost,'' Cashman said in Tampa. ``I really think  
our case was strong, and I thought the midpoint was irrelevant. 
Obviously, it's not. It's one of those things where the glass is 
half-empty, half-full.''

<HEADLINE> Researchers: Volcanoes Ruled Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Volcanoes belched up to 10 times more lava onto the surface of  
ancient Mars than previously thought, and the planet may still have 
some fire left in its belly, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of two studies published in Thursday's issue of the  
journal Nature, researchers reported evidence that more than 3.5 
billion years ago, Mars' volcanoes filled one canyon alone with 
enough molten rock to bury the entire United States beneath a fiery 
lake four miles deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence included more than 100 layers of what the  
researchers believe is volcanic rock jutting from the walls of the 
2,400-mile-long Valles Marineris canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like thick stacks of lava and it goes down as far as  
we can see,'' about six miles, said Alfred S. McEwen, a research 
scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	He and colleagues studied photographs obtained by the Mars  
Global Surveyor, a spacecraft that has been orbiting Mars since 
1997 and begins a two-year mission next month to map the entire 
planet in fine detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Their research supports the growing view that Martian volcanoes  
were more important than meteor collisions in shaping the planet's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcanic activity would also help explain why Mars apparently  
had a thick, warm atmosphere early in its history. Volcanoes belch 
carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes the atmosphere to heat 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same journal, scientists from the Planetary Science  
Institute of Tucson reported that based on images radioed back by 
the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars' volcanoes -- one of which looms 14 
miles above its dusty, windswept surface -- may not be finished 
erupting. 
</P>
<P>
	They examined photos of a lava flow in a volcanic crater and  
estimated it formed 40 million to 100 million years ago. The flow 
was marked with relatively few meteor craters, in contrast with 
older flows that were heavily pockmarked. That suggests the flow is 
relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying that there's going to be an eruption in 1999,  
but there may still be dormant areas on Mars with the potential for 
future eruptions,'' said William K. Hartmann, a scientist at the 
Planetary Science Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the research team is analyzing photos that suggest even  
younger flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University  
helping plan NASA's 2001 rover mission to Mars, said he wouldn't be 
surprised if Mars were still volcanic. He noted that the Global 
Surveyor will produce a thermal map showing any surface hot spots.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Rise / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Treasury bonds rose Wednesday as the stock  
market tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 15/32  
point, or $4.69 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.31 percent from 5.34 percent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Money flowed into the relative safety of Treasury bonds as the  
Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.56, or by 1.1 percent, with a 
loss of 95 points in the final hour. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
composite had an even sharper fall, dropping 2.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors often turn to bonds for a haven for their money in a  
turbulent stock market. The bond market has also gained ground in 
recent weeks, as money managers look to take advantage of a rise in 
yields from last year's historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up between 1/16  
point and 3/32 point, and intermediate maturities were up 3/16 
point to 5/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.33 
to 1299.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.51 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from the Treasury auction 
Tuesday to 4.41 percent. Six-month yields were 4.58 percent, as the 
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from the Treasury auction to 
4.43 percent. One-year yields were 4.65 percent as the discount 
fell by 0.04 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bills pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. The weekly 
Treasury bill auction was held on Tuesday because of the Presidents 
Day holiday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 5.13 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 9/32 from 124 15/16 late Tuesday 
The average yield to maturity fell to 5.14 percent from 5.16 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Stieb Retires From baseball Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dave Stieb has retired -- again.  
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old right-hander, who came out of retirement last  
season to rejoin the Toronto Blue Jays, said Wednesday that he's 
leaving major-league baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
	Stieb, who has the lone no-hitter in Blue Jays history, appeared  
in 19 games last season, his first in the majors since retiring in 
1993. Stieb went 1-2 with a 4.83 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was still good enough to earn a minor-league deal and an  
invitation to spring training with the Blue Jays. Stieb would have 
earned $400,000 if made the opening-day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Stieb leaves as Toronto's franchise leader in wins (175),  
innings (2,873), strikeouts (1,658), shutouts (30), complete games 
(103) and starts (403). His career record with the Blue Jays is 
175-134 with a 3.42 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Stieb also played briefly with the Chicago White Sox in 1993  
before retiring.

<HEADLINE> NFL To Add Los Angeles or Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Los Angeles and Houston both lost NFL franchises  
in the past five years. By next month, one of those cities can look 
forward to having a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue anticipates no serious opposition to  
adding a 32nd franchise, setting up a vote when the owners meet in 
Phoenix on March 14-18. The new team could begin play by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general feeling is we should have 32 teams,'' said  
Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, a member of the expansion 
committee that met for nearly four hours Tuesday at an Atlanta 
airport hotel. ``Los Angeles and Houston are both viable markets 
that should be in the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would mark the league's fourth expansion this decade.  
Jacksonville and Carolina joined the NFL in 1995 and the new 
Cleveland Browns begin play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the L.A. and Houston markets have fan interest,  
large populations and television appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very close race,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	There is only one group, headed by Robert McNair, vying for the  
franchise in Houston, and it has a plan for a new retractable-roof 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rival groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise, each with its own stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz has lined up an all-star roster of  
investors, including actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, to build 
a combined stadium and shopping mall in Carson, 21 miles south of 
downtown. Developer Ed Roski Jr. and billionaire Eli Broad are 
proposing to renovate the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders  
returned to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. The Houston Oilers left for Tennessee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the league might assist in the funding of the Los  
Angeles stadium, but the money would go toward one of the plans 
already proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say if the league is committed to picking one of  
the two ownership groups, indicating there is some trepidation 
among the owners about the warring bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two different ownership groups and two different  
stadium plans,'' he said. ``That's something we've got to work 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion decision likely will spawn a whole new set of  
issues, with realignment at the head of the list. Tagliabue said 
the expansion committee discussed various scenarios Tuesday, using 
both Los Angeles and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Realignment is a hot-button issue in a league where Arizona and  
Dallas are part of the NFC East, Atlanta and Carolina are members 
of the NFC West, and the three teams in Florida are spread over 
three separate divisions in both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, the league's finance committee decided it  
needs more information about an $800 million bid by Howard Milstein 
to purchase the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants to ensure that Milstein is not violating the  
rule against borrowing more than $100 million using the team as 
collateral to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving as promptly as we can. It's important to  
Washington and important to the league,'' Tagliabue said. ``But 
it's not as important that we complete this deal today or tomorrow 
as it is to make the right decision for the next quarter-century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Tagliabue also hopes to have a  
decision by the March meeting on whether Edward DeBartolo Jr., 
owner of the San Francisco 49ers, can resume active control of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo ceded day-to-day control to his sister, Denise  
DeBartolo York, when he was targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud 
probe. He pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a felony 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said the NFL is still committed to having the 2003 Super  
Bowl in San Francisco -- if a new stadium is built to replace 3Com 
Park. That issue will be discussed next month as well, with the 
owners having the option of taking away the title game.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Wins FCC Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp.'s plan to take over cable giant TCI  
was approved by federal regulators Wednesday, clearing the way for 
a deal that could provide consumers a new choice for local phone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission imposed no major  
conditions on the deal, which was valued at nearly $32 billion when 
it was announced in June. Based on closing stock prices Wednesday, 
the deal is now valued at about $43.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger holds the promise of cracking open local phone  
monopolies to competition, regulators concluded. Local phone 
competition has focused mostly on high-volume business customers, 
not residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also offers one-stop shopping for local calling,  
Internet access and long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic because the combined resources of AT&AMP;T and TCI  
surely will generate a very substantial effort to expand the 
choices now available to residential phone subscribers,'' said FCC 
Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC did not force AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. to  
provide other companies with access to TCI's high-speed cable TV 
lines. Consumer groups, America Online and others had pressed the 
agency to require AT&AMP;T to give other companies access to those 
lines to offer competing Internet or phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the early stage of deployment of cable's high-speed  
Internet access services, it would be imprudent to act now,'' 
Kennard said. The commission concluded that the merger would not 
harm competition for Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong praised the FCC's action,  
saying the companies' ``look forward to completing the merger 
expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's  
Washington office, contends that ``most consumers won't see 
benefits because the merged company is likely to serve only 
high-end customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, however, he has a commitment from AT&AMP;T to ``offer  
service uniformly in all neighborhoods in every city it serves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of AT&AMP;T and TCI also approved the deal in separate  
meetings Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger plan still must be approved by local cable  
franchising authorities. Some local authorities want to provide 
rivals access to TCI's high-speed lines, but it's unclear if they 
would have the authority to force changes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company and  
biggest provider of mobile phone services. TCI is the nation's 
second-largest cable TV company, with lines that reach one-third of 
U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of TCI's lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet and gain 
access to online data at speeds up to 100 times faster than 
conventional telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. More cable 
agreements are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes  
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional 
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T also will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge extra if customers got Internet 
service over the merged companies' lines and wanted another 
Internet service provider, such as AOL. But the commission did not 
set any conditions on that part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department approved the merger in December on  
condition that TCI sell its interest in a rival mobile phone 
company, Sprint PCS. The FCC reaffirmed that condition in its 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Liberty Media Group will be a wholly owned  
subsidiary of AT&AMP;T. Liberty, TCI's programming arm, has stakes in 
some of America's most popular cable networks, including Discovery, 
Black Entertainment TV and Fox/Liberty Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said federal rules requiring cable network owners to  
make their channels available to rival TV distributors would apply 
to Liberty, something consumer and public interest groups sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AT&AMP;T closed at $84.31 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Shares of the more commonly traded series A stock 
for TCI closed at $64.31 1/4 while shares of the TCI B series stock 
closed at $71.81 1/4 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Is Interim Brit Soccer Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Kevin Keegan, one of the greatest soccer players  
in the 1970s, was hired Wednesday as interim coach of England's 
national team -- but only for four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan says he is not a candidate to be the permanent successor  
to Glenn Hoddle and will complete the remaining 18 months on his 
contract to coach Fulham, a second-division team owned by Mohamed 
Al Fayed, who also owns Harrods department store. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle was fired Feb. 2 following controversial comments about  
the disabled and Howard Wilkinson coached England to a 2-0 loss 
last week against World Cup champion France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin has made his wishes absolutely clear that he wishes to  
complete his contract at Fulham,'' said David Davies, interim 
executive director of The Football Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan, 48, was England's top international star in the 1970s,  
scoring 21 goals in 63 games with the national team. At Liverpool, 
he led the team to its first European Champions Cup title in 1977. 
He later led Hamburg SV to a German Bundesliga championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely delighted,'' Keegan said in a statement. ``I'm  
committed to Fulham, but I believe I can do a successful job for 
England as well. It will be a great thrill to work with everybody 
connected with the national team.''

<HEADLINE> Home Construction at 12-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite icy weather in the Northeast and  
Midwest, construction of new homes jumped 3.8 percent in January to 
a 12-year high, extending the building boom of 1998 into the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started construction of houses and apartments at a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.80 million, the most since 
December 1986, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, they started 1.62 million units, an 11-year high,  
and economists had expected January would mark the start of a 
modest decline during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the conditions that drove homes sales and construction  
in 1998 -- low mortgage rates, plentiful jobs and high stock prices 
-- continued into 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, in January, starts of single-family homes rose 1.2 percent  
to an annual rate of 1.39 million, a 15-year high. Starts of 
apartments shot up 17.1 percent to a rate of 410,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally, the South more than accounted for the national gain.  
Starts there jumped 22.3 percent to a rate of 890,000, the most in 
13 years. They rose 3.7 percent in the West to a rate of 446,000. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they plunged 25.3 percent -- the sharpest decline in  
five years -- to a rate of 316,000 in the Midwest and slipped 3.2 
percent to a rate of 152,000 in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, housing permits -- a barometer of construction plans --  
rose 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.78 
million, the most since July 1986.

<HEADLINE> Panel Told Salt Lake Paid for Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Salt Lake City Olympic bidders paid for ski  
trips for three U.S. Olympic Committee members, a former ski 
official has told a panel investigating corruption in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Peterson, former executive director of the U.S. Skiing  
Association, said Tuesday that he identified one of the members and 
gave information on the other two to an investigation headed by 
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them one name, the location of the trip and the  
amount,'' Peterson said from his Utah home. ``I told them two 
others were involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said the trips occurred in the late 1980s, when Salt  
Lake was trying to win the USOC's approval to bid internationally 
for the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the USOC had a $25 limit on gifts from bid cities.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson spoke as investigators appeared to focus on gifts Salt  
Lake City gave to USOC board members, site selectors and staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from the John Cook, a partner in the law firm of Hogon  
&AMP; Hartson and the USOC's outside counsel, asked hundreds of 
committee representatives to detail any gifts they received from 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you personally receive any gifts or financial advantages  
from any United States bid city or any representatives of a bid 
city that exceeded $25 in value?'' the questionnaire said. 
</P>
<P>
	It then asked eight questions about any gift received, including  
what it was, who gave it, where and when it was received, and 
whether it was reported to the USOC executive director as required 
by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Information gathered by Cook's sweep will be turned over to  
Mitchell and the Justice Department, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission was appointed by the USOC in December  
after it was found that Salt Lake City bidders provided almost a 
half-million dollars in scholarships for sons and daughters of IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	That news has turned into the biggest scandal in Olympic  
history, with nine IOC members expelled or resigning and at least 
13 others under investigation by an internal task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Salt Lake ethics panel detailed more than $1.2  
million in cash, scholarships, travel, medical care and other 
inducements to 24 IOC members during the city's successful bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC picked Salt Lake City in 1989 to bid for the 1998  
Winter Olympics. Those games went to Nagano, Japan, and Salt Lake 
City automatically retained the U.S. designation, winning the 2002 
Games in a landslide four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's panel is examining the USOC's role in that selection  
and preparing recommendations to avoid a recurrence of any 
wrongdoing it finds. It is expected to brief USOC leaders on Feb. 
28 and release its findings the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson was initially reluctant to cooperate with the Mitchell  
investigation, but said he changed his mind because he was 
impressed with the work the inquiry appeared to be doing.

<HEADLINE> French Sailor Rescued Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Giovanni Soldini navigated rough seas  
for nearly 24 hours to save a fellow sailor who capsized in a solo 
around-the-world yacht race. 
</P>
<P>
	As dawn broke Tuesday, Soldini found the yacht PRB, floating  
belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, sailing FILA, picked up a hammer on the third pass and  
threw it at the hull. The thud reached sleeping Frenchwoman 
Isabelle Autissier, who popped out of an escape hatch in the stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Dunning, the Around Alone race coordinator, said Soldini  
``found a needle in a haystack'' when the Italian yachtsman found 
Autissier more than a day after her 60-foot boat capsized in the 
Pacific Ocean between South America and New Zealand, the most 
desolate water on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Autissier is out of danger and out of the race, riding as  
a passenger aboard FILA. 
</P>
<P>
	The daring rescue was a perfect melding of seamanship,  
technology and tenacity, The (Charleston) Post and Courier 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't luck, race director Mark Schrader said. With Soldini,  
it was pure concentration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama began Monday with an electronic scream for help from  
an emergency beacon aboard Autissier's yacht. But when the fax 
arrived at race headquarters in Charleston, race officials weren't 
too concerned because the beacons often malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had already had three false alarms in the race,'' Dunning  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials, however, couldn't contact Autissier. Then they  
learned Autissier's computer system had conked out. That's when 
they began to get nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour later, Dunning got a call from Autissier's shore  
team in France. She had phoned them, saying she was capsized. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway between New Zealand and Cape Horn, the southern tip of  
South America, Autissier was as close to the middle of nowhere as 
you can get. And 40 mph winds were battering the violent stretch of 
40-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials began searching for ships in the area -- anybody  
who could help. It turned out Autissier's only chance would be 
another competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was sailing farther north than Autissier and leg leader  
Marc Thiercelin. The Italian skipper thought the weather to the 
south was too violent and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin was only 34 miles ahead of Autissier, but his boat,  
SOMEWHERE, had a busted boom and he didn't think it could turn and 
sail into the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Thiercelin was closer, Soldini could get there  
quicker than the Frenchman fighting against head winds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tense time for Schrader, who has lost a sailor on this  
leg of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just my nightmare,'' Schrader said. ``Losing Harry  
Mitchell four years ago, I didn't want to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, 200 miles to the north, didn't hesitate: ``I have 30  
knots of wind, and I'm not letting up until I have found Isa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini's white, arrowhead-shaped yacht crashed through 30-foot  
waves at a furious pace, averaging nearly 20 mph for hours at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	His course took him into a vicious Southern Ocean storm that  
whirled clockwise. And as Soldini neared Autissier's position, the 
winds shifted like the sweep hand of a clock. 
</P>
<P>
	When Soldini spotted PRB, there was no sign of Autissier.  
</P>
<P>
	Capsized, PRB still had its keel, pointing skyward like a  
stubby, flat mast. The wide, white hull looked like a whale's 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini sailed as close as he dared, turned around and sailed  
back. Then he threw the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside PRB's hull, Autissier had been asleep -- conserving energy  
and batteries. She hadn't expected a rescue so soon. The hammer was 
like an alarm clock. Autissier got up and made her way to the 
escape hatch, where she had a life raft waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	When she saw FILA, she got in and cast off from her yacht,  
drifting downwind so Soldini could pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 10 minutes after Soldini spotted PRB, he had Autissier  
on board. He sent a short, understated message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, this is FILA. Isabelle is on board with me, everything  
is OK. We are going to take Isa and go back in the race. Ciao, 
Gio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday afternoon, they were joking with race officials about  
being low on wine and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Autissier will continue on as a passenger.  
</P>
<P>
	When Soldini arrives in Punta del Este, Uruguay, he will be  
given time credit for the time he spent rescuing her -- probably 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no penalty for having Autissier on board. She just  
can't help him sail. As for the future, ``I'm going to take myself 
a nice cruise,'' Autissier told her shore crew.

<HEADLINE> Whitaker Says He's Ready To Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker was surprised to see his friend  
Terronn Millett at a news conference in Madison Square Garden, and 
wanted to know what he's doing there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fighting Vince Phillips (for Phillips' junior welterweight  
title), Millett said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know the undercard was that good,'' Whitaker replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The main event isn't bad either -- the 35-year-old Whitaker  
challenging 26-year-old Felix Trinidad of Puerto Rico for the IBF 
welterweight championship Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an intriguing fight. The unbeaten Trinidad hasn't been in a  
tough fight in the last few years, and Whitaker, a champion in some 
division from 1984 to 1997, could be slowed by age and drug and 
alcohol problems and a layoff of 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker won't talk about the problems that kept him out of the  
ring in 1998, and he shrugs off a layoff of 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than delighted to be 35 years old, but I'm going to  
give a 21-year-old performance,'' Whitaker said. ``I'm looking 
forward to getting into the middle of the ring in the Garden and 
seeing those lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Whitaker performed under the Garden lights was  
Nov. 15, 1984, when he stopped Farrain Commeaux in the second round 
of a scheduled six-round lightweight bout on a card that featured 
several members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Whitaker fought in the Garden, he won the WBC  
welterweight title by outpointing James ``Buddy''' McGirt on March 
6, 1993. Whitaker also has held the WBC, WBA and IBF lightweight, 
IBF junior welterweight and WBA junior middleweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad barely broke a sweat in his only Garden appearance. He  
stopped Troy Waters of Australia in the first round Aug. 27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad has fought only once since, knocking out Mahenge Zulu  
in the fourth round last April 3 in Puerto Rico. The reason for his 
inactivity was he was tied up in litigation with promoter Don King. 
Trinidad lost in curt and then signed a $42.9 million multifight 
contract with King. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad doesn't feel the layoff will have any affect on his  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, who lost the WBC 147-pound title on a controversial  
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997, last fought when he 
outpointed Andre Pestriaev in a 12-round welterweight bout Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker tested positive for cocaine after that fight and  
underwent drug and alcohol rehabilitation in 1998 when he tested 
positive in a random drug test and also was convicted of reckless 
driving, for which he got a suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Whitaker, Trinidad said through an interpreter, ``He's a  
little bit slower, but he's strong and he has experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker has beaten good fighters such as McGirt, Jose Luis  
Ramirez, Roger Mayweather, Azumah Nelson and got a draw with Julio 
Cesar Chavez in a fight he seemingly dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not fighting Ramirez or Chavez, he's fighting Felix  
``Tito'' Trinidad,'' the unbeaten champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be carried on HBO following a rebroadcast of WBC  
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya's split-decision win over 
Ike Quartey last Saturday. The telecast will begin at 9:30 p.m. 
EST.

<HEADLINE> Woman Testifies on Dragging Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A former girlfriend of murder defendant  
John William King testified Wednesday she saw him and two 
companions drive off in the gray pickup truck that allegedly was 
used later that night to drag a black man to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Keisha Adkins, 21, said she saw the men leave about 1:30 a.m. on  
June 7. Prosecutors say that about an hour later, 49-year-old James 
Byrd Jr. was chained to the truck and dragged nearly three miles 
until his body was torn to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a white 24-year-old unemployed laborer, could get the  
death penalty if convicted. Two other white men, Lawrence Russell 
Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen Berry, 23, also are charged in the 
crime and will be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I remember right, Shawn was driving, Russell was in the  
middle and Bill was on the passenger side,'' Ms. Adkins said, 
referring to King. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness also has linked the pickup to Byrd's death. The  
truck was identified as belonging to Berry. Prosecutors also have 
said traces of Byrd's blood have been found on the truck, and on 
sandals worn by King. 
</P>
<P>
	Color photographs of dozens of intricate racist, satanic and  
neo-Nazi tattoos on King's body were shown to the jury later 
Wednesday. Authorities said King is a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look closely there's a tree branch and a man hanging  
from the tree,'' Jasper police Detective Rich Ford said of the 
tattoos. ``It appears to be a black man hanging from a tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were shown photographs of some similar tattoos worn by  
the two other men. 
</P>
<P>
	King's other tattoos include Nazi-type SS lightning bolts, an  
upside-down satanic star known as a baphomet on the back of his 
head, a large patch of the Confederate Knights of America, a white 
supremacist group, underlined with a bold ``Aryan Pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorneys objected to the tattoo photos, saying the art  
was constitutionally protected as freedom of expression. State 
District Judge Joe Bob Golden overruled the objection. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said the tattoos, along with racist  
correspondence, will show him to be a man of hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tattoos speak for themselves,'' District Attorney Guy  
James Gray said. ``It's proof -- state of mind, hate, anger -- the 
kind of thing in somebody's mind it takes to commit this kind of 
act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But King's attorney, Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, said the tattoos  
prove little. ``I don't think just the tattoos themselves make him 
a racist,'' Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins, who is married, said she has known King for nearly a  
decade and once had romantic feelings for him. She said he invited 
her to his Jasper apartment the night of June 6-7 and she spent 
about three hours with him before leaving around 1:30 a.m. She said 
the three men also left the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said that King carried out the crime because he  
wanted something ``dramatic'' to help recruit members for a white 
supremacist group he was organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins testified there was no talk of race during her visit  
to King's apartment.

<HEADLINE>  Simpson Memorabilia Set on Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson memorabilia went up in flames to  
a chorus of cheers and boos Wednesday, a day after it was sold at 
auction to help pay off the $33.5 million judgment he owes in the 
deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two No. 32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of  
Fame induction certificate were burned and two trophies were 
smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building in a protest organized 
by a Christian radio talk show host who purchased $16,000 worth of 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction Tuesday raised $430,000, including $255,500 for  
Simpson's Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are destroying O.J. Simpson's property in front of the L.A.  
courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying 
justice before our very eyes,'' protest organizer Bob Enyart of 
Denver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The destruction was criticized by some spectators at the  
downtown courthouse and by Simpson, who said it was a waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder about the mentality involved in this,'' Simpson said  
in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``The guy's 
burning up $16,000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with 
cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred spectators booed and cheered at the destruction  
of the items, which included jerseys from the University of 
Southern California and the National Football League's Buffalo 
Bills and two 1973 ``Lifesaver'' trophies apparently given for 
charity contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman was the auction's big item and was not part of  
Wednesday's demonstration. The winning bid of $255,500 came from an 
anonymous East Coast collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by the court-ordered auction goes to the estate of  
Ms. Simpson and Ronald Goldman's family. A jury made the award in a 
wrongful death lawsuit that followed Simpson's acquittal on 
criminal charges in the 1994 killings. Simpson is appealing the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also auctioned off were football awards, artwork, Tiffany-style  
lamps and a fox fur coat that belonged to Simpson's first wife, 
Marguerite. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices surprised some collectors because Simpson sports  
memorabilia hasn't been selling well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to have anything to do with O.J.  
Simpson. There's a real sour taste in their mouths,'' said Scott 
Welkowsky, owner of Out of This World Memorabilia in Orange County.

<HEADLINE> Graoms Fall; Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures fell and soybean futures were mixed  
in early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a 
continued response to weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in wheat and corn futures was relatively small, though,  
in comparison to Tuesday, when investors ignored reports that Egypt 
was purchasing 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat. Investors also 
were keeping tabs as the dollar rose late Tuesday against the 
Japanese yen and British pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in grain futures prices appeared to be curtailed a bit  
today, however, as the dollar was mixed against major currencies in 
European trading. Gold prices also were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite reports of a near-record soybean crop in Brazil -- which  
would compete with U.S. growers' crops -- March soybean futures held 
their own after falling 4 cents Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for March delivery fell 1 3/4 cents  
to $2.50 1/2 a bushel; March corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.13 1/2 a bushel; 
March oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.00 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans were up 1/2 
cent to $4.88 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and live hog futures fell early today on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. Pork belly futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .75 cent to 66.82 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .72 cent to 73.90 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .27 cent to 45.15 cents a pound; March pork bellies were up 
.15 cent to 55.25 cents a pound.

cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred spectators booed and cheered at the destruction  
of the items, which included jerseys from the University of 
Southern California and the National Football League's Buffalo 
Bills and two 1973 ``Lifesaver'' trophies apparently given for 
charity contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman was the auction's big item and was not part of  
Wednesday's demonstration. The winning bid of $255,500 came from an 
anonymous East Coast collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by the court-ordered auction goes to the estate of  
Ms. Simpson and Ronald Goldman's family. A jury made the award in a 
wrongful death lawsuit that followed Simpson's acquittal on 
criminal charges in the 1994 killings. Simpson is appealing the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also auctioned off were football awards, artwork, Tiffany-style  
lamps and a fox fur coat that belonged to Simpson's first wife, 
Marguerite. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices surprised some collectors because Simpson sports  
memorabilia hasn't been selling well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to have anything to do with O.J.  
Simpson. There's a real sour taste in their mouths,'' said Scott 
Welkowsky, owner of Out of This World Memorabilia in Orange County.

<HEADLINE> Ulcer Drug Is World's Top Seller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Impotence drug Viagra may garner more press, but  
it has a ways to go before it surpasses the success of ulcer drug 
Prilosec. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Prilosec became the pharmaceutical industry's first $5  
billion prescription medication. In contrast, Viagra had sales of 
only $788 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prilosec sales rose 27 percent in 1998 to $5.14 billion, Swedish  
drugmaker Astra AB said Tuesday. From 1993 until last July, Astra 
shared half of its U.S. sales with drug giant Merck &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Prilosec, also commonly used for heartburn, has been the world's  
top selling drug since 1996, when it overtook another popular ulcer 
drug, Zantac. 
</P>
<P>
	Prilosec beat out the No. 2 drug, Zocor, by more than $1.1  
billion in 1998. Zocor, a cholesterol drug made by Merck, had 
worldwide sales of $3.95 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In third place was Prozac, the antidepressant sold by Eli Lilly  
and Co., which had $2.81 billion in worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures come from the companies' year-end financial reports.  
</P>
<P>
	A blockbuster drug is considered one with annual worldwide sales  
exceeding $1 billion. About 25 drugs surpassed that mark last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Astra officials say a new direct-to-consumer advertising  
campaign and a larger sales force helped boost sales of Prilosec, 
which is known as Losec outside the United States. The company has 
also convinced doctors to use Prilosec on a variety of 
gastrointestinal disorders in addition to ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Prilosec works better and quicker than other ulcer  
and heartburn medications. The drug is aimed at a huge market -- 
more than 21 million people experience heartburn in the United 
States alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patient population is enormous and it's an easy drug to  
use,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. It is 
also a drug that users must take everyday, usually for months at a 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Prilosec's days as the world's top-selling  
medication are numbered. The drug loses its U.S. patent in 2001, 
paving the way for a rival company to make a cheaper, generic form. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Abbott Laboratories has a rival drug already on the market  
called Prevacid, and American Home Products has Protonix awaiting 
approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts believe that cholesterol drug Lipitor, marketed by  
Warner Lambert and Pfizer, could top them all, with sales expected 
to surpass $6 billion in 2002. Lipitor had $2.2 billion in sales 
last year, making it the sixth best-selling drug.

<HEADLINE> Trading Suspended for 3 Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators on Wednesday  
suspended trading in shares of three small companies until March 2. 
A regulator said the companies appeared to be linked. 
</P>
<P>
	In three separate announcements made at the same time, the  
Securities and Exchange Commission said it took the actions because 
of questions about the accuracy of the companies' public 
statements. The SEC described the three -- Shebolt International 
Inc., Redwing Inc. and CPR Corp. -- as shell companies based in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, in separate filings with the National Association  
of Securities Dealers, gave the same office address in Las Vegas as 
their headquarters and listed several of the same people as company 
officers and directors, said Cliff Hyatt, branch chief of the SEC's 
enforcement division in its Pacific Region. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hyatt would neither confirm nor deny that an  
investigation of the companies was under way, it is generally 
assumed when such trading suspensions are imposed that the 
regulators are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The trading halts are standard 10-day suspensions, and will  
continue through 11:59 p.m. EST on March 2. At that time the 
stocks, unless they're subject to a further suspension, can resume 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In its announcements, the SEC said Shebolt had claimed to have  
acquired certain unnamed electronic and software companies, while 
Redwing had claimed to have bought unnamed banking companies and 
CPR had said it had bought unspecified engineering and automotive 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Press releases issued separately from London by the three  
companies on Jan. 15, which were written in similar formats, said 
the acquired companies had combined assets or net worth of tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no telephone listings in Las Vegas for the companies,  
and efforts to reach their officials for comment Wednesday were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the market watchdog agency suspended trading in  
shares of another six small companies until Feb. 11. The unusually 
high number of trading halts in one day fueled speculation that the 
companies are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	The shares of Shebolt, Redwing and CPR are traded on the  
National Association of Securities Dealers' OTC Bulletin Board, an 
electronic trading system for small stocks that are thinly traded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Stock Market runs the Bulletin Board, but stocks  
carried there are not actually listed on the Nasdaq market because 
they don't meet Nasdaq listing standards or don't file disclosure 
statements with the SEC. A recent change will tighten disclosure 
requirements for companies seeking Bulletin Board listings of their 
stocks.

<HEADLINE> La. Clinics Sue To Stop Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Abortion clinics and doctors sued Gov. Mike  
Foster on Wednesday to block his order to inspect abortion clinics, 
tattoo parlors and body-piercing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster on Feb. 5 signed an emergency order allowing the surprise  
inspections. That same day a Baton Rouge television station 
reported allegations in a lawsuit that a clinic was dirty and 
unsafe. Inspectors found no problems at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster later amended the order to allow the inspections only  
after complaints are filed against the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the measure is aimed at the state's five abortion  
clinics, all of which are represented in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Foster's order unfairly singles out abortion from all  
other health care and places unjustifiable burdens on abortion 
providers,'' said Priscilla Smith, an attorney with The Center for 
Reproductive Law and Policy that is representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said his executive order wasn't meant as an attack on  
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pro-life, but that's not what this is about,'' Foster said  
in a statement. ``It's about a response to a story that portrayed 
some unsanitary conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends the order allows searches without probable  
cause, warrant or consent, and without any way to ensure that 
medical records and the doctor-patient relationship remain 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants with Foster were state Health Secretary  
David Hood, and Jimmy Guidry, assistant secretary for public 
health.

<HEADLINE> TWA Has Loss; Plans Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines will cut about 1,000 jobs  
and may make other cost-cutting moves this year, following a 10th 
straight year of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based carrier reported Wednesday that it lost  
$79.1 million in the quarter ending Dec. 31, bringing losses for 
the year to $120.5 million. TWA hasn't had a profitable year since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not satisfied until we are earning consistent and  
reasonable profits,'' TWA chairman and chief executive Gerald 
Gitner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was Wall Street. TWA shares were off 43 3/4 cents at $5.50  
in afternoon trading on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will eliminate about 1,000 of its 21,200 jobs this  
year, mostly through attrition and voluntary severance, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, TWA will consider other cost-cutting moves, such as  
closing additional facilities, chief financial officer Michael 
Palumbo said. No details were provided on what facilities might be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA blamed a big chunk of the fourth-quarter loss -- $42.6  
million -- on special charges: $25 million to retire outdated 727s 
and DC9s; and $17.6 million to restructure operations in Israel, 
Italy and elsewhere, and to close its Los Angeles reservations 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealing with these issues is neither easy nor inexpensive,''  
Gitner said. ``However, it is something that must be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA was also hurt by a series of job actions last year,  
including a Christmastime ``sickout'' by flight attendants upset 
over stalled contract talks. The sickout forced dozens of flight 
cancellations. Officials would not speculate on how much money the 
company lost as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks with the International Association of Machinists,  
which represents the flight attendants, are expected to resume next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly loss amounted to $1.30 a share and compared to a  
loss of $31.2 million, or 62 cents a share, in the fourth quarter 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Before extraordinary items, TWA lost 62 cents per share for the  
quarter. That was slightly better than analysts had projected. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, TWA's loss amounted to $2.35 per share. Last year,  
TWA lost $110.8 million, or $2.37 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But Juli Niemann of Huntleigh Securities in St. Louis said TWA's  
performance was cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem we're facing with TWA is these are the  
best of times with airlines and they can't make any money,'' 
Niemann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $747.1 million,  
down from $812.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, revenue decreased to $3.26 billion from $3.33  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA received nine new aircraft in 1998 and finalized orders for  
37 more for this year. The airline also announced plans for 
delivery beginning in 2000 of 125 Boeing and Airbus planes, with 
options for 125 more. 
</P>
<P>
	Gitner said that while financial results were disappointing, the  
company finished first among the major airlines in on-time 
performance as ranked by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The 
airline also reached agreement with pilots and Teamsters on new 
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Donald O'Connor Is Off Ventilator </HEADLINE>

	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Song-and-dance man Donald O'Connor  
was removed from a ventilator nearly three weeks after he was 
hospitalized for pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to his wife and she says he's doing much better and  
they are all very optimistic,'' O'Connor publicist Glenn Rose said

Medical Center on Jan. 30. He was removed from the ventilator on 
Sunday. There was no indication when he will be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's in any hurry until he feels strong  
enough,'' Rose said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Pederson for $4.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Doug Pederson, who has never started an NFL game and at times  
has been a third-stringer, parlayed that undistinguished resume 
into a $4.5 million contract and, perhaps, a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, 31, with only 32 regular-season passes in a career  
that began in 1992 -- as a practice squad member in Miami -- signed 
the three-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday. New 
Eagles coach Andy Reid believes Pederson could be his starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very smart individual who has size, and that helps,''  
said Reid, Green Bay's quarterbacks coach before being hired by the 
Eagles. ``He also has the physical ability to run and throw the 
ball. He's been able to study the West Coast offense for the last 
three years, so he knows the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also seems to have beaten the system. A perennial backup,  
Pederson spent the last four seasons as Brett Favre's backup, which 
meant rarely getting onto the field, never in tight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Eagles think he will be a vast improvement on Koy  
Detmer, Rodney Peete and Bobby Hoying, who quarterbacked the team 
to a league-low offensive ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around enough to know that it's a game about  
winning, and I want to win. That reaction is fine,'' Pederson said 
of those who question his credentials. ``I guess that's part of the 
history of Doug Pederson. I've been a backup to Dan Marino, I've 
been a backup to Brett Favre. This is my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not Steve Atwater's time. Or Cornelius Bennett's. Or Chris  
Calloway's. 
</P>
<P>
	All three veterans were released Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, 32, who played safety in three Super Bowls and eight  
Pro Bowls, was not stunned by being cut -- he sat out most passing 
downs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is a big shock to me,'' said Atwater, one  
of the best tacklers at safety in the game. ``When they were taking 
me out of games, that said something right there. They had needs to 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but great things to say about my time in  
Denver. It was 10 great seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver needed salary cap room, so Atwater was released one day  
after Denver signed cornerback Dale Carter to a six-year, $38 
million contract with an $8 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a linebacker for the Buffalo Bills in all four of their  
Super Bowl defeats in the early 1990s, helped Atlanta get to the 
NFL title game in January. The Falcons lost to the Broncos 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Pro Bowler led the Falcons in tackles, but he is  
33 and would earn $3.7 million for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also want to make room for last year's top draft  
pick, Keith Brooking, who played regularly in passing situations at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also released offensive lineman Dave Widell. Falcons  
safety Devin Bush signed a four-year contract with the St. Louis 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway, 30, would have earned just over $1 million this  
season, including a $500,000 roster bonus due on March 1. A starter 
since 1993, Calloway had 62 receptions for 812 yards and six 
touchdowns this season, all team highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my two years here, this was the toughest move I've had to  
make,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``We've improved the quality 
and the depth at the receiving position. That, along with the 
salary cap, forced us to go in this direction. Chris is a true 
professional and I wish him nothing but the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Middle linebacker Corey Widmer signed an $11.2 million,  
four-year deal to stay with the Giants. Widmer became a starter in 
1996, and last season he finished with 85 tackles, a fumble 
recovery and five passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets declined to match Jacksonville's $14.4 million  
five-year offer to tight end Kyle Brady. The contract calls for a 
$4 million bonus and a salary cap hit of only $1.3 million next 
season, but the Jets opted to sign Eric Green away from Baltimore 
and let Brady go. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Clyde Simmons, whose 114 career sacks are 10th in  
NFL history, signed a two-year, $4 million deal with Chicago. 
Simmons, 35, started all 16 games for the Cincinnati Bengals in 
1998 and finished with five sacks, second-best on the team, and 30 
tackles. He made the Pro Bowl twice with Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bears stepped up to the front and showed they wanted me  
here now,'' Simmons said. ``So that's why I'm here.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors May Be Key to Bioterrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Imagine a truck driving by a football  
stadium during a game. It sprays a mist that drifts over the 
stadium. Nobody notices. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, hundreds show up with sniffles and fevers that  
doctors believe is the flu. But five days later 300 people are dead 
before a local scientist figures out it's not flu, it's an attack 
of anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	That scenario is fictional, but it could happen, say  
bioterrorism experts at Johns Hopkins University, who gathered 
1,000 health and terrorism officials Tuesday to discuss possible 
ways to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	It will fall to doctors -- not the military or police -- to  
recognize a bioterrorist attack and react in time to save lives, 
experts said at the conference. But the nation isn't yet ready, 
said Dr. D.A. Henderson, who led the world's eradication of 
smallpox and now is mobilizing health workers against bioterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``To remain unprepared is to invite disaster,'' Henderson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Don't panic, other experts stressed. A huge bioterrorist attack  
such as the anthrax scenario is unlikely -- particularly because few 
terrorists have the expertise or equipment to spray germs over 
large areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the threat is real, said Col. Gerald Parker of the U.S.  
Army Medical Research Institute on Infectious Diseases. At least 
five countries that sponsor terrorism have bioweapon capabilities. 
The greatest casualties would come from anthrax or smallpox, spread 
in a way that many people could inhale the germs without knowing 
it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More likely is a small attack, said former National Security  
Council member Jessica Stern. Americans already have experienced 
one: In 1985, a cult poisoned Oregon salad bars with salmonella, 
making 750 people sick. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for either, the Department of Health and Human  
Services is spending $158 million this year and is asking Congress 
for $230 million next year, Secretary Donna Shalala said at the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the nation needs a stockpile of vaccines and treatments  
that communities could access quickly, Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, antibiotics can prevent anthrax if given soon after  
exposure, but an attack could mean that hospitals have to ration. 
The world hasn't vaccinated against smallpox in years, and there's 
only enough vaccine left for 6 million people and no factories to 
make more. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also is working to improve disease surveillance,  
where local doctors learn to watch for and report unusual symptoms, 
thus catching outbreaks early. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not be afraid, but we must be aware,'' Shalala said.  
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, the most feared germ weapons program has been Iraq's.  
</P>
<P>
	But the Japanese cult that released the nerve gas sarin in a  
Tokyo subway in 1995 attempted bioterrorism first, said terrorism 
expert Kyle Olson of Research Planning Inc. Four times before the 
nerve gas attack, the cult tried releasing botulism toxin and 
anthrax in different places, but the attempts failed, Olson said. 
Cult members also traveled to Zaire in a failed search for Ebola 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	And nobody knows what has happened to the former Soviet Union's  
vast stockpiles of weaponized germs, including smallpox, said 
Christopher Davis of ORAQ Consultancy, who investigated Soviet 
bioweapons for Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	But terrorists don't have to dispense germs to cause terror,  
Stern said, pointing to a spate of anthrax hoaxes starting last 
year that have so far affected more than 5,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical case: An abortion clinic opens a letter mixed with  
powder that says, ``You have just been exposed to anthrax.'' The 
local fire department gives decontamination showers to everyone in 
the clinic, and hospitals dole out antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	All the threats so far have been hoaxes, but investigating can  
cost up to $100,000 and repeated false alarms mean some cities 
don't take the threats seriously any more, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the 'cry wolf syndrome,''' he said. ``The danger,  
obviously, is we're going to miss something.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Foreign Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Foreign citizens have no right to be told  
they could be deported when they plead guilty to misdemeanors, 
though it would be a good idea to tell them, a court ruled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stems from  
an El Paso woman's claim that she would not have pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor shoplifting in 1994 had she known it could result in 
her being deported. 
</P>
<P>
	That plea, coupled with a prior felony conviction, made Patricia  
Jimenez, a Mexican citizen, eligible to be kicked out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jimenez was a resident alien who had lived in the United  
States for 10 years and had four children who are American citizens 
when she filed her appeal in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She was facing a deportation hearing at the time, according to  
court records. 
</P>
<P>
	After a trial court and appeals court ruled in her favor, the  
state asked the Criminal Court of Appeals to decide if defendants 
have a right to be informed of possible deportation after a 
misdemeanor guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	State laws only require officials to tell an alien defendant  
that a felony guilty plea could result in deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled the same requirements don't exist for  
misdemeanor cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The better practice may be to admonish all defendants as to

<HEADLINE> ABC Showed Less of Clinton Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Regular viewers of ABC's ``World News Tonight''  
heard less about Monica Lewinsky than people who watched NBC and 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC broadcast gave two hours less air time to Lewinsky than  
NBC and CBS evening news programs from when the sex scandal broke 
to President Clinton's acquittal in his impeachment trial last 
week, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' logged 826 minutes on the scandal, the  
``CBS Evening News'' 820 minutes and ``World New Tonight'' 699 
minutes, according to the Tyndall Report, a newsletter than 
monitors the shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC spent the fewest minutes on the scandal during 10 of the 14  
months it was in the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Friedman, executive producer of ``World News Tonight,''  
said the disparity surprised him because ABC made no conscious 
decision to underplay the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I'm not particularly concerned because I think  
our coverage was quite good,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage for all networks was heaviest in September, when  
Kenneth Starr's report was released and video of Clinton's grand 
jury appearance was broadcast. The day the president was acquitted 
didn't even make it to the top eight nights of Clinton-Lewinsky 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like not only had the general public decided that  
not much was at stake and Clinton was not going to be removed, the 
TV networks had decided it, too,'' said Andrew Tyndall, president 
of ADT Research. 
</P>
<P>
	In 56 weeks, the Lewinsky story logged 2,345 minutes of air  
time, or 19 minutes less than the networks devoted to the O.J. 
Simpson case between the murders and his acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gulf War remains the most heavily covered story of the  
decade on the evening news.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Pederson To Be New QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles signed free agent  
Doug Pederson to a $4.5 million, three-year contract on Wednesday 
to be the starting quarterback for the NFL's worst offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, 31, has never started an NFL game and had thrown just  
32 regular-season passes in the league during a career that began 
in 1992 on the Dolphins' practice squad. He has been Brett Favre's 
backup the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very smart individual who has size and that helps,''  
said Eagles coach Andy Reid, who was Green Bay's quarterbacks coach 
before being hired by the Eagles. ``He also has the physical 
ability to run and throw the ball. He's been able to study the West 
Coast offense for the last three years, so he knows the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson will be called upon to resuscitate an offense that  
scored only 161 points last season, 80 fewer than the next worst 
team. The Eagles went through three quarterbacks -- Bobby Hoying, 
Rodney Peete and Koy Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step,'' Pederson said. ``You can't turn away from  
that. But I'm ready. I'm willing to take that step,'' Pederson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, undrafted after throwing 33 touchdowns and 41  
interceptions at Northeast Louisiana, had his most active year in 
1998. He completed 14 of 24 passes, including 10 of 16 for 128 
yards and two touchdowns in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around enough to know that it's a game about winning  
and I want to win. That reaction (from the fans) is fine,'' 
Pederson said. ``I guess that's part of the history of Doug 
Pederson. I've been a backup to Dan Marino, I've been a backup to 
Brett Favre. This is my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said the signing would not impact the team's strategy for  
the NFL Draft, which begins April 17. The Eagles, many believe, 
will use high draft pick on a quarterback.

<HEADLINE> Whitaker Says His Age Won't Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker turned pro in Madison Square  
Garden a little more than 14 years ago. On Saturday night, he will 
fight in the famed arena again, ready to show his career is not at 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than delighted to be 35 years old, but I'm going to  
give a 21-year-old performance,'' Whitaker said Wednesday at the 
final news conference leading to his bout with unbeaten IBF 
champion Felix Trinidad. ``I'm looking forward to getting into the 
middle of ring in the Garden and seeing those lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Whitaker performed under the Garden lights was  
Nov. 15, 1984. He stopped Farrain Commeaux in the second round of a 
scheduled six-round lightweight bout on a card that featured 
several members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Whitaker fought in the Garden he won the WBC  
welterweight title by outpointing James ``Buddy'' McGirt on March 
6, 1993. Whitaker also has held the WBC, WBA IBF lightweight, IBF 
junior welterweight and WBA junior middleweight titles. He has been 
a champion every year from 1984 until 1998, when he didn't fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, a 26-year-old Puerto Rican, barely broke a sweat in  
his only Garden appearance. He stopped Troy Waters of Australia in 
the first round Aug. 27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad fought only once since -- knocking out Mahenge Zulu in  
the fourth round last April 3 in Puerto Rico -- because of 
litigation with promoter Don King. Trinidad lost in court and 
signed a $42.9 million multifight contract with King. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad doesn't think the layoff will affect his performance. A  
bigger question concerns Whitaker's 16 months of inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, who lost the WBC 147-pound title on controversial  
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997, last fought when he 
outpointed Andre Pestriaev in a 12-round welterweight bout Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker tested positive for cocaine after that fight. He  
underwent drug and alcohol rehabilitation in 1998 when he tested 
positive in a random drug test and also was convicted of reckless 
driving for which he received a suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He will not discuss his out-of-ring problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is Trinidad's most prominent opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit slower, but he's strong and he has  
experience,'' Trinidad said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker has beaten such fighters as McGirt, Jose Luis Ramirez,  
Roger Mayweather, Azumah Nelson and got a draw with Julio Cesar 
Chavez in fight he seemingly dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not fighting Ramirez or Chavez -- he's fighting Felix  
``Tito'' Trinidad,'' the champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be carried on HBO following a tape of WBC  
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya's split-decision win over 
Ike Quartey last Saturday. The telecast will begin at 9:30 p.m. 
EST.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Moves To Increase Oil Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in a week, the government  
took steps Wednesday to increase the amount of oil in its emergency 
reserve, hoping also to help the ailing petroleum industry reduce 
supplies on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department announced it will allow companies to store  
as much as 70 million barrels of oil in its underground reserve for 
a year or more in return for some of the oil as a storage fee. 
</P>
<P>
	With prices severely depressed, the opportunity to remove even  
modest amounts of oil from the market for a year might be 
attractive to some companies that are betting prices might rebound 
in the future, industry analysts suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also said the amount involved is not enough to  
significantly affect prices, especially at a time when inventories 
are high. Worldwide oil prices are at a 12-year low. Oil sold on 
the spot market Wednesday at $11.59 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said opening the Strategic  
Petroleum Reserve on the Texas-Louisiana coast for private storage 
is ``a unique opportunity ... to add to our energy security'' at a 
time when private storage space is hard to find and prices are 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks  
at the end of January were at 330.2 million barrels, up almost 3 
percent from the previous month. About 19 million barrels of oil 
are consumed daily in the United States, according to the API. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil stored temporarily in the reserve would remain the  
property of the commercial owner, but some of it would be turned 
over to the government in lieu of a fee and become part of the 
reserve's permanent inventory, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently has 561 million  
barrels of government-owned oil that can be used in case of an 
emergency. The reserve has a capacity of 680 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Richardson announced the planned purchase of 28  
million barrels of oil for the reserve from federal leases in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Instead of cash, the government would forgo 
royalties up to the value of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of opening some of the emergency reserve to private  
storage is not new. 
</P>
<P>
	The government offered a six-month storage plan last year, but  
found few companies interested. This time ``we've gotten a lot of 
inquiries,'' said Energy Department spokesman Tom Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	The department set a March 10 deadlines for offers and said it  
could receive oil at a rate of 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day at 
its Big Hill storage site south of Beaumont, Texas. The oil must be 
stored in six empty caverns at Big Hill for at least a year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the interest is expected to come from smaller producers,  
mainly independents, and not from the large multinational 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't detect any urgent bells going off,'' said Chris  
Kelley, a spokesman at the American Petroleum Institute, which 
represents the major oil companies. ``But we're encouraged by the 
administration's latest attempt to think of the oil and natural gas 
industry in a positive light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been criticized by some members of  
Congress from oil states for not doing more to help the depressed 
domestic oil industry. Last month alone, 11,500 oil industry 
workers lost their jobs, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The government doesn't predict any substantial price rebound  
anytime soon. Prices could be depressed well into the next decade 
and not likely exceed $14 a barrel until after 2000, the Energy 
Information Administration predicted recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related action, the Energy Department announced it would  
spend $19 million to help small producers pay for new technology 
needed to produce oil from fields where recovery has been 
difficult. The federal money, provided on a matching basis, was 
hoped to prompt increased private spending on use of such 
technology.

<HEADLINE>  Trial Opens in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Investigators knew they had something far  
more sinister than a hit-and-run accident when they discovered a Ku 
Klux Klan-engraved cigarette lighter on the bloody trail of a man 
who was dragged to his death, a sheriff testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when we started having some bad thoughts,'' Jasper  
County Sheriff Billy Rowles told jurors Tuesday. ``I knew somebody 
had been murdered because he had been black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors put the sheriff on the stand as the first witness in  
the murder trial of 24-year-old John King, a man who prosecutors 
contend was organizing a new white supremacist group for which he 
hoped to recruit members with the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he was trying to form his own personal hate group  
in Jasper,'' District Attorney Guy James Gray said after the first 
full day of testimony. ``This killing was to promote his own 
personal agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was to resume today.  
</P>
<P>
	King, an unemployed laborer and ex-convict who served time for  
burglary, faces life in prison or death by injection if convicted 
of the June 7 killing of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 49, was chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged  
for three miles before his body -- minus a head, neck and arm -- was 
dumped on a road across from a black church and cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 23, are to  
be tried later on the same murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowles testified that the evidence wasn't consistent with a  
routine hit-and-run accident: There were no skid marks, and the 
bloody trail did not run parallel to the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going through my mind. ... Somebody's dragging  
something,'' Rowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gray's opening statement to the jury of 11 whites and one  
black, he said t letters King wrote and tattoos that made him a 
walking racism exhibit would tie him to the killing, as would 
physical evidence including the lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was engraved with King's prison nickname, ``Possum'' and with  
three interlocking Ks, the KKK symbol, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's blood also was found on King's shoes, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also showed jurors photographs of Byrd's remains and  
tattered remnants of Byrd's clothing. Several members of Byrd's 
family began sobbing as the clothing was revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors portray King as unabashedly racist, a man who  
bragged about his tattoos depicting scenes including a black man 
hanging from a tree, Nazi swastikas and a Woody Woodpecker cartoon 
character wearing a Klan robe and hood. 
</P>
<P>
	Correspondence seized from his apartment the day after Byrd's  
death and entered into evidence Tuesday included 22 pages of 
handwritten by-laws and a code of ethics for King's ``Confederate 
Knights of America Texas Rebel Soldiers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs -- who declined an  
immediate opening statement -- objected to introduction of the 
written material and photos of King's tattoos, on grounds these 
items were protected by freedom of expression. The judge overruled 
the objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Chapman, 18, testified that she received 19 letters  
from King while he was in prison, some of them filled with racist 
venom. In one, King signed off: ``White is right.''

	AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Wins FCC Approval  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today gave AT&AMP;T Corp.  
permission to acquire cable giant TCI in a deal that could give 
consumers one-stop shopping -- from local calling to high-speed 
Internet access -- over cable TV lines. Federal Communications 
Commission officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
agency voted to clear the deal, which was valued at nearly $32 
billion when it was announced in June. But the action isn't 
considered official and final until the commission publicly 
releases information on the order. It's not clear when that will 
be. AT&AMP;T stock was down 5/16 at 84 5/16.

	Judge Gives Pilots More Time

	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today gave American Airlines'  
pilot union more time to defend itself against contempt charges 
that stemmed from failing to halt a sickout that at one point 
grounded more than half the carrier's flights. The Allied Pilots 
Association had asked U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall to hear its 
side of the case before imposing damages. The union said it needed 
more time to rebut financial harm the carrier claims it suffered as 
a result of the job action. The airline's lawyer, Dee Kelly, urged 
the judge to proceed. Kendall continued the hearing until April 12.

straight year of losses. The St. Louis-based carrier reported today 
that it lost $79.1 million in the quarter ending Dec. 31, bringing 
losses for the year to $120.5 million. TWA hasn't had a profitable 
year since 1988. The company will eliminate about 1,000 of its 
21,200 jobs this year, mostly through attrition and voluntary 
severance, officials said. Meanwhile, TWA will consider other 
cost-cutting moves, such as closing additional facilities, chief 
financial officer Michael Palumbo said. No details were provided on

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite icy weather in the Northeast and  
Midwest, construction of new U.S. homes jumped 3.8 percent in 
January to a 12-year high, extending the building boom of 1998 into 
the new year. Builders started construction of houses and 
apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 million, the

computers, semiconductors, lumber and furniture offset declines for 
aircraft, steel, clothing and tobacco. Utility output rose 0.2 
percent but mining output plunged 1.8 percent, reflecting a sharp 
drop in coal production and lackluster oil and gas extraction.

said he believed proposals being put forward to link the dollar

Heinz officials said the company will concentrate on its food 
products, including Heinz ketchup and Ore-Ida potatoes. Company 
spokesman Ted Smyth said officials have yet to decide which 
factories will close or lose production. Heinz has 100 factories 
and 40,500 employees worldwide. He also said the plan includes

percent of its work force, partly because of the poor Asian economy 
and low oil prices. David P. Gruber, chairman and chief executive, 
said in announcing the cuts that the company expects to save $26 
million on jobs, discontinuation of product lines and the 
consolidation in its core aerospace structural, aerospace turbines 
and energy products businesses.

	BP Amoco To Cut 3,000 More Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco is eliminating 3,000 more jobs. It  
reported a sharp decline in fourth-quarter earnings due to oil 
prices that are at a 12-year low and a downturn in the refining and 
chemicals business. BP Amoco's chief executive, Sir John Browne, 
said today the latest job cuts are on top of 7,000 cuts already 
announced. Profit after exceptional items fell to $532 million in 
the fourth quarter of 1998 from $1.62 billion a year earlier. The 
latest results reflected a $351 million charge covering integration 
costs caused by the merger of BP and Amoco.

<HEADLINE>  Milosevic Rejects NATO Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic dealt a blow today  
to prospects for a Kosovo peace deal, rejecting a 
take-it-or-leave-it proposal that foreign troops enforce any 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav president's latest defiance increased chances of  
NATO intervention, with only three days remaining until a deadline 
set by world powers for Serbia and ethnic Albanians to reach an 
agreement at talks in France. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who flew to Belgrade from France to  
meet with Milosevic on Tuesday night, and Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright both warned Milosevic that he will suffer 
airstrikes if he doesn't accept an agreement by Saturday at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yugoslav leader showed no signs of budging.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued in Yugoslavia early today by the official  
Tanjug news agency, Milosevic said ``our negative stand on the 
presence of foreign troops is not only the attitude of the 
leadership, but also of all citizens of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top Western diplomat at the talks in France, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said today that mediators were ``not 
surprised'' by Milosevic's defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	International mediators, led by the United States, brought Serbs  
and secessionist ethnic Albanians to the negotiating table to end a 
conflict that has cost an estimated 2,000 lives and left hundreds 
of thousands homeless in the province in southern Serbia, the 
dominant of two Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment of an international force is the key element of  
the deal proposed by the United States and backed by other powers 
at the conference outside Paris. As many as 30,000 NATO troops, 
including some 4,000 American soldiers, would be sent to Kosovo 
immediately to police the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright telephoned Milosevic from Washington on Tuesday and  
told him that rival Kosovo Albanians appear ready to sign the 
agreement and she expects him to do the same, according to State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic showed no more willingness to do so than the  
Serbian officials at the talks, which opened in a 14th century 
French chateau on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Milosevic reiterated the Serb stand that there  
can be no independence for Kosovo and that all ethnic communities 
in the province should have the same rights, although ethnic 
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our delegation in Rambouillet is negotiating in good faith,''  
declared Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Serb leader's statement, along with other defiant  
signals sent by his government, seemed to offer little hope the 
Serb delegation would back down and sign the peace deal despite the 
growing danger of NATO military action. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug quoted Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as  
warning that NATO attacks on Yugoslavia would mean the end of any 
negotiations on the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian state television, which reflects Milosevic's views,  
aired defiant statements from government officials and statements 
by ordinary Serbs saying the government should not budge under 
international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs had been counting on Russia to back up their rejection  
of foreign troops. But a NATO source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the Russians have told the 16-nation military 
alliance they are willing to go along with a NATO deployment as 
part of a three-year interim peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The source also said Russians may eventually participate in a  
peacekeeping operation, as they do in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. 
The Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council was meeting today in 
Brussels, Belgium, to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior Russian Defense Ministry official said NATO's  
insistence on sending troops was the ``most crude and simplistic 
way'' of solving the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no diplomatic, legal, political or especially  
economic levers in the alliance's arsenal, just naked military 
force,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the ministry's 
department for international relations, and one of Russia's most 
outspoken critics of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials still oppose NATO airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia in the event the peace talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO military planning for deployment is virtually complete.  
</P>
<P>
	Advance troops could be in place in Kosovo in a matter of hours  
with 6,000 to 8,000 more troops quickly following, officials said. 
The first forces to arrive would probably be 2,200 U.S. Marines now 
in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the deployment of the main 28,000-strong force are  
expected to be finished by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Any American peacekeepers sent to Kosovo would remain until a  
system of self-rule is ``up and running'' and stability is 
restored, the Clinton administration said Tuesday. However, other 
administration officials said the aim is to get the job done within 
three years.

<HEADLINE> Trading Suspended for 3 Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators on Wednesday  
suspended trading in shares of three small companies until March 2. 
A regulator said the companies appeared to be linked. 
</P>
<P>
	In three separate announcements made at the same time, the  
Securities and Exchange Commission said it took the actions because 
of questions about the accuracy of the companies' public 
statements. The SEC described the three -- Shebolt International 
Inc., Redwing Inc. and CPR Corp. -- as shell companies based in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, in separate filings with the National Association  
of Securities Dealers, gave the same office address in Las Vegas as 
their headquarters and listed several of the same people as company 
officers and directors, said Cliff Hyatt, branch chief of the SEC's 
enforcement division in its Pacific Region. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hyatt would neither confirm nor deny that an  
investigation of the companies was under way, it is generally 
assumed when such trading suspensions are imposed that the 
regulators are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The trading halts are standard 10-day suspensions, and will  
continue through 11:59 p.m. EST on March 2. At that time the 
stocks, unless they're subject to a further suspension, can resume 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In its announcements, the SEC said Shebolt had claimed to have  
acquired certain unnamed electronic and software companies, while 
Redwing had claimed to have bought unnamed banking companies and 
CPR had said it had bought unspecified engineering and automotive 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Press releases issued separately from London by the three  
companies on Jan. 15, which were written in similar formats, said 
the acquired companies had combined assets or net worth of tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no telephone listings in Las Vegas for the companies,  
and efforts to reach their officials for comment Wednesday were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the market watchdog agency suspended trading in  
shares of another six small companies until Feb. 11. The unusually 
high number of trading halts in one day fueled speculation that the 
companies are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	The shares of Shebolt, Redwing and CPR are traded on the  
National Association of Securities Dealers' OTC Bulletin Board, an 
electronic trading system for small stocks that are thinly traded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Stock Market runs the Bulletin Board, but stocks  
carried there are not actually listed on the Nasdaq market because 
they don't meet Nasdaq listing standards or don't file disclosure 
statements with the SEC. A recent change will tighten disclosure 
requirements for companies seeking Bulletin Board listings of their 
stocks.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Facing Pressure To Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New House Speaker Dennis Hastert faces growing  
pressure to assert himself on Social Security, taxes and other 
high-profile issues now that the impeachment tsunami that engulfed 
Washington has receded. 
</P>
<P>
	After a one-week breather, lawmakers return Monday to a  
post-impeachment capital, where the focus will be on the bills and 
political maneuvering that will set the stage for the 2000 
elections. That means Hastert's low-key, six-week honeymoon on his 
new job will end and he will have to start delivering on his 
promise to build a Republican consensus on a host of thorny issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are ``pleased right now because the last thing they  
want is a lightning rod'' like former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., 
said Marshall Wittman, director of congressional affairs for the 
conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the House returns next week, ``it will be crunch time''  
for Hastert, Wittman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., and other leaders have decided that the House  
will vote initially on such bills as those dealing with African 
trade, cellular phones, anti-missile defense and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost overnight, there will be a recognition that we're back  
to business,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	But behind the scenes, the speaker will be seeking internal  
agreement on issues that GOP leaders want to pursue to show the 
party has moved beyond impeachment, but that continue to divide 
Republicans. These include the size and type of the tax reduction 
they will seek, whether to postpone tax cuts until reaching a deal 
with President Clinton on overhauling Social Security and whether 
to exceed spending limits enacted just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those issues will be addressed in the fiscal 2000 budget  
that House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, plans to 
push through his panel by March 17. That leaves roughly a month for 
resolving those questions. Hastert has said he wants Congress to 
complete its budget work quickly this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly haven't answered all those questions yet,'' said  
Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., who represents moderates at GOP 
leadership meetings. He added, ``If we want to retain our majority, 
the pressure is on us to produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP edge over Democrats is slim -- just 222-211, plus  
one Democratic-leaning independent and one vacancy. With just six 
GOP defections able to sink a bill, no speaker -- not even the 
forceful Gingrich -- could dictate decisions to Republican 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	By his nature and history, Hastert is not one to dictate  
positions anyway. The amicable 12-year House veteran, who until 
this year had risen no higher than deputy whip, prides himself on 
building consensus behind the scenes, and that's what he's been 
seeking the last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Hastert has held countless meetings with other GOP  
leaders, committee chairmen and lawmakers, trying to divine the 
direction they should take. Hastert spokesman John Feehery says the 
speaker believes Republicans should initially engage Clinton in 
trying to revamp the politically sensitive Social Security program 
before tackling spending and tax issues. 
</P>
<P>
	To help begin that process, Hastert, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and congressional Democratic leaders plan to 
meet with Clinton at the White House next week to discuss the 
year's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Hastert has kept a low profile since becoming speaker  
Jan. 6, when the new Congress was sworn in. He has gone home to his 
rural-suburban district near Chicago almost every weekend and will 
appear on a network interview program next Sunday for only the 
fourth time as speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he is nowhere near the GOP fund-raising draw that  
Gingrich was. His only venture into that world so far came last 
month when he attended several money-raising events in Miami during 
Superbowl weekend, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who has stressed the need for bipartisanship in the  
post-impeachment atmosphere, has already surpassed Gingrich in 
reaching out to House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had a half-hour meeting in early January, and Gephardt  
said recently that Hastert has been ``much more forthcoming'' than 
Gingrich, with whom Gephardt had a frigid relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, Hastert and Gephardt have not followed through on  
the Democrat's Jan. 6 suggestion that the two men and their wives 
visit each other's congressional districts.

<HEADLINE> Editors Defend JAMA, AMA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Editors at the Journal of the American Medical  
Association defended the publication after a recently fired editor 
asserted that he had to battle AMA officials to retain editorial 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Lundberg, who ran the journal for 17 years, told the  
Chicago Tribune this week that the AMA public relations staff tried 
to get copies of articles prior to publication so they could ``spin 
them for the AMA's corporate interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a day went by in considering what to publish  
that I and my editorial staff didn't have to worry about offending 
AMA members, AMA politicians and the AMA Washington office by what 
we published,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg said irate AMA members and officers and state medical  
societies threatened ``political action against the editor and the 
journal for publishing what offended them ideologically, or more 
likely imposed on (physicians') ability to earn money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not discuss specific incidents.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Glass, an interim co-editor of JAMA since Lundberg  
was fired Jan. 15, didn't deny that some people want to control the 
prestigious medical journal's content. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Lundberg describes attempts to influence the content of  
JAMA. There certainly were those,'' Glass said Wednesday. ``But 
those attempts didn't succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Glass and co-editor Dr. Phil Fontanarosa  
said they continue to have final say about the content of news 
releases about upcoming JAMA articles. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said AMA officials have not tried ``to  
interfere with any aspect of the editorial and publication 
processes'' since Glass and Fontanarosa were named to their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA Executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. fired  
Lundberg after JAMA published a survey of college students' sexual 
attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. Anderson said it inappropriately interjected the 
organization into a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA and Lundberg later reached an agreement that will let  
him contribute articles to the publication.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Panel Chair Discusses Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Will the traditionally powerful ACC get  
just three teams in the NCAA tournament this year? Will the 
formidable Big Ten get as many as 7 or 8? 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the selection committee insists he won't know  
himself until after the committee's work is done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even add up what teams from conferences are picked  
until the field is picked,'' C.M. Newton said Wednesday in a 
conference call. ``I just try to get that out of my head. We try to 
keep those kind of thoughts out of it. I honestly have not known 
until it's through. Then I like to go back and see what we've 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-man committee will begin selecting, seeding and  
bracketing the 64-team field at 1 p.m. CST on March 4 and unveil 
its handiwork on live television March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton, who is completing his second year as committee chairman,  
declined to predict how many teams the ACC or any other league 
might squeeze into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to even speculate on that because there's so  
much basketball left to be played,'' he said. ``We've got two or 
three games left in the conference, then the conference 
tournaments. To speculate would serve no purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all conferences assign their automatic berth in the NCAA  
to the winners of their conference tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're not the automatic qualifier, then the conference  
affiliation goes out the window. We don't look to see if they're 
the ACC or whatever,'' he said. ``We compare them against other 
teams to see what's available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, winning the long, grinding regular season title  
counts for nothing officially in the eyes of the selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But it doesn't hurt, Newton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do consider that,'' Newton said. ``We want to make sure we  
don't overlook any conference champion on that at-large board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches who do not understand the committee's rules and  
procedures in filling out the bracket will have only themselves to 
blame this year. In December, the NCAA mailed to every coach in 
Division I a 30-minute video explaining the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
	In the video, committee members Rudy Davalos, Craig Thompson,  
McKinley Boston and Newton explain how teams are selected, seeded 
and bracketed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hancock of the NCAA wrote the script and Jim Marchiony,  
media coordinator of the tournament, edited it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through the policies and procedures we make public,''  
Marchiony said. ``We didn't go step-by-step. But we touched the 
major parts of the procedures. We essentially made up a bracket and 
went through it and explained why teams go where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's work has always been done strictly behind closed  
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It perfectly normal to be curious about a process that you  
don't experience first hand,'' Marchiony said. ``You have all these 
people sitting around the country waiting to see if they're in or 
not, and they're not in that room. It's perfectly understandable 
they would be curious what goes behind some of those decisions.''

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez canceled a trip  
to the United States scheduled for next week, saying he was unable 
to get an audience with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to cancel because it wasn't possible to acquire a  
space in President Clinton's tight agenda,'' Chavez told reporters 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former army paratrooper who tried unsuccessfully to  
overthrow the government in 1992, had been barred from entering the 
United States until his landslide victory in presidential elections 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
	For investors in New York eager to get their first glimpse of  
Venezuela's new president, Wednesday's cancellation represented the 
second disappointment in three weeks. Chavez cut short a trip to 
the U.S. last month after complaining of a minor stomach ailment.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Judges of Rio's Carnival parade on  
Wednesday named a neighborhood group from the north of the city 
this year's champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Imperatriz Leopoldinense group was judged the best of 14  
samba schools, which paraded from Sunday to Tuesday in the 
showpiece of Rio's annual pre-Lenten Carnival. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools, which each include about 4,000 costumed dancers and  
a core of singers and drummers, are judged on their theme, song, 
drummers, floats and organization. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Heavy rains pounding large swathes of Peru's  
central mountains have caused car crashes and floods that have 
killed 17 people and injured dozens Tuesday and Wednesday, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rains, which began in January, have increased in recent  
days, causing some rivers flowing to Peru's desert coast to flood, 
blocking highways and damaging homes, civil defense spokeswoman 
Nancy Barros said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one accident on Wednesday, a bus skidded off a road and  
rolled down a precipice in Huancavelica, 140 miles southeast of 
Lima, on Wednesday, killing nine people and injuring 20, police 
spokesman Edgar Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, two trucks flipped over on flooded roads  
Tuesday night near the city of Piura, 530 miles northwest of Lima, 
killing five people and injuring 17, police said. 
</P>

<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on  
Wednesday asked Congress to grant him fast-track powers to tackle 
an economic crisis provoked by a 12-year low in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a nationally broadcast press conference, Chavez said  
approval of a special powers law would allow him to implement a 
banking transaction tax, restructure the country's $23 billion 
foreign debt, broaden the tax base, attract foreign investors and 
crack down on rampant government corruption and waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are aimed at reducing a $9 billion deficit that  
helped push last year's inflation rate to 30 percent, one of the 
highest in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the population is mired in poverty even though  
Venezuela possesses some of the largest oil reserves outside the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear if Congress will grant fast-track powers to  
Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup attempt.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Men dressed in police uniforms searched the  
office of a left-leaning Guatemalan news agency over the weekend, 
the agency's officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joaquin Perez Sanchez, news director for the Cerigua agency,  
said he suspected the raid on Sunday was a mistake by police 
searching for stolen archaeological goods and said it was probably 
not political.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Fall in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell slightly Wednesday as  
investors took profits after Tuesday's sharp rise. Many Asian stock 
markets remained closed for the Chinese New Year, while trading was 
quiet in those that were open. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 14,158.67  
points, down 73.97 points, or 0.52 percent. On Wednesday, the 
average gained 177.92 points, or 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling by domestic institutional investors and renewed concerns  
about the health of the Japanese economy drove down share prices, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Wednesday that Japan's NEC  
Corp. is likely to post greater losses for the fiscal year ending 
March 31 than previously forecast, fueling fears that overall 
corporate earnings would be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed really. There aren't that many reasons to  
buy stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``While company earnings may stabilize with the government's  
efforts, there is still no sign of an economic recovery,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar continued a rally against  
the Japanese yen, which began on Tuesday after the Japanese Finance 
Ministry announced it would lower the yields of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 118.62 yen, up 1.62 yen from  
Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.74 yen 
overnight. The New York rate was the highest level for the 
greenback since Dec. 9, when it hit 118.75 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, shares plunged as local retail investors sold  
shares in financial and property stocks on market rumors that 
property company Quality Houses PCL failed to reach an agreement on 
debt restructuring with its lenders and might have to reduce its 
capital. The company later refuted the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index dropped 12.34 points, or  
3.5 percent, to 338.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and  
South Korea were closed for Chinese New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell slightly, with the index dragged  
down by late selling in PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia shares. The JSX 
Composite Index closed down 0.873 point, or 0.2 percent, at 397.975 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares ended nearly flat in thin trading. The  
PSE index fell 0.30 point to 1,918.57. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, led by  
telecommunications stocks and other blue chips such as the banks 
and News Corp. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,882.2, up 0.8 
percent, or 22.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed up, led by market  
bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital 
index closed at 2,183.25 points, up 1.5 percent, or 31.75 points.

<HEADLINE> Grammys Come at Tumultuous Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wednesday's Grammy Awards will give the  
executives who run the music industry some rare moments of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The business that decides what music people will hear is going  
through tumultuous times, with bottom line-enforced consolidation 
coming just when new technologies are opening up unimagined 
frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
	If things could only be as simple as sitting back for a few  
hours and listening to Lauryn Hill or Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
	At the very least, fewer executives will be looking for Grammy  
tickets this year. Instead, many are looking for jobs because of 
massive retrenchment being caused by Seagram Corp.'s purchase of 
Polygram. Many of the industry's well-known music companies -- 
Motown, A&AMP;M, Geffen, Mercury, MCA, Island, Interscope -- are being 
folded into the larger Universal Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-name musical acts under this umbrella, like U2, Sheryl  
Crow, Nine Inch Nails and Boyz II Men, are expected to survive. But 
there are reports that as many as 200 artists will be cut adrift, 
left without a company to manufacture, distribute and promote their 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, the industry is being dominated less by  
freethinking executives who follow their instincts in signing and 
developing musical acts and more by companies ruled by Wall Street 
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is an almost dizzying parade of interchangeable  
musicians, careers that nosedive before age 30. Last year's Weezer 
is this year's Limp Bizkit. Arrested Development becomes Foxy 
Brown. The rock band Sugar Ray even named their most recent album 
``14:59'' in a joking reference to the clock ticking on their 15 
minutes of fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Hanson be forgotten before all the brothers finish puberty?  
</P>
<P>
	``You have more one-hit wonders in the 1990s than you've had  
since the 1950s,'' said John Scher, a former Polygram executive who 
is now president of the Metropolitan Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said that before he left Polygram, the company really  
didn't care about advancing the careers of any artists unless they 
were major stars who could quickly pay off an investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The major labels are quicker to cast aside musicians who don't  
break through with big hits, said Andy Allen, president of the 
Alternative Distribution Alliance. With radio consolidation leading 
to restricted playlists, fragmented station formats and fewer 
people deciding what gets played, it's harder to get music noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds depressing, but there's a much brighter side.  
</P>
<P>
	Many experts predict a boom for smaller, independent record  
labels -- the ones more willing to take a chance on something new or 
stick with an established artist even when their best sales days 
are past. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Berry Gordy got started at Motown in the 1960s, Clive  
Davis at Arista in the 1970s, Russell Simmons at Def Jam in the 
1980s and now new moguls like Puff Daddy and Master P. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the independent labels are just licking their lips,''  
said Allen, whose company distributes their music. ``They have the 
idea that the bands that were taken from them by the major labels 
will now be available to them -- the artists that sell anywhere from 
30,000 to 150,000 records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Independent labels lack the distribution and marketing muscle of  
the bigger companies, so it means fans may have to search harder to 
find the music. The smaller companies usually have more time to 
devote to a particular project, though, since they're not doing so 
many things at once. 
</P>
<P>
	Many rap artists, increasingly the dominant musical spokesmen of  
their generation, are discovered by independent labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you are going to find that more bands are going to  
break through,'' said Tom Calderone, head of music programming at 
MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Young fans enjoy the process of discovering musicians on their  
own, particularly through the Internet, so this could help a more 
decentralized music industry flourish, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet now serves a musical function that radio or a  
trusted friend once did, providing a network for like-minded fans 
to talk about what's new. Some in the industry fear it may 
eventually take over the role that record companies and record 
stores now hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a format known as MP3, it's becoming much easier for  
fans to download music files from the Internet, copy them with 
CD-quality sound and play them on a Walkman-like device costing 
about $200. 
</P>
<P>
	It has the potential to unleash a musical freedom of expression  
that terrifies the industry; if people can get music cheaply or for 
free over the Internet, why buy CDs and tapes? Two months ago, 
major record companies appointed a task force to sort out the 
issues involved and see how they can do business over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is waiting for the task force to finish its work.  
The independent record label Rykodisc said this month it was 
licensing about 175 of its songs to sell in the MP3 format for 99 
cents each. IBM is experimenting this spring with a service to 
download albums, at a price to be determined by five major record 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year ago, if you mentioned the Internet to anyone in the  
music business, there was complete shock and horror,'' said Scott 
Epstein, senior vice president at Spinner.com, an Internet service 
that functions as on on-line radio. ``Now people are becoming more 
educated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein said there's ``a lot of thrashing going on in the  
industry about how it's going to work, how it will be controlled, 
how record companies will make their profits. It's going to be 
harnessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, though the idea of harnessing the Internet's power for  
profits runs counter to the philosophy of many technically savvy 
music fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher, whose company promotes concerts and runs an independent  
record label, said he believed there will always be fans who want 
to go into a store and buy music. And he questions how many people 
will embrace the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that in our future, people are going to turn  
their record collections around like they did in going from records 
to CDs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the industry is caught in an era of almost unprecedented  
change. Small wonder that music executives have a lot more to think 
about at the Grammys than what Madonna is wearing. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy Awards will be telecast Feb. 24 from the Shrine  
Auditorium in Los Angeles on CBS at 8 p.m. EST, with Rosie 
O'Donnell as host. Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill leads the way with 10 
nominations, and Shania Twain and Sheryl Crow both have six.

<HEADLINE> Jasper Jurors Hear Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- An ex-girlfriend of accused murderer John  
William King testified today she saw King and two companions drive 
away in a gray pickup truck that prosecutors contend is the vehicle 
a black man was chained to and dragged to his death last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Keisha Adkins, 21, also testified King was wearing sandals on  
which prosecutors say they found blood traces belonging to James 
Byrd Jr., whose dismembered body was found the morning of June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins, who said she had known King for eight or nine years,  
said King called her several times after he was released from 
prison on a burglary conviction and invited her to his Jasper 
apartment the night of June 6. Two other men were there, Lawrence 
Russell Brewer and Shawn Allen Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 31, and Berry, 23, also are charged with Byrd's death  
and are to be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I remember right, Shawn was driving, Bill in the middle and  
Russell on the passenger side,'' Ms. Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to authorities, she said King was wearing sandals  
when he and the other two men left the apartment about 1:30 a.m. 
June 7 to go meet some women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't known what shoes he had on when he left,'' she said  
under cross-examination today. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said King called her the next night and ``sounded  
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he needed to see me and needed to talk to me,'' she  
said. But she said she had no idea why King needed to speak with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have contended King's attack on Byrd was part of a  
plan to draw attention to a new white supremacist group he was 
organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins, however, said there was no racial discussion during  
her visit to King's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he was trying to form his own personal hate group  
in Jasper, Texas,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray 
said Tuesday after the first full day of testimony. ``I believe 
we'll be able to establish that this killing was to promote his own 
personal agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, an unemployed laborer and ex-convict, faces life in  
prison or death by injection if convicted of killing Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old East Texas man was chained to the back of a  
pickup truck and dragged for three miles before his body, minus a 
head, neck and arm, was left dumped on a road across from a black 
church and cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has said he hopes to wrap up his side of the case by the  
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening statement Tuesday to the jury of 11 whites and  
one black, Gray said physical evidence, racist tattoos all over 
King's body and letters written by King would tie him to Byrd's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Correspondence seized by authorities from King's Jasper  
apartment the day after Byrd's death and entered into evidence late 
Tuesday included 22 pages of handwritten by-laws and a code of 
ethics for what King called the ``Confederate Knights of America 
Texas Rebel Soldiers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Student,'' King wrote. ``Welcome to the Aryan Institute  
for Higher Learning... Welcome to the dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the documents, he labels himself ``Captain'' of the  
organization. In another, where he signs himself as ``President,'' 
he describes his group as working for the ``struggle of our white 
race'' and complains of ``thousands of organizations working for 
the interest of minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How many groups stand up for the cultural values and ideals of  
the white majority?'' he asked. ``We of the Confederate Knights of 
America are unapologetically committed to the interest, ideas and 
cultural value of the White Aryan race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said other physical evidence includes a lighter  
engraved with King's prison nickname ``Possum'' and a Ku Klux Klan 
symbol of interlocking three K's found along the bloody route. 
Byrd's blood also was found on King's shoes, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tattoos over more than 65 percent of his body include a black  
man hanging from a tree, nazi swastikas and a Woody Woodpecker 
cartoon character wearing a Klan robe and hood. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, who declined an  
immediate opening statement, objected to the introduction of the 
written material and photos of King's tattoos, saying such items 
were protected by the Constitution as freedom of expression. State 
District Judge Joe Bob Golden overruled the objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began testimony by laying out the crime scene, with  
Sheriff Billy Rowles telling how he first thought he had a routine 
hit-and-run accident. But he said he was puzzled by the lack of 
parallel tire tracks that should have followed the trail of blood 
typically left by someone dragged under a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	When investigators found the lighter, ``That's when we started  
having some bad thoughts,'' the sheriff added. ``I knew somebody 
had been murdered because he had been black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other items from the crime scene included tools with the name  
``Berry'' scratched into the surface. Authorities knew Berry was a 
mechanic and arrested him on outstanding traffic warrants. When he 
gave an affidavit that included information identifying King as 
having the nickname ``Possum,'' ``I know this country boy's in 
trouble,'' Rowles testified. 
</P>
<P>
	In love letters he sent from prison to Michele Chapman, a Jasper  
woman described by King as ``my precious Aryan Princess,'' King 
used obscenities and vulgarities when referring to blacks and 
Mexicans. He bragged about what he said was $3,000 worth of tattoo 
work he received for free all over his body from an inmate tattoo 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``White is right!!!'' he wrote in one letter, signing it off:  
``...Take care and stay white and beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also showed jurors photographs of Byrd's remains and  
introduced into evidence tattered remants of Byrd's clothing. 
Several members of Byrd's family began sobbing as the clothing was 
revealed.

<HEADLINE>  First Lady To Consider Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inching closer to a possible New York Senate  
race, Hillary Rodham Clinton is sounding out supporters and 
weighing how much money she would have to raise to run a serious 
campaign. Her interest provoked some stirrings from New York City 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton promised Tuesday she would give ``careful thought''  
to running and she thanked ``the large number of people'' she said 
had encouraged her to jump into the race. President Clinton said 
Monday his wife would be ``terrific'' in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's comments fanned already-intense speculation about  
whether she really would trade her coveted status as first lady for 
the rough and tumble of the campaign trail. Whatever she decides, 
though, her deliberations already have helped the White House by 
changing the subject after a more than a year of scandal and 
impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting she has been preoccupied with her husband's troubles,  
Mrs. Clinton said she had not been able to focus until now on 
whether to run in 2000 for the Senate seat opened by the retirement 
of Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She promised a decision later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be pressure for her to give a sign one way or the  
other when she headlines a New York fund-raiser in the first week 
of March for the Democratic Party's Women's Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's statement brought a reaction from the camp of  
Giuliani, the New York mayor who could be a formidable rival to 
Mrs. Clinton. ``If Hillary Clinton announces a run for Senate, that 
would encourage the mayor to consider his candidacy for the Senate 
as well,'' Giuliani spokeswoman Colleen Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are told that her candidacy would be the singular biggest  
unifying force in the Republican Party,'' Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made it clear he has ambitions beyond City Hall and  
has not ruled out a run for the Senate. He has a strong base and is 
a solid fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer sounded a note of  
caution for the first lady. ``I think she would be an extremely 
formidable candidate. I guess she'd have to be the favorite, but 
favorites don't always win,'' Schumer told a news conference in 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could not elaborate  
on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's decision. ``I can't be any more 
specific than that because she doesn't know. She's going to talk to 
people, those who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said she has begun returning telephone calls to 
supporters and asking for information about what it would take to 
run a campaign -- from the amount of money she would have to raise 
to the availability of campaign talent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these advisers echoed the sentiments of associates of  
Mrs. Clinton, who have been saying for weeks that they suspect she 
will eventually decide against making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for running for office, 
according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of 
Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a 
Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democratic ally of the Clintons, is  
going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released early this month from Quinnipiac College's  
Polling Institute, had Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of 
registered voters to 42 percent for Giuliani. Six percent of voters 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac's telephone poll had a margin of error of plus or  
minus 3 percentage points, while the Marist poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released early this month from Quinnipiac College's  
Polling Institute, had Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of 
registered voters to 42 percent for Giuliani. Six percent of voters 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac's telephone poll had a margin of error of plus or  
minus 3 percentage points, while the Marist poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> 5 Questions: Rebecca Romijn-Stamos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- No matter how good it looks on the  
outside, it's what's inside that matters, right? 
</P>
<P>
	So inside this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue are 10  
pictures of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, jaw-dropping snapshots of her 
kneeling in the sand, falling off water skis, on the roof of a 
Jeep. In several, the only thing that separates her from an R 
rating is a strategically placed hand or a piece of fruit. In 
others, the only thing she wears is some body paint and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's the shot that made the cover -- the model posing  
seductively in a chain mail bikini, blonde mane flowing with the 
ocean behind her -- to capture modeling's unofficial crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know it was going to be a cover, though,'' says Ms.  
Romijn-Stamos, host of MTV's ``House of Style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We shoot roughly 81,000 pictures and everybody (else) is  
gorgeous, everybody has an equal shot at the cover. When the cover 
shot happens, it's just this moment where everything's right. You 
either get that moment or you don't. Luckily, I was in the right 
place at the right time,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the SI swimsuit issue was unveiled, the publicity  
whirlwind has sent the 26-year-old supermodel, who was born in 
Berkeley, Calif., crisscrossing across the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	First came the mind-numbing media appearances in New York, then  
a quick flight to the Bahamas for an interview on ``The Oprah 
Winfrey Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She flew to Los Angeles days later to appear on ``The Howie  
Mandel Show'' and ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' then returned 
to New York to be a presenter at ESPN's Espy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm exhausted, just trying to get through the week, but it's  
fun,'' she says just before her ``Tonight Show'' segment. 
</P>
<P>
	She recently married TV sitcom star John Stamos. Hence the  
hyphenated surname and ring on her finger. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How did you wash off the body-paint swimsuit we see in the  
magazine? Did you have to use turpentine? 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: It's water-soluble. I just ran into the ocean  
and rinsed off. Trust me, after all the hours we spent under the 
paint, we were ready to wash it off. 
</P>
<P>
	2. They spent 14 hours on one of the really complex body-paint  
bikinis. Were you able to eat or drink during application? Could 
you sleep? 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: I ate. (An assistant) brought me tea and  
lunch and breakfast and cookies. ... I slept for the first three 
hours, but it was kind of a weird, restless, self-conscious sleep 
where I kept waking up and dozing off again. There were three 
people painting on me. ... It was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	2 1/2. Did it tickle?  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: It tickled around my bellybutton. It actually  
jarred me awake out of a dream I was having. A-a-a-h! 
</P>
<P>
	3. The bikini you're wearing on the SI cover, was it  
uncomfortable? It's like steel mesh or something. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: It wasn't uncomfortable. I wouldn't suggest  
swimming laps in it. It might rust. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How have fans reacted to your cover girl status?  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: On the plane ... the day the issue hit the  
stands, it was like every guy in first class had a copy of it. Half 
of them knew I was on the flight and half of them didn't. All of 
the flight attendants were coming back with notes and (SI) copies 
and having me sign them. The pilots started coming back with copies 
and having me sign them. ... I kept seeing guys in front of me 
looking at pictures of me and sort of pointing things out to their 
friends. ... It was so funny. When I went to sleep, I'd wake up 
with notes asking me to sign their issue. 
</P>
<P>
	4 1/2. Isn't this something you're used do? You're already pretty  
well-known. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: Not this much. Every newsstand we passed it  
was all over the place. Everybody had their copies fresh off the 
press. They were all looking at me, then looking at their issues 
going, 'Oh, there she is!' 
</P>
<P>
	5. How has your husband taken all of this?  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Romijn-Stamos: He's so proud. But he hasn't seen me. His  
friends say, 'God, it must be so great being married to the 
swimsuit issue cover model.' And he says, 'Yeah it's great, but I 
never see her. I can't get any action.'

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 101.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials dove into the close for the  
second day in a row on Wednesday, matching big losses in the 
broader market that resulted from aggressive sales of technology 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 101.56 at 9,195.47  
after sliding 95 points in the final hour. Earlier in the session, 
the index bailed out of a 77-point loss and stayed positive for a 
brief time, only to retreat again. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the big drop in the index, the leadership was thin.  
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by only a small margin on 
the New York Stock Exchange, and volume was 878.8 million shares, 
anemic by recent standards although still up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares, which have led the market higher since  
October, are providing the same exclusive leadership downward. 
Other sectors of the market -- manufacturing shares, for example -- 
have been unable to support the major indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's this loss of the key leadership which is bothering the  
market,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower all day, with the  
Nasdaq composite again posting a big loss of 64.96, and closing at 
2,248.91, as technology issues slid lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was down 17.84 at 1,224.03.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq loss was again sparked by Dell. The computer maker's  
fourth-quarter earnings, released late Tuesday, met analysts' 
per-share expectations, but revenues didn't grow as much as 
analysts had hoped. Dell tumbled 7 3/16, or 8.1 percent, to 81 5/8 and 
was the most heavily traded Nasdaq stock. The shares dipped as low 
as 77 3/8 during the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related shares fell as well. Dow component  
Hewlett-Packard fell 2 3/8 to 68 1/8. The computer maker's earnings, also 
released late Tuesday, beat analysts' per-share expectations, but 
its 1-percent revenue growth did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Applied Materials, which reported strong earnings late  
Tuesday, ended 1/2 point lower at 67 3/8 in Nasdaq trading after giving 
up an earlier gain of 3 3/4 point. Applied Materials posted operating 
income of 11 cents a share, well above analysts' consensus target 
of 6 cents, but revenue fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks put in another volatile day, with America Online  
falling 6 1/2 to 153, but e-Bay rising 1 7/8 to 233, amid reports that 
AOL was about to take a minority position in the online auction 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nasdaq trading, Amazon.com, fell 5 1/8 to 93 1/2, but Geoworks  
Corp. rose 1 7/8 to 5 1/4, after Amazon agreed to acquire a 7-percent 
minority stake in the tiny software firm for about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors attempted to support the Dow Jones industrials by  
bidding up industrial stocks early in the day, after the government 
reported that industrial production was unchanged in January after 
a lackluster 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the industrial production data doused fears that  
the central bank might raise interest rates, despite the fact that 
the Commerce Department also reported today that housing starts 
jumped a very strong 3.8 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	But a morning rally in industrial shares didn't hold. Dow  
component General Motors ended down 1/2 at 82 5/8, after giving up a 
strong gain of 4 1/16. United Technologies ended up 5/8 at 121 3/4, 
after gaining nearly 3 points earlier in the session. The company's 
chief financial officer confirmed Tuesday that United Technologies' 
automotive unit is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action on Wall Street, the American Stock Exchange's  
market value index declined 7.19 to 688.65, and the Russell 2000 
index of medium-sized companies tumbled 6.86 to 389.54. The New 
York Stock Exchange market index lost 6.38 to close at 580.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, Tokyo's Nikkei index eased 0.52  
percent. London's FT-SE 100 index fell 0.49, Frankfurt's DAX 
dropped 1.93 percent, and the CAC in Paris declined 0.32 percent, 
all on nervousness about technology stocks in New York.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Share Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices fell Wednesday as investors  
sold shares to take profits on Tuesday's sharp rise. The dollar 
gained against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 73.97 points,  
or 0.52 percent, to close the day at 14,158.67 points. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 177.92 points, or 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.62 yen in late trading, up 1.62 yen from  
Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.74 yen 
overnight. The New York rate was the highest level for the 
greenback since Dec. 9, when it hit 118.75 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, profit-taking by domestic institutional  
investors and renewed concerns about the health of the Japanese 
economy drove down share prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Wednesday that Japan's NEC  
Corp. is likely to post greater losses for the fiscal year ending 
March 31 than previously forecast, fueling fears that overall 
corporate earnings would be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed really. There aren't that many reasons to  
buy stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``While company earnings may stabilize with the government's  
efforts, there is still no sign of an economic recovery,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling of shares as companies unwound cross-shareholding  
agreements before the fiscal close in March also pushed stock 
prices down, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 4.60 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1097.08 points. 
The TOPIX closed up 6.66 points, or 0.61 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 400.16 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared to 398.99 million shares 
the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Declines outnumbered advances 729 to 361, while 194 issues were  
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved between 118 and 118.83  
yen, continuing a rally begun on Tuesday after the Japanese Finance 
Ministry announced it would lower the yields of government bonds. 
Rising bond yields were behind last month's strengthening of the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Bank of Japan lowered its target for overnight  
call money -- the rate banks charge each other for unsecured 
short-term loans -- to 0.15 percent from the previous 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates in Japan would weaken the yen by making  
yen-denominated investment less attractive to investors, but 
helpful to companies by lowering borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.950 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.985 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.81 yen from 98.54 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 132.87 yen, up from  
131.16 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Thursday morning as  
U.S. funds bought the dollar to adjust positions. Japanese stock 
prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.75 yen at midday, up 0.13 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but below its level of 119.02 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 56.85 points, or 0.40 percent, to  
close the morning session at 14,101.82. On Wednesday, the average 
closed down 73.97 points, or 0.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained strength as U.S. funds  
stepped up purchases after it fell to 118.50 yen early in the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Longer term U.S. players think the dollar is heading higher  
against the yen, so it seems to be well bid,'' said Shuji Takano, 
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar were remarks by Japanese Vice Finance  
Minister for International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara, who said the 
Bank of Japan's willingness to take radical steps to boost the 
economy is now ``much, much stronger than the market currently 
realizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks by Sakakibara, who is known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his  
influential comments on the currency, were carried in Thursday's 
overseas edition of the Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara also said it was ``natural for the yen to weaken as a  
result of the very dramatic easing of monetary policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The yen also turned vulnerable to selling after the Bank of  
Japan guided its key interest rate lower to bolster the nation's 
sagging economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the central bank lowered its target for overnight  
call money -- the rate banks charge each other for unsecured 
short-term loans -- to 0.08 percent, down 0.02 percentage point from 
Tuesday, a central bank official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami said recently it would even be  
acceptable for overnight call rates to fall to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates in Japan make the yen less attractive to  
investors, but helpful to companies by lowering borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 133.52 yen, up from  
132.87 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices were moderately lower on the  
fall of New York stocks earlier and continued selling in the 
futures market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 101.56 points  
Wednesday to close at 9,195.47. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 4.05 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish the 
morning at 1,093.03. The TOPIX closed down 4.60 points, or 0.42 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
rose to 1.955 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.930 percent, 
pushing its price down to 98.77 yen from 98.97.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Suspect Tape Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Detectives at his side, Kip Kinkel walked  
through the bloodied Thurston High School cafeteria hours after a 
shooting rampage that killed two of his classmates and wounded 22. 
Police asked the teen-ager why he opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no other choice,'' Kinkel, then 15, said in a barely  
audible monotone on a videotape played in Lane County Circuit Court 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-minute tape of the May 21, 1998, walk-through was played  
to bolster a defense motion to keep Kinkel's recorded statements 
from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, 16, is charged as an adult with four counts of  
aggravated murder and 54 other counts. Prosecutors allege he killed 
his parents at home, then drove to the Springfield school and began 
blasting away with a .22-caliber rifle loaded with 50 bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he faces life in prison without parole.  
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jack Mattison was expected to rule today on another  
defense motion to delay the trial -- now scheduled to begin April 6 
-- on grounds the defense has not had enough time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the videotape was played, Detective Alan  
Warthen described how the young suspect was found to have extra 
bullets taped to his chest so he could kill himself and begged 
officers who questioned him: ``Just kill me! Just shoot me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, who had been expelled from school a day before the  
shootings for having a stolen gun in his locker, acknowledged on 
the videotape how he walked into the cafeteria wearing a trench 
coat and armed with three guns and two knives. 
</P>
<P>
	After telling one student he ``should probably leave,'' Kinkel  
said he pulled out a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle with a 
50-round banana clip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started shooting,'' Kinkel said on the tape. He did not  
attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a corner of the packed courtroom, 18-year-old Richard Peak,  
who was shot in the left arm, watched with rapt attention while his 
mother, Sue Clark, sobbed beside him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know why Kip didn't show up,'' she said. ``He didn't  
want to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers argued they need more time to interview  
witnesses and obtain records. They have yet to say whether they 
will employ a defense claiming Kinkel suffered from some mental 
defect. He was known around the school for torturing animals and 
making bombs and threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Warthen said Kinkel described shooting his father in the head,  
just above his ear, and then waiting in the house for his mother to 
get home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was explaining how he killed his mother -- he just went  
off,'' the detective said. ``He started talking about a voice in 
his head. He started banging his head against the wall a couple of 
times. I put my hand on his shoulder and said, `Kip, calm down.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, about 100 people gathered in Eugene as Thurston  
High School students put on their first local performance of the 
play, ``Bang, Bang, You're Dead,'' designed to foster a national 
discussion of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Playwright William Mastrosimone, whose credits include the  
acclaimed play ``Extremities,'' and the TV miniseries, ``Sinatra,'' 
wrote the one-act play a few days after the Thurston shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Missy Alberts wasn't present when the shootings started at  
Thurston, but got a dramatic look at what her classmates went 
through by seeing the play. She left the auditorium crying and 
hugged her friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty tough,'' she said. ``It wasn't what I expected  
it to be. It was a lot more powerful.''

<HEADLINE> Home Construction at 12-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite icy weather in the Northeast and  
Midwest, construction of new homes jumped 3.8 percent in January to 
a 12-year high, extending the building boom of 1998 into the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started construction of houses and apartments at a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.80 million, the most since 
December 1986, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the Federal Reserve said today that production at  
the nation's factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in 
January after a lackluster 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders in 1998 started 1.62 million units, an 11-year high,  
and economists had expected January would mark the start of a 
modest decline during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the conditions that drove homes sales and construction  
in 1998 -- low mortgage rates, plentiful jobs and high stock prices 
-- continued into 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, in January, starts of single-family homes rose 1.2 percent  
to an annual rate of 1.39 million, a 15-year high. Starts of 
apartments shot up 17.1 percent to a rate of 410,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally, the South more than accounted for the national gain.  
Starts there jumped 22.3 percent to a rate of 890,000, the most in 
13 years. They rose 3.7 percent in the West to a rate of 446,000. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they plunged 25.3 percent -- the sharpest decline in  
five years -- to a rate of 316,000 in the Midwest and slipped 3.2 
percent to a rate of 152,000 in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing permits -- a barometer of construction plans -- rose 2.8  
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.78 million, the 
most since July 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sluggishness in industrial production continued to  
reflect the loss of export sales to economically troubled countries 
in Asia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing output edged a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent  
higher. Gains in the output of autos, computers, semiconductors, 
lumber and furniture offset declines for aircraft, steel, clothing 
and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility output rose 0.2 percent but mining output plunged 1.8  
percent, reflecting a sharp drop in coal production and lackluster 
oil and gas extraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The various changes left U.S. industry operating at 80.5 percent  
of its capacity. That's the lowest level in more than six years and 
means industry has the capacity to increase output, if necessary, 
without incurring inflation-causing production bottlenecks.

<HEADLINE> Through Injuries, Huskies Mush On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- A coaching manual is no help, and there's  
no official name for it. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the country's better college basketball teams these  
are the February doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for No. 1 Duke and No. 3 Auburn, almost the entire Top 10  
has had some bumps lately. Look at No. 9 Cincinnati's current 
three-game losing streak or No. 6 Kentucky dropping two straight. 
No. 7 Stanford lost two of three at home and No. 10 St. John's lost 
three straight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Connecticut had a recent four-game stretch featuring its  
first loss of the season, one of the best road wins in school 
history and then two poor offensive performances. The Huskies may 
have snapped out of it with a 77-64 victory over Rutgers on Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to be good for any long period of time,'' Huskies  
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``I saw two quotes recently where (Rutgers 
coach) Kevin Bannon and (Miami coach) Leonard Hamilton both said a 
win against us legitimizes their season. When you get those kind of 
things you can face those doldrums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut has been hit with injuries. Richard Hamilton, the  
leading scorer and reigning Big East player of the year, missed the 
loss to Syracuse and victory at Stanford because of a bruised 
thigh. Top rebounder Jake Voskhul missed the Syracuse game because 
of a stress fracture in his left foot, and the injury flared again 
in the second half against Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Syracuse and Stanford games were followed by lackluster wins  
against Boston College and Seton Hall. The shooting was abysmal in 
that stretch (37 percent, 10-for-58 from 3-point range), even when 
Hamilton returned for the last two games. The Huskies averaged 57.7 
points, well off their league-leading 79.4 average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the things overlooked a little bit is that  
we've played not so good and we have one loss and that is something 
people don't realize and don't give enough credit for,'' Calhoun 
said. ``Twenty-three and one in most neighborhoods is pretty good. 
Some wins weren't pretty and I would agree with that, but we did 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said Voskuhl's practice time will be monitored closely  
as the Huskies chase their fifth outright league title in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is getting closer to his old self, scoring 21 points on  
5-for-16 shooting against Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a lot better,'' said Hamilton, who averages 21 points.  
``I wasn't settling for jump shots. I was driving to the basket. 
I'll be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton said the most important number on the stat sheet after  
the Rutgers game wasn't the 53 percent shooting, rather the 16 
assists, five of which were his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach said we weren't in a shooting slump, we were in a  
passing slump,'' Hamilton said. ``We just have to get the ball 
where we want like we always did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies' 10-week run at No. 1 had an entire state caught up  
in the possibility of a first Final Four appearance. Expectations 
haven't dropped even if fan grumbling has increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we looked closer to the team I remember two weeks  
ago,'' Calhoun said after the Rutgers game. ``I still believe we're 
one of the two best teams in the country and I think we've shown 
that by losing only one of 24 games.''

<HEADLINE> Dad Charged in Death of Second Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) -- A man charged with murdering his  
infant son for insurance money in 1987 has been accused of 
smothering his infant daughter six years earlier in another alleged 
insurance scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett Wilson, a convicted embezzler, was arrested Monday at  
his home, where he lives with his fourth wife and their 5-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 42, pleaded innocent in the death of his son and will  
plead innocent to the latest charge, defense attorney Barry Helfand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett Michael Wilson was found dead in August 1987 in his  
crib. Medical examiners initially attributed both his death -- and 
that of 2-month-old Brandi Jean Wilson in May 1981 -- to Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson collected $150,000 in life insurance on the boy and  
$40,000 on Brandi, the daughter of Wilson and his second wife, 
Deborah Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, medical examiners changed the causes of death,  
ruling that both infants probably were smothered. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into the deaths was prompted by Mary Anastasi,  
Wilson's third wife and mother of the dead boy, who told police in 
1994 that she believed her son was murdered. The couple divorced in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has been free on $100,000 bond since June, following his  
arrest in his son's death. Trial in that case is set for July 19.

	Clinton Pushes Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton made his case today for  
shoring up Social Security and Medicare to people who might be 
called the ``sandwich'' generation: college students who could get 
stuck supporting their parents while trying to raise families of 
their own. In a satellite-linked address to college campuses across 
the country, Clinton drew sharp distinctions between his proposed 
use of federal budget surpluses to reinforce the retirement system 
and the Republican idea of using the extra cash to slash taxes by 
10 percent across the board. Clinton criticized the GOP's focus, 
saying that splurging with the budget surplus today instead of 
investing in the future would ``tie the hands of future decision 
makers.''

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Offering his strongest statement to date on  
whether he is going to run for president in 2000, Gov. George W. 
Bush said today: ``I'm warming to the task.'' But the Republican, a 
leader in several recent polls on the 2000 race, repeated that he 
still hasn't made up his mind. Bush spoke after a meeting with 
legislative leaders from New Jersey and South Carolina.

	3 Kurd Protesters Killed in Berlin

<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Israeli security guards shot and killed three  
Kurds who forced their way into the Israeli consulate today with 
dozens of protesters enraged by reports that Israel aided in the 
arrest of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that Israel had no role in 
the arrest and defended the shootings, saying the guards acted in 
self-defense. Meanwhile, Turkish officials released a videotape of 
Ocalan that showed him handcuffed and sweating, his eyes taped 
shut. Ocalan has waged a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in 
southeastern Turkey.

	15 Die Under Oregon Suicide Law  
</P>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- In the first year under the nation's only  
assisted-suicide law, 15 terminally ill people in Oregon used it to 
end their lives, and there was no evidence they suffered painful, 
lingering deaths. In a report published in tomorrow's New England 
Journal of Medicine, Oregon health officials also said that fears 
that the law would be used as an easy way out by people afraid of 
financial ruin or extreme pain proved unfounded. Rather, health 
officials found that use of the law has so far been driven 
overwhelmingly by the desire of strong-willed patients to exercise 
some control over the way they died.

	North Korean Population Shrinks  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's population has shrunk by  
as many as 3 million people in the past four years because of 
famine, South Korean intelligence officials said today, citing a 
classified North Korean survey. The survey by the North's Public 
Security Ministry confirms widespread Western reports that more 
than 500,000 North Koreans have died of hunger each year since 
1995. Massive floods swept much of North Korea in 1994 and bad 
weather in successive years caused the food shortage to become 
acute.

	Freighter May Have Spilled More Oil

	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- The Coast Guard said about 70,000 gallons  
of molasses-like fuel oil may have spilled from a grounded 
freighter -- more than 30,000 gallons than originally believed. A 
salvage tug was expected to drag the carcass of the New Carissa 
about 200 miles into the Pacific Ocean, possibly at high tide 
today. With the bow still containing about 135,000 gallons of fuel 
oil, Navy officials believe sinking the 440-foot front section will 
help contain the gooey liquid.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles signed free agent  
Doug Pederson to a $4.5 million, three-year contract to be the 
starting quarterback for the NFL's worst offense. Pederson, 31, has 
never started an NFL game and had thrown just 32 regular-season 
passes in the league during a career that began in 1992 on the 
Dolphins' practice squad. He has been Brett Favre's backup the last 
four seasons. The Eagles scored only 161 points last season.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Aid Disputed in Gondola Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A pilot who took an inventory of the  
contents of a Marine jet after it sliced through a ski gondola 
cable in the Italian Alps testified Wednesday that he didn't find 
any written altitude rules but that they somehow turned up later 
among the items. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Capt. Bryan Thayer took the stand at the court-martial of  
the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, who is charged with 
involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of 20 people aboard the 
gondola last February. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said that after the accident, he helped make a list of  
the items in the cockpit of the EA-6B Prowler, and the ``pilot 
aid'' wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``pilot aid'' is a quick reference that is supposed to be in  
the cockpits of military jets. It spells out the altitude rules and 
speed limits for the route being flown. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the material appeared in a bag of maps and charts that  
had been taken from the cockpit, Thayer said. He said he did not 
remember seeing anyone put it there. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force officer has testified the pilot aid was indeed  
among the items taken from the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, could get more than 200 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ashby was flying too low and too fast when he  
hit the cable, which wasn't on a government-issued map he was 
using. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have contended that the Air Force did not  
share up-to-date flight restrictions with the Marine crews based at 
the air base in Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Marc Rogers, however, testified that all air  
crews were apprised of new flight rules at regular briefings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said U.S. squadrons in Italy were under a 2,000-foot minimum  
altitude restriction when the gondola cable was cut -- not 1,000 
feet as previous testimony indicated. The cable was about 360 feet 
above ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the minimum altitude was doubled to 2,000 feet in  
November 1997 because of concerns low-flying jets might trigger 
avalanches in the winter. He said the restriction changed back to 
1,000 feet in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, goes on trial  
next month on the same charges. Two back-seat crewmen, who received 
immunity from prosecution, are expected to testify this week.

<HEADLINE> TWA Has Loss; Plans Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines posted wider losses for  
the fourth quarter and the full year and said it plans to cuts 
1,000 jobs this year, or about 4.7 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts will be made mostly through attrition, and the  
company provided no details today on where the cuts will be made. 
TWA has 21,200 employees in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA lost $79.1 million in the fourth quarter, blaming more than  
half of that on special charges related to cutting overhead and 
upgrading fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline company also lost $120.5 million for the year. It  
hasn't had an annual profit since 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly loss reported Wednesday amounted to $1.30 a share  
for the period ending Dec. 31. It lost $31.2 million, or 62 cents a 
share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Before extraordinary items, TWA lost 62 cents per share for the  
latest quarter. That was a smaller loss than analysts had 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA cited $42.6 million in extraordinary expenses in the fourth  
quarter. The company spent $25 million to retire outdated 727s and 
DC9s and $17.6 million to restructure operations in Israel, Italy 
and elsewhere, and to close its Los Angeles reservations office. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the special charges, TWA would have lost $34.5 million  
in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealing with these issues is neither easy nor inexpensive,''  
TWA chairman and chief executive Gerald Gitner said. ``However, it 
is something that must be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA officials have said they expect about 1,000 job losses in  
1999, mostly through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $747.1 million,  
down from $812.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, TWA's loss came to $2.35 per share compared to  
losses of $110.8 million. or $2.37 per share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual revenue decreased to $3.26 billion from $3.33 billion a  
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Market Turns Mixed; Dow Up 38.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials climbed out of an  
early slump to show moderate gains by late morning, but the Nasdaq 
composite was still lower amid disappointment over Dell Computer's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
38.12 at 9,335.15, having bailed out of a 77-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned mixed after a weak morning. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.31 at 1,247.18, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 14.85 at 2,299.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues still outnumbered advancers on the big board by  
by a 9-to-8 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume 
came to 309.86 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of those indicators impressed Larry Lawler, manager of  
equity trading Dreyfus Corp. ``Until I see a better tone to the 
market in general, not just one day to the next, a better 
advance-decline ratio, then I'll get a little more excited about 
the market. But until then, I think we're just going to tread 
water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's fourth-quarter earnings, released late Tuesday, met  
analysts' expectations of 31 cents a share. But its revenues didn't 
grow as much as analysts had hoped. Dell's shares were down 6 11/16 
at 82 1/16 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related shares were mostly lower. Dow component  
Hewlett-Packard was down 13/16 at 69 11/16. The computer maker's 
earnings, also released late Tuesday, beat analysts' per-share 
expectations, but its 1 percent revenue growth did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Applied Materials, which also reported earnings late Tuesday,  
was up 2 3/4 at 70 5/8 in Nasdaq trading. Applied Materials posted 
operating income of 11 cents a share, above analysts' consensus 
target of 6 cents, but well below last year's 52 cents. Revenue 
fell to $742 million from $1.31 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials, however, were led higher by General Motors,  
up 3 7/16 at 86 1/2; and American Express, up 2 1/8 at 104 5/16. United 
Technologies was up 2 5/8 at 123 3/4. The company's chief investment 
officer confirmed Tuesday that United Technologies' automotive unit 
is up for sale.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Explains Decision on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The foreign minister of Cyprus says his  
government's decision not to deploy Russian air-defense missiles 
gives the Clinton administration an opening to take a ``more 
convincing'' approach to Turkey in mediating the island's future. 
</P>
<P>
	The minister, Yiannakis Cassoulides, told a reporter Wednesday  
after a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that he 
does not expect a reciprocal gesture from Turkey for the decision 
on the S-300 missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, it ``creates opportunities for the United States  
to be more convincing toward the Turks'' on a Cypriot proposal to 
reunite the divided island. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey supports a separate Turkish Cypriot state set up after  
Turkish troops invaded Cyprus in 1974 and took control of about 35 
percent of the island's northern part. No other country has 
recognized the division. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Albright said U.S. relations with Cyprus are  
``very close,'' with the two governments cooperating against 
terrorism and narcotics traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	She praised as courageous Prime Minister Glafcos Clerides'  
decision not to deploy the Russian missile system and urged all 
sides to work with the U.N. representative in Cyprus, Ann Hercus. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassoulides said their meeting was ``extremely useful.'' The  
foreign minister said his country had demonstrated it can be a 
reliable friend to all nations.

<P>
	Afterward, he said Albright had reaffirmed a U.S. commitment to  
seek a solution for Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sandy Berger, President Clinton's senior national  
security adviser, said the administration has afforded a high 
priority on the pursuit of a Cyprus accord, but no breakthrough has 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Holbrooke, the American diplomat who played a major role  
in promoting a settlement in Bosnia in 1995, took on a Cyprus 
settlement as a personal task. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassoulides said Wednesday he hopes Holbrooke would remain  
involved even after the Senate approves his nomination to be U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassoulides said Tuesday in New York that he hopes shuttle  
diplomacy by U.N. envoy Hercus ``will prepare the ground for the 
secretary-general to convene talks between the two sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When that is going to take place, I don't know,'' he told  
reporters after meeting Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> Heinz To Cut As Many As 4,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. will cut as many as 4,000 jobs  
during the next four years, sell its Weight Watchers diet classes 
and close some factories to boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to concentrate on food products, including  
Heinz ketchup and Star-Kist tuna, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	William R. Johnson, Heinz's president and chief executive  
officer, described the four-year plan, dubbed ``Operation Excel,'' 
to financial analysts in Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is regrettable that a necessary consequence of the  
restructuring process is a reduction of the global work force,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz executives want to save $2.5 billion during the next four  
years to reinvest in Heinz brands and $100 million to market food 
in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the company will lay off at least 3,000 workers by  
closing 15 to 20 factories and reducing operations at least 10 
others. Production will be expanded at 13 to 15 other factories to 
help centralize manufacturing, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Ted Smyth said officials have yet to decide  
which factories will close or lose production. Heinz has 100 
factories and 40,500 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Heinz employees in Pittsburgh said they were not worried.  
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Mullin, a 53-year-old driver, said workers were told  
Tuesday that the layoffs would affect mostly workers overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one here thinks their job's out the window,'' he said at a  
diner across the street from the plant. The Pittsburgh plant makes 
baby food, soup, pickles and condiments for restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Smyth said the plan includes 1,100 previously announced layoffs  
from the move of Ore-Ida Foods and Weight Watchers Gourmet Food Co. 
to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weight Watchers classes, a $400 million annual business,  
represent a small part of Heinz' annual $9.5 billion in sales. 
Weight Watchers foods, publications and classes earn about $1 
billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Smyth said the new owner will buy the franchise name along with  
the classes. Heinz will keep the Weight Watchers line of frozen 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Weight Watchers was founded by Albert Lippert and Jean Nidetch  
after Lippert took a diet class led by Nidetch in 1963. The 
co-founders sold the diet plan to Heinz for $72 million in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Smyth said the sale of the diet business will enable Heinz to  
focus on its six core food products: ketchup, relishes and other 
condiments; frozen foods like Ore-Ida potatoes, Bagel Bites and 
Weight Watchers; tuna; soups and pasta meals; baby foods; and pet 
foods like 9-Lives and Kibbles 'n Bits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those foods will be promoted in the United States, England,  
Italy, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Heinz  
shares fell 81 1/4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $54.81 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Astros Want Clemens Issue Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane wants the  
Roger Clemens issue resolved this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Astros starting spring training Thursday, management  
wants to know whether the defending NL Central champions will 
obtain the five-time Cy Young Award winner from Toronto, McLane 
doesn't want trade talks to drag on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he and I agree that it would be a distraction to our  
club that we'd like to try to avoid,'' general manager Gerry 
Hunsicker said Wednesday. ``I will defer that final decision to him 
but clearly, before the full camp opens next week, we'd like to see 
this thing over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash had hoped to trade Clemens in  
December, but it didn't happen, with Hunsicker blasting Clemens' 
request for a $27.4 million, one-year extension, which would have 
essentially given him a $43.5 million, three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk to Gord pretty often but I don't want to characterize  
our talks,'' Hunsicker said. ``It's very difficult when this is 
made public and everyone is looking for the inside scoop. So we're 
just continuing to explore all the options that we can think of and 
hopefully we can find one that makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays want center fielder Richard Hidalgo and pitcher  
Scott Elarton, two promising young players McLane is unwilling to 
give up. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens appeared to take himself off the market on Dec. 22 when  
he rescinded the Dec. 2 trade demand, which had triggered talks 
with the Astros, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Texas 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hunsicker criticized Clemens, the pitcher said he wouldn't  
play for the Astros as long as team president Tal Smith and 
Hunsicker remained. But Clemens later appeared to soften his 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, 36, won his second straight Cy Young Award last season  
after going 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers general manager Doug Melvin says the Rangers are still  
interested in Clemens, but declined to elaborate. The Rangers 
attempted to acquire Clemens throughout December but they would not 
part with left fielder Rusty Greer.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Suspect Linked to Truck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A former girlfriend of murder defendant  
John William King testified Wednesday she saw him and two 
companions drive off in the gray pickup truck that allegedly was 
used later that night to drag a black man to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Keisha Adkins, 21, said she saw the men leave about 1:30 a.m. on  
June 7. Prosecutors say that about an hour later, 49-year-old James 
Byrd Jr. was chained to the truck and dragged nearly three miles 
until his body was torn to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a white 24-year-old unemployed laborer, could get the  
death penalty if convicted. Two other white men, Lawrence Russell 
Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen Berry, 23, also are charged in the 
crime and will be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I remember right, Shawn was driving, Russell was in the  
middle and Bill was on the passenger side,'' Ms. Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness also has linked the primer-gray-colored pickup  
to Byrd's death. The truck was identified as belonging to Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also have said traces of Byrd's blood have been  
found on the truck, and on sandals worn by King. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins, who is married, said she has known King for nearly a  
decade and once had romantic feelings for him. She said he invited 
her to his Jasper apartment the night of June 6-7 and she spent 
about three hours with him before leaving around 1:30 a.m. She said 
the three men also left the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said that King carried out the crime because he  
wanted something ``dramatic'' to help recruit members for a white 
supremacist group he was organizazing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins testified there was no talk of race during her visit  
to King's apartment.

<HEADLINE> New Manager, Outlook for Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Malone spent the offseason retooling  
the Los Angeles Dodgers with a couple of big trades and the 
commitment of millions of dollars to players -- mostly to Kevin 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the general manager says, the real fun begins.  
</P>
<P>
	``The organization was in a place where we needed to make a lot  
of changes,'' he said. ``The last five months, there's been a lot 
of hard work. Right now, the light at the end of the tunnel is 
growing larger and larger. We'll soon be involved in actual 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and catchers report Thursday to Vero Beach, Fla., for  
perhaps the final spring training at Dodgertown, with the rest of 
the team due Feb. 24. The exhibition schedule opens March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sanctuary is the game itself,'' Malone said. ``I was one of  
those guys who always loved to practice because I loved the game. 
I'm getting excited, knowing that the beginning of the season and 
the coming together of what I believe is a championship club is 
getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've positioned ourself on paper to be a championship club.  
Now, we've got to work real hard and get it done on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new faces will be plentiful, headed by manager Davey  
Johnson, hired by Malone in October. No team of Johnson's has ever 
finished lower than second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there's Brown, a 33-year-old right-hander who  
signed a record $105 million, seven-year contract to anchor the 
starting rotation, a deal that caused many major league owners to 
lambaste Rupert Murdoch, head of the Dodgers' new owner, Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new faces include catcher Todd Hundley, center fielder  
Devon White, and relievers Alan Mills, Mel Rojas and Greg Cadaret. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are catchers Charles Johnson and Tom Prince,  
infielder-outfielder Bobby Bonilla, relievers Mark Guthrie and 
Scott Radinsky, and outfielder Roger Cedeno. 
</P>
<P>
	And that doesn't even count the in-season transformation last  
year, which included the departure of catcher Mike Piazza and the 
arrival of outfielder Gary Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, just 17 players remain from the 40 on the roster at the  
start of spring training a year ago. Malone thinks the offseason 
moves have made the Dodgers, who were 83-79 in 1998, World Series 
title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about this team, I'm excited,'' he said.  
``I'm energized by the potential. What we've got to do is make sure 
our focus is clear, come together and learn, get to know each 
other, get on the same page as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More deals could come. There are six legitimate contenders for  
five berths in the starting rotation: Brown, Chan Ho Park, Darren 
Dreifort, Ismael Valdes, Dave Mlicki and Carlos Perez -- the only 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are two seasoned shortstops: Mark Grudzielanek and  
Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe competition is healthy,'' Malone said. ``We have a  
surplus as far as starting pitchers and middle infielders is 
concerned. To me, that's a strength. We'll see how things progress 
in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your ears are always open. Every day you look for ways to  
improve your club. I don't anticipate any major deals. I don't feel 
right now there are a lot of question marks as far as this club is 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone also refuted a recent newspaper report that outfielder  
Raul Mondesi, listed in last year's media guide as weighing 215 
pounds, had ballooned to 275. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was erroneous; he left here the other day at 240,''  
Malone said. ``He's 15 or 20 pounds heavier than where he'll be on 
opening day.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Leaders Debate 2000 Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Organized labor leaders, hoping to reclaim the  
House for Democrats and influence other political campaigns, agreed 
Wednesday to pour more than $40 million into the 2000 elections and 
start spending the money earlier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	A measure approved by the AFL-CIO executive council at its  
winter meeting here requests each affiliate union to donate $1 per 
member -- about $13.5 million a year for two years -- to mobilize 
union voters. Coupled with political money in regular budgets, the 
federation's spending for 2000 campaigns would total $40 million to 
$46 million, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what we raise, we will be out-raised by the business  
community 10 to 1,'' said Gerald McEntee, president of the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hatch, executive director of the GOP House campaign  
committee, said the labor federation's action ``should be a wakeup 
call to every working American and every business owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``... If they don't participate in the 2000 election cycle, the  
liberal elite and unions will attempt to buy the next Congress to 
install their agenda of backroom politics,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	McEntee told reporters after the private vote that none of the  
AFL-CIO money will go to candidates or political parties. Instead, 
he said, it will pay for telephone banks, flyers at workplaces, 
newsletters, mailings and television advertising to educate union 
and minority voters about key legislative issues in a drive that 
will start almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Such grass-roots efforts almost always benefit Democrats over  
Republicans. ``Winning back the House is a big goal,'' McEntee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor spent nearly as much money in the 1996 presidential  
election cycle. This time, however, the effort is starting a year 
earlier, creating a continuous campaign cycle for labor's political 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they talked boldy about winning back the House for  
Democrats, some union leaders said they won't shy away from 
supporting moderate Republicans who support their issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters President-elect James P. Hoffa interrupted a hallway  
interview to shake the hand of GOP Rep. Peter King, a moderate from 
New York. Turning away, Hoffa called King the kind of Republican 
labor can't avoid supporting, saying, ``We're certainly aware of 
who our friends are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton was a popular topic of discussion in the  
bars and hallways of the resort hotel that hosted the meeting. A 
longtime adviser, Harold Ickes, was quietly gauging support for a 
possible Senate bid in New York. New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli, 
head of the Democratic Senate campaign committee, was said to be 
urging labor leaders to encourage her to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she has some pretty good credentials to be elected to  
the Senate,'' said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who bypassed  
a presidential bid to seek the speaker's chair, addressed a private 
session of the executive council, looking for early money and 
organizational support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are definitely trying to get on this quickly and it's not  
just because there's a presidential campaign,'' Gephardt said at a 
news conference. ``I believe ... work on all of these challenges -- 
recruiting good candidates, helping them run a good campaign, 
helping them raise the resources they need to run -- is a long 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I also believe get-out-the-vote efforts have suffered in the  
past because they're (organized) at the end'' of too many 
campaigns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who wants the AFL-CIO endorsement in the  
Democratic presidential primary, addresses the group Friday. His 
only challenger so far, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, 
appears Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior AFL-CIO official, also speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the endorsement likely won't be settled before the 
fall. Two AFL-CIO affiliates have already endorsed Gore, but he is 
not popular with industrial unions; Bradley's standing is no 
better, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	With organized labor's help, House Democrats gained five seats  
in the November elections and need to net just six more to reclaim 
the chamber in 2000. Democrats also hope to narrow the Senate gap -- 
now at 55 Republicans, 45 Democrats -- and retain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1-per-member goal would give the AFL-CIO $27 million over  
two years to mobilize union voters. The effort would begin in about 
35 marginal congressional districts and 20 states, said a top 
political adviser for the unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The states were chosen because of their strategic importance in  
the presidential campaign and the once-a-decade redistricting 
process, where governors and state legislators redraw the political 
maps. Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Michigan are among 
the states targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions in the targeted areas will launch massive communications  
efforts to tell voters how their politicians stand on labor's 
laundry list of issues, such as education, health care, Social 
Security and the minimum wage.

<HEADLINE> NBC Holds Lead in February Sweeps / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC maintained a lead during television's  
February ``sweeps'' period with a strong showing of its Thursday 
night lineup, while Stephen King faced a stormy reception on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of NBC's Thursday shows bettered their season averages,  
led by ``ER.'' The medical drama was the week's most popular show 
as viewers flocked to George Clooney's penultimate appearance as a 
series regular. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 16 share, Nielsen Media  
Research said on Wednesday. CBS was second with a 9.4 rating and 15 
share, followed by ABC's 7.9 rating and 13 share and Fox's 6.7 and 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of NBC's miniseries, ``The '60s,'' finished in  
eighth place for the week. It gave the network solid ratings for a 
night when its traditional sitcoms have not been faring well. 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of ABC's Stephen King miniseries, ``Storm of the  
Century,'' finished in 10th place for the week. That's not as 
strong as past King-based series and was second in its time slot to 
CBS's movie, ``Deep in My Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also received criticism for running ``Storm of the Century''  
advertisements in a crawl beneath other prime-time programs, 
confusing some viewers who thought they were seeing a special news 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	While NBC's new ``Providence'' continues to shine, the news  
isn't so good for two CBS midseason replacements. ``Turks'' and 
``Magnificent Seven'' were both deep in the ratings pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling WB network has an unusually strong 3.7 rating and  
6 share for the week. Its family comedy, ``7th Heaven,'' finished 
with a bigger audience than any other series ever on the network. 
UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share, while Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' took back control of the evening news  
race after two weeks of domination by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' 
NBC had an 8.7 rating and 17 share in the week President Clinton's 
impeachent trial ended, and ABC had an 8.2 and 16. The ``CBS 
Evening News'' was at 7.7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.8; ``Frasier,'' NBC,  
17.4; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 14.9; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.9 ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.4; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 14.4; ``NBC 
Movie of the Week: The '60s, Part Two,'' NBC, 13.4; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: Deep in My Heart,'' CBS, 13.1; ``Storm of the Century,'' 
ABC, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> ABC Showed Less of Clinton Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the evening  
news show of choice for viewers suffering from Monica Lewinsky 
overload. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC broadcast gave two hours less airtime to Lewinsky than  
its rivals on NBC and CBS from when the sex scandal broke to 
President Clinton's acquittal in his impeachment trial last week, a 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' logged 826 minutes on the scandal, the  
``CBS Evening News'' 820 minutes, and ``World New Tonight'' 699 
minutes, according to the Tyndall Report, a newsletter than 
monitors the evening news shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC spent the fewest minutes on the scandal during 10 of the 14  
months it was in the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Friedman, executive producer of ``World News Tonight,''  
said the disparity surprised him because ABC made no conscious 
decision to underplay the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I'm not particularly concerned because I think  
our coverage was quite good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage for all networks was heaviest in September, when  
Kenneth Starr's report was released and video of Clinton's grand 
jury appearance was broadcast. The day Clinton was acquitted didn't 
even make it to the top eight nights of Lewinsky news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like not only had the general public decided that  
not much was at stake and Clinton was not going to be removed, the 
TV networks had decided it, too,'' said Andrew Tyndall, president 
of ADT Research. 
</P>
<P>
	In 56 weeks, the Lewinsky story logged 2,345 minutes of airtime,  
or 19 minutes less than the networks devoted to the O.J. Simpson 
case between the murders and his acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gulf War remains the most heavily covered story of the  
decade on the evening news.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Demand Cleaner Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to dramatically cut air pollution in  
the next decade, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to 
propose tough new requirements for cleaner cars and gasoline, 
including a dramatic reduction in pollution from popular sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft proposal could be sent to the White House for review  
as early as Friday, according to government sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations, which would go into effect in 2004,  
have been the subject of intense lobbying by both the auto and oil 
industries and could shape the kind of cars Americans will drive 
over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, automakers would be required to make popular  
sport utility vehicles, which now account for nearly half of the 
market, as pollution free as passenger cars, according to sources 
familiar with the general outline of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the largest SUVs would be given additional time  
to comply, however, according to one source, who like others who 
discussed the proposal, did so under conditions of not being 
further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA also plans to require oil companies to dramatically  
reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline sold nationwide. The 
low-sulfur gas will have to contain on average 30 parts per million 
sulfur. Outside of California, gasoline today has more than 10 
times that amount in most parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined to comment on the draft proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources and environmentalists, some of whom had been  
briefed on the proposed rules, said that they largely mirror the 
tougher emission requirements already planned in California, 
beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	That would include a reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions from  
cars from the current 0.4 grams per mile to 0.05 grams per mile in 
2004. The automakers already have committed to cutting these 
emissions to 0.2 grams per mile under a national low-emissions 
vehicle program beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said tailpipe releases of hydrocarbons and  
nitrogen oxide, both sources of urban smog, would be cut by as much 
as 90 percent from levels required today outside California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will dictate how clean cars will be in the first  
decades of the 21st century,'' said Michelle Robinson of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. Most important, she added, is that for the 
first time it will mean sharp reductions in emissions from SUVs, 
which, along with pickups and minivans, account for nearly half of 
the vehicles sold today. 
</P>
<P>
	William Becker, executive director of the association  
representing state air pollution control officials, said the 
tougher emission controls on both cars and SUVs will be essential 
if states are to meet future air quality mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	The cleaner gasoline alone is equivalent to taking 54 million  
cars off the road, said Becker, adding that the tougher tailpipe 
standards will be like removing an additional 50 million cars by 
the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules have been the focus of fierce lobbying by both the  
auto and oil industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, auto executives, meeting with EPA officials,  
argued that while they're ready to dramatically cut emissions on 
cars and many of the smaller and mid-size SUVs, they should be 
given more time, and face less stringent standards, for the larger 
SUVs such as the Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told them we can do most of what you want, but just can't  
get as low or as fast as you want'' on the larger sport utility 
vehicles, said one auto executive who has been involved in the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The large SUVs are among the best sellers in showrooms. Last  
year they accounted for 28 percent of the SUVs sold, compared to 24 
percent a year earlier, according to Ward's Automotive, which 
tracks auto industry sales. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources, the EPA may still give some flexibility to  
automakers on meeting the tougher emission standards for the larger 
SUVs as long as manufacturers meet their overall fleet averages. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil executives said the cleaner low-sulfur gasoline would cost 5  
to 6 cents a gallon more to produce. The more stringent tailpipe 
emission requirements may add $160 to $200 to the cost of a car, 
according to EPA and California state agency estimates.

<HEADLINE> Mardi Gras Starts in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The wild Mardi Gras party in the French  
Quarter was still roaring at midnight when police finally convinced 
Richard Titus to call it a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't quit until you have to,'' said Titus, 32, of  
Cleveland, strutting down Bourbon Street in a skimpy French maid's 
outfit, complete with black fishnet stockings and spiked heels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else can you live out your fantasies and help everyone  
else live out theirs and do it legally?'' he asked early today, 
bound for a bed to sleep off the hours of full-tilt partying. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine, temperatures in the 70s and an extra day off  
contributed to what officials say may have been the biggest Mardi 
Gras crowd ever as New Orleans wrapped up Carnival season with its 
annual bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much bigger than last year,'' said police spokesman Marlon  
Defillo. ``We had 1.5 million people then. We'll have over 2 
million this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satin-clad angels rubbed elbows with devils, clowns and cowboys  
along St. Charles Avenue, the mansion-lined parade route where 
floats and marching bands sashayed until dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Balconies along the narrow old streets were crowded with people  
tossing beads to the throngs below. Although officially illegal, 
many flashed flesh for the gaudy mock jewels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you believe I'm normally a very shy person?'' asked  
Linda Kelly, 24, of Dallas, giggling as photographers snapped away 
while she gave an impromptu striptease. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few arrests in the French Quarter, Defillo said,  
but they were all misdemeanors -- nudity, urinating in public, 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real good group,'' Defillo said. ``No problems at all,  
really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the original hoot and holler,'' said Don Hebert, who  
rode a float in the Zulu parade. ``It's like stepping outside your 
life for a day. I pity anyone who misses it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the bash for Mardi Gras was billed as the last noisy fling  
before Lent, celebrators in New York City on Tuesday were more 
subdued at the beginning of the lunar New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	For a third year, City Hall cited safety in banning all  
fireworks and firecrackers, the traditional way Chinese, Koreans, 
Cambodians, Tibetans and Vietnamese have scared off evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	The fireworks in Chinatown were fake, with bright red confetti  
shooting out of exploding pods to usher in Year 4697 -- the Year of 
the Rabbit -- instead of brilliant pyrotechnics. Eleven-year-old 
Debbie Cheung wasn't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds cheap,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 15  
</P>
<P>
	Deming (N.M.) Headlight, on President Clinton's acquittal:  
</P>
<P>
	Undoubtedly, hard feelings will linger resulting from Clinton's  
attempted coverup of an affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and Congress have a duty to put aside grudges and  
work in the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Clinton could spend the next two years finding ways to  
defeat any Republican who voted for his removal. And the 
Republican-led Congress could thwart any initiative pushed by 
Clinton. Or a scandal-starved media could unfold some new 
conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
	But where will antagonism and partisanship get us in the long  
run? ... 
</P>
<P>
	So both Clinton and Congress must strive to find common ground --  
and surprisingly enough, there is some on such issues as Social 
Security, Medicare and national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made big mistakes in hiding his affair with Lewinsky.  
But the Senate has issued its verdict and the matter is closed -- at 
least in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The pundits have missed the mark many times during the 13-month  
Clinton-Lewinsky saga. But now they're giving some good advice to 
the country: Let's move on. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Newt Gingrich's  
vindication: 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service has belatedly cleared former U.S.  
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of the main charge that led to his 
reprimand by the House of Representatives two years ago. The House 
should at least reconsider the $300,000 fine it imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax charges involved a college class that Gingrich was paid  
to prepare and teach at two Georgia colleges in 1993 and 1994. The 
course, ``Renewing American Civilization,'' was financed by 
tax-exempt donations to the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a 
nonprofit offshoot of the GOPAC political action committee headed 
by Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	The former speaker was reprimanded and fined by a vote of 395-28  
in early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The belated IRS opinion says the class ``taught principles that  
could be used by each American in everyday life, whether the person 
is a welfare recipient, the head of a large corporation, or a 
politician'' and was not biased toward particular politicians or a 
particular party and satisfied educational criteria set forth in 
the tax code. No more than an incidental private benefit was 
provided to Gingrich, GOPAC, and other Republican entities, the 
opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House should correct its record on Gingrich and find out why  
it took the IRS so long to clear (his) name. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 14  
</P>
<P>
	Houston Chronicle, on end of impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans are no doubt relieved that the impeachment trial  
of William Jefferson Clinton is finally over. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, at least, President Clinton appears contrite. ...  
</P>
<P>
	Fine words to mark the end of a troubling time. But, though the  
deceitful Clinton was acquitted, he cannot be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the nation should move on. ...  
</P>
<P>
	... We can only hope that Clinton and the Congress will put  
aside any bitterness and honestly work together. There is much 
important work to do. 
</P>
<P>
	If gloating on the one hand and pouting on the other can be  
dispensed with, there is one important silver lining in which 
Americans on both sides of the Clinton scandal should take comfort. 
It is that the process, as tortuous as it has been, is in place at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	We believe the impeachment experience has left the nation  
stronger, not weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole drama defines the singular greatness of the country  
and our Constitution. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line is the Constitution prevailed and the nation  
endures. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9:  
</P>
<P>
	Observer-Dispatch, Utica, N.Y., on soft money in state politics:  
</P>
<P>
	The state Board of Elections made headlines last week when it  
raised the limits on how much people could donate to political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board is not the bad guy. It was just carrying out a  
1994 state law enacted by the state legislators, who want the 
limits upped to account for inflation so that their re-election 
money-machines can take more and more. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the issue is not the rising costs of running for office,  
but ensuring that incumbents can build up huge campaign war chests 
-- using money donated by fat-cat lobbyists and those wanting 
special influence -- to intimidate any potential rivals. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The solution is very simple. New York needs new campaign finance  
laws. It needs to lower the limits on individual and political 
action committee donations, not pass a law to raise them. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As long as New York's government is controlled by the wallets of  
the lobbyists, the people of New York will never get all they 
should from Albany. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 15  
</P>
<P>
	The (Jacksonville) Florida Times-Union, on poor children:  
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, it was politically correct to think many  
impoverished children were going to bed with only crumbs -- or 
nothing at all -- for an evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's medically correct to think of them as being fat.  
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta  
reports 11.3 percent of all low-income children under 2 -- and 8.6 
percent of them between 2 and 4 years old -- are overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	A CDC employee said 38 percent of their household expenditures  
go for ``foods consumed outside the home.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, impoverished children are eating too many  
Twinkies and candy bars instead of nutritious and relatively 
inexpensive home-cooked meals. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 12  
</P>
<P>
	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on the Rev. Jerry Falwell and  
Teletubbies: 
</P>
<P>
	If you thought the sex police were at their most vindictive in  
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, you haven't heard about the Rev. Jerry 
Falwell's attack on Tinky Winky, the biggest of the Teletubbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell, in the current issue of his National Liberty Journal, a  
monthly magazine, has outed the amorphous character as a gay role 
model for young, impressionable children. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally we have been in the thrall of the absolutist sex  
police, who insist they are totally right with the same fervor 
Falwell seems intent on continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	It is this mentality that so turned off so many of us from the  
House impeachment ado. 
</P>
<P>
	Their zealotry extended to other venues by Falwell and his ilk  
makes laughingstocks of its proponents and bewilders those who look 
at Teletubbies and see harmless characters. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 10  
</P>
<P>
	Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash., on Mike Tyson:  
</P>
<P>
	Even the Nevada Gaming Commission could have trouble finding a  
way for Mike Tyson to attend his next tentatively scheduled fight 
on April 24. He could still be in the slammer. Or, he might qualify 
for work release. It's very confused. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission reinstated the heavyweight fighter's license in  
October after a one-year suspension for biting Evander Holyfield's 
ear during a fight in June 1997. Of course, that followed the 
reinstatement of Tyson's license after he served a prison sentence 
for rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Tyson has been given a one-year jail term in Maryland for  
assaulting two motorists after a traffic accident. He may serve 
only 60 days and be eligible for work release during that time. The 
jail time or an appeal, though, could lead to a review of his 
parole in Indiana on the rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Tyson's inability to get along in civilized society is at  
odds with the ease with which he gets just about anything he wants 
out of boxing officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Their hunger for big dollars is matched only be their disdain  
for morality. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 8  
</P>
<P>
	The Intelligencer, Wheeling, W.Va., on education:  
</P>
<P>
	``Feds Differ on How to Fix Schools,'' said one recent news wire  
headline. The story went on to describe competing Clinton 
administration and congressional proposals to pour money into 
public school buildings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also is debating school issues such as curriculum  
policy. Education is popular with federal politicians because 
education in these prosperous, peaceful times ranks at or near the 
top of most polls of voter concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet education is and, despite federal meddling, should remain a  
local and state concern. Throughout the country, voters cast 
ballots in school board and bond elections, as well as for some 
state education posts. Local and state officials are more closely 
tied to schools in their areas, and certainly are better attuned to 
local school issues than any poll-driven pol in Washington ever 
could be. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the feds have a lot of money, a lot of power and  
polls that tell them they should ``do something'' about education, 
you can count on more federal intervention in education, not less. 
And as federal meddling increases, local authority decreases and 
voters look higher up the political food chain for help. It is a 
vicious cycle that seems unlikely to stop in a therapeutic age in 
which constitutional principle is cast as far out of cultural place 
as a zoot suit. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 14  
</P>
<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on impeachment trial of President  
Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate found President Bill Clinton not guilty on two  
charges of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction of justice. Since 
the possibility that he would be found guilty by a two-thirds 
majority of the U.S. Senate was always remote, the outcome of the 
impeachment trial was never in doubt. Nevertheless, the impeachment 
trial will have undesirable consequences because it has not only 
tarnished the prestige of the presidency but also undermined the 
public's faith in the U.S. Congress and the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Why did the Republican Party insist on going ahead with the  
impeachment trial? Some Republicans may have been posturing for the 
presidential and congressional elections scheduled for next year. 
Indeed the Republican Party has been accused of staging a partisan 
political drama, but this drama has been superimposed on a 
fundamental clash of values that is shaking American culture. ... 
The clash between the Republican conservatives and the president 
has been reduced to a culture war with no room for compromise. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 15  
</P>
<P>
	Financial Times, London, on the Clinton scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Starr, the U.S. independent prosecutor, should heed the  
call from Republican and Democratic senators and drop any plans he 
may be developing to mount a criminal prosecution of President Bill 
Clinton while in office. Indeed, Mr. Starr should now wind up his 
operation with all speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Starr has pursued Mr. Clinton with a single-minded and  
obsessive vigor. But now that the Senate has decided to acquit Mr. 
Clinton, he must accept its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Outstanding tasks remain. The reports on the Whitewater land  
deal and the White House travel office, which did not feature in 
the case against the president, should be produced quickly and 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	But a criminal indictment of Mr. Clinton while he is in office,  
reportedly under consideration, would go beyond the role of the 
independent prosecutor, which is to present the facts to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A Department of of Justice investigation of Mr. Starr's methods  
is also unnecessary. His zeal may have led to unseemly behavior, 
but investigating the investigator will only drag this sorry saga 
on longer. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 14  
</P>
<P>
	Le Monde, Paris, on the Senate's acquittal of President Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	In Hollywood and Washington alike, Americans like good to  
triumph over evil. Since the saga of Kenneth Starr has at last 
reached an ending, it's ``happily ever after'' for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans wanted to ruin the Democrat Bill Clinton for hiding  
his adulterous relationship with Miss Lewinsky. From crime to 
impeachment trial, the operation opened up floods of humiliating 
allegations about the president. The process should have given 
Republicans a boost, but ended in crushing defeat for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans were unlikely to get the 67 votes needed to  
depose Clinton, but on Friday they even failed to get a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky-Clinton affair goes beyond petty politics and the  
elections to come. It touches on the evolution of American society. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 16  
</P>
<P>
	Die Welt, Berlin, Germany, on diplomatic fight between Spain and  
Britain over Gibraltar: 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's foreign secretary, Abel Matutes, is sticking out his  
tongue at London. Hours-long security controls, not recognizing 
drivers' licences, forbidding civilian airplanes from flying over 
Spanish air space -- all this brings to mind the Berlin blockade. 
The Spanish government regards the British occupation of Gibraltar 
in 1704 as pure annexation. Spain wants to annul the Treaty of 
Utrecht, even though those who live in Gibraltar would rather 
remain British. In contrast to earlier times, when Spanish citizens 
worked in Gibraltar, and British citizens vacationed in Spain, 
Madrid has returned to the politics of the Iron Curtain, all 
because the British foreign secretary Robin Cook rejected an offer 
to share administration with Spain. A Cold War between two NATO and 
EU partners is a disagreeable anachronism. For this reason it is 
all the more important that the topic is discussed Sunday when 
European foreign ministers meet. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 15  
</P>
<P>
	Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	There is a second chance for peace in Kosovo. The negotiations  
in Chateau Rambouillet are going on for another week. ... The offer 
from the Balkan Contact Group stands until next Saturday. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement represents the last chance for Yugoslavia to  
protect at least a small part of its sovereignty over the southern 
province. If Slobodan Milosevic were a rational politician, he 
would accept it. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 17  
</P>
<P>
	La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on Abdullah Ocalan's capture:  
</P>
<P>
	Kurds' demonstrations all over Europe following Abdullah  
Ocalan's capture took us by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But we were certainly not surprised to see that the European  
Union, before these events, stayed silent and inert. ... 
</P>
<P>
	All the European countries have good reasons to try and stay  
away from the Ocalan case. Germany has to think about two million 
Turks and half a million Kurds residing on its territory and about 
the possible risks for its public order. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece has already very difficult relations with Turkey. In  
Italy, part of the leftist parties have close ties to the PKK and 
the volatile government majority might split over Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the truth remains that the Kurds are a nation, the PKK is a  
party, and that the European Union is neither one, nor the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kurdish problem might even be impossible to solve. But  
Europe doesn't have the courage to either to face it or simply deny 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	As it always happens in these cases, Europe could only cover its  
weakness with silence. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 17  
</P>
<P>
	Maariv, Jerusalem, on capture of Abdullah Ocalan:  
</P>
<P>
	The government of Turkey will be sorry that the leader of the  
Kurdish underground, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured. The Kurds will 
express their feelings not only in the streets of Europe but also 
through terror acts in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	World opinion tends to see people like Ocalan as freedom  
fighters. Ocalan's trial will need to stand the test of Western 
norms. If he is sentenced to death, the leaders of the world will 
act for his amnesty. The Kurds will take hostages in an effort to 
win the freedom of their leader. The struggle for Kurdish 
independence will be renewed. ... It's questionable if all this is 
worth the head of the leader of the underground, who was seen as an 
escaped terrorist. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 15  
</P>
<P>
	The Arab Daily, Amman, Jordan, on Saddam Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	For as long as Iraq is perceived a danger in the region, Arab  
countries will have no choice but to stay silent even when the U.S. 
military machine continues to pound one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	To start with, Saddam Hussein came out calling on Arab nations  
to overthrow their regimes; either in an attempt to warn Arab 
governments, or truly fanaticizing that the One Arab Nation will 
rise and heed his call. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he alienates France, Russia and China, the countries that  
have done their best in his support at the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	And now comes this blatant threat that may bring another  
blizzard of foreign fire down on the heads of the Iraqis who have 
already endured years of misery and frustration. They surely don't 
need any more. 
</P>
<P>
	It is as good time as any for Saddam to wake up and realize that  
he's playing into the hands of those who wish to continue military 
action until he is no longer there. Then, he would have brought it 
all upon himself for real. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 16  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on the Asian economic crisis:  
</P>
<P>
	... The crisis is the result not of a foreign conspiracy to  
undermine this continent, but of a confluence of factors, both 
local and foreign. Avarice, corruption, feeble regulatory systems 
and the absence of transparency and accountability within were some 
of the evils that fed on the easy availability of fickle money from 
abroad, and inflow driven by the lust for short-term and often 
speculative gains. Once the game was up, foreign capital was up and 
away, leaving the International Monetary Fund to prescribe cures 
when prevention was what should have been enforced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	... It is reported that the setback in the region has cost  
American industries $30 billion in lost exports and caused layoffs 
in manufacturing and a shrinking of farm income. Asian countries 
trying to export their way out of the crisis could put more 
pressure on the U.S. trade deficit, to the point where there will 
be calls for protectionism there -- a development that would hurt 
exporters in many parts of the world. The Asian crisis is a truly 
global one.

<TEXT>

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell slightly Wednesday as  
investors took profits after Tuesday's sharp rise. Many Asian stock 
markets remained closed for the Chinese New Year, while trading was 
quiet in those that were open. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 14,158.67  
points, down 73.97 points, or 0.52 percent. On Wednesday, the 
average gained 177.92 points, or 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling by domestic institutional investors and renewed concerns  
about the health of the Japanese economy drove down share prices, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Wednesday that Japan's NEC  
Corp. is likely to post greater losses for the fiscal year ending 
March 31 than previously forecast, fueling fears that overall 
corporate earnings would be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed really. There aren't that many reasons to  
buy stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``While company earnings may stabilize with the government's  
efforts, there is still no sign of an economic recovery,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar continued a rally against  
the Japanese yen, which began on Tuesday after the Japanese Finance 
Ministry announced it would lower the yields of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 118.62 yen, up 1.62 yen from  
Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.74 yen 
overnight. The New York rate was the highest level for the 
greenback since Dec. 9, when it hit 118.75 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, shares plunged as local retail investors sold  
shares in financial and property stocks on market rumors that 
property company Quality Houses PCL failed to reach an agreement on 
debt restructuring with its lenders and might have to reduce its 
capital. The company later refuted the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index dropped 12.34 points, or  
3.5 percent, to 338.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and  
South Korea were closed for Chinese New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell slightly, with the index dragged  
down by late selling in PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia shares. The JSX 
Composite Index closed down 0.873 point, or 0.2 percent, at 397.975 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares ended nearly flat in thin trading. The  
PSE index fell 0.30 point to 1,918.57. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, led by  
telecommunications stocks and other blue chips such as the banks 
and News Corp. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,882.2, up 0.8 
percent, or 22.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed up, led by market  
bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital 
index closed at 2,183.25 points, up 1.5 percent, or 31.75 points.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Fossil Power To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Siemens Fossil Power Corp. will close its  
facility in West Allis, Wis., by the end of the year, eliminating 
most of the 850 jobs based there. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Allis facility makes combustion turbines to turn  
generators at power plants and also services combustion and steam 
turbines. It has about 250 hourly employees and 600 salaried 
employees, about 100 of whom are field service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the field service personnel will retain their positions  
after the closing, the company said, but a spokesman said the 
specific number hasn't been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	German powerhouse Siemens AG bought Westinghouse Power  
Generation last summer, creating Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp. 
The company had planned a worldwide restructuring of the fossil 
power plant business. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to West Allis, three other facilities will be closed  
or sold, and work at those sites will be transferred to other North 
American facilities. Those facilities are at Glassport, Pa.; 
Hobart, Ind.; and St. Catharines, Ontario. About 50 employees at 
each site will be affected, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Trevor Berbick Ordered From Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Trevor Berbick, the former  
heavyweight champion who beat Muhammad Ali in the boxing great's 
final fight, faces deportation and was ordered to return to his 
native Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian authorities took the action because Berbick was  
stripped of his landed immigrant status last summer for a series of 
criminal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Heisler of Citizenship and Immigration Canada said the  
45-year-old boxer was ordered from the country last August because 
of his ``criminality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is no longer a landed immigrant,'' he told The Canadian  
Press from his office in Halifax. ``Once he was ordered deported, 
his status was revoked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick, who returned to Canada about a year ago after living  
for more than a decade in Florida, is appealing the decision and 
has a March 8 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick won the Canadian heavyweight title Feb. 6 in Montreal,  
but authorities say he should not have even been allowed to fight 
for the crown because of his legal trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Professional Boxing Federation requires that anyone  
who fights for one of its titles be either a Canadian citizen or a 
landed immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick said he has no fear of what the future might bring.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's going to happen to me,'' Berbick told the Montreal  
Gazette on Wednesday night from his Montreal residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a citizen of the world. I have no problem living anywhere  
in the world; anywhere where God wants me to live. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won the title in the ring. I want to be champ. I don't worry  
about the allegations. I'm a clean man,'' Berbick professed. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick was convicted in 1992 of raping a family baby sitter in  
Florida. He was sentenced to four years in prison and resurfaced in 
Canada shortly after his release about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was convicted in 1992 of second-degree grand theft for  
forging his ex-wife's signature to get a $95,000 mortgage on his 
Florida home. 
</P>
<P>
	A year earlier, he was convicted of misdemeanor assault for  
attacking his former business manager, who testified Berbick put a 
gun to her head and accused her of stealing $40,000 from him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Hayter, president of the Canadian federation, said his group  
didn't question how Berbick could have returned to Canada. It also 
didn't seek proof of his immigration status before sanctioning the 
title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always represents himself as a Canadian,'' Hayter said.  
``The assumption was he is a Canadian boxer like he was before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there were no objections raised whatsoever at any  
step of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayter said the federation will await the outcome of Berbick's  
appeal before deciding whether to strip him of his title. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick moved to Halifax after fighting for Jamaica at the 1976  
Montreal Olympics. He left for Florida in the early 1980s after 
wins over John Tate and Ali put him in line for a shot at the world 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat Ali in 1981 in the Bahamas, a 10-round decision in a  
non-title fight that sent Ali into retirement. Berbick won the 
title in 1986 by beating WBC champion Pinklon Thomas.

	U.S. Prepares for Serbia Mission  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States ordered an additional 51  
American warplanes to Europe Wednesday for possible airstrikes 
against Serbia if a peace deal for Kosovo is not reached this 
weekend. Key to any peace agreement is the deployment of a 
30,000-strong NATO force in the province to ensure the deal is 
implemented. Belgrade's refusal so far to consider allowing such a 
force on Yugoslav territory has been a major roadblock in the 
talks. Demanding that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic change 
his mind by noon Saturday, James P. Foley, a State Department 
spokesman, said: ``If it would take some military action to force 
Mr. Milosevic to his senses, so be it.''

	Polish Parliament Votes on NATO  
</P>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland's parliament on Wednesday ratified  
the NATO treaty, one of the last formal steps for the Eastern 
European nation to enter the Western military alliance. Poland 
along with two other NATO newcomers -- Czech Republic and Hungary -- 
will formally join the defense pact on March 12 at the Harry S. 
Truman Library in Independence, Mo. Polish President Aleksander 
Kwasniewski has called the decision by Poland and its two former 
East bloc allies to join NATO ``one of the most important in the 
20th century'' because it ends the post-World War II divisions of 
Europe by victorious armies.

	Lewinsky Interview Limits Discussed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr is clearing the way for Monica  
Lewinsky to give her first television interview, but prosecutors 
and lawyers for the former White House intern are still discussing 
restrictions on what she can say. The main restriction is that 
Lewinsky cannot go beyond what she has said in her numerous 
interviews with prosecutors and in her grand jury testimony, 
according to sources. ABC is hoping to air Barbara Walter's 
interview with Lewinsky about her relationship with President 
Clinton during the February ratings ``sweeps'' period, which ends 
March 3. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Offers Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, delivering a  
satellite-linked address to college campuses across the country, 
made his case for shoring up Social Security and Medicare. He spoke 
to students who could get stuck supporting their baby boom parents 
while trying to raise families of their own. Clinton drew 
distinctions between his plan's use of federal budget surpluses to 
reinforce the retirement system and the Republican idea of using 
the extra cash to slash taxes by 10 percent across the board. 

</P>
<P>
	EPA To Demand Cleaner Vehicles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency will  
propose regulations to dramatically reduce pollution from 
automobiles including popular sport utility vehicles, according to 
sources. The draft proposal, which is still subject to review by 
the White House, also would require cleaner burning gasoline, 
containing significantly less sulfur, the sources said. The tougher 
pollution controls for motor vehicles would be phased in beginning 
in 2004. For the first time, most popular sport utility vehicles, 
minivans and pickup trucks would have to meet the same emission 
standards as automobiles, according to the proposal. Currently some 
SUVs release more than three times as much smog-causing chemicals 
as cars.

	Labor Leaders Debate 2000 Campaigns  
</P>

	MIAMI (AP) -- Organized labor leaders, hoping to reclaim the  
House for Democrats and influence other political campaigns, agreed 
to pour more than $40 million into the 2000 elections and start 
spending the money earlier than ever. A measure approved by the 
AFL-CIO executive council requests each affiliate union to donate 
$1 per member -- about $13.5 million a year for two years. That 
would be added to money already in regular budgets. None of the 
AFL-CIO money will go to candidates or political parties, one 
official said. Instead, it will pay for telephone banks, flyers, 
newsletters, mailings and television advertising.

a near-flawless second half to beat the sluggish Houston Rockets 
116-102 Thursday night. Marbury shot 16-for-24, and Kevin Garnett 
had 23 points, nine assists and nine rebounds. The victory gave the 
Wolves (5-2) their best start since joining the league in 1989 and 
moved them into a second-place tie with Houston in the Midwest 
Division, one game behind Utah.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Nears FCC Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are poised to give AT&AMP;T  
Corp. permission to acquire cable giant TCI in a deal that could 
give consumers one-stop shopping -- from local calling to high-speed 
Internet access -- over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is expected this week to  
clear the deal, which was valued at nearly $32 billion when it was 
announced in June, said government and industry officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the merger holds the promise of providing a new  
choice for local phone service -- a prospect appealing to 
regulators, who want to crack open local phone monopolies to 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, however, is not expected to force AT&AMP;T and  
TeleCommunications Inc. to provide other companies with access to 
TCI's high-speed cable TV lines. Consumer groups, America Online 
and others had been pressing for the agency to require AT&AMP;T to give 
other companies access to those lines to offer competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of AT&AMP;T overwhelmingly approved the deal at a  
meeting this morning in New Jersey. TCI shareholders were meeting 
in Colorado for a vote later today. The merger plan must also be 
approved by many local cable franchising authorities. Some local 
authorities want to provide rivals access to TCI's high-speed 
lines, but it's unclear if they would have the authority to force 
any changes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company and  
biggest provider of mobile phone services. TCI is the nation's 
second-largest cable TV company, with lines reaching one-third of 
all U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those TCI lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet and access 
online data at speeds as much as 100 times faster than conventional 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. More cable 
agreements are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes  
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional 
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T also will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge consumers extra if they got 
their Internet service over the merged companies' lines but wanted 
another Internet service provider, such as AOL. But federal 
regulators are not expected to set any conditions on that part of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department approved the merger in December on the  
condition that TCI sell its interest in a rival mobile phone 
company, Sprint PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FCC declined to open a proceeding that would  
force all cable companies to share their high-speed lines with 
rivals. But the agency said it would monitor the situation to make 
sure cable companies don't freeze out their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and AOL have pressed for the same mandatory  
access requirements they sought in the merger to apply to all cable 
companies. AT&AMP;T and TCI support voluntary agreements for businesses 
offering competing services to gain access to their high-speed 
cable lines.

<HEADLINE> French Sailor Rescued Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Giovanni Soldini navigated rough seas  
for nearly 24 hours to save a fellow sailor who capsized in a solo 
around-the-world yacht race. 
</P>
<P>
	As dawn broke Tuesday, Soldini found the yacht PRB, floating  
belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, sailing FILA, picked up a hammer on the third pass and  
threw it at the hull. The thud reached sleeping Frenchwoman 
Isabelle Autissier, who popped out of an escape hatch in the stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Dunning, the Around Alone race coordinator, said Soldini  
``found a needle in a haystack'' when the Italian yachtsman found 
Autissier more than a day after her 60-foot boat capsized in the 
Pacific Ocean between South America and New Zealand, the most 
desolate water on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Autissier is out of danger and out of the race, riding as  
a passenger aboard FILA. 
</P>
<P>
	The daring rescue was a perfect melding of seamanship,  
technology and tenacity, The (Charleston) Post and Courier 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't luck, race director Mark Schrader said. With Soldini,  
it was pure concentration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama began Monday with an electronic scream for help from  
an emergency beacon aboard Autissier's yacht. But when the fax 
arrived at race headquarters in Charleston, race officials weren't 
too concerned because the beacons often malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had already had three false alarms in the race,'' Dunning  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials, however, couldn't contact Autissier. Then they  
learned Autissier's computer system had conked out. That's when 
they began to get nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour later, Dunning got a call from Autissier's shore  
team in France. She had phoned them, saying she was capsized. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway between New Zealand and Cape Horn, the southern tip of  
South America, Autissier was as close to the middle of nowhere as 
you can get. And 40 mph winds were battering the violent stretch of 
40-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials began searching for ships in the area -- anybody  
who could help. It turned out Autissier's only chance would be 
another competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was sailing farther north than Autissier and leg leader  
Marc Thiercelin. The Italian skipper thought the weather to the 
south was too violent and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin was only 34 miles ahead of Autissier, but his boat,  
SOMEWHERE, had a busted boom and he didn't think it could turn and 
sail into the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Thiercelin was closer, Soldini could get there  
quicker than the Frenchman fighting against head winds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tense time for Schrader, who has lost a sailor on this  
leg of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just my nightmare,'' Schrader said. ``Losing Harry  
Mitchell four years ago, I didn't want to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, 200 miles to the north, didn't hesitate: ``I have 30  
knots of wind, and I'm not letting up until I have found Isa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini's white, arrowhead-shaped yacht crashed through 30-foot  
waves at a furious pace, averaging nearly 20 mph for hours at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	His course took him into a vicious Southern Ocean storm that  
whirled clockwise. And as Soldini neared Autissier's position, the 
winds shifted like the sweep hand of a clock. 
</P>
<P>
	When Soldini spotted PRB, there was no sign of Autissier.  
</P>
<P>
	Capsized, PRB still had its keel, pointing skyward like a  
stubby, flat mast. The wide, white hull looked like a whale's 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini sailed as close as he dared, turned around and sailed  
back. Then he threw the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside PRB's hull, Autissier had been asleep -- conserving energy  
and batteries. She hadn't expected a rescue so soon. The hammer was 
like an alarm clock. Autissier got up and made her way to the 
escape hatch, where she had a life raft waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	When she saw FILA, she got in and cast off from her yacht,  
drifting downwind so Soldini could pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 10 minutes after Soldini spotted PRB, he had Autissier  
on board. He sent a short, understated message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, this is FILA. Isabelle is on board with me, everything  
is OK. We are going to take Isa and go back in the race. Ciao, 
Gio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday afternoon, they were joking with race officials about  
being low on wine and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Autissier will continue on as a passenger.  
</P>
<P>
	When Soldini arrives in Punta del Este, Uruguay, he will be  
given time credit for the time he spent rescuing her -- probably 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no penalty for having Autissier on board. She just  
can't help him sail. As for the future, ``I'm going to take myself 
a nice cruise,'' Autissier told her shore crew.

<HEADLINE> Ex-USOC Boss Defends Salt Lake Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Salt Lake City's choice a decade ago as the  
American candidate for the Winter Games never was influenced by 
improper gifts from Utah bidders, a former official of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baaron Pittenger, the USOC's executive director when Salt Lake  
was picked in 1989, said there were no signs that officials of the 
bid were involved in anything like the behavior that has since 
become the center of the Olympics' greatest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excesses of Salt Lake City came after they lost to  
Nagano'' in 1991, he said. ``I don't think Salt Lake City did 
anything to win the U.S. bid that was significantly different from 
other cities in the same situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittenger said he had reviewed the selection many times in the  
two months since the Salt Lake scandal broke and was convinced the 
USOC decision was clean and correct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never a time when I was uncomfortable with the process,''  
Pittenger said in a telephone interview from his Colorado Springs, 
Colo., home. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that none of the more-than 100 USOC board members  
ever had mentioned receiving gifts higher than the $25 limit set by 
USOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever brought it up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After being designated the U.S. candidate over Anchorage,  
Alaska, and Reno, Nev., Salt Lake lost the '98 Winter Games to 
Nagano. It automatically re-entered the race for 2002 and won in a 
historic landslide vote by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That victory, however, is now the focus of at least five  
investigations of allegations that Salt Lake bribed IOC members 
with cash, scholarships, medical care, travel and other gifts. Nine 
IOC members have resigned or been expelled and 15 others have been 
implicated in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent ethics panel headed by former Senate Majority  
Leader George Mitchell is looking at the USOC's selection of Salt 
Lake and scheduled to release its findings March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC's outside counsel is questioning members of the USOC  
board, site selection commission and senior staff from 1988-89 
about any gifts over the $25 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Skiing Association executive director Howard  
Peterson has given investigators information about three USOC board 
members and their families he says accepted free ski vacations from 
Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Mercury News reported Wednesday that Jimmy Carnes,  
the former executive director of the national track and field 
federation and a former USOC board member, confirmed he and his 
family had taken a ski trip to Deer Valley, Utah, in 1989, with 
Salt Lake picking up the $889 tab. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnes said he never thought the trip violated USOC rules and  
never reported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittenger said he doubted that disclosure of such trips would  
have done anything to change the USOC's decision favoring Salt 
Lake. 
</P>

	``That would have been a major act that we just don't have any  
evidence to support,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Utah Probes Salt Lake Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah attorney general's office is  
investigating whether state laws were broken in Salt Lake City's 
bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed Richards, chief of the department's criminal division, said  
Wednesday the investigation will go beyond the accusations of 
unethical conduct levied last week against former Salt Lake bid 
executives Tom Welch and Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Jan Graham is not heading the investigation  
because she served for two months in the bid effort, attending two 
meetings in the late-1980s when Salt Lake was preparing a bid for 
the 1998 Games that eventually went to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Graham was a private lawyer with a Salt Lake firm.  
She was elected attorney general in 1992 and won a second term in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards said his investigation will build off the report of an  
ethics panel for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee that detailed a 
seven-year campaign of gift-giving and vote-influencing. The 
Justice Department is investigating whether federal laws were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Wilkinson, a former federal prosecutor who is representing  
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, has said she found no evidence 
of criminal misconduct in the ethics report filed two weeks ago 
with the SLOC board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richards said Wilkinson is ``not even from Utah'' and wasn't  
familiar with the state's laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you expect from somebody representing the other  
side?'' Richards asked. ``I've been a defense attorney. I don't 
think I've ever had a case where I said, `Yes, my client has broken 
the law.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Marc Hodler, the 80-year-old Swiss lawyer who made the  
first accusations of corruption in December, says he plans to visit 
Salt Lake to meet the new 2002 Games chief, Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do everything to help Salt Lake City,'' said  
Hodler, the International Olympic Committee member in charge of 
overseeing the 2002 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Expos To Address Future Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Expos will shed some light on their  
future at a news conference on Thursday, team president Jacques 
Menard says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good meeting of the shareholders. It was a positive,  
constructive meeting,'' was all Menard said following a 
shareholders meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is trying to raise enough money to finance a new  
stadium but nothing is in place. Shareholders have said they will 
try to sell the team, possibly to a buyer who would move the 
franchise to the United States, if a financing plan is not in place 
by March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said another shareholders meeting has been scheduled for  
March 11 in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the federal and provincial governments have said they will  
not offer financial help.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Foreign Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Foreign citizens have no right to be told  
they could be deported when they plead guilty to misdemeanors -- 
though it would be a good idea to tell them, a Texas court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals stems from an El  
Paso woman's claim that she would not have pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor shoplifting in 1994 had she known it could result in 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plea, coupled with a prior felony conviction, made Patricia  
Jimenez, a Mexican citizen, eligible to be kicked out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jimenez was a resident alien who had lived in the United  
States for 10 years and had four children who are American citizens 
when she filed her appeal in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She was facing a deportation hearing at the time, according to  
court records. 
</P>
<P>
	After a trial court and appeals court ruled in her favor, the  
state asked the appellate court to decide if defendants have a 
right to be informed of possible deportation after a misdemeanor 
guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	State laws only require officials to tell an alien defendant  
that a felony guilty plea could result in deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled the same requirements don't exist for  
misdemeanor cases. ``The better practice may be to admonish all 
defendants as to possible immigration consequences,'' the court 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jimenez' attorney, Monty Roberson, did not return phone  
calls from The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Lt. Gov. Finds Nothing To Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The first Republican to be elected  
lieutenant governor of Alabama this century may have to wait 
another 100 years before the Democrats give him something to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Windom spent $5.3 million to win the No. 2 spot in this  
heavily Democratic state. But a week before he could take office, 
the state Senate stripped the post of its most powerful duties -- 
appointing committees, picking committee chairmen and controlling 
the fate of many bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's move was instigated by Democratic Gov. Don  
Siegelman, who was lieutenant governor when he got elected last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman wanted to prevent Windom from carrying out a vow to  
block a vote on the new governor's No. 1 campaign proposal: 
creation of a state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We elected Siegelman governor. We didn't elect him dictator,''  
complained Windom, who has threatened to take the dispute to court. 
``Don Siegelman wants to be governor and lieutenant governor, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama is one of 18 states where the governor and lieutenant  
governor run separately and can be from different political 
parties. That was never a problem this century, since Alabama has 
pretty much been a one-party state for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But times are changing in the Deep South, and Republicans are  
making themselves heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom was heavily financed by business groups, which tangled  
with Siegelman for years over tort reform. Siegelman, who was 
lieutenant governor the past four years, was repeatedly blamed for 
the death of bills aimed at restricting punitive-damage verdicts by 
juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom pulled off a narrow victory over a senator who had been  
Siegelman's right-hand man. But the Democrats increased their 
majority in the Senate in the same election, giving them the 
numbers to strip Windom of his power. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Senate voted 18-17 to take away the lieutenant  
governor's power to appoint Senate committees and assign bills to 
committees for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, we won, but I don't think we got what we thought  
we were going to get,'' said Wayne Bonner, chairman of a 
construction industry political action committee that bankrolled 
Windom. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the power now rests with the Senate's top Democrat, who  
said the move was merely an effort to permit power to be held by 
the majority party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing the evolution of a two-party state,'' said Lowell  
Barron, Senate president pro tem. ``We're trying to organize like 
the U.S. Senate is organized and like most states are organized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some predict a backlash if Siegelman does not return power to  
Windom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have war,'' said Sen. Larry Dixon, a  
Republican.

<HEADLINE> Ex-USOC Boss Defends Salt Lake Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Salt Lake City's choice a decade ago as the  
American candidate for the Winter Games never was influenced by 
improper gifts from Utah bidders, a former official of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baaron Pittenger, the USOC's executive director when Salt Lake  
was picked in 1989, said there were no signs that officials of the 
bid were involved in anything like the behavior that has since 
become the center of the Olympics' greatest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excesses of Salt Lake City came after they lost to  
Nagano'' in 1991, he said. ``I don't think Salt Lake City did 
anything to win the U.S. bid that was significantly different from 
other cities in the same situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittenger said he had reviewed the selection many times in the  
two months since the Salt Lake scandal broke and was convinced the 
USOC decision was clean and correct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never a time when I was uncomfortable with the process,''  
Pittenger said in a telephone interview from his Colorado Springs, 
Colo., home. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that none of the more-than 100 USOC board members  
ever had mentioned receiving gifts higher than the $25 limit set by 
USOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever brought it up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After being designated the U.S. candidate over Anchorage,  
Alaska, and Reno, Nev., Salt Lake lost the '98 Winter Games to 
Nagano. It automatically re-entered the race for 2002 and won in a 
historic landslide vote by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That victory, however, is now the focus of at least five  
investigations of allegations that Salt Lake bribed IOC members 
with cash, scholarships, medical care, travel and other gifts. Nine 
IOC members have resigned or been expelled and 15 others have been 
implicated in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent ethics panel headed by former Senate Majority  
Leader George Mitchell is looking at the USOC's selection of Salt 
Lake and scheduled to release its findings March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC's outside counsel is questioning members of the USOC  
board, site selection commission and senior staff from 1988-89 
about any gifts over the $25 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Skiing Association executive director Howard  
Peterson has given investigators information about three USOC board 
members and their families he says accepted free ski vacations from 
Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Mercury News reported Wednesday that Jimmy Carnes,  
the former executive director of the national track and field 
federation and a former USOC board member, confirmed he and his 
family had taken a ski trip to Deer Valley, Utah, in 1989, with 
Salt Lake picking up the $889 tab.

never reported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittenger said he doubted that disclosure of such trips would  
have done anything to change the USOC's decision favoring Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been a major act that we just don't have any  
evidence to support,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jeter, Yankees Eye Multiyear Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter's surprising arbitration case is  
barely over, and already baseball people are looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	After just three more seasons, he'll be eligible for free  
agency. Presumably, the Yankees would like to sign the All-Star 
shortstop to a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball's in their court,'' Jeter's agent, Casey Close, said  
Tuesday after his client won a $5 million salary. ``It's an 
organization that has the resources and the opportunity to do 
something special for a special player. They've rolled those dice 
before and found out what happened with Bernie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this week, Bernie Williams was the last Yankee to go to  
arbitration, winning his case for a $3 million salary in 1996. 
Williams rejected several multiyear offers that he deemed too low, 
went year by year and became a free agent last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly signed with the Boston Red Sox, citing the way he felt  
the Yankees treated him, and stayed with New York only after owner 
George Steinbrenner, in the final hours of talks, increased his 
offer from $50 million for five years to $87.5 million for seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, eligible for arbitration for the first time, made  
$750,000 last year and turned down the Yankees' offer to settle for 
$3.5 million, $300,000 above their arbitration figure. 
</P>
<P>
	He can become a free agent after the 2001 season, but the  
Yankees haven't made any proposals for a long-term deal since he 
rejected a $31 million, five-year offer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek's vital to the ballclub and is a tremendous person,''  
Steinbrenner said after the decision. ``I just hope he's in the 
right frame of mind to get the job done. ... I'm not upset at all -- 
I'm very happy. A little lighter in the purse, but very happy. You 
never like to lose -- show me a gracious loser and I'll show you a 
loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners had won the first five hearings this year, defeating  
Montreal infielder Shane Andrews, Boston outfielder Midre Cummings, 
Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon, Los Angeles shortstop Mark 
Grudzielanek and Detroit outfielder Brian Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets reliever Armando Benitez, scheduled for a hearing  
Tuesday, instead settled for a one-year contract worth $1,987,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez, who made $1.1 million with Baltimore last season, got a  
deal halfway between the $2.4 million he had sought and the 
$1,575,000 the Mets had offered. Benitez, obtained from Baltimore 
during the offseason, was 5-6 with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves for the 
Orioles last season and made $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis left-hander Darren Oliver, 4-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 10  
starts last season, lost his case today and will get $3.55 million 
instead of $4.15 million, arbitrators Richard Bloch, Jerome Ross 
and William H. Holly Jr. ruled. Oliver made $3.05 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four other players remain in arbitration, with hearings  
scheduled to conclude this week. Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera 
was the only player to have a hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, St. Louis signed free agent infielder Shawon  
Dunston to a $500,000, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Close offered to settle the Jeter case before Monday's hearing  
at the midpoint of $4.1 million, but the Yankees refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a call and I was wrong,'' general manager Brian Cashman  
said, adding, ``I cost the company some money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, whose case was decided by arbitrators Nicholas Zumas, Ira  
Jaffe and Gil Vernon, matched Ruben Sierra's 1992 salary with Texas 
as the second-highest ever awarded in arbitration. The only higher 
award is the $5.3 million pitcher Jack McDowell got from the 
Chicago White Sox in 1994 -- when he lost his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with. It's the business side, the ugly part,'' Jeter  
said. ``If you play well on the field, everything will take care of 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter hit .324 last season with 19 homers, 84 RBIs and 30  
steals. He was fifth in the AL in batting average and first in runs 
with 127. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's anyone Steinbrenner is angry at, it probably is  
Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won, I lost,'' Cashman said in Tampa. ``I really think  
our case was strong, and I thought the midpoint was irrelevant. 
Obviously, it's not. It's one of those things where the glass is 
half-empty, half-full.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Jagr Is a Star on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux hasn't laced up a pair of skates  
or stared down a goalie on a breakaway in nearly two years. No 
matter, he thinks the best player in hockey still resides in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux doesn't attend Penguins' games in person -- he's  
embroiled in a dispute with the bankrupt franchise's owner. But he 
watches enough on TV to give Jaromir Jagr this endorsement: ``He's 
the best player in the world -- by far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jagr has played during the Penguins' 10-game winning  
streak, at a level reached only occasionally by gifted players such 
as Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky, it would be hard to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jagr had four points in a streak-extending 7-3 victory  
Monday night over Washington, Capitals coach Ron Wilson said he 
yanked goalie Olaf Kolzig with Pittsburgh ahead 5-1, ``as an act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr is the best player in the league,'' Canadiens defenseman  
Stephane Quintal said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr will say only that Lemieux was the best player he ever saw,  
``and there was only one Mario.'' He won't compare himself to Eric 
Lindros, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr is enjoying the crackdown on holding, clutching and  
grabbing, tactics Lemieux long implored the NHL to regulate because 
they allowed players of marginal ability to drag down the quality 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has changed since last year,'' Jagr said.  
``It's more open and the stronger, better, faster guys have an 
advantage over the other guys. Last year, there was a lot of 
holding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's no holding back Jagr as he tries to win a  
third NHL scoring title in five years. He has 26 points, with six 
games of three points or more, during a 10-game winning streak the 
Penguins hope to extend tonight at the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprising aspect of the Penguins' longest streak since  
they won a league-record 17 in a row in 1993 is it has revealed 
Jagr the leader, not just Jagr the scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr succeeded Lemieux and Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain  
mostly in deference to his ability as a player, rather than as a 
leader of men. But he has stepped forward recently as the Penguins' 
most vocal leader, one capable of rallying his team even when he 
doesn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated the Penguins trailed Buffalo 3-2 on Feb. 2, Jagr  
stood up on the bench and said, ``We're not losing.'' The Penguins 
scored three times in the final 6:01 to win 5-3, with Jagr figuring 
in every goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the winning streak in danger of ending Saturday in  
Nashville, Jagr implored his teammates to remember they won their 
previous two games in overtime, yelling, ``Let's do it again.'' 
They did, winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Jagr is not a one-man offense. Kip Miller, who had  
only three points with the Islanders last season, has 10 goals and 
18 points in 11 games since moving up to Jagr's line. Martin Straka 
made the All-Star game, and Alexei Kovalev has 18 goals since 
joining the NHL's league-best offense 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes only a few shifts of any game to realize that  
Jagr's speed, playmaking ability, scoring touch and ability to stay 
on his skates even when pummeled by larger defensemen makes the 
Penguins go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jaromir Jagr gets better every year,'' Penguins  
general manager Craig Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine agreed, saying, ``You wonder how much  
better the kid can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What even his coach forgets sometimes is Jagr no longer is a  
kid. Jagr turned 27 Monday and is in his ninth season in the 
league, even if it seems like only last week he was an 
impressionable teenager playing alongside Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's possible Jagr might play someday for the now-retired  
Lemieux, who is trying to assemble investors who would rescue the 
Penguins from bankruptcy and keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great,'' Jagr said, clearly enjoying the thought  
that Lemieux might be his boss. ``It would be all offense all the 
time -- just the way we like it.''

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Arrive at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- One by one they unpacked their gear for the  
start of a new season. Time for the champions to put the 
record-smashing year behind and look to the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	In came Andy Pettitte, then Chuck Knoblauch. Nearly four months  
of celebration had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness. I'm ready for it,'' manager Joe Torre said.  
``Just from the few people I've seen, everybody seems to be rarin' 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As baseball players started to report to spring training  
Wednesday, a day ahead of the first official workouts, all but one 
of the New York Yankees were back, intent on winning the World 
Series for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to win. That's the bottom line,'' shortstop Derek  
Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York went 125-50, setting an AL record for regular-season  
wins (114) and a major league record for combined victories in the 
regular and postseason. They steamrolled San Diego in a World 
Series sweep, then brought back everyone except Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is to get back to the World Series and win it  
again,'' said Jeter, who a day earlier had won a $5 million salary 
in arbitration. ``It doesn't make a difference how many games we 
win. We want to be the champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spring training officially starts Thursday, the first day  
pitchers, catchers and injured players can work out under the 
supervision of team personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	While some players reported Wednesday to the clubhouse at  
Legends Field, others -- Jeter among them -- worked out at the club's 
nearby minor-league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Yankees already have been working out for several  
weeks. No sign of complacency here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that being a problem,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
``You really don't have to worry about any guys in this 
clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees know there will be pressure on them -- owner George  
Steinbrenner makes sure of that. But there's also a burden of 
matching last year's feats. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get the pitching sure, we can do the same thing,''  
Torre said. ``Again, we can't set those types of goals. You don't 
want to go into a situation where you lose a few games and you 
start being concerned about comparing to last year -- where we were 
at this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we have the same resolve on a day-to-day basis that  
we had last year and not get caught up in our celebrity of last 
year -- of what we accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are concerns heading into the start of training.  
Outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who missed the postseason following 
colon cancer surgery, feels good about his progress and is hopeful 
of being with the team on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any concerns about my health or my ability to  
play. That's not a concern at all,'' Strawberry said. ``I feel 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case Strawberry won't be ready, the Yankees took him off  
the 40-man roster in December, which would shield his salary from 
the luxury tax if he's in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down here to prove to myself that there's a lot of  
baseball left,'' Strawberry said. ``This is gravy for me. It's all 
about having fun. After what I've been through, what can I expect 
but to have fun?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who receives chemotherapy treatment once a week,  
said his weight is back up to 222 pounds. If he doesn't wind up 
fitting into the Yankees' plans, he's confident he'll play 
somewhere in the majors in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky. Most people have a hard time with chemo. It's not  
an easy thing to get by,'' he said, adding that he hasn't noticed 
any side effects from treatments that likely will continue until at 
least May. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who had been offered $3.2 million by the Yankees, said  
his teammates were supportive both before and after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all happy for me,'' Jeter said. ``Now the focus is  
on the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Torre's expected two-year contract extension should be  
finalized this week. Torre said he will sign the agreement sometime 
in the next few days. ... Torre said catcher Jorge Posada will 
likely see more action than he did last year. As for the four-way 
left-field battle between Darryl Strawberry, Chad Curtis, Shane 
Spencer and Ricky Ledee, Torre said is not he's locked into 
anything at the present time. ... Closer Mariano Rivera asked 
arbitrator James Duff for a raise from $750,000 to $4.25 million, 
while the team argued the reliever should be paid $3 million. A 
decision is expected Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Moves To Increase Oil Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in a week, the government  
took steps Wednesday to increase the amount of oil in its emergency 
reserve, hoping also to help the ailing petroleum industry reduce 
supplies on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department announced it will allow companies to store  
as much as 70 million barrels of oil in its underground reserve for 
a year or more in return for some of the oil as a storage fee. 
</P>
<P>
	With prices severely depressed, the opportunity to remove even  
modest amounts of oil from the market for a year might be 
attractive to some companies that are betting prices might rebound 
in the future, industry analysts suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also said the amount involved is not enough to  
significantly affect prices, especially at a time when inventories 
are high. Worldwide oil prices are at a 12-year low. Oil sold on 
the spot market Wednesday at $11.59 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said opening the Strategic  
Petroleum Reserve on the Texas-Louisiana coast for private storage 
is ``a unique opportunity ... to add to our energy security'' at a 
time when private storage space is hard to find and prices are 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks  
at the end of January were at 330.2 million barrels, up almost 3 
percent from the previous month. About 19 million barrels of oil 
are consumed daily in the United States, according to the API. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil stored temporarily in the reserve would remain the  
property of the commercial owner, but some of it would be turned 
over to the government in lieu of a fee and become part of the 
reserve's permanent inventory, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently has 561 million  
barrels of government-owned oil that can be used in case of an 
emergency. The reserve has a capacity of 680 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Richardson announced the planned purchase of 28  
million barrels of oil for the reserve from federal leases in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Instead of cash, the government would forgo 
royalties up to the value of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of opening some of the emergency reserve to private  
storage is not new. 
</P>
<P>
	The government offered a six-month storage plan last year, but  
found few companies interested. This time ``we've gotten a lot of 
inquiries,'' said Energy Department spokesman Tom Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	The department set a March 10 deadlines for offers and said it  
could receive oil at a rate of 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day at 
its Big Hill storage site south of Beaumont, Texas. The oil must be 
stored in six empty caverns at Big Hill for at least a year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the interest is expected to come from smaller producers,  
mainly independents, and not from the large multinational 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't detect any urgent bells going off,'' said Chris  
Kelley, a spokesman at the American Petroleum Institute, which 
represents the major oil companies. ``But we're encouraged by the 
administration's latest attempt to think of the oil and natural gas 
industry in a positive light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been criticized by some members of  
Congress from oil states for not doing more to help the depressed 
domestic oil industry. Last month alone, 11,500 oil industry 
workers lost their jobs, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The government doesn't predict any substantial price rebound  
anytime soon. Prices could be depressed well into the next decade 
and not likely exceed $14 a barrel until after 2000, the Energy 
Information Administration predicted recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related action, the Energy Department announced it would  
spend $19 million to help small producers pay for new technology 
needed to produce oil from fields where recovery has been 
difficult. The federal money, provided on a matching basis, was 
hoped to prompt increased private spending on use of such 
technology.

<HEADLINE> Auto Affordability Best in 18 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The average price of a new vehicle was more  
affordable last year than in any year since 1980, a Comerica Bank 
index shows. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 24.6 weeks of median pretax family income to buy an  
average-priced new vehicle, compared with 25.5 weeks in 1997, 
according to the bank's Auto Affordability Index, released Tuesday. 
The average vehicle price was just over $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The index, compiled annually from Commerce Department and  
Federal Reserve Bank data, is based on the total cost of a vehicle 
divided by median family income. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, vehicles were at the most affordable level since  
1980, when new vehicle purchases absorbed an average 23.5 weeks of 
income,'' said Comerica chief economist David Littmann. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the change was that Americans' income grew 5  
percent last year, Littman said. Another is that prices for some 
cars were lower than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Chrysler  
Corp., now DaimlerChrysler, announced they would virtually freeze 
sticker prices on 1999-model cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Littman also noted that average annual auto financing rates were  
lower than in 1997.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Breaks 200 Butterfly Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALMO, Sweden (AP) -- Susie O'Neill of Australia shattered  
swimming's oldest record Wednesday, breaking the 200-meter 
butterfly world mark with a time of 2 minutes, 05.37 seconds in a 
World Cup short course meet. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, 25, improved the record of 2:05.65 set by Mary T.  
Meagher of the United States on Jan. 2, 1981 at Gainesvile, 
Florida, by .28 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, the reigning Olympic and world champion, finally got  
the world record nearing the end of her brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Madame Butterfly'', she has said that she will  
retire after next year's Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	During another World Cup meet at Hobart in her native Australia  
last month, O'Neill failed in an attempt to break Meagher's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's better not to aim for a world record,'' she said.  
``That's what I did in Hobart, but I failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea I was on world-record pace tonight. I couldn't  
believe I had broken the record when I got out of the pool. It was 
so noisy during the race. I thought the fans were cheering for the 
Danish girl. Later I understood that the fans wanted to see a world 
record. It was a great atmosphere to compete in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sophia Skou of Denmark finished a distant runnerup in 2:09.80  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who clocked a 2:06.60 for the second fastest time in  
history when she won the event in last year's Commonwealth Games, 
had finished only sixth in the 100-meter butterfly during the first 
session Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Town President Hangs Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSONVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- Gari Miller put his heart and soul  
into his part-time job as president of this little village, a place 
where friends say he answered calls day and night and kept an open 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	Like any politician, the 83-year-old Miller had detractors. They  
launched a recall campaign to bounce him and three other village 
officials from their jobs. He shrugged off the trouble, but now his 
friends wonder if it became too much for him to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife of 61 years, Eleanor, found his body hanging in his  
tool shed Monday, three days before the scheduled recall election. 
</P>
<P>
	His death was ruled a suicide. Miller left no note, no way to  
explain why he would leave the wife he dearly loved and the job for 
which he was passionate. 
</P>
<P>
	But small-town politics and the pressure of the recall drive --  
which accused Miller and the others of using abusive language, not 
paying bills on time and violating open meetings law -- seem a 
possibility to many who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes in small towns, it gets personal. It's like family  
that way,'' Sanilac County Sheriff Virg Strickler said Tuesday, 
stressing that he isn't making any assumptions about Miller's 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suicide is never a rational thing,'' Strickler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller's funeral will be held Thursday, a block away from where  
the recall balloting is scheduled to be held. It was unclear 
Tuesday whether the election would be held for the other three 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Carsonville, about 80 miles north of Detroit, is a community of  
583 people. The village has one blinking light in a downtown that 
consists of a bank, a beauty shop, a tire store, a hotel and bar 
and a couple of party stores. Dirt roads connect most of its 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired truck mechanic, Miller liked fixing up his meticulous  
white ranch house and tending his yard. He and wife Eleanor, 78, 
were inseparable. He had a daughter, son-in-law, two grandsons, a 
great-grandson and a great-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller campaigned hard and won handily in March, pulling in 78  
votes to the incumbent's 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his detractors were some residents who didn't like  
Miller's handling of a state requirement that the village install 
its first-ever sewer system. People weren't happy that construction 
crews had come in and torn up roads for the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about him brought tears to the eyes of friends including  
trustee Vernon Kelley, also facing a recall. He said Miller 
responded quickly to problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time day or night, somebody called with a complaint about  
the sewers, he'd come running,'' Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him the other day and asked him if (the recall)  
bothered him and he said, `No, not really. If they want me out, OK. 
If not, that's that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``But what he was saying and what he was thinking might have  
been two different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also choked up was pro tem town President John Dew.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole town is upset over this. Gari was a good person. All  
he ever had was the best interest of this town in mind,'' Dew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Smith, owner of Carsonville Tire, said his friend had spoken  
of the recall and was afraid it would tarnish his record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running a hard campaign, then people are all against him. It  
was just too much pressure,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bacon, who knew Miller for more than 60 years, said the  
political controversies were hard on his friend and ``he let it run 
away with him maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who filed the recall petition didn't return a message  
left Tuesday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But other unhappiness with Miller was apparent in one store  
where a small group gathered, saying the recall was about more than 
unpaid bills and unpleasant language. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's some guilt on the part of the people who  
started the recall election,'' Strickler said. ``But by no stretch 
of the imagination does anyone believe they intended this to 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Bob Smith Aims for White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith is a former teacher who says  
the public has a lot to learn and a former high school baseball 
coach who has spent his political career way out in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the former real estate agent is bidding on some prime  
property: the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Decelle, a retired teacher who supervised Smith's first few  
years working in the classroom, remembers the passion for 
government the young civics teacher tried to impart to his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Decelle, a lifelong Democrat, also remembers the heated  
political discussions the Republican Smith sparked with other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to use the word opinionated, but that's what he  
is. What you see is what you get,'' Decelle said. ``He says one 
thing and does what he says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 57, is unafraid to take a stand, even if everyone else  
remains seated. He was one of only five senators who voted against 
the 1991 Civil Rights Act, one of three senators who voted against 
the National Energy Policy Act in 1992 and one of three to vote 
against the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Supreme Court 
justice. He voted against funding for Head Start, food stamps and 
emergency aid for hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was right, and the other 93 senators were wrong,'' he said  
about the Civil Rights vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters laughed in a 1997 hearing when Smith called President  
Clinton fund-raising mess ``probably the biggest scandal in the 
history of the republic.'' He also faced ridicule several years ago 
after giving a passionate speech against allowing elephants on 
Capitol grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith insists his extreme views will draw people together  
instead of alienating them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people deserve honesty and I think there are a broad  
range of voters out there who agree with me,'' he said in a 
telephone interview Wednesday. ``Clearly, there are enough people 
out there who agree with me for me to win the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just issues. It's integrity, it's a passion of  
wanting to lead,'' he said. ``It's a simple kind of feeling, a 
feeling of patriotism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has visited 20 states in the year and a half since he  
began considering a run, with frequent stops in Iowa, home of the 
first presidential caucuses. Wherever he goes, he says he tells 
people about the life experiences that shaped his views: growing up 
without his father, who was killed in a World War II airplane 
crash, serving in the Navy in Vietnam, serving his community as a 
teacher and school board member. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to introduce myself as a real person: Bob Smith the  
school teacher, the coach, the dad, the husband, then the 
senator,'' he said. ``I think people need to know who you are. If 
you're a good person in your life, you have a better chance of 
being a good president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won his first House seat in 1984 after two unsuccessful  
campaigns and was re-elected twice. He was elected to the Senate in 
1990 and re-elected by a narrow margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Beaulieu, a 70-year-old Newmarket businesswoman who has  
supported Smith from the start, says the early losses reveal as 
much about Smith as the wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good loser,'' she said. ``If you can't be a good  
loser, you can't be a good winner. He never saw it as losing. It 
was just on to the next election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beaulieu said Smith won her over with his honesty: ``He doesn't  
talk double-talk. He speaks plain language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he comes from this first presidential primary state,  
the favorite-son factor is not looming large. In a recent poll of 
New Hampshire Republicans, only 4 percent said they would vote for 
Smith in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Woodburn, chairman of the state Democratic Party, is  
offering $100 to the first Republican officeholder or GOP leader to 
endorse Smith publicly. No one has claimed the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're poking fun at Bob Smith to illustrate a serious lack of  
support he has,'' Woodburn said. ``We're trying to find where that 
lonely Republican is who will publicly support Bob Smith.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pushes Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With impeachment behind him and the  
Republican-controlled Congress in recess, President Clinton is 
trying to gain the upper hand in the debate over how to divide the 
federal budget surplus while saving Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign geared up today with satellite-linked town hall  
meetings aimed at selling young people on the president's plan to 
shore up the retirement system and Medicare. Clinton goes to New 
Hampshire on Thursday to talk about tax credit proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is fundamentally very simple choice,'' Clinton said.  
``Will our first priority be spending the budget surplus that we 
have worked so hard to create on a terrifically appealing tax cut 
in the moment, or will our first priority be investing whatever the 
necessary amount of the surplus is for at least the next 15 years 
to strengthen Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the events are designed to sharpen  
the distinctions between the president's insistence on dealing with 
Social Security before trimming taxes and the Republicans' emphasis 
on across-the-board tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 200 years, the test of each generation of Americans has  
been not simply how well they did in their own time but whether 
they left our country in better shape for future generations,'' 
Clinton said from the East Room of the White House, where dozens of 
students gathered. ``Because of the size of the Baby Boom 
generation ... we have a special responsibility to the generation 
represented by most of you in this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office today projected that  
Clinton's plan could lead to roughly $800 billion in on-budget 
deficits by 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials in the past have taken issue with the  
CBO's analysis on Social Security, but Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., 
called the estimates proof that ``the president's approach to 
Social Security reform is to resurrect the days of deficit 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some authorities contend the surest way to shore up  
Social Security is to raise taxes and reduce benefits, Clinton 
adviser Paul Begala said today that such unpopular actions are 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the surplus, we are not now at a time when we need deep  
and drastic cuts in Social Security,'' Begala said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' ``So we can take that surplus and invest in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have agreed in principle with Clinton's call to  
devote 62 percent of the anticipated budget surpluses to shoring up 
the Social Security system over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on Clinton's proposal to dedicate 15  
percent of the surplus to Medicare, and Republicans have roundly 
criticized a proposal to use another 11 percent to establish 
401(k)-style accounts for working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other  
GOP lawmakers presided over the first in a series of small town 
meetings Monday to build support for their proposal to cut taxes by 
$743 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty-two percent should be set aside to save Social  
Security,'' said Republican National Committee spokesman Tom Yu. 
``The rest should go back to the taxpayer. It's an overpayment in 
taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, makes his pitch via satellite today to 
41 college campuses in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to convince students, and Congress, that fixing the  
retirement system now is the best plan for their future. ``Then 
it's a debate over how do you do tax cuts,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of slashing taxes across the board, Clinton wants to  
target tax cuts where he believes they are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly proposed retirement funds, called Universal Savings  
Accounts, would target tax credits to low- and middle-income 
working Americans who choose to save more for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the key political battleground of New Hampshire on Thursday,  
Clinton plans to focus on his proposed $1,000 tax credit on helping 
families cope with the burdens of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would provide up to $500 in tax credits for  
stay-at-home parents caring for children under age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu said Republicans weren't worried about Clinton stealing the  
spotlight while lawmakers were on a recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many members of Congress and senators are going to be holding  
town hall meetings and listening to their constituents during the 
recess,'' Yu said. ``They're not taking the day off by any means.''

<HEADLINE>  Designers Unveil Fall Lines in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Red jacket. Red sweater. Red pants. Red boots.  
Wear them all together if you dare. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Lauren isn't kidding about advocating crayon brights and  
sherbet shades for fall. At his preview Wednesday, chockablock with 
models in an incendiary lineup of monochromatic fuchsias, yellows 
and oranges, the fashion future looked bright. 
</P>
<P>
	As Fashion Week hit the midpoint, Lauren's high-energy tones lit  
up simple shapes, notably cashmere turtlenecks and blazers, along 
with felted knee-length skirts and cropped pants. 
</P>
<P>
	On the quieter side, he served up a rainbow of soft-colored  
outfits in all-light blue, coral and periwinkle. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren also bowed to the season's trendy athletic influences,  
including sporty down vests, parkas and drawstring waists. But the 
news is in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	They are all dressed up in bright satin, or they sparkle with  
sequins then teamed with floor-sweeping ball skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sport utility done in a dressed-up way,'' Lauren said  
after his show. So is his strapless cashmere gown in black and red 
hunting checks. It just might score right on the mark as the 
perfect Oscar get-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kors likewise brought out all the big guns Wednesday,  
serving up his rendition of how the West was worn. Or rather, 
should be worn. 
</P>
<P>
	His roundup of cowgirl couture translates into chic urban  
models. They're West-dressed in pony-print skirts, cashmere ponchos 
and studded suede handstitched jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 15, Kors announced that the luxury goods group LVMH Moet  
Hennessy Louis Vuitton had just bought a one-third stake in his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ellen Tracy company also has cause to celebrate. The 50th  
anniversary of the $250 million design house falls in March, 
fueling its fall preview with a return to perennial classic cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no slick runway sight gags at Ellen Tracy's show,  
held in a separate hall at Grand Central Station. The company 
tracks the trends while realistically keeping sight of its 
customer. This fall she will be dressed in pastel-colored mid-knee 
flannel skirts, plain cashmere sweaters, satin camisoles and 
jackets with softer tailoring. 
</P>
<P>
	For evening, Ellen Tracy's return to classic sportswear  
continues, with T-shirts, tank tops and simple pants dressed up in 
iridescent fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more I talk to women, and comfort is such a factor,''  
says Linda Allard, head designer for Ellen Tracy. ``Women today 
have been there with the corporate suit, and we don't need to be so 
structured anymore. It's about being comfortable but looking 
polished.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Jake Gyllenhaal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In Coalwood, W. Va., all the boys grow up to be  
coal miners, and Homer Hickam has no reason to think he'll be any 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	Too small to earn a football scholarship like his brother, Homer  
seems headed for the mines, just like his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Soviets launch the Sputnik satellite.  
</P>
<P>
	As the townspeople of Coalwood gather to watch the tiny dot race  
across the ``October Sky,'' something inside Homer clicks. Going 
against his father's wishes, he decides to build and launch his own 
homemade rocket, enlisting the help of three high school friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the story, Homer is trying to get out,'' says Jake  
Gyllenhaal, who plays the teen-age rocketeer in the film. ``In 
every scene you can feel him trying to get out of Coalwood and 
follow his passion. He wants to be a scientist, and his father 
can't understand that. So they constantly bump heads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homer's determination to launch the rocket -- despite his  
father's opposition -- propels him out of Coalwood and life in the 
mines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homer really wants to get out of this town,'' Gyllenhaal  
explains. ``And ... after this epiphany of seeing Sputnik, he does 
fall in love with science and rocketry and stuff like that, and he 
sucks at math. I mean, really, when it comes down to it, he sucks 
at math, he sucks at science, and he's never really put in the 
discipline that it needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``October Sky'' is based on the book ``Rocket Boys,'' written by  
Homer Hickam Jr., who retired from NASA last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also stars Chris Cooper (``Lone Star'') as John Hickam,  
Homer's father; Laura Dern as Homer's high school teacher; and 
Natalie Canerday (``Sling Blade'') as Homer's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``October Sky,'' directed by Joe Johnston (``Jumanji,'' ``Honey  
I Shrunk the Kids''), was shot during a four-month period in 
eastern Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal, 18, grew up in Los Angeles and now lives in New  
York, where he is a freshman at Columbia University. His father is 
Stephen Gyllenhaal, who directed ``A Dangerous Woman'' with Debra 
Winger. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How did you get involved in acting?  
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal: I've always been an actor. It's my family business.  
My father is a director and my mother is a screenwriter and 
actually my sister is an actress, too. Also, I've been on sets 
almost half my life, so I've just watched the process and from that 
developed my own style and my love for the process of acting. 
</P>
<P>
	1 1/2: Did you act in plays in school?  
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal: Oh, yeah. I took acting classes when I was younger,  
and I acted professionally a little bit. I think my parents 
hesitated from me doing it because when I actually started doing 
it, it started to pick up and they wanted me to concentrate on 
school. So being young and naive like I still am but like more so 
at a younger age, I think that I was forced to stay in school, much 
to my dismay. And then as I got older, I did a few things here and 
there, they let me sort of get a taste of it and keep that sort of 
passion alive. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Are you in every scene in the film?  
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal: Yeah. Every scene. I think a lot of the film is,  
it's very dialogue-driven, but at the same time ... the camera is 
the biggest narrator and it's not necessarily always the words, and 
so I didn't realize that I had to do so much. And when I got there, 
it was a bit overwhelming at first, realizing that, looking at the 
schedule and seeing that I had no day off for three and a half 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	3. How does it feel when you see yourself on the big screen?  
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal: I've seen it twice now and five minutes into the  
movie I always go like 'aren't they bored by now? aren't they bored 
with this face?' Because I'm looking around waiting for people to 
go, 'we've seen enough of this guy, he's already been in almost 
every single shot and every single second of this movie.'	   4: You shot the film in coal mining country. Can you imagine 
working as a coal miner? 
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal: I would never think of being a coal miner. I think  
it would be just a horrible job. But when it really comes down to 
it, it is so honorable in so many ways, and there are people who 
work down in the mines who are literally in love with it, like John 
(Hickam) is in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Where did you get that great West Virginia accent?  
</P>
<P>
	Gyllenhaal: I have different accents that I do, and the accents  
sort of come out of this box in my head. What I did with the West 
Virginia accent was, I took what I believed to be like a sort of 
cliched Southern accent that I had always developed since I was a 
little kid to get attention at the dinner table, and we worked with 
a speech pathologist for like two hours, and that was it. All of us 
did. We just sort of tuned it to the colloquialisms that go along 
with the region.

<HEADLINE> Wyman-Gordon To Cut 350 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAFTON, Mass. (AP) -- Wyman-Gordon Co., a manufacturer of  
commercial forgings and castings, is eliminating 350 jobs, or 8.8 
percent of its work force, partly because of the poor Asian economy 
and low oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	David P. Gruber, chairman and chief executive, said in  
announcing the cuts Wednesday that the company expects to save $26 
million because of the job cuts, discontinuation of product lines 
and the consolidation in its core aerospace structural, aerospace 
turbines and energy products businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to charge $11 million against earnings as a  
result of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman-Gordon, which had $753 million in annual sales last year,  
expects earnings to drop 7 percent in the third quarter due to a 
slowdown in customer orders for energy products because of Asian 
market conditions and low oil prices, as well as seasonal 
fluctuations in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which employs 4,000, said it plans to minimize  
overtime and outsourcing expenses during the next quarter, and 
balance production more efficiently between its Scotland and 
Houston plants.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Millionaires Eye Farming / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A new venture -- and one of the planet's oldest --  
has caught the eye of a handful of Microsoft millionaires: farming. 
</P>
<P>
	A group banding together as Farmland Acquisition, Research and  
Management Limited Liability Co., or Farm LLC, is buying up land in 
the Sammamish Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-powered, high-tech investors have a low-key, low-tech  
dream: They hope to turn a profit in agriculture and save the 
scenic open space near their homes at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	In three months, they've raised nearly $1 million and bought  
their first acreage. By year's end, they expect to own about 80 
acres, 7 percent of the farmland in the valley on the Seattle 
metropolitan area's northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to demonstrate ... the best and highest use of  
farmland is farming,'' said Roger Calhoon, the Farm LLC general 
manager, who holds a doctorate in biophysics and retired early from 
a biotechnology career. 
</P>
<P>
	The general idea is to raise fruit and vegetables on some  
parcels, lease others to new farmers and run a demonstration garden 
for people considering farm life. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm LLC's 17 members hope to tap the growing market for  
high-quality organic produce. They plan to sell direct from the 
farm, cutting out middleman expense and keeping consumers in touch 
with where food comes from. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really, I think, a community-driven venture, and we  
really hope to reach out to the community so the people will see 
the farm as their neighborhood farm,'' Calhoon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members include Microsoft engineer Bob Atkinson, writer  
Christine Dubois and farmer Claire Thomas, who grows organic 
produce on seven acres in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Most are from Microsoft, though there are some doctors and  
Boeing employees, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have people walking in there and plunking down $100,000,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They met through Thomas' Root Connection, a co-op in which  
members buy shares of the harvest and get weekly allotments of 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubois said she's in it for her children.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to have the experience of a farm and know that  
food doesn't come from boxes on the shelf,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkinson, who grew up on a Nova Scotia orchard, said the group  
will help new farmers by making small, affordable pieces of land 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having access to the larger amount of capital, we can buy the  
40 acres and lease 10-acre parcels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm LLC also will experiment with more intensive methods, such  
as greenhouses, to produce greater yields and year-round income and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people don't really realize how much produce can  
be grown,'' Thomas said, touting the valley's rich soil as among 
the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
	The valley has 1,140 acres of farmland, 686 of them protected by  
a county farm preservation program. The rest are periodically 
considered for soccer fields, industrial parks and other nonfarm 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the partnerships that come in and buy farmland are  
looking down the road for other uses,'' said county agriculture 
specialist Eric Nelson, who grew up on a valley dairy that's now 
the site of an office park. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson likes Farm LLC's concept, though he worries it may drive  
up area land prices for full-time farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Microsoft millionaires have affected the housing  
market,'' he said, ``the same thing could happen to farmland.''

	WALLACE, S.C. (AP) -- A tow truck struck a church van, killing  
five children and critically injuring another, the state Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three children were ejected from the Wallace Family Life Daycare

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Growth Hormones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Giving growth hormones to short but otherwise healthy children  
adds only a modest 2 inches to their height on average, a study 
found, leading some experts to question whether up to 10 years of 
daily injections are worth the cost and the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine  
is the first long-term look at the controversial practice of 
administering growth hormones for cosmetic reasons, a use that has 
not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Raymond L. Hintz and colleagues at Stanford University  
showed that about 80 percent of the children studied reached 
heights greater than would have been expected otherwise. However, 
the results in individual children varied, and 20 percent saw no 
height increase. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, few of the children reached the target height set  
by doctors based on the size of the child's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hintz called the results ``somewhat disappointing.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: Do we treat, understanding that it's not a  
100 percent guarantee and that it's years of treatment, or do we 
let nature take its course?'' he said. ``This is going to be a 
difficult judgment. I think different parents are going to give 
different answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends use of growth  
hormones only in children who have a deficiency of the hormones; a 
rare chromosomal abnormality called Turner syndrome that stunts 
growth in girls; or a chronic kidney disorder that retards growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy warns that the hormones should not be widely used  
for cosmetic reasons because they could lead to tumors, diabetes, 
hip problems or difficulties with self-esteem. This study found no 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the FDA has not approved the drugs for use in short  
but otherwise healthy children, it is not illegal to do so. Roughly 
30,000 children are treated with growth hormones in the United 
States yearly, and about 20 percent of them don't fit into one of 
the categories the FDA deems as medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	One year of growth hormone therapy can cost $10,000 to $25,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The new study was paid for in part by Genentech Inc. of South  
San Francisco, Calif., which holds 67 percent of the U.S. market 
for growth hormones. Eli Lilly and Co. and Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn also 
produce growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers examined 121 children who were considered short  
for no known medical reason and were treated with growth hormones 
for two to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 80 children who received treatment and who have reached  
adulthood, both boys and girls were an average of about 2 inches 
taller than would have been expected otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Sharon E. Oberfield of the  
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University called 
the findings inconclusive but was skeptical of hormone use on 
healthy children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is short stature a disease? If not, should the most severe  
short stature be considered a disability warranting treatment?'' 
Oberfield wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hintz defended the use of the hormones in some cases where a  
person is ``severely short,'' meaning below 4-foot-11 for a woman 
or 5-3 for a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have trouble interacting with people or in handling  
kitchen cabinets or driving, then it becomes a significant 
problem,'' he said. ``Like a lot of `isms,' such as racism or 
ageism, there is heightism, which can be subtle. Sometimes people 
judge others, even unconsciously, based on their stature.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ark. Gov. Won't Get New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge turned down former Gov.  
Jim Guy Tucker's bid for a new trial, rejecting a claim that a 
woman who sat on his jury was so biased against him that Tucker 
couldn't get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was convicted in 1996 of fraud and conspiracy and served  
18 months of home detention. He claimed a woman who married into 
the family of a political detractor had no business sitting on his 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater prosecutors had promised not to try Tucker again if  
his arguments had been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's lawyers had said that any fair-minded judge would have  
dismissed Renee Johnson from the jury if her connections to the 
governor's political enemies were known. 
</P>
<P>
	A week into the trial, Ms. Johnson married Charles Hayes, a man  
whom Tucker had twice denied clemency. Hayes is the nephew of 
Robert ``Say'' McIntosh, a longtime Tucker critic who taunted the 
governor after the jury returned its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was convicted with James and Susan McDougal, who were  
President Clinton's business partners in the Whitewater land 
development that gave Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation its name. McDougal died in prison last year and Mrs. 
McDougal served 2 1/2 months of a 24-month prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served 18 months on a contempt citation after refusing  
to talk to a grand jury. She faces a criminal contempt trial next 
month.

<HEADLINE> Va. Won't Pay in Right-To-Die Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Virginia House refused today to  
compensate a woman for legal fees she racked up in a court battle 
over whether she had the right to let her brain-damaged husband 
die. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would have awarded $48,000 to Michele Finn for fees she  
incurred during a state investigation into whether Hugh Finn was 
truly in a vegetative state, unaware of his surroundings. The bill 
also would have paid $10,000 to Hugh Finn's brothers and parents, 
who opposed the right-to-die case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Finn, fighting back tears, said she was disappointed with  
the vote and lashed out at Gov. Jim Gilmore for his last-ditch 
attempt at preventing her from letting her husband die. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand how a man can be so cold as to put us  
through this and not have it end in a graceful way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Finn, a former Louisville, Ky., television anchorman,  
suffered brain injury in a 1995 car crash that left him in what 
doctors said was a ``persistent vegetative state.'' But when Mrs. 
Finn decided to let him die, her husband's family sued, saying he 
showed signs of awareness. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia's legislature and health department got involved,  
forcing examinations of Hugh Finn to determine if he had any hope 
of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The case led to bitter feelings among the family, but a judge  
eventually ruled in Mrs. Finn's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes before Finn's tube was to be pulled, Gilmore filed an  
emergency motion to stop the procedure. His request was denied and 
Finn died Oct. 9, eight days after his feeding tube removed. 
</P>
<P>
	A court has already awarded Mrs. Finn $13,000 in legal expenses  
from fighting Gilmore's lawsuit. Gilmore, a Republican, is 
appealing. Mrs. Finn lives in Louisville, Ky., with her two 
daughters.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Life: Beavis and Butt-Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fore, dude. Huh-huh, huh-huh.  
</P>
<P>
	Beavis and Butt-head are hitting the miniature golf links in  
cyberspace, bringing their demented brand of teen underachievement 
to desktop sports. Forget the corny windmill and hitting through 
the big clown's mouth. This minigolf rocks! Huh-huh, huh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trademark scatological slang is unavoidable as always,  
starting with the game's title, but just like their MTV show and 
feature film, it's all in fun. No real four-letter words are used, 
just the boys' raunchy, made-up lingo. 
</P>
<P>
	After running the same disclaimer that accompanies their TV  
show, which stresses that Beavis and Butt-head are not role models, 
the game launches and players choose which of the cartoon's 
goof-ball cast to tee off as: one of the two title characters, 
Anderson their uptight neighbor, beleaguered Principal McVicker, 
Todd the tough guy, or the hippie school teacher, Mr. Van Driessen. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to four people can play together, and everyone's ball stays  
in play until they hole out, allowing players to hit other balls 
with theirs, creating a ricocheting chaos that adds to the 
silliness. Each player's animated persona is pictured on the side 
of the screen, allowing each character to heckle the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The round opens in Beavis and Butt-head's living room, where the  
lame-brain duo spend hours glued to the TV set watching music 
videos. The first putt has to pass safely through the opening and 
closing window, leaving an approach to the hole on the couch, where 
springs popping through the upholstery will reject errant shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Players move on to Nacho Pichu, a snack volcano layout  
surrounded by flowing molten cheese and tortilla chips. Next is the 
Burger World hole, where the just-mopped tile floor is extra slick 
and the mop bucket is just one of many obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Buzzcut's minefield hole follows, where players have to  
hit through a narrow passage guarded by sand bags, past some land 
mines that will blow up if hit, up a ramp and over a mud pit, 
through a series of old tires and past more mines to reach the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Maxi Mart, convenience is not in store for players who  
have to send shots past the hot-dog roaster and around a standing 
rack display to bank off the soft drink coolers toward the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 6 is a junkyard layout where a dangling auto hoist magnet  
guards the hole. Moving to Highland High School, swinging front 
doors swat mistimed shots back at players. Two holes later, players 
visit the bedroom of Beavis and Butt-head's little pal, Stewart. 
Shots go past his ``I love unicorns'' poster and have to get by his 
circling toy train set to find the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	In Todd's auto shop, the oil drain catch basin is a hazard. On  
the following wood shop hole, a buzz saw and drill press have to be 
circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is Van Driessen's signature hole, a psychedelic  
dreamland with a rotating peace sign to hit through, a field of 
glowing lava lamps and a curtain of love beads. In Anderson's yard, 
his swimming pool is a hazard and the hole is hidden inside his 
utility shed. 
</P>
<P>
	In McVicker's office, beware the hyperactive file cabinet  
drawers that bash mistimed shots off-line, as well as his swinging 
front door, which can bat loose shots down into his secretary's 
vestibule. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 17 is a rock concert stage, where balls must be played into  
glitter-spraying chute pockets between spritzes to get down to hole 
in the mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
	The final hole is the lollapalooza, Cornholio, named for Beavis'  
sugar- and caffein-addled alter ego. It's the toughest on the 
course, requiring a perfect shot up a toilet paper ramp into a 
chute pocket floating in a coffee cup to send the ball safely to 
the next area. 
</P>
<P>
	The putting control is a simple, click, pull back and release  
arrangement. The farther one pulls away from the ball the farther 
it goes. It could be more precise, but that might make the game 
more serious than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	The game from GT Interactive (CD-ROM for Windows, $19.99) is a  
hoot from the first tee to the 18th green. The only cool thing 
missing is Daria, Beavis and Butt-head's brainy, unpopular 
classmate. But she has her own spin-off show on MTV now, so maybe 
she'll get her own computer game.

<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- John M. Harrison, a former editorial  
writer and journalism teacher and author of a book published to 
celebrate the 150th anniversary of The Blade, died Sunday. He was 
84 and had prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison was born in 1914 in Oakland, Iowa, where he helped his  
father publish the town's weekly newspaper, The Acorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a brief period as managing editor of the St. Helens,  
Ore., Sentinel-Mist, Harrison was associated with his father's 
newspaper until he joined The Blade in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote editorials as a Blade associate editor from 1947 to  
1958. 
</P>
<P>
	When his father died in 1948, Harrison left The Blade for  
several months to edit and publish the family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a Nieman Fellowship to study at Harvard University  
in 1951. He then taught journalism at his alma mater, the 
University of Iowa, from 1958 to 1961, and was a professor of 
journalism and American studies at Pennsylvania State University 
from 1961 until he retired in 1978 and moved back to his home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison's 1985 book about the history of The Blade, which was  
founded in 1835, was written at the request of the newspaper's late 
co-publisher, Paul Block Jr.

<P>
	WAKULLA SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Henry W. Kendall, a physicist who  
won the Nobel Prize for discoveries about the building blocks of 
matter, died Monday during an underwater photography dive. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
and founding member of the antiwar Union of Concerned Scientists, 
had been taking pictures in about 10 feet of water at Wakulla 
Springs State Park when his body was found in shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known, but authorities  
said he did not drown. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, along with Jerome I. Friedman and Richard E. Taylor,  
worked for years starting in the late 1960s uncovering evidence 
that protons and neutrons, once thought to be basic building blocks 
of matter, were made up of smaller components called quarks. They 
shared the Nobel prize in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall had served since 1973 as chairman of the Union of  
Concerned Scientists, founded in 1969. He led efforts to warn 
against the dangers of nuclear weapons, safety hazards in nuclear 
power industry and space-based weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the union, Kendall challenged President Reagan's ``star  
wars'' defense system proposal -- a system of satellites to defend 
American cities against nuclear attack. He had also helped brief 
President Clinton in 1997 on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall and his brother were also large shareholders in the  
family business, Kendall Co., which made Curad bandages, Curity 
diapers and hospital equipment. Colgate Palmolive Co. bought the 
business in 1972 for $512 million.

	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- William Kessen, a child psychologist who  
was the Eugene Higgins Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Yale 
University, died Saturday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessen, whose studied the behavior of children in the first  
years of life, was reknowned for his research on how infants 
organize and make sense of the world before they are able to speak. 
He also studied the emergence of professional psychology in the 
late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to numerous articles, Kessen published several books  
including ``The Language of Psychology'' (with George Mandler), 
``The Child,'' ``Childhood in China,'' and ``The Rise and Fall of 
Development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kessen chaired Yale's psychology department from 1977-1980 and  
served as acting secretary of the university during the fall of 
1980. He retired in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies After Crashing Into School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- A 73-year-old man died after he lost  
control of his car, crashed through the window of an elementary 
school and landed on a pupil's desk in a second-grade classroom 
today. None of the 22 children was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The desks were empty because the pupils were out of their seats  
checking on a pet guinea pig when the car crashed into the 
ground-level classroom about 9:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the children suffered minor scrapes and bruises, but  
none required transportation to hospitals by ambulance, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver was identified as Mason Martin of Columbia.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Martin exited the parking lot of a library  
directly across the street from the school when he ran through the 
window into the ground-level classroom. The car landed on top of a 
vacant desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin died at University Hospital and Clinics at 10 a.m. today,  
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were still investigating and did not know  
whether the driver died from injuries suffered in the accident or 
from other causes as he drove the car. They had not determined how 
fast he was traveling when he crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Philip Frye said counselors were available for the  
students, and parents were allowed to take them home if they 
wished.

<HEADLINE> La. Clinics Sue To Stop Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Abortion clinics and doctors have sued Gov.  
Mike Foster in an attempt to block his order to inspect abortion 
clinics, tattoo parlors and body-piercing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit filed Wednesday contends the order allows  
searches without probable cause, warrant or consent, and without 
any way to ensure that medical records and the doctor-patient 
relationship remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster's order allows inspections only after complaints are  
filed against the clinics. He originally signed the order Feb. 5, 
the same day a Baton Rouge television station reported allegations 
that a clinic was dirty and unsafe; inspectors found no such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said his executive order wasn't meant as an attack on  
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pro-life, but that's not what this is about,'' Foster said  
in a statement. ``It's about a response to a story that portrayed 
some unsanitary conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the measure is aimed at the state's five abortion  
clinics, all of which are represented in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Foster's order unfairly singles out abortion from all  
other health care and places unjustifiable burdens on abortion 
providers,'' said Priscilla Smith, an attorney with The Center for 
Reproductive Law and Policy that is representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants with Foster were state Health Secretary  
David Hood, and Jimmy Guidry, assistant secretary for public 
health.

<HEADLINE> Union Bars 'Oklahoma' From Broadway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No go ``Oklahoma!''  
</P>
<P>
	Plans to bring the smash London revival of ``Oklahoma!'' to  
Broadway have been put on hold after Actors' Equity barred the 
producer from using the British cast when the Rodgers and 
Hammerstein musical comes to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Cameron Mackintosh had wanted to use the London company  
on Broadway because of time constraints on the show's busy 
director, Trevor Nunn, who runs the Royal National Theater in 
England. An American cast eventually would have taken over the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was being proposed was the only way forward,'' Mackintosh  
said Wednesday from England. ``The fact that Equity feels that they 
can't allow this leaves nowhere else for us to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn had appeared Tuesday before the union's governing council  
to state his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn is busy directing productions of ``Troilus and Cressida''  
and ``Candide'' at the Royal National in London as well as ``Not 
About Nightingales,'' a play by Tennessee Williams, in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oklahoma!'' had a sold-out summer run last year in London at  
the Royal National. Mackintosh reopened the show in January for a 
six-month engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	An opening in New York was never officially announced, although  
it was widely assumed that Mackintosh wanted to present the show 
here in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, ``Oklahoma!'' won four Olivier Awards, London's  
equivalent of the Tonys, including the prize for best musical 
production.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Continue To Wait for Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers have waited for  
Dennis Rodman. And waited, and waited, and waited. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps their patience is wearing a bit thin.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks into it, the same questions are there, it's hard to  
find the answers,'' Rick Fox said after scoring 20 points to help 
the Lakers overpower the Charlotte Hornets 116-88 Tuesday night. 
``If he's coming, the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we put all that stuff aside, the trade talk, the  
Rodman talk. This has been a night we've been waiting for, and we 
went out and made it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Lakers coach Del Harris said he placed a  
moratorium on Rodman discussions with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling my players that I would prefer they don't give any  
more answers to trade rumors or acquisition rumors,'' Harris said. 
``I think we've done enough. I don't think it's healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed an interest in Rodman more than two  
weeks ago. The eccentric seven-time NBA rebounding champion 
reportedly decided last week he wanted to play for them, and a 
source close to the team told The Associated Press late Sunday he 
was expected to be signed by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen, which really shouldn't be considered a major  
surprise since Rodman has proven to be anything but predictable in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	While responding to questions about a civil case involving  
Rodman on Tuesday, attorney Richard Howell was asked if he was 
Rodman's civil lawyer or his sole lawyer, and whether his client 
would join the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm his lawyer lawyer, I know everything,'' Howell replied.  
``And I'm not saying a thing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for representatives of International Creative  
Management, Rodman's new agents, weren't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever he decides to come, if he decides to come, is fine,''  
said Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, who had 20 points and 12 
rebounds against the Hornets despite sitting out the final 17 
minutes. ``If he decides not to come, it's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been that type of a guy, to keep people guessing,  
the last five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was in Las Vegas on Monday, registered under his own name  
at a prominent hotel, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if that annoyed him, that Rodman was in Las Vegas  
rather than with the Lakers, O'Neal replied, ``The only thing that 
annoys me now is we're 3-3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal made that comment before the Lakers snapped a two-game  
losing streak with by far their most convincing win of the young 
season. The Hornets (1-5), meanwhile, lost their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for Rodman, the Lakers learned that Robert Horry,  
hospitalized Sunday due to an irregular heartbeat, will remain on 
the sidelines for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28 was told to sit out the game against the Hornets and  
tonight's contest against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be re-evaluated Thursday,'' he said. ``They say I  
have nothing to worry about. The muscles are fine, the blood flow 
is fine, I've just got an extra beat in my heart, probably caused 
by a virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, (doctors) just want me to take it easy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Horry could return as early as Friday night, when the Lakers  
entertain the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Jones had 19 points, six rebounds and five assists, and  
Kobe Bryant added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who 
never trailed the outmanned Hornets, playing without injured stars 
Glen Rice and Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Psychologically, we needed a good performance, and we got  
it,'' backup Lakers point guard Derek Harper said. ``We finally put 
together enough consistency to put a team away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Phills scored 20 points and J.R. Reid had 13 points and  
eight rebounds for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets hung tough for 20 minutes, trailing by just three  
points before the Lakers outscored them 14-5 in the final 4:01 of 
the first half to take a 62-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets weren't closer than 10 points in the second half. It  
was 70-60 midway through the third quarter when O'Neal scored four 
straight points to trigger a 12-0 run that blew open the game. It 
was 89-67 entering the final period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a game for a while, but then we let it get  
away from us,'' Hornets coach Dave Cowens said. ``I thought we did 
all right in the first half, but the second half was not our half. 
We made too many mental mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the first of six in eight days for the Lakers, and  
the first of three in four days for the Hornets, who then get five 
days off.

<HEADLINE> Ore. School Shooting Trial Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- A judge on Wednesday delayed the trial for  
the teen-ager accused of fatally shooting two classmates in a high 
school cafeteria, saying he wanted to give defense lawyers more 
time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	Kip Kinkel, 16, was scheduled to go to trial April 6.  
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jack Mattison, who said he wants to ``get it done once and  
get it done right,'' asked both sides to meet next week to 
determine a reasonable time frame for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel is accused of shooting his parents to death at home last  
May and then going to the cafeteria of Springfield's Thurston High 
School and opening fire, killing two classmates and wounding 22 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel's attorneys had argued they needed more time to interview  
witnesses, obtain records and complete a psychological evaluation. 
They have yet to say whether they will employ a defense that claims 
Kinkel suffered from some mental defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that any delays in the trial would be unfair  
to the community. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Kinkel faces a maximum of life in prison without  
parole. Because he was 15 at the time of the shootings, he is not 
eligible for the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Abandons School Racial Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The city's school system agreed Wednesday  
to abandon race-based admissions and come up with a new enrollment 
plan that might increase consideration of students' economic 
hardships. 
</P>
<P>
	For 15 years, the school system has operated under a  
court-approved desegregation plan that says no school can have more 
than 45 percent of any one racial or ethnic group. Sought-after 
``magnet'' schools, including the district's academic flagship 
Lowell High, have a 40 percent limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a suit by Chinese-Americans who were denied admission to  
Lowell and two elementary schools, the district agreed to stop 
assigning students primarily on the basis of race, but said it 
would preserve racial diversity through other means. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which avoids a potentially divisive trial,  
brought proclamations of harmony from former legal and political 
foes: on one side, the school district and the NAACP, and on the 
other, Chinese-American students and parents who have become the 
city's largest ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement includes a ban on the use of race or ethnicity as  
the primary reason to assign any student to a school or program. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban would begin this fall with students entering  
kindergarten, middle and high schools, as well as students new to 
the district -- about 20,000 of the district's 62,000 students. It 
would extend to all students a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new enrollment system that the district would design for  
2000-01, with help from the state school superintendent and advice 
from parties in the lawsuit, could include diversity -- racial, 
ethnic and economic -- among its goals. 
</P>
<P>
	And if any school showed signs of ``racial isolation,'' a return  
to the days of de facto segregation in poor minority neighborhoods, 
the district or the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People could ask the judge to approve changes in 
enrollment, as long as students aren't assigned primarily because 
of race. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Orrick called on all sides to agree  
on a new long-term admissions plan by Oct. 1. He gave preliminary 
approval to the settlement and scheduled a hearing on final 
approval for April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes at a time of increasing judicial hostility  
to race-based admissions. In November, a federal appeals court 
struck down race as an admissions factor at the prestigious Boston 
Latin School, a ruling the school board decided not to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco officials insisted Wednesday they can find ways of  
maintaining racial diversity without race-based admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	State Superintendent Delaine Eastin said it could be done with a  
computer-designed enrollment system keyed to students' 
socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong correlation between race and poverty,'' said  
Anthony Anderson, an associate district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	The district also will redraw attendance boundaries for 2000-01  
and try to maintain diversity by combining different ethnic 
neighborhoods, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP lawyer Peter Cohn said the settlement still lets the  
district ``use all its tools to bring about an end to school 
segregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Girard, lawyer for three Chinese-American students and  
their parents who sued the district, said the settlement is ``in 
many ways better than what we could have achieved through 
litigation,'' since parents can work with the district to oversee 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this gives control of the district back to the  
population of San Francisco,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Newark Airport Has Worst Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline passengers on a tight schedule would  
be wise to avoid Newark International Airport, which once again 
ranked tops across the nation in flight delays last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey airport, located in the shadow of New York, had  
31,924 delayed flights, or about 6.9 percent of its total traffic 
for 1998, according to Federal Aviation Administration data 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up to second place was San Francisco International, which  
had 29,409 delays, or 6.8 percent of its total. The airport ranked 
third in 1997. Rounding out the top five last year were O'Hare 
International in Chicago, Hartsfield International in Atlanta and 
LaGuardia Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark officials complained that they are paying the price for  
antiquated air traffic routing patterns that give preference to 
nearby La Guardia and John F. Kennedy airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and local officials are working on a plan to redesign  
the traffic patterns to better accommodate the traffic at Newark, 
where flights have doubled in the past 20 years. In 1998, the 
airport had 32.3 million passengers, surpassing the 31.6 million 
who flew in and out of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with the FAA so that when they do the airspace  
redesign, we're the first in line,'' said Terry Benczik, a 
spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
which operates the Newark airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials are also lengthening a runway, building more  
gates, adding computerized instrument landing equipment and trying 
to persuade airlines to adjust their scheduling to reduce delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA labels a flight as late when it is delayed 15 minutes or  
more from its scheduled arrival or departure time. Newark ranked 
worst for the third consecutive year, and it would have held that 
distinction since 1991 if not for a drop to seventh place in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare had a total of 28,751 flight delays, only 3.2 percent of  
its total traffic. Hartsfield had 27,764 delays, according to the 
FAA data, or about 3.2 percent of its total traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	La Guardia, while ranked fifth in the total number of delays,  
was similar to Newark and San Francisco in its percentage of 
delayed flights. It had 24,689 delays in 1998, about 6.8 percent of 
its total traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the top 10 were Logan International Airport in Boston,  
Lambert Airport in St. Louis, Kennedy airport in New York, Sky 
Harbor Airport in Phoenix and Philadelphia International. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had 16,400 delays, or 3 percent; Lambert had 15,925  
delays, or 3.16 percent; Kennedy had 12,962 delays, or 3.6 percent; 
Sky Harbor had 11,757 delays, or 2.2 percent; and Philadelphia had 
11,552 delays, or 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Paul Newman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Surrounded by posters for his movies and photos  
of his family, Paul Newman cradles a stack of mail in his lap, 
chuckling over a $2 check -- a payoff of a Super Bowl bet from his 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, he moves from the office to the sitting room of  
his Fifth Avenue apartment, and proudly displays a picture of his 
young grandson sitting in a little race car. 
</P>
<P>
	In shirt, tie and blue sport coat, Newman appears comfortable  
not only in his natty clothes but in his own skin. He settles in 
the middle of the sofa, puts his black loafers up on the coffee 
table, and is ready to be interviewed -- except, well, he's not 
quite sure about what. 
</P>
<P>
	That's understandable since the Academy Award-winning actor also  
is known for his line of food products, his philanthropy, his 
political activism and his race car driving, which he intends to 
pick up again. 
</P>
<P>
	And right now, he's the best thing in ``Message in a Bottle,''  
the sappy love story which was released over Valentine's weekend 
and benefited from the timing. It was No. 1 at the box office, 
raking in $ 19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Newman would rather talk about politics and food than  
acting and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he took his latest role because the character was a  
salty, devoted, funny father -- and because it was relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done a lot of films where I didn't have to carry the  
film. And that was nice. That was a relief, to know that the whole 
thing wasn't completely on my shoulders,'' says Newman, who is 74 
and has made more than 60 films, mostly as a leading man, since the 
mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He offers a comment or two that might feed the publicity mill  
for the movie, and then quickly turns to politics and the 
impeachment of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cure is worse than the disease,'' he says. ``It gives  
Congress an opportunity to do exactly what they like to do best, 
which is to avoid doing the business of governing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moment after making it clear he doesn't care a fig about  
Congress, he calls for some Fig Newmans from his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	He self-effacingly says his food business is outgrossing his  
films and that he still works as an actor because he has to support 
himself since all of the after-tax profits of Newman's Own go to 
various charities. This year, the amount that the company has given 
to charity since it started in the early 1980s will surpass $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he never dreamed that the company would become as large  
as it is. ``If I knew it was going to be half this big I would have 
taken a cut,'' he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Business grew about 16 percent last year. ``Not bad,'' he says  
proudly. Even more proudly he relates that one of his five 
daughters runs the company's organic arm and already has 70 percent 
of the organic pretzel business. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's cornered the market, run everybody else out of business,  
which I like. I like the barracuda aspect of her business,'' he 
says, breaking out some organic chocolate bars along with the 
nonfat Fig Newmans. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a lunchtime trip to Newman's place can be such a fattening  
experience, it's a wonder that he keeps his chiseled features and 
slender frame -- until Newman says the really tempting stuff simply 
isn't kept in his Westport, Conn., home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into the theater because I was running away from the  
sporting goods business,'' he says, referring to his family's 
long-ago enterprise in Cleveland. ``I could never understand the 
romance of it -- I mean, of any (retail) business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he admits, it's ironic that he ran away from being in  
business ``only to find myself back in it. And enjoying it really. 
And enjoying the cutthroat aspect of it. Now that I'm in this 
business I understand the allure of market share, and killing the 
opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's any doubt, Newman makes it clear: ``Yes, I'm very  
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems like ancient history now that when Paul Newman was  
first starting out some people thought he was a Brand-X knockoff of 
Marlon Brando or James Dean. After an embarrassing debut in 1954 in 
``The Silver Chalice,'' he knocked out moviegoers two years later 
with his performance as boxing champ Rocky Graziano in ``Somebody 
Up There Likes Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He received Oscar nominations over the next four decades for  
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' ``The Hustler,'' ``Hud,'' ``Cool Hand 
Luke,'' ``Absence of Malice,'' ``The Verdict'' and ``Nobody's 
Fool.'' He won as best actor for 1986's ``The Color of Money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and Robert Redford teamed up as one of Hollywood's greatest  
duos in ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and ``The Sting,'' 
winner of seven Oscars, including best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has distinguished himself as a director with such films  
as ``Rachel, Rachel,'' which he also produced and for which he 
received an Oscar nomination, ``The Effect of Gamma Rays on 
Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,'' ``Harry and Son'' and ``Sometimes a 
Great Notion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman attributes his longevity to ``luck,'' but when it's  
suggested that sounds too simple -- if not downright disingenuous -- 
he explains: ``Genetics is luck. Appearance is luck ... being born 
in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says he worked ``to correct deficiencies'' but the fact  
remains he feels lucky to have been born a handsome guy and to go 
into a business where ``the premium on that is extraordinary.'' 
Plus, you have a better chance at lasting longer if you're male, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Married for four decades to Oscar-winning actress Joanne  
Woodward, he'd still like to work with her one more time. ``I just 
hope it would aspire to something,'' he says, adding that he would 
like it to be the quality of ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' in 1990, the 
last time they worked together. But nothing's on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman and Woodward teamed up for most of their films in the  
1950s and '60s, appearing in such movies as ``The Long Hot Summer'' 
(1958), ``From the Terrace'' (1960), ``Paris Blues'' (1961) and ``A 
New Kind of Love'' (1963). 
</P>
<P>
	As for the recurring hope that he and Redford would work  
together again, he says they have been looking for something for 25 
years, but nothing has come close to the quality they had with 
``Butch Cassidy'' and ``The Sting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were lucky. We did two almost perfect films together. And  
to try to maintain that special quality is pretty tough.''

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco To Cut 3,000 More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco will eliminate 3,000 more jobs after  
profits fell sharply in the fourth quarter due to oil prices that 
are at a 12-year low and a downturn in the refining and chemicals 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Sir John Browne said the latest job cuts are on  
top of 7,000 cuts already announced, amounting to a 10 percent 
reduction of the work force created when British Petroleum bought 
Chicago-based Amoco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sad and regrettable that we are having to let very good  
staff go, but putting together two organizations means that we need 
fewer people, and that situation is exacerbated by the continuing 
low oil price and hostile environment,'' Browne said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	British Petroleum's $48 billion purchase of Amoco was completed  
at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cuts would be made among the company's professional,  
managerial and clerical staff, but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said fourth-quarter profit after exceptional items fell  
to $532 million from $1.62 billion a year earlier, reflecting a 
$351 million charge related to the merger of the two oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were still at the top end of many analysts'  
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think BP is achieving things that most of its peers are  
not,'' said Credit Lyonnais Laing analyst Jurjen Lunshof. 
``Delivering this at current oil prices is pretty punchy stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On London's stock exchange, BP Amoco's share price closed down  
16.5 pence at 840 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's figures were the first for the joint company and  
showed 1998 fourth-quarter revenues at $19.6 billion, down from 
$26.8 billion in 1997. Full year revenues for 1998 were $83.7 
billion, down from $108.5 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, profit after exceptional items was $4.65 billion,  
down from $6.97 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two things are happening at same time,'' said Ian Fowler, BP  
Amoco's spokesman in New York. ``The merger of BP and Amoco has 
cost job losses and, at the same time, the oil industry landscape 
has continued not to improve. The oil price is still lousy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said BP Amoco will charge some $1.5 billion against  
earnings in 1999, mainly to cover severance pay and other costs 
associated with the job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said it hopes to achieve $2 billion in annual savings  
within the next twelve months, a year ahead of its original target. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne also said that BP Amoco will make around $1 billion of  
asset disposals in 1999 as part of a worldwide review to upgrade 
its asset portfolio, but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it expects crude oil prices to remain broadly  
unchanged, with supply exceeding demand. Margins and volumes are 
likely to remain depressed, while chemical prices are expected to 
fall for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco also said that it expects the merger to improve  
underlying pretax profit by $550 million within the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	To get regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Trade  
Commission for the merger, the two companies had to sell 134 
gasoline stations and nine petroleum terminals to address antitrust 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed to give owners of more than 1,600 gasoline  
stations in 30 cities permission to end their contracts.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Man Wins Big-Surf Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) -- Some of the world's best big-wave  
surfers paddled out at Mavericks on Wednesday to compete at the 
onetime secret spot with a deadly reputation thanks to gnarly 
three-story walls of water that once claimed the life of a top 
Hawaiian pro. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50,000 ``Men Who Ride Mountains'' contest started late as  
fog shrouded the rocky coastline about 22 miles south of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The surf didn't reach epic proportions for Mavericks but was  
huge nevertheless, with most waves in the 18- to 20-foot range, 
although some 30-foot breakers were ridden. At least three wipe-out 
victims swept into a rocky area known as the Boneyard and had to be 
rescued. No one was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was Darryl ``Flea'' Virostko, 27, of Santa Cruz, who  
sports black leopard spots dyed into his blond crewcut. He won 
$15,000, getting an extra $5,000 beyond the $10,000 first prize for 
pulling off a particularly slick move. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first wave I caught, it was a big one. The second one was  
even bigger,'' Virostko said, describing his winning ``air drop,'' 
in which a surfer free-falls, losing contact with his board on 
descent, then lands and rides the wave successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Before heading out for his heat, Australian contestant Ross  
Clarke-Jones described his simple game plan: ``I'm going to hold my 
breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few spots in the world boast bigger waves, and virtually none  
are as steep and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, when you catch a wave, the challenge is how you ride  
it,'' said Grant Washburn, a contestant from San Francisco. ``Here, 
catching it is the biggest challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The waves break far offshore and their explosive whitewater can  
knock surfers to the bottom, holding them under long enough to 
drown or drag them across jagged, rocky outcroppings. The water 
temperature for the contest was a chilly 52 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavericks was discovered about 20 years ago by contest director  
Jeff Clark, who let few in on the secret until 1990. Ever since, it 
has attracted oceangoing daredevils from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaiian big wave rider Mark Foo died at Mavericks in 1994 when  
he belly-flopped off a 30-foot wave and drowned. His board snapped 
into three pieces and his body wasn't found for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty surfers took part in the contest, some coming from Hawaii  
and Australia. Most were residents of Northern California, the 
mainland's primary big wave mecca. Richard Schmidt, 38, of Santa 
Cruz won $7,000 for second place. Clarke-Jones, 32, won $6,000 for 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300 people lined the beach or scaled cliffs to view the  
action. Some were awestruck by the monstrous surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe these waves. They're so tall. It's like  
another world,'' spectator Carol Kirchner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others doubted the surfers sanity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're psychotic,'' said Kelly McKinley of nearby Los  
Altos. ``They have a couple of screws loose. It's kind of like Evel 
Kneivel when he jumps and does his tricks.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Oliver Loses in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals left-hander Darren Oliver  
lost his salary arbitration case Wednesday and will get $3.55 
million this season, a $500,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, 28, had asked arbitrators Richard Bloch, Jerome Ross and  
William H. Holly for $4.15 million when his case was argued Tuesday 
in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, acquired from Texas on July 31 along with third baseman  
Fernando Tatis for right-hander Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop 
Royce Clayton, was a combined 10-11 with a 5.73 ERA in 1998. He was 
4-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 10 starts with the Cardinals. For his 
career, Oliver is 45-31 with a 4.64 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver was first Cardinals player to go to a hearing since Walt  
Jocketty became general manager prior to the 1995 season. Reliever 
Ricky Bottalico ($2.25 million) and infielder Edgar Renteria 
($1,975,000) also filed this year but settled.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Says AOL Aiding Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America Online renewed its contract to use  
Microsoft's Web browser because it wanted to bolster the 
government's antitrust claims against the software giant, a 
Microsoft executive alleged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is required by contract to promote Microsoft's browser over  
the one made by rival Netscape, but it recently gave up the chance 
to get out of that obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Vice President Brad Chase contended during his  
testimony in the antitrust trial that the decision was prompted by 
AOL's desire to help the Justice Department, which claims Microsoft 
has illegally smothered its competition. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 15 million subscribers, AOL is the world's  
largest Internet provider. Chase said that if AOL were to switch 
its Internet browser, Microsoft's browser market share would plunge 
to about 30 percent while Netscape's would soar to more than 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of shift would be inconsistent with AOL's desire to  
support the government in this case,'' Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will switch to Netscape eventually, Chase predicted, because  
of a $4.3 billion proposal to buy the company and make use of its 
emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In its antitrust lawsuit, the government alleges that Microsoft  
wielded its monopoly power to wipe out its competition. It claims 
Microsoft intimidated AOL into turning against Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	In his written testimony and while on the witness stand, Chase  
has argued that AOL chose Microsoft because of its superior 
technology -- and not because it promised to provide easy access to 
AOL in its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	David Colburn, an AOL executive who testified earlier in the  
trial, said Microsoft promised to put an AOL icon on the Windows 
desktop, the first screen a person sees after turning on a 
computer. Desktop placement -- and its potential to attract 
thousands of customers -- was the main reason AOL signed its 1996 
contract with Microsoft, Colburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chase disagreed. He recounted on Wednesday his meeting  
Colburn for lunch a week after the contract was signed to discuss 
why AOL chose Microsoft over Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn told him that Microsoft had the better technology, Chase  
recalled. Microsoft's executives also were easier to deal with and 
didn't continually change their conditions, while Netscape was 
``arrogant and they would put a deal on the table and put a deal 
off the table,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Microsoft released the written testimony of  
another upcoming witness, executive Daniel Rosen, who attended a 
controversial June 1995 meeting that is at the center of the 
government's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering of Microsoft and Netscape officials was the  
setting of an alleged attempt by Microsoft to illegally divide the 
Internet software market. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen called the charges ``fiction, absurd and untrue.'' The  
executive, who helped organize the meeting, said he had proposed 
that Microsoft pay for the browser that Netscape had developed for 
computer operating systems other than Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Microsoft already was planning to include its own  
browser software in Windows 95, which was under development. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no proposed `market division.' ... I did not get any  
sense that the two men had rejected my idea, much less that they 
regarded it as illegal or improper,'' wrote Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Notes of the meeting, which have emerged as important evidence  
for the government, were typed by Netscape co-founder Marc 
Andreessen on his laptop. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen criticized the notes, however, and suggested that  
Andreessen ``was not paying attention to the meeting itself but 
was, instead, reading and replying to e-mail messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen's notes ``are most certainly not an accurate or  
complete record of what happened at the meeting,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen takes the stand after the current witness, John Rose, an  
executive at Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest maker of 
personal computers, completes his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	During his cross-examination by the government Wednesday, Rose  
testified that more than 90 percent of his company's computers come 
equipped with Windows. Compaq has no alternative but to buy Windows 
because it runs more than 70,000 application programs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faces Contempt Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Only days after President Clinton's  
impeachment trial ended in bipartisan acquittal, a federal judge 
said she is ready to consider citing him for contempt for denying 
under oath that he had a relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who oversaw Mrs. Jones'  
sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, said she waited because 
of the trial and an appeal of Mrs. Jones' case. The appeal ended 
when the president and Mrs. Jones reached an $850,000 settlement 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, I believe that now it is time for the court to  
address the contempt issue,'' Wright said in an order issued 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she would step aside from the case if she were  
asked to do so by attorneys because of her contact with a House 
impeachment case manager. She gave lawyers until Friday to file a 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright's order did not say whether the president might face a  
charge of civil or criminal contempt. Civil contempt is used to 
compel someone to testify, such as the 18-month jail term imposed 
on Susan McDougal after she refused to testify before the 
Whitewater grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishments for contempt range from a reprimand to a fine or  
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House referred requests for comment to Clinton's  
private lawyer, Robert Bennett, who did not return a call to his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' spokeswoman, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, said she had  
not talked with Mrs. Jones, but added that Clinton should be held 
for contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``My God, he lied,'' she said. ``If he can get away with not  
being held for contempt, I suppose we could all lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright raised the possibility of contempt in a footnote to her  
Sept. 1 decision to release a transcript of Clinton's testimony in 
the Jones case on Jan. 17, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Wright said she ``has concerns about the nature''  
of the deposition but made no finding about whether the president 
was in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group in  
Washington, filed a formal petition with Wright months ago seeking 
a court hearing on whether Clinton was in contempt of court because 
of what the private organization called his ``apparently false 
testimony.'' The foundation said ``the court has the right, if not 
the duty, to defend itself against obstructive acts committed in 
its presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In saying she would step down, Wright disclosed Tuesday she had  
contact with Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and that her law clerk 
provided an affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Hutchinson wanted her testimony about Clinton's  
demeanor during his deposition testimony, including where his 
attention was directed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified to the grand jury that he might not have been  
paying attention when his lawyer told the judge about Ms. 
Lewinsky's affidavit and said there was no sex of any kind with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said she was not willing to be a witness in the  
impeachment proceeding and suggested that others could provide the 
same evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her law clerk, Barry Ward, later provided an affidavit about  
Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she didn't think those were reasons for her to  
step aside. If that happens, the contempt matter would be decided 
by another judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 
1991. She was a state worker at the time. Clinton has denied her 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones filed her lawsuit in 1994. Wright dismissed it last  
April and an appeal was pending when Mrs. Jones and Clinton reached 
the settlement Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
Ms. Lewinsky and set in motion a criminal investigation that 
resulted in the House vote to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Clinton was acquitted by the Senate on charges of  
perjury and obstruction of justice.

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Jagr Is a Star on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux hasn't laced up a pair of skates  
or stared down a goalie on a breakaway in nearly two years. No 
matter, he thinks the best player in hockey still resides in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux doesn't attend Penguins' games in person -- he's  
embroiled in a dispute with the bankrupt franchise's owner. But he 
watches enough on TV to give Jaromir Jagr this endorsement: ``He's 
the best player in the world -- by far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jagr has played during the Penguins' 10-game winning  
streak, at a level reached only occasionally by gifted players such 
as Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky, it would be hard to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jagr had four points in a streak-extending 7-3 victory  
Monday night over Washington, Capitals coach Ron Wilson said he 
yanked goalie Olaf Kolzig with Pittsburgh ahead 5-1, ``as an act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr is the best player in the league,'' Canadiens defenseman  
Stephane Quintal said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr will say only that Lemieux was the best player he ever saw,  
``and there was only one Mario.'' He won't compare himself to Eric 
Lindros, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr is enjoying the crackdown on holding, clutching and  
grabbing, tactics Lemieux long implored the NHL to regulate because 
they allowed players of marginal ability to drag down the quality 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has changed since last year,'' Jagr said.  
``It's more open and the stronger, better, faster guys have an 
advantage over the other guys. Last year, there was a lot of 
holding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's no holding back Jagr as he tries to win a  
third NHL scoring title in five years. He has 26 points, with six 
games of three points or more, during a 10-game winning streak the 
Penguins hope to extend tonight at the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprising aspect of the Penguins' longest streak since  
they won a league-record 17 in a row in 1993 is it has revealed 
Jagr the leader, not just Jagr the scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr succeeded Lemieux and Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain  
mostly in deference to his ability as a player, rather than as a 
leader of men. But he has stepped forward recently as the Penguins' 
most vocal leader, one capable of rallying his team even when he 
doesn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated the Penguins trailed Buffalo 3-2 on Feb. 2, Jagr  
stood up on the bench and said, ``We're not losing.'' The Penguins 
scored three times in the final 6:01 to win 5-3, with Jagr figuring 
in every goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the winning streak in danger of ending Saturday in  
Nashville, Jagr implored his teammates to remember they won their 
previous two games in overtime, yelling, ``Let's do it again.'' 
They did, winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Jagr is not a one-man offense. Kip Miller, who had  
only three points with the Islanders last season, has 10 goals and 
18 points in 11 games since moving up to Jagr's line. Martin Straka 
made the All-Star game, and Alexei Kovalev has 18 goals since 
joining the NHL's league-best offense 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes only a few shifts of any game to realize that  
Jagr's speed, playmaking ability, scoring touch and ability to stay 
on his skates even when pummeled by larger defensemen makes the 
Penguins go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jaromir Jagr gets better every year,'' Penguins  
general manager Craig Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine agreed, saying, ``You wonder how much  
better the kid can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What even his coach forgets sometimes is Jagr no longer is a  
kid. Jagr turned 27 Monday and is in his ninth season in the 
league, even if it seems like only last week he was an 
impressionable teenager playing alongside Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's possible Jagr might play someday for the now-retired  
Lemieux, who is trying to assemble investors who would rescue the 
Penguins from bankruptcy and keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great,'' Jagr said, clearly enjoying the thought  
that Lemieux might be his boss. ``It would be all offense all the 
time -- just the way we like it.''

<HEADLINE> TV Under Fire by Advocacy Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If television isn't very good -- and a fair  
number of people are vocal about saying so -- how can it be made 
better? And who defines what better is? 
</P>
<P>
	The debate surrounding two new studies critical of TV  
demonstrates how differently the medium is viewed from different 
perspectives and how complicated any effort to change it is. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that television is  
often irresponsible in its depiction of sex, would like programs to 
be more forthright in featuring such topics as contraception, 
abstinence and safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying television is immoral. ... We're not saying  
get sex off TV,'' said Vicky Rideout, who directed the report for 
the nonprofit foundation that studies health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply saying young people are watching a lot of  
television. TV is an important part of how young people form 
attitudes toward sex,'' Rideout said in releasing findings that 
half of 1,300-plus broadcast and cable shows included sexual 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fraction of programs show the risks or responsibilities  
of sex, the study found -- although TV executives and producers at a 
daylong Kaiser conference insisted they are not derelict. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' they note, has addressed AIDS and teen pregnancy. The WB  
drama ``Felicity'' featured an episode in which its title 
character, a virginal college freshman, learns about condoms from a 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dawson's Creek,'' another popular WB series, includes two  
teen-age characters who abstain from sex (and, for the record, 
others who don't). 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Dawson's a virgin and Joey's a virgin is a big,  
big topic of conversation in high schools across America,'' said WB 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Kellner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parents Television Council, a conservative media watchdog  
group, also believes television is influential. But chairman L. 
Brent Bozell III has a sterner perspective than the Kaiser 
researchers on how that influence is being used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prime-time TV today is infested with raw sexual content,  
filthy language and gratuitous violence. And tens of millions of 
impressionable children every night are being pounded with this 
sewage,'' Bozell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a list of programs deemed ``family-unfriendly,'' the group  
includes ``Spin City'' because it ``condones casual sex and the 
homosexual lifestyle.'' One scene criticized by the group shows an 
unmarried couple having sex, with a condom package visible. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the council would prefer to see less sex  
altogether, and more messages about the value of education, respect 
for authority and the importance of faith. It released a report 
naming companies that sponsor ``family-unfriendly'' shows such as 
``Spin City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But scenes or characters that earn a slap from the Parents  
Television Council might earn praise from other groups trying to 
encourage safe sex or tolerance of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	With pressure from so many groups, and with so many competing  
demands, how are broadcasters to respond? 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine television as the fulcrum of a teeter-totter, with  
advocacy groups, viewers and politicians all piling on to make it 
tilt their way. If the networks deserve any compassion, this could 
be a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Honig, the PTC's executive director, says the group doesn't  
``want a G-rated society. We recognize it's not going to be that 
way. We just want some responsibility in dealing with these 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast television will not go back to the illusory, sexless  
perfection of ``Father Knows Best.'' Audiences and advertisers have 
yet to signal they are fed up with the raciness of many TV comedies 
or dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	And how are networks to go forward?  
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters believe that a schedule full of clean-scrubbed fare  
like ``Touched by an Angel'' or ``7th Heaven'' would limit their 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally unlikely is a programming slate that trades titillation  
for real controversy. A handful of dramas -- ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; 
Order,'' ``NYPD Blue'' -- give thoughtful attention to abortion, 
affirmative action, child abuse and other social issues, but 
networks know they risk stepping on a land mine each time. 
</P>
<P>
	The medium's traditional fear of controversy, stems, of course,  
from its respect for the bottom line. Be too bold, risk losing 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The PTC understands the pressure points. The group slapped six  
major corporations on the wrist last week, stepping up its campaign 
to hold companies responsible for the shows they sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies responded to The Associated Press:  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a very good advertiser in respect to upholding the right  
kind of values,'' said Pillsbury. ``We want to do anything we can 
to support family-friendly programming,'' said Procter &AMP; Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks, of course, acknowledge that sponsors wield a  
certain power. Susanne Daniels, WB's programming head, encouraged 
advocacy groups attending the Kaiser conference to work directly 
with advertisers and help them understand ``the times are 
a-changin.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The times may be, but can television?  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pope Schedules Three Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- These days at the Vatican, questions about  
Pope John Paul II seem to fall into one of two categories: How is 
he feeling, and where is he going next? 
</P>
<P>
	With the pope easing back into his routine after his second bout  
with the flu this winter, his spokesman is already announcing plans 
for new trips for the 78-year-old pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican officials said Tuesday that three more trips -- to Iraq,  
Vietnam and Armenia -- would possibly be added to his schedule this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Vatican confirmed that the pope also would  
journey to a ski resort in Slovenia in September to beatify a 19th 
century bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	That word came on the heels of confirmation that John Paul would  
make a springtime trip to Romania, a pilgrimage viewed as a 
possible precursor to a future stop in Moscow, one of the few 
important destinations to elude the pope in two decades of 
globe-trotting. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, there were hints that the pope might stop in Hong  
Kong later this year as part of an Asian swing being mapped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican denies that the flurry of additions to a 1999 papal  
trip list is meant to counter mounting concern and ever-swirling 
rumors about the pope's declining health. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip announcements were made after final details were worked  
out with local officials, said Vatican spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro-Valls. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Romania and Slovenia pilgrimages, John Paul  
will make his longest trip as pontiff to his Polish homeland for 14 
days in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Holy See diplomats and logisticians are trying to make a papal  
wish come true by pulling off a trip to Iraq so he can visit 
Biblical sites as part of the run-up to Holy Year celebrations in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the bishop of Fatima, Portugal, invited the pope to  
return in a trip designed to give thanks for John Paul's survival 
after a May 13, 1981, assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square. 
The pope didn't immediately respond to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	But while his travel agenda grows, the pope has been cutting  
back lately at home. He has canceled several engagements at the 
Vatican while fighting the flu, and his Sunday appearances from a 
window overlooking St. Peter's Square have been briefer than usual 
lately, to give the pope more rest time. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, John Paul has struggled with a bad, left-hand tremor,  
and his voice is often slurred, two symptoms that have led many 
observers to say he has Parkinson's disease. The Vatican has not 
commented on the pope's condition.

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Warming' to Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Offering his strongest statement to date on  
whether he is going to run for president in 2000, Gov. George W. 
Bush said Wednesday: ``I'm warming to the task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican, a leader in several recent polls on the 2000  
race, repeated that he still hasn't made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spoke after a meeting with legislative leaders from New  
Jersey and South Carolina. It was his latest discussion with 
politicians from outside Texas who are urging him to seek the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of the people here said, `If you'll run, we'll  
support you.' For that, I'm most grateful,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunch meeting took place at the Governor's Mansion.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've come from New Jersey specifically to encourage this  
governor to run for the presidency because I believe the integrity 
of the presidency is something that is lacking,'' said Alex 
DeCroce, deputy speaker of the New Jersey Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think George W. Bush can bring that back to Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Lautenberg Won't Seek 4th Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Sen. Frank Lautenberg had a change of heart  
and announced Wednesday he will not seek a fourth term in 2000, 
saying he didn't want to spent the next two years raising money for 
another campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg, 75, becomes the second veteran Democrat not to seek  
re-election in 2000, joining New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
The departures create opportunities for the Republicans, who have a 
55-45 advantage in the Senate, to capture open seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I weighed the option of spending two years primarily  
fund-raising for my election against spending full time on the 
job,'' Lautenberg said in a statement. ``I decided that's not what 
I want to do. I've come down on the side of continuing my work for 
the people of New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg has been known for a liberal voting record and  
support of President Clinton's programs. In 1984, he successfully 
pushed a measure making 21 the legal drinking age in all 50 states, 
and in 1990, he sponsored legislation that banned smoking on 
domestic airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
	He had insisted for months that he wanted to win another term in  
hopes of becoming a committee chairman should Democrats win back 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	During a November trip through world hot spots, including the  
Middle East and the former Yugoslavia, Lautenberg said that his 
hectic schedule should put to rest any thoughts that he was too old 
to seek a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, he said, he decided to spend his remaining time in  
office working on legislation. High on Lautenberg's agenda is a 
bill, endorsed by the president, to require background checks when 
firearms are purchased at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg said that to run an effective campaign, he would have  
to raise $125,000 a week for the rest of his term. However, he said 
he believed he would have won if he ran in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she has given no public sign of interest in the seat,  
Gov. Christie Whitman is often mentioned as a possible GOP 
candidate for Senate in 2000. Whitman issued a statement Wednesday 
saying Lautenberg's announcement would have no bearing on whether 
she runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg, a resident of Montclair, earned millions as founder  
of Automatic Data Processing, a payroll services company, before 
entering politics in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	That year he won an open Senate seat by defeating Republican  
Rep. Millicent Fenwick, the model for Lacey Davenport in the 
``Doonesbury'' comic strip. That campaign, and his two subsequent 
re-election victories, gave him a reputation as a bruising and 
aggressive campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg is the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget  
Committee. He also serves on the Appropriations, Environment and 
Public Works and Intelligence committees.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Operating Profit Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Bank said today its 1998  
operating profit was unchanged from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's largest commercial bank's operating profit held at 4.3  
billion marks, or $2.45 billion, for the latest year, matching the 
figure for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement boosted its shares by up to 1.4 percent in  
early trading today on the Frankfurt stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts said Deutsche Bank's earnings performance may  
be weaker than it looks because of the way it calculated the 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank normally calculates operating profit after risk  
provisions. But the bank said its 1998 operating profit does not 
include expenditures for conversions to the new European currency, 
the euro, and for preparing its computers for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank has a $10.1 billion deal to acquire U.S.-based  
Bankers Trust and is hoping for approval from regulators this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also one of many German companies facing class-action  
suits in the United States filed by Holocaust survivors, accusing 
them of profiting from slave labor or the Nazi expropriation of 
Jewish assets.

<HEADLINE> Declassified Spy Photos Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To the untrained eye the pictures appear to  
show vast, disorganized construction sites deep in an evergreen 
forest. Roads spoke out from a central complex, acres are cleared 
for new construction, occasionally a helipad can be made out. 
</P>
<P>
	The seemingly unremarkable pictures are, in fact, the product of  
a massive and costly U.S. espionage effort and were, until a few 
years ago, among the most secret documents in the possession of the 
U.S. government. They show secret Soviet nuclear weapons 
facilities, sites that remain off-limits to foreigners and that 
hold some of Russia's 25,000 nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Declassified in 1995, the images -- more than 800,000 of them --  
sat untouched in the National Archive, stored on reels 30 inches 
long by 2.5 inches wide. Only now are researchers beginning to sift 
through the pictures and they are making a case that the material 
is of more than historical interest. The images may show the way 
toward helping Russia reduce its nuclear arsenal and to safely 
store the warheads it keeps. 
</P>
<P>
	At a symposium Tuesday at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace,  
Joshua Handler of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School said 
the photographs show that Russia may have enough secure storage 
space to enable thousands more nuclear warheads to be removed from 
missiles under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Russia and the United States have faced a daunting task of  
financing adequate security for thousands of weapons storage sites 
scattered across the former Soviet Union. The specter of terrorists 
raiding a storage site, or of impoverished nuclear commanders 
selling them to rogue states, has been the driving force behind 
annual U.S. expenditures of more than $350 million per year in 
disarmament aid. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan have eliminated their nuclear  
arsenals, however, the number of active storage sites has shrunk 
dramatically as has the cost of providing adequate security, 
Handler argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it is clear that the number of storages is much smaller,  
their locations are more well-known and the possibility of 
understanding the cost of upgrading their security is much 
greater,'' Handler said. Based on Russian cost estimates, 20 
national-level weapons storage sites and 60 smaller, military 
storage sites could be secured for $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite photographs being used by Handler and others were  
taken under the CIA's Corona program, the world's first successful 
spy satellite system. The program was developed by rocket 
scientists pressing to find a replacement for U-2 spy planes after 
the downing of Francis Gary Powers' U-2 in 1960, and by optical 
scientists at Kodak in Rochester, N.Y., and Polaroid and the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's the gee-whiz factor -- nobody had seen these nuclear  
weapons storage sites before, whether from space or on the 
ground,'' Handler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the hundreds of photographs shown at the symposium and  
displayed on the Federation of American Scientists Web page at 
www.fas.org is an image of Krasnoyarsk-45 in south-central Russia, 
a uranium enrichment facility making a key ingredient in Soviet 
nuclear weapons. Photos show extensive construction, a main rail 
line leading into rows of industrial buildings and nearby living 
quarters. Individual railroad tracks and details of buildings can 
be discerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Characteristic looping road patterns helped CIA analysts and  
today's scholars find important details such as weapons storage 
bunkers. Often a helipad or an elaborate perimeter fence indicate a 
project's sensitivity. And the Soviets sometimes placed soccer 
fields near troop quarters, providing a handy measuring stick for 
the size of various buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of images of Zaltoust-36, a warhead assembly plant in  
Siberia, show extensive rail and road lines, secure storage areas 
and a secured perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars examining the Corona pictures are hampered by the fact  
that little if any of the CIA analysis that went with the images 
has been declassified. These ``photographic intelligence reports'' 
contained detailed descriptions of the facilities pictured, 
according to Charles Vick, an expert in Soviet rocketry for the 
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington-based research 
group that follows national security issues.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Pilots' Union More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today gave American Airlines'  
pilot union more time to defend itself against contempt charges 
that stemmed from failing to halt a sickout that at one point 
grounded more than half the flights of the nation's second-largest 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association had asked U.S. District Judge Joe  
Kendall to hear its side of the case before imposing damages. The 
union said it needed more time to rebut financial harm the carrier 
claims it suffered as a result of the job action. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's lawyer, Dee Kelly, urged the judge to proceed,  
saying, ``I frankly think they've had notice. The airline has 
suffered huge losses and we would like to show the court how 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, who has promised a sizable fine against the union,  
continued the hearing until April 12. He also ruled that a 
temporary restraining order issued a week ago ordering the pilots 
to return to their cockpits will remain in effect through May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to cool down and take the loaded guns away from each  
other's heads,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union placed $10 million, or one-quarter of its assets, with  
the court on Tuesday in preparation for the fine Kendall promised 
on Saturday, when he ruled that the union did not do enough to 
prevent the sickout once he ordered pilots back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' work action took place over 10 days and resulted in  
delays and cancellations for more than 600,000 passengers when 
about 6,000 flights were left at the gate. Flights, however, appear 
to be back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if the airline is running normal, we think the union  
should share in the pain,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Herring, vice president and controller for American, told  
the judge the carrier has lost an estimated $58.7 million in 
revenue from 4 p.m. last Wednesday to the end of Saturday. 
Wednesday is when Kendall ordered the pilots back to work; Saturday 
is when he held the union and two top board members in contempt and 
promised to fine them. 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire 10 days of the work action, losses ``will easily  
exceed $150 million,'' Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Ahern, vice president of operations for AMR Corp., the  
airline's parent company, said that as of this morning 486 pilots 
were on the sick list -- down from 2,443 out sick on Friday -- and 
cancellations dropped significantly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other evidence presented in court today, American turned  
in an e-mail it said was threatening to the judge. Details of that 
message were not released by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots say they became disillusioned at the negotiating  
table with Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR. According to APA, the 
company had ignored their contract by purchasing Reno Air Corp. and 
not immediately increasing pay for all pilots affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations continued on the issue Tuesday, and the airline  
said it had offered movement on some of the core issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it offered to immediately increase pay up to 56  
percent for pilots of Reno Air, which was purchased by AMR in 
December. American also said it would shorten the overall period 
for training and integrating both airline operations and pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot union president Rich LaVoy said negotiators have agreed on  
a training and transition program that would take up to 18 months. 
The sticking point continues to be when Reno pilots will get their 
raise. American is willing to do it immediately; the union wants it 
to be retroactive to the day Reno was purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid. AMR said the pilot union's 
demands to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly would 
cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the talks continued, American is expected to take steps to  
win back the business of passengers alienated by cancellations 
during a pilots sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say that because of high demand for seats, travelers  
shouldn't expect big fare cuts after this labor dispute. What's 
more, American cut back its spring flight schedules by 1 percent in 
anticipation that pilots would refuse voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer frequent-flier  
magazine, said he expects the airline to use frequent flier miles 
as an apology rather than money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to see a lot of big fare slashes.  
American is more conservative. They don't like to do things 
everyone else would match,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hotard, a spokesman for AMR, said because of federal  
requirements he could not comment on whether there would be a fare 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	To appease travel agents who have been overwhelmed by the  
changes in schedules, American will also pay commissions for 
tickets that were later refunded because of the sickout. 
Commissions are not usually paid in that situation.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Defends Ban on Sex Toys' Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Women who say they can't enjoy  
themselves in the bedroom without sex toys like vibrators asked a 
federal judge Wednesday to block a new Alabama law banning the sale 
of such items. 
</P>
<P>
	Those challenging the 1998 law contend it violates privacy  
rights by indirectly prohibiting adults from engaging in legal acts 
behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state contends there is no fundamental right to a  
product used to produce an orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lynwood Smith gave no indication of when he  
might rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on sex toys in this Bible Belt state was signed by Gov.  
Fob James, who was defeated last November. He backed prayer in 
school and once threatened to call out the National Guard to keep 
the Ten Commandments on a courtroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was inserted in a law to prohibit nude dancing in  
nightclubs. Selling or distributing ``any device designed or 
marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital 
organs'' was made punishable by up to a year in jail and a $10,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is not being enforced pending the outcome of the  
lawsuit, which was filed by six women, four of whom say they use 
vibrators for gratification that couldn't otherwise achieve. The 
other two women sell sexual devices at stores or during in-home 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lopez of the American Civil Liberties Union, representing  
users and sellers of sex toys, told the judge that many sex 
therapists recommend the devices for women who cannot achieve 
orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state contend that similar bans in Texas and  
Georgia have been upheld and that legislators have broad discretion 
in passing laws to protect the public from what they regard as 
harmful products. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul H. Van Wyk, a Montgomery psychologist who is not involved  
in the lawsuit, said in an interview that he rarely recommends sex 
aids to clients, but he doesn't believe the items should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting us from vibrators is protecting us from a crime  
without a victim,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the plaintiffs, Sherri Williams, who owns stores called  
Pleasures in Huntsville and Decatur, said business was initially 
hurt by the law but picked up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Valentine's. That's always a big time for us,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Kurds Test Europe's Tolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Kurds have found refuge, jobs and a base  
for their independence struggle in western Europe, but violent 
protests by militants are testing the tolerance of their host 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, home to about a half-million Kurds, this week's  
violence sparked by the arrest of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan fed 
an emotional debate about citizenship rights for foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned Kurds on Wednesday that they  
could face ``the force of the law,'' including deportation, if they 
resort to violence in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berlin on Wednesday, Israeli security guards shot and killed  
three Kurds who forced their way into the Israeli consulate with 
dozens of protesters enraged by reports that Israel aided in 
Ocalan's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 43 people were injured: 16 demonstrators and 27 police  
officers. Police said they arrested 220 Kurds, 45 at the consulate 
and the remainder at demonstrations after the shootings. It is 
unclear what charges they will face. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, though, European Union countries seemed to  
defer a crackdown against the small minority of militant Kurds, 
partly out of sympathy for their people's plight after a 14-year 
battle to carve their own homeland out of southeastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	As television images of Kurdish demonstrators storming embassies  
and battling police flashed into living rooms across Europe, the 
many other Kurds who tacitly support the guerrilla campaign by 
Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, kept a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked our community to remain calm and show their  
discontent by peaceful actions,'' said Kendal Nezam, head of the 
Kurdish Institute in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not worried about any revenge measures being taken  
against them in person,'' he said of the estimated 120,000 Kurds in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the many protesters across Europe were usually treated with  
restraint. Police in Germany and Italy let most of them go after 
identity checks. Brussels, Belgium, the seat of the EU, tried to 
take a tougher line by temporarily banning demonstrations by Turks 
and Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping western Europe tolerant of their cause is crucial for  
Kurdish militants, who collect money for the PKK among Turkish 
Kurds living there and use the region as a base for promoting the 
Kurdish cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere is that clearer than in Germany, which has western  
Europe's largest Kurdish population. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the government has banned the PKK, officials estimate  
Ocalan's group still has about 10,000 militants in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But a backlash against violence by Kurds was building among  
politicians, none of whom want to be seen as soft on foreigners who 
commit offenses in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's tough talk itself was in response to pressure from  
the conservative opposition, which has launched a petition against 
government plans to grant several million foreign residents German 
citizenship while allowing them to keep their original citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	To cheers at a rally of rightist supporters, Bavarian governor  
Edmund Stoiber declared Wednesday that the Kurdish struggle ``must 
not be allowed to play itself out in the streets of Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aghast at the violence, critics of the citizenship plan argued  
it would no longer allow Germany to kick out violent Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, home to about 50,000 Kurds, the government of Prime  
Minister Tony Blair -- a center-left administration like Schroeder's 
-- has made no direct threat to deport Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lord Rea, a Labor Party member of the House of Lords who  
sympathizes with the Kurds, said they were going too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of occupation is mistaken,'' he said after Kurds,  
occupying the Greek Embassy in London for a second day, refused to 
let him in when he wanted to help mediate.

<HEADLINE> New Marrow May Help With SCIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bone marrow transplants from relatives can extend the lives of  
children with extremely weak immune systems, a rare genetic 
disorder once considered almost always fatal, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have known since 1968 that bone marrow transplants could  
help children with SCIDS, or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome, but there was scant information on the longer-term 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies with the disease can't produce T-cells that ward off  
infection, and can die from something as minor as a cold. The 
best-known victim was David, the Houston ``Bubble Boy'' who lived 
in a germ-proof enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Rebecca  
Buckley and colleagues at the Duke University Medical Center showed 
that children who received bone marrow transplants from relatives 
benefited, even if the donor was not an identical match. 
</P>
<P>
	They examined 89 infants who received transplants between 1982  
and 1998. Among them, 72, or 81 percent, were still alive three 
months to 16 1/2 years after transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Alain Fischer of the Necker  
Hospital in Paris called the study's results impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long-term follow-up, which found the children in good general  
health, validates these results. These outcomes are by far the best 
that have been reported,'' Fischer wrote.

<HEADLINE>  New Manager, Outlook for Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Malone spent the offseason retooling  
the Los Angeles Dodgers with a couple of big trades and the 
commitment of millions of dollars to players -- mostly to Kevin 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the general manager says, the real fun begins.  
</P>
<P>
	``The organization was in a place where we needed to make a lot  
of changes,'' he said. ``The last five months, there's been a lot 
of hard work. Right now, the light at the end of the tunnel is 
growing larger and larger. We'll soon be involved in actual 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and catchers report Thursday to Vero Beach, Fla., for  
perhaps the final spring training at Dodgertown, with the rest of 
the team due Feb. 24. The exhibition schedule opens March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sanctuary is the game itself,'' Malone said. ``I was one of  
those guys who always loved to practice because I loved the game. 
I'm getting excited, knowing that the beginning of the season and 
the coming together of what I believe is a championship club is 
getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've positioned ourself on paper to be a championship club.  
Now, we've got to work real hard and get it done on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new faces will be plentiful, headed by manager Davey  
Johnson, hired by Malone in October. No team of Johnson's has ever 
finished lower than second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there's Brown, a 33-year-old right-hander who  
signed a record $105 million, seven-year contract to anchor the 
starting rotation, a deal that caused many major league owners to 
lambaste Rupert Murdoch, head of the Dodgers' new owner, Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new faces include catcher Todd Hundley, center fielder  
Devon White, and relievers Alan Mills, Mel Rojas and Greg Cadaret. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are catchers Charles Johnson and Tom Prince,  
infielder-outfielder Bobby Bonilla, relievers Mark Guthrie and 
Scott Radinsky, and outfielder Roger Cedeno. 
</P>
<P>
	And that doesn't even count the in-season transformation last  
year, which included the departure of catcher Mike Piazza and the 
arrival of outfielder Gary Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, just 17 players remain from the 40 on the roster at the  
start of spring training a year ago. Malone thinks the offseason 
moves have made the Dodgers, who were 83-79 in 1998, World Series 
title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about this team, I'm excited,'' he said.  
``I'm energized by the potential. What we've got to do is make sure 
our focus is clear, come together and learn, get to know each 
other, get on the same page as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More deals could come. There are six legitimate contenders for  
five berths in the starting rotation: Brown, Chan Ho Park, Darren 
Dreifort, Ismael Valdes, Dave Mlicki and Carlos Perez -- the only 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are two seasoned shortstops: Mark Grudzielanek and  
Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe competition is healthy,'' Malone said. ``We have a  
surplus as far as starting pitchers and middle infielders is 
concerned. To me, that's a strength. We'll see how things progress 
in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your ears are always open. Every day you look for ways to  
improve your club. I don't anticipate any major deals. I don't feel 
right now there are a lot of question marks as far as this club is 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone also refuted a recent newspaper report that outfielder  
Raul Mondesi, listed in last year's media guide as weighing 215 
pounds, had ballooned to 275. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was erroneous; he left here the other day at 240,''  
Malone said. ``He's 15 or 20 pounds heavier than where he'll be on 
opening day.''

<HEADLINE> On Show: Gustave Moreau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Almost a century after French painter Gustave  
Moreau died, an art historian reached into a cupboard in the 
19th-century symbolist's home and unrolled a previously 
undiscovered canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	It was big -- more than 4 by 6.5 feet -- and, though unfinished,  
it was impressive in its depiction of the mythical Diomedes being 
devoured by his horses. 
</P>
<P>
	To those who study Moreau, who died in 1898 at age 72, it was no  
surprise such a grand work had gone unnoticed for so long in the 
3 1/2-story gray brick home at 14 Rue de La Rochefoucauld, east of 
Paris' Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	The house was, after all, a museum, a shrine Moreau bequeathed  
to France replete with 15,000 of his paintings, drawings and 
watercolors along with mounds of books, papers and journals. His 
works now virtually carpet the walls, while others are displayed 
like posters in a museum store or in rotating cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
	By hoarding so much of his art, Moreau preserved his legacy but  
limited much of his fame to France. Now, the first retrospective of 
Moreau's works in the United States since 1964 seeks to bring 
attention to the jewel-like colors and fantastic imagery of this 
artist who painted history -- with a bit of poetic license. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gustave Moreau: Between Epic and Dream,'' opened Feb. 13 at  
The Art Institute of Chicago after a successful run at the Grand 
Palais in Paris. The display of more than 180 paintings, 
watercolors and drawings -- some never previously exhibited -- runs 
through April 25, then travels to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York for a May 24-Aug. 22 showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreau is best known for his paintings of mythological and  
biblical stories, confrontations between good and evil, a battle he 
saw in the movement away from spirituality and art to materialism. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believed that art should not merely mirror the times but  
should address the great human issues confronted by each 
generation,'' said The Art Institute's Larry J. Feinberg, who 
helped curate the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps his most popular work, ``Oedipus and the Sphinx,''  
Moreau shows the encounter between the mythical Oedipus and the 
winged monster with the head and bust of a woman who devoured those 
who couldn't solve its riddle. But Oedipus solves the riddle, and 
good triumphs over evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Born to an agnostic father and a Catholic mother, Moreau was a  
spiritual man who studied Hinduism and was interested in the 
overlapping of religions. He became increasingly pious after about 
1890 following the death of his parents who shared his home and 
Alexandrine Dureux, the governess he loved but never married. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreau was admired in his own time, even selling the Sphinx  
painting to Prince Napoleon for 8,000 francs in 1864. But because 
Moreau led a comfortable, middle-class life, he was not forced to 
sell many of his works and kept much for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Paintings such as ``Salome (Salome Dancing Before Herod)'' often  
use splendid tapestry-like colors and dreamlike touches to retell 
epics and biblical stories such as the beheading of John the 
Baptist. In ``Salome,'' for example, the young temptress dances 
with her eyes shut as if she is sleepwalking. The executioner, 
sword in hand, stands to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The Art Institute's Douglas W. Druick, who also  
helped curate the exhibition, ``Moreau saw himself as a would-be 
poet in an age of prose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This view seems to have influenced the painting ``Orpheus,'' in  
which Moreau adds a new final scene to the myth of the poet Orpheus 
being torn limb from limb by women he had spurned. In Moreau's more 
hopeful, dreamlike version, a lovely maiden has found the poet's 
head floating in a river and lovingly placed it on his lyre, 
suggesting his songs will live on. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreau was obsessed with technique and lists, the latter  
recorded in a thick red notebook that has helped scholars chronicle 
his works. He spent seven years developing the extraordinary 
``Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra,'' doing hundreds of studies of 
Hercules' anatomy -- not to mention Hydra, the mythical seven-headed 
snake. 
</P>
<P>
	To develop his skills, Moreau also spent months in the Sistine  
Chapel, copying Michelangelo's frescoes. And he enthusiastically 
sought out Leonardo da Vinci's works, using his walking stick to 
measure a da Vinci work in the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreau never traveled outside Europe but was well read, studying  
contemporary literature, the Bible, mythology, scientific books on 
snakes, a book on decoration and much more. 
</P>
<P>
	He frequented museums and sketched animals at a Parisian  
menagerie, where he probably saw the elephant he would depict as 
laden with jewels and walking through a flower-covered lake in one 
of his late watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Moreau lacked in personal experience, his imagination  
soared. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that I have sought,'' he once wrote, ``I have found, in  
small proportions no doubt, but in forms perfectly pure and 
flawless. ... I have allowed my imagination free play, and I have 
not been led astray by it.''

<HEADLINE>  First Lady To Consider Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inching closer to a possible New York Senate  
race, Hillary Rodham Clinton is sounding out supporters and 
weighing how much money she would have to raise to run a serious 
campaign. Her interest provoked some stirrings from New York City 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton promised Tuesday she would give ``careful thought''  
to running and she thanked ``the large number of people'' she said 
had encouraged her to jump into the race. President Clinton said 
Monday his wife would be ``terrific'' in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's comments fanned already-intense speculation about  
whether she really would trade her coveted status as first lady for 
the rough and tumble of the campaign trail. Whatever she decides, 
though, her deliberations already have helped the White House by 
changing the subject after a more than a year of scandal and 
impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggesting she has been preoccupied with her husband's troubles,  
Mrs. Clinton said she had not been able to focus until now on 
whether to run in 2000 for the Senate seat opened by the retirement 
of Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She promised a decision later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be pressure for her to give a sign one way or the  
other when she headlines a New York fund-raiser in the first week 
of March for the Democratic Party's Women's Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's statement brought a reaction from the camp of  
Giuliani, the New York mayor who could be a formidable rival to 
Mrs. Clinton. ``If Hillary Clinton announces a run for Senate, that 
would encourage the mayor to consider his candidacy for the Senate 
as well,'' Giuliani spokeswoman Colleen Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are told that her candidacy would be the singular biggest  
unifying force in the Republican Party,'' Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made it clear he has ambitions beyond City Hall and  
has not ruled out a run for the Senate. He has a strong base and is 
a solid fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer sounded a note of  
caution for the first lady. ``I think she would be an extremely 
formidable candidate. I guess she'd have to be the favorite, but 
favorites don't always win,'' Schumer told a news conference in 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could not elaborate  
on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's decision. ``I can't be any more 
specific than that because she doesn't know. She's going to talk to 
people, those who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said she has begun returning telephone calls to 
supporters and asking for information about what it would take to 
run a campaign -- from the amount of money she would have to raise 
to the availability of campaign talent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these advisers echoed the sentiments of associates of  
Mrs. Clinton, who have been saying for weeks that they suspect she 
will eventually decide against making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for running for office, 
according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of 
Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a 
Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democratic ally of the Clintons, is  
going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released early this month from Quinnipiac College's  
Polling Institute, had Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of 
registered voters to 42 percent for Giuliani. Six percent of voters 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac's telephone poll had a margin of error of plus or  
minus 3 percentage points, while the Marist poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Has Chance To Tie Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA -- (AP) -- For the second time in three seasons, Eric  
Lindros has a chance to tie the Philadelphia Flyers' record for 
points in consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' streak reached 17 games in the Flyers' 4-1 win at  
Phoenix on Tuesday night, leaving him one short of Bob Clarke's 
team mark (18) set in 1975. In the 1996-97 season, Lindros also put 
together a 17-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' captain can put his name in the record book Thursday  
night when the Montreal Canadiens visit Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	During the off-season, Clarke, now president and general manager  
of the Flyers, challenged Lindros to become a more consistent 
player and leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has responded with what could turn out to be the best of  
his seven pro seasons. With 32 goals and only two games missed due 
to injury, Lindros has a chance to establish new career highs -- 
presently 47 goals, 73 games -- in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I've never seen him this good,'' said Mikael  
Renberg. ``Not only scoring points, but he's doing everything. Some 
games we're up a goal or two and we put him out there in crucial 
situations. He's such a team player now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 78 points, Lindros stands second to Pittsburgh's Jaromir  
Jagr in league scoring. His plus-39 trails only teammate John 
LeClair (plus-40). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's only thinking about going out and winning the  
game,'' said Chris Therien. ``But it would be a great achievement. 
They (management) asked him to be more consistent and he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeClair marvels at the fact that Lindros really hasn't had a  
sub-par game since the streak started Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``''I think it shows what kind of great player you are. Some  
players are great, but they're great when they want to be. I think 
Eric has been great every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros plays down the streak, putting more emphasis on the  
team's success. After losing the first two games of a four-game 
western road trip, the Flyers came back to tie Colorado and beat 
the Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two games were pretty positive,'' he said. ``I think  
we're playing more consistently as a team. Last year we were hot, 
then cold again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros takes the chance at a record in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess when you're healthy and the team is playing well ...  
it's not something that you worry about. It's something that you 
should have some fun with and go out and enjoy the game.''

<HEADLINE> Girlfriend Links Dragging Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- An ex-girlfriend of accused killer John  
William King linked him today to a gray pickup truck and a pair of 
sandals. Prosecutors say the truck was used to drag a black man to 
his death and that King's sandals were marked with his blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Keisha Adkins, 21, testified today that the night of the killing  
she saw King and two companions drive away in the truck to which 
prosecutors say James Byrd Jr. was chained. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins, who has known King for nearly a decade, also said he  
was wearing sandals the night of the killing. Prosecutors say those 
sandals were the ones smeared with Byrd's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins said King called her several times the night of June  
6 and invited her to his Jasper apartment. Also there were Lawrence 
Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen Berry, 23, who are to be tried 
later for the same murder charges in Byrd's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The three left the apartment about 1:30 a.m. to go meet some  
women, Adkins said. She left separately. Prosecutors allege the 
killing took place soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I remember right, Shawn was driving, Bill in the middle and  
Russell on the passenger side,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	King called her the next night and ``sounded different,'' she  
said. ``He said he needed to see me and needed to talk to me,'' but 
didn't say why. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say King, a 24-year-old unemployed laborer and  
ex-convict who served time for burglary, attacked Byrd as part of a 
plan to draw attention to a new white supremacist group he was 
organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adkins, however, said there was no racial discussion at  
King's apartment that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he was trying to form his own personal hate group  
in Jasper,'' District Attorney Guy James Gray said Tuesday, the 
first full day of testimony. ``This killing was to promote his own 
personal agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King faces life in prison or death by injection if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 49, was chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged  
for three miles before his body -- minus a head, neck and arm -- was 
dumped on a road across from a black church and cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles testified Tuesday that the  
evidence wasn't consistent with a routine hit-and-run accident: 
There were no skid marks, and the bloody trail did not run parallel 
to the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going through my mind. ... Somebody's dragging  
something,'' Rowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gray's opening statement to the jury of 11 whites and one  
black, he said letters King wrote and tattoos that made him a 
walking racism exhibit would tie him to the killing, as would 
physical evidence including the lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was engraved with King's prison nickname, ``Possum'' and with  
three interlocking Ks, the KKK symbol, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's blood also was found on King's shoes, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also showed jurors photographs of Byrd's remains and  
tattered remnants of Byrd's clothing. Several members of Byrd's 
family began sobbing as the clothing was revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors portray King as unabashedly racist, a man who  
bragged about his tattoos depicting scenes including a black man 
hanging from a tree, Nazi swastikas and a Woody Woodpecker cartoon 
character wearing a Klan robe and hood. 
</P>
<P>
	Correspondence seized from his apartment the day after Byrd's  
death and entered into evidence Tuesday included 22 pages of 
handwritten by-laws and a code of ethics for King's ``Confederate 
Knights of America Texas Rebel Soldiers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs -- who declined an  
immediate opening statement -- objected to introduction of the 
written material and photos of King's tattoos, on grounds these 
items were protected by freedom of expression. The judge overruled 
the objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Chapman, 18, testified that she received 19 letters  
from King while he was in prison, some of them filled with racist 
venom. In one, King signed off: ``White is right.''

<HEADLINE> John Friesz Visits San Diego </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Two days after Warren Moon came looking for a  
job, former San Diego starter John Friesz visited the 
quarterback-hungry Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Moon and Friesz were released by the Seattle Seahawks last  
week, and the Chargers are interested in signing one of them to 
start until Ryan Leaf gets his act together. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Moon said there would be a lot of positives about  
joining the Chargers. But his agent, Leigh Steinberg -- who also 
represents Friesz -- said on Wednesday that several other teams are 
interested in Moon, and the 42-year-old quarterback will extend his 
search a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have made signing a veteran quarterback their top  
priority, and need to do that before taking care of other free 
agent needs. That could open the door for Friesz to get the job 
here, and he'd come cheaper than Moon would. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get something done as soon as possible, whether  
it's here or somewhere else,'' said Friesz, who has a 13-25 record 
in 38 starts over nine seasons for San Diego, Seattle and 
Washington. ``San Diego still feels like home. I'd love to be a 
Charger again, sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard drafted Friesz in the  
sixth round of the 1990 draft. He said the meeting with Friesz went 
well, but that the Chargers could go through the same thing with 
him as with Moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like John, but once you show your interest, everything  
changes,'' Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard said the Chargers found out Wednesday that Mark Rypien,  
who recently had arthroscopic shoulder surgery, doesn't have 
rotator cuff damage. The Chargers will try to get him in for a 
visit this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That turned out good,'' Beathard said. ``That makes it a  
little bit different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rypien, who sat out last season due to his son's terminal  
illness, knows Leaf. Both played at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Beathard and Friesz have a good relationship, but  
added: ``Again, it's the Chargers' prerogative to set a timetable 
that makes sense for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friesz said starting is important to him, but so is winning.  
Aside from spending 1992 on the injured reserve list when the 
Chargers went 11-5 and reached the playoffs for the first time in a 
decade, the nine-year NFL veteran has never played for a winning 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty frank with both Beathard and coach (Mike) Riley,  
that if I felt this team was on a downward spiral, I wouldn't be 
here,'' said Friesz, who spent the last four seasons in Seattle. 
``I think that in the next couple of years it can be a real quality 
team. I think it's a team moving in the right direction and I'd 
like to be a part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers' 5-11 record in 1998 was largely due to brutal play  
by Leaf, who was a rookie bust, and Craig Whelihan. The two 
combined to throw 34 interceptions -- tying the team record -- and 
only 10 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, the second pick in April's draft, also had off-field  
problems and was benched after starting the first nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	The immobile Friesz won the Chargers' starting job in the final  
exhibition game of 1991. But he tore up his left knee in the 
exhibition opener in 1992, leading the Chargers to trade for Stan 
Humphries. After starting six games in 1993, Friesz signed as a 
free agent with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Friesz opened 1997 as Seattle's starter, but broke his thumb in  
the opener. He also started just one game last year, a 27-20 win at 
San Diego in which he threw an 81-yard touchdown pass to Joey 
Galloway.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heeding a lesson learned in Bosnia, the  
Clinton administration is making no promises of an early return 
home for the thousands of U.S. troops poised for peacekeeping duty 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission, as currently envisioned under on a peace plan being  
negotiated between the warring Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, likely 
would keep U.S. soldiers in Kosovo for three years, officials said 
Tuesday. That is the expected transition period during which Kosovo 
would gain autonomy from Yugoslavia, whose president, Slobodan 
Milosevic, so far has insisted that no foreign troops will be 
allowed to enforce a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his decision that U.S. participation in a NATO-led  
peacekeeping force was necessary -- assuming a solid peace accord is 
reached -- President Clinton said Saturday that as many as 4,000 
U.S. soldiers would go to Kosovo. But he made no mention of a 
deadline for ending the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is widespread agreement that we shouldn't lock ourselves  
into a short deadline as we did in Bosnia, only to have to break 
that promise,'' Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there would be no  
deadline for withdrawing from Kosovo, once the mission of 
implementing the military aspects of a peace accord is started, 
possibly in early March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really learned a lesson in Bosnia that setting an  
artificial deadline doesn't work,'' Albright said on ABC-TV's 
``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What one needs to do is to put down benchmarks,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Her spokesman, James Foley, told reporters at the State  
Department that the length of stay for American peacekeepers would 
depend in part on how long it took to establish and train a local 
police force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``That does not mean ... that our forces will be there for an  
inordinate period of time,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although members of Congress are generally supportive of  
Clinton's decision to include U.S. troops in a NATO-led 
peacekeeping force, some have expressed worry that it will stretch 
the military too far at a time when it already is committed to 
Bosnia as well as Iraq, Europe and East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	American troops were sent to Bosnia as part of a NATO  
peacekeeping force after a settlement was reached in November 1995 
to end an ethnic war in the former Yugoslav republic. Clinton 
initially assured Congress the mission would end within one year, 
but it is continuing today with no certain end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still about 6,700 U.S. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  
At the peak there were more than 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers would disarm Serb and Kosovo Albanian forces  
and clear the way for setting up a local police force. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the U.S. troops would stay in Kosovo however long  
it takes to deal with those ``benchmarks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're not putting that down as a period of time,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. military leaders also  
are concerned about not getting bogged down in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to complete this as quickly as possible,'' Bacon  
said. ``And I know all the other allies would as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final details of U.S participation have yet to be worked out,  
but a group of about 2,200 Marines now aboard ships in the 
Mediterranean Sea probably would be the first U.S. forces to enter 
Kosovo, official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Tuesday the Army troops  
assigned to Kosovo most likely would come from U.S. bases in 
Germany, although no final decision has been made. Many of the 
troops there have rotated through Bosnia on peacekeeping duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense to have soldiers (in Kosovo) who are trained in  
that environment,'' Caldera told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Gets 50 Years for AIDS Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- A doctor accused of giving his lover the  
AIDS virus by injecting her with infected blood got the maximum 
penalty -- 50 years of hard labor -- on Wednesday for attempted 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the defendant's life is unique among convicted  
felons. But in the last analysis the punishment must fit the 
crime,'' Judge Durwood Conque told Dr. Richard Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt was convicted of walking into Janice Allen's darkened  
apartment on Aug. 4, 1994 and injecting her with the tainted blood, 
which he claimed was a vitamin shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Schmidt injected Mrs. Allen after she told him  
their 10-year relationship was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Allen, a nurse, said she learned she had HIV in January  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, a 50-year-old gastroenterologist, had been free on  
$500,000 bond and an electronic monitor, allowed only to go his 
home, clinic and hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Thomas Guilbeau asked the judge to continue the  
bond and restrictions while the case is appealed, but Conque 
refused and Schmidt was taken to jail.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Veterans Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after appearing in the Super Bowl, Steve  
Atwater and Cornelius Bennett were released by their NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, who played in three Super Bowls and eight Pro Bowls,  
was not stunned by being cut. At 32, he was replaced on passing 
downs this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is a big shock to me,'' said Atwater, one  
of the best tacklers at safety in the game. ``When they were taking 
me out of games, that said something right there. They had needs to 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but great things to say about my time in  
Denver. It was 10 great seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater was released one day after Denver signed cornerback Dale  
Carter to a six-year, $38 million contract with an $8 million 
bonus. Denver needed salary cap room and cut Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a No. 1 pick of the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992, made  
four straight Pro Bowls (1994-97) and is expected to start in place 
of cornerback Darrien Gordon, in whom the Chiefs have showed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're very serious about a three-peat,''  
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said of the acquisition of Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have one of the best tandems in the league,''  
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said of Carter and Ray Crockett. 
``You can't believe what that does for a defense when you have two 
corners like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who played linebacker for the Buffalo Bills in all four  
of their Super Bowl defeats in the early 1990s, helped Atlanta get 
to the NFL title game in January. The Falcons lost to Denver 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Pro Bowler led the Falcons in tackles, but he is  
33 and would earn $3.7 million for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also want to make room for last year's top draft  
pick, Keith Brooking, who played regularly in passing situations at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also released offensive lineman Dave Widell and saw  
safety Devin Bush sign a four-year contract with the St. Louis 
Rams. Bush was a first-round selection in 1995 and started 36 games 
in his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Another veteran looking for work is wide receiver Chris  
Calloway, who was cut by the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my two years here, this was the toughest move I've had to  
make,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``We've improved the quality 
and the depth at the receiving position. That, along with the 
salary cap, forced us to go in this direction. Chris is a true 
professional and I wish him nothing but the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway, 30, would have earned just over $1 million this  
season, including a $500,000 roster bonus due on March 1. A starter 
since 1993, Calloway had 62 receptions for 812 yards and six 
touchdowns this season, all team highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had a good career with the Giants,'' Calloway said. ``I  
appreciate my time here and the opportunity the organization gave 
me to play. I hope to continue to play somewhere this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Middle linebacker Corey Widmer will be back with the Giants  
after signing an $11.2 million, four-year deal. Widmer became a 
starter in 1996 and last season he finished with 85 tackles, a 
fumble recovery and five passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important to me to stay here,'' said Widmer, a  
seventh round draft choice in 1992. ``It meant a lot that I can 
stay here and continue my relationship with this organization and 
its fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One quarterback he might face in the NFC East is Doug Pederson,  
who joined Philadelphia for $4.5 million over three years. Pederson 
was Brett Favre's backup in Green Bay and worked with Eagles coach 
Andy Reid, who was quarterbacks coach for the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, 31, has never started an NFL game and has thrown just  
32 regular-season passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step,'' said Pederson, who joins a team that used  
three quarterbacks last season -- Koy Detmer, Rodney Peete and Bobby 
Hoying. ``You can't turn away from that. But I'm ready. I'm willing 
to take that step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Clyde Simmons, whose 114 career sacks are 10th in  
NFL history, signed a two-year, $4 million deal with Chicago. 
Simmons, 35, started all 16 games for the Cincinnati Bengals in 
1998 and finished with five sacks, second-best on the team, and 30 
tackles. He made the Pro Bowl twice with Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> AOL Reportedly in Talks With eBay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. stock fell as much as 4  
percent Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal reported the 
Internet giant was talking to eBay about buying a minority stake in 
the online-auction company. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently were concerned that an eBay acquisition  
would be expensive for AOL, the nation's largest online service and 
Internet access provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock in the online auction company has soared since eBay went  
public in September, giving the company a market value of about $9 
billion. That means a 10 percent stake in eBay could cost AOL at 
least $900 million, not counting any acquisition premium paid to 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL stock was down $6.43 3/4 a share at $153.06 1/4 in afternoon  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors in eBay pushed up 
the company's stock by $2.87 1/2 a share to $234 by late afternoon on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported  
Wednesday that the direction of talks between AOL and eBay could 
change. But AOL executives are seeking to build closer ties with 
eBay. Last September, eBay agreed to pay AOL at least $12 million 
over three years in exchange for getting links on AOL that send 
users to its auction site. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., said through a spokeswoman it doesn't  
comment on ``rumors or speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by eBay said the San Jose, Calif., company  
is ``always looking for ways to extend our (business) 
relationships'' but termed the Journal report ``purely 
speculative.''

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Arrive at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- One by one they unpacked their gear for the  
start of a new season. Time for the champions to put the 
record-smashing year behind and look to the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	In came Andy Pettitte, then Chuck Knoblauch. Nearly four months  
of celebration had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	As baseball players started to report to spring training  
Wednesday, a day ahead of the first official workouts, all but one 
of the New York Yankees were back, intent on winning the World 
Series for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to win. That's the bottom line,'' shortstop Derek  
Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York went 125-50, setting an AL record for regular-season  
wins (114) and a major league record for combined victories in the 
regular and postseason. They steamrolled San Diego in a World 
Series sweep, then brought back everyone except Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is to get back to the World Series and win it  
again,'' said Jeter, who a day earlier had won a $5 million salary 
in arbitration. ``It doesn't make a difference how many games we 
win. We want to be the champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spring training officially starts Thursday, the first day  
pitchers, catchers and injured players can work out under the 
supervision of team personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	While some players reported Wednesday to the clubhouse at  
Legends Field, others -- Jeter among them -- worked out at the club's 
nearby minor-league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Yankees already have been working out for several  
weeks. No sign of complacency here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that being a problem,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
``You really don't have to worry about any guys in this 
clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who missed the postseason  
following colon cancer surgery, feels good about his progress and 
is hopeful of being with the team on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any concerns about my health or my ability to  
play. That's not a concern at all,'' Strawberry said. ``I feel 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case Strawberry won't be ready, the Yankees took him off  
the 40-man roster in December, which would shield his salary from 
the luxury tax if he's in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down here to prove to myself that there's a lot of  
baseball left,'' Strawberry said. ``This is gravy for me. It's all 
about having fun. After what I've been through, what can I expect 
but to have fun?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who receives chemotherapy treatment once a week,  
said his weight is back up to 222 pounds. If he doesn't wind up 
fitting into the Yankees' plans, he's confident he'll play 
somewhere in the majors in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky. Most people have a hard time with chemo. It's not  
an easy thing to get by,'' he said, adding that he hasn't noticed 
any side effects from treatments that likely will continue until at 
least May. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who had been offered $3.2 million by the Yankees, said  
his teammates were supportive both before and after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all happy for me,'' Jeter said. ``Now the focus is  
on the season.''

<HEADLINE> Tomatoes May Lower Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eating lots of fresh and processed tomatoes  
can lower the risk of many kinds of cancer, according to a study 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	A summary study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute  
found there was enough data to show convincingly ``that high 
consumers of tomatoes and tomato products are at substantially 
decreased risk of numerous cancers, although probably not all 
cancers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study analyzed 72 past studies that had examined the link  
between various cancers and the consumption of tomatoes and 
tomato-based products. Some of the studies also analyzed the blood 
levels of lycopene, a compound principally found in tomatoes that 
protects cells from cancer-causing oxidants. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 57 of the 72 studies linked tomato intake with a reduced  
risk of cancer, Dr. Edward Giovannucci of Harvard Medical School 
said in the report he authored. In 35 of these studies, he wrote, 
the connection was strong enough to be ``statistically 
significant,'' while in another 15 the link was inconclusive or 
only ``slight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The data are most compelling for cancers of the prostate gland,  
lung and stomach, Giovannucci reported. The findings also suggest 
links between tomatoes and lower levels of several other cancers, 
including pancreatic, colorectal, esophageal, oral, breast and 
cervical cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Clare Hasler, executive director of the Functional Foods for  
Health Program at the University of Illinois, called Giovannucci's 
work the most comprehensive to date on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that people who eat a large amount of tomatos have a  
reduced risk for a number of types of cancers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the study shows, ``It is good to eat tomatoes as a part  
of a diet that is rich in other fruits and vegetables,'' said Dr. 
Moshe Shike, director of the Cancer Prevention and Wellness Program 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual studies Giovannucci examined included tomatoes in  
many forms, including raw, ketchup, spaghetti sauce, tomato paste, 
soup and salsa. Benefits were found from all those forms, the study 
concluded, and cooking and processing tomatoes did not diminish the 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many processed foods containing tomatoes also contain  
fats and sugars that are not healthful when eaten in excess. Or 
they may be part of meals that contain high-fat items, such as some 
types of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the studies examined the dietary differences between  
people with cancer and those without. In many cases, the primary 
difference was the consumption of tomatoes or tomato products, or 
the presence in the blood of high levels of lycopenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies merely measured ``high'' consumption versus none,  
while other researchers measured the actual tomatoes consumed. One 
study, for instance, showed a 50 percent reduction in oral cancer 
when comparing people who averaged one tomato a day with people who 
ate less than three a week. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how tomatoes lower the risk of cancer,  
Giovannucci said in the study, but he noted, ``Tomatoes are rich in 
several phytochemicals believed to have anticancer properties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent of these phytochemicals is a compound that  
leads to the formation of carotenoids, chemicals that can protect 
cells from the effects of oxidants. Tomatoes are a particularly 
rich source of several carotenoids, including lycopene. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Giovannucci wrote that lycopene's benefits as a  
supplement, such as in a vitamin pill, have not been proven. The 
lowered cancer risk has been demonstrated only for raw or processed 
tomatoes, not from compounds extracted from the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings add further support to current dietary  
recommendations to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables to 
reduce cancer risk,'' Giovannucci said in the study.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Marks Day of Mourning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- President Islam Karimov declared  
Thursday a day of mourning in Uzbekistan, where a series of car 
bombs killed 13 people and shook the Central Asian nation's image 
as an outpost of stability in a turbulent region. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has claimed responsibility for the Tuesday attacks, and  
the government has not officially announced any suspects or 
arrests. Islamic militants have come under suspicion, but 
apparently without any specific evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	A visiting official from the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe said she had heard that five suspects had 
been arrested. But Helle Degn, the Danish president of the OSCE's 
parliamentary assembly, did not disclose the source of her 
information and stressed that Justice Ministry officials would not 
confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The six car bombs exploded within minutes of each other outside  
government buildings in an assault apparently aimed at the 
authoritarian Karimov and his government. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 13 people killed, more than 100 were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Stepped-up security was evident in the Uzbek capital Wednesday.  
Streets in downtown Tashkent remained cordoned off. Additional 
security forces patrolled the city and police stopped young men on 
the streets to check their documents. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the city's main subway stations was closed. Airports and  
railway stations were allowed to resume operations, but passengers 
and their luggage were thoroughly searched. 
</P>
<P>
	The car bombs were the most serious attack against the  
government since the country gained independence in the 1991 
breakup of the Soviet Union. Karimov came to power during the 
Soviet era and has been Uzbekistan's leader ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	He has kept a tight grip on power and tolerated no real  
opposition. The president points to the turmoil in the Central 
Asian nations of Afghanistan and Tajikistan and vows that he will 
never allow his country to slide into anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups have criticized Karimov's tough policies,  
and Islamic fundamentalists have on occasion clashed with 
government security forces. While most Uzbeks, including Karimov, 
are Muslims, Uzbekistan is a secular nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Karimov has accused the fundamentalist Wahabbi movement of  
seeking to undermine state power and create an Islamic state, and 
government security forces cracked down on Wahabbis a year ago in 
Namagan region in eastern Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Bocelli To Make U.S. Operatic Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Andrea Bocelli, the Italian tenor who has sold  
millions of pop and classical CDs worldwide, will make his U.S. 
operatic debut in the Michigan Opera Theatre's production of 
Massenet's ``Werther.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli, who is blind, will appear in the romantic title part  
with mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves for six performances of 
``Werther'' at the Detroit Opera House Oct. 30 through Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli is nominated for a Grammy for best new artist and enjoys  
success on the pop charts, but the company pursued Bocelli ``purely 
for artistic reasons,'' said spokesman Mitch Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a pop star that has become a classical singer. He's a  
classical singer who sings some pop things and has become a 
romantic idol,'' said Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli sang April 19 at the Kennedy Center for the Performing  
Arts in Washington, but this will be his first North American opera 
performance.

	The recall involves 54,500 1998 vehicles and 274,000 1995-1997  
vehicles, the automaker said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1998 vehicles, the air bags could inadvertently deploy  
if a metal object strikes the control module in certain 
circumstances. In the 1995-1997 vehicles, the air bags could deploy 
if the control module becomes corroded from water running across 
the floor mat.

<P>
	No serious injuries have been reported and drivers aren't at any  
immediate risk, DaimlerChrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the 1998 model year vehicles will be notified of the  
recall this week. Owners of the 1995-1997 model year vehicles will 
be notified next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The air bag control modules will be replaced and protective  
covers installed at no charge.

<HEADLINE> Freighter May Have Spilled Even More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- As salvage crews readied to tow the broken  
bow of a grounded freighter far out to sea, the Coast Guard said 
about 70,000 gallons of the molasses-like fuel oil may have spilled 
-- far more than originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	A salvage tug was expected to drag the carcass of the New  
Carissa about 200 miles into the Pacific Ocean, possibly at high 
tide today. An assessment team was on shore checking the condition 
of the ship and weather conditions in preparation for the move, the 
Coast Guard said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	With the bow still containing about 135,000 gallons of fuel oil,  
Navy officials believe sinking the 440-foot front section will help 
contain the gooey liquid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This oil is already thick and viscous. If you get it down to  
these depths, about 5,000 feet, it will be very cold and under 
pressure, which will help immobilize it and contain it,'' Coast 
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Ed Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials initially believed less than 40,000 gallons of fuel  
oil had spilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the oil still aboard the Japanese-owned ship and the oil  
believed spilled, that means less than half of the nearly 400,000 
gallons that was on the New Carissa at its grounding was burned off 
in fires ignited by a Navy explosives team last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship broke into two pieces after the Navy used napalm and  
explosives to try to burn off its fuel cargo. The burning, the 
first such attempt in the continental United States, was considered 
the best hope of averting a pollution disaster along the south 
Oregon coastline. The beaches are home to rich marine life and rare 
bird species. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo cited in today's editions of The Oregonian shows the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency has waived all environmental 
permits required for scuttling the ship because the Coast Guard has 
declared a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans had not been made as of today to move the fractured ship's  
smaller back portion. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Carissa ran aground off the north entrance to Coos Bay  
on Feb. 4 while the crew was trying to wait out a storm.

<HEADLINE> Peter Lynch Gives Boston Coll. $10M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Investment superstar Peter Lynch and his  
wife, Carolyn, have given Boston College a donation of more than 
$10 million, the largest gift in the school's 136-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was given Tuesday to BC's School of Education, which  
will be renamed for the Lynches. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lynch said it was the largest gift ever made by him and  
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch retired as head of Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund in  
1991 when he was 46, after increasing the fund's assets from $20 
million to more than $14 billion. He is a graduate and a trustee of 
Boston College, where his father taught mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Lynch is on the board of BC's Campus School.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lynches asked that the exact amount of the gift not be  
revealed. They said it was larger than the previously largest gift 
to BC, $10 million 10 years ago, and less than $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day, when we've become so cynical about education,  
this is an incredible statement, that Peter Lynch thinks education 
is worth investing in,'' said Mary Brabeck, dean of the School of 
Education.

<HEADLINE> Gymnast's Dad To Turn Over Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The father of Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu  
has agreed to hand over financial records of the trust fund he 
established for her before her legal emancipation last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumitru Moceanu also agreed to give a deposition to his  
daugher's attorney on March 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Moceanu, 44, did not comment after Tuesday's hearing  
before Harris County Probate Judge William McCulloch. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Moceanu's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, sought a court  
order to force the father to turn over the records, which she 
believes will show the teen-age gymnast's fortune has been 
squandered. Moceanu, 17, ran away from her parents' home last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Moceanu, has not filed a lawsuit against her father,  
Texas law permits judges to order evidence to be disclosed before a 
suit is filed to try to prevent frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarrell did not seek other financial records, such as Dumitru  
Moceanu's personal finances and records of the company that runs 
the Moceanu gym, said Katherine Scardino, the father's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Yarrell added that she still might seek those other  
records if she finds she needs them to track her client's trust 
fund money. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Moceanu's trust owns the 70,000-square-foot north Houston  
gym building, Dumitru Moeceanu owns the company that operates the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	While her father says all the money in the trust went to pay for  
the gym, Ms. Moceanu said she believes her parents have used some 
of the money to buy personal items, which would violate the trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund is liable for paying off $1 million in loans  
issued by Woodforest National Bank to buy the land and build the 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agreement reached Tuesday, Woodforest will turn  
over the records it has on the trust by Friday and Robert Sanders, 
an accountant working for the Moceanu parents, will turn over 
records he has by Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu no longer lives in Houston. The gymnast, declared an  
adult Oct. 29, moved to Orlando, Fla., last month to resume 
training and now lives in Colorado Springs, Colo., Yarrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	She is training in a facility for Olympic hopefuls. Scardino  
said the gymnast's parents are worried about her education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is this child not going to school?'' Scardino said.  
``She's flying around from Texas to Florida to Colorado and not 
doing what she should be at this stage of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu has been studying for a high school equivalency  
examination since first running away from her parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Dumitru Moceanu has dropped his appeal of a protective  
order keeping him away from his daughter until December, Scardino 
said. She cited her client's inability to keep up with legal costs.

<HEADLINE> New Marrow May Help With SCIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bone marrow transplants from relatives can extend the lives of  
children born with an extremely weak immune system, a rare genetic 
disorder that once was considered almost always fatal, a study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have known since 1968 that bone marrow transplants could  
help children with SCIDS, or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome, but there was scant information on the longer-term 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies with the disease can't produce T-cells that ward off  
infection, and can die from something as minor as a cold. The 
best-known victim was David, the Houston ``Bubble Boy'' who lived 
in a germ-proof enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, Dr.  
Rebecca H. Buckley and colleagues at the Duke University Medical 
Center showed that children who received bone marrow transplants 
from relatives benefited, even if the donor was not an identical 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	They examined 89 infants who received transplants between 1982  
and 1998. Among them, 72, or 81 percent, were still alive three 
months to 16 1/2 years after transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Alain Fischer of the Necker  
Hospital in Paris called the study's results impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long-term follow-up, which found the children in good general  
health, validates these results. These outcomes are by far the best 
that have been reported,'' Fischer wrote.

<HEADLINE> Dell Stock Down on Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. shares tumbled more than 13  
percent in morning trading after the company reported its 
fourth-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street expectations, hurt 
by intense competition with rival computer sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer company still managed a 49 percent profit increase.  
But the revenue disappointment was unusual for Dell, the 
third-largest seller of computers that has set a scorching industry 
pace with its unconventional tactic of selling machines directly to 
customers and avoiding the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell shares recovered somewhat by late morning, with the stock  
down $5.50 a share at $83.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's sales growth slowed in the quarter as rivals slashed  
prices in bidding wars for corporate buyers. ``We could have been 
more aggressive in pricing in our product,'' Dell chief financial 
officer Thomas Meredith said in a phone interview from the 
company's Round Rock, Texas headquarters. He said the company may 
bid more vigorously as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Dell battles for buyers of high-powered computers, the  
company continues to avoid offering budget models for less than 
$1,000, like rivals Compaq Computer Corp. and International 
Business Machines Corp. Instead, Dell has focused on machines with 
bigger margins, managing to post consistently strong income even as 
rivals' narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy resulted in a profit of $425 million, or 31 cents  
a share, meeting analysts' forecasts for the company's fourth 
quarter, ended Jan. 29. That was up from a profit of $285 million, 
or 20 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That increase was partly due to slower rate of cost increases in  
the quarter as revenue grew only 38 percent, to $5.17 billion from 
$3.74 billion. That was about $200 million less than analyst 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell was able to hold the line on higher costs in part by  
boosting its Internet business, which requires fewer staff than 
conventional sales. Dell sold $14 million a day in computers over 
the Internet in the quarter, up from $10 million daily the quarter 
before, Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dell's full fiscal year, profit grew 55 percent to $1.46  
billion, or $1.05 a share, from $944 million, or 64 cents a share. 
Revenue rose to $18.24 billion from $12.33 billion.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Growth Hormones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The first long-term study on the controversial practice of using  
growth hormones for cosmetic reasons shows the treatment can 
increase the height of healthy children by about 2 inches. However, 
the hormones don't offer a guarantee of any gain in stature. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings published in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine led some experts to question whether up to 10 years of 
daily injections are worth the cost and the trouble, especially 
since the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of 
hormones for cosmetic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Raymond Hintz and colleagues at Stanford University showed  
that about 80 percent of the children studied over 10 years reached 
heights greater than would have been expected otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the results in individual children varied; 20 percent  
saw no height increase. And few of the children reached the target 
height set by doctors based on the size of the child's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hintz called the results ``somewhat disappointing.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: Do we treat, understanding that it's not a  
100 percent guarantee and that it's years of treatment, or do we 
let nature take its course?'' he said. ``I think different parents 
are going to give different answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was paid for in part by Genentech Inc. of South San  
Francisco, Calif., which holds 67 percent of the U.S. market for 
growth hormones. A spokeswoman for Genentech said the company 
``does not currently intend to pursue FDA approval'' for short, 
healthy children based on the study's findings. Eli Lilly and Co. 
and Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn also make growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends use of growth  
hormones only in children who have a deficiency of the hormones; a 
rare chromosomal abnormality called Turner syndrome that stunts 
growth in girls; or a chronic kidney disorder that retards growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy warns that the hormones should not be widely used  
for cosmetic reasons because they could lead to tumors, diabetes, 
hip problems or difficulties with self-esteem. This study found no 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the FDA has not approved the drugs for use in short  
but otherwise healthy children, it is not illegal to do so. About 
30,000 children are treated with growth hormones in the United 
States yearly, and about 20 percent of them don't fit into one of 
the categories the FDA deems as medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	One year of growth hormone therapy can cost $10,000 to $25,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers examined 121 children who were considered short  
for no known medical reason and were treated with growth hormones 
for two to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 80 children who received treatment and who have reached  
adulthood, both boys and girls were an average of about 2 inches 
taller than would have been expected otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Sharon Oberfield of the  
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University called 
the findings inconclusive but was skeptical of hormone use on 
healthy children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is short stature a disease? If not, should the most severe  
short stature be considered a disability warranting treatment?'' 
Oberfield wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hintz defended the use of the hormones in some cases where a  
person is ``severely short,'' meaning below 4-foot-11 for a woman 
or 5-3 for a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have trouble interacting with people or in handling  
kitchen cabinets or driving, then it becomes a significant 
problem,'' he said. ``Like a lot of `isms,' such as racism or 
ageism, there is heightism, which can be subtle. Sometimes people 
judge others, even unconsciously, based on their stature.''

<HEADLINE> Biletnikoff's Daughter Strangled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- The 20-year-old daughter of NFL Hall  
of Famer Fred Biletnikoff was found strangled Tuesday on a 
community college campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The young woman's boyfriend, Mohammed Ali, was arrested for  
investigation of murder Tuesday night as he tried to drive her car 
into Tijuana, Mexico, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies flew to 
San Diego to bring Ali back to San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance workers picking up garbage discovered Tracey  
Biletnikoff's partially clothed body on a hillside between a 
parking lot and a tennis court at Canada College about 20 miles 
south of San Francisco, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was reported missing early Tuesday and had not been seen  
since she and Ali, 23, got into a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not give details of the killing or say whether  
Ms. Biletnikoff had been sexually assaulted. When asked whether she 
was a student at the college, sheriff's Sgt. Bill Cody said there 
was a connection but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Biletnikoff and his former wife, who lives in Southern  
California, were notified of their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty devastated, as you would expect,'' Cody said at  
a Tuesday news conference in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff worked as a drug counselor in San Mateo and had  
been dating Ali for several months, Cody said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Biletnikoff, who has four other children, is in his ninth  
year as wide receivers coach with the Oakland Raiders. He played 
for the Raiders from 1965-78 and was named MVP of Super Bowl XI. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the team's all-time leading receiver with 589 catches  
until Tim Brown broke that record two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sympathy and prayers are with the Biletnikoff family,''  
Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said in a prepared statement.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Sees U.S. Cultural War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the political right's intellectual  
firebrands is questioning whether conservatives should ``drop out'' 
of American culture and essentially declare decades of moral 
struggle unwinnable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Paul  
Weyrich wrote in a letter to several hundred fellow conservative 
leaders. ``I do not believe that a majority of Americans actually 
share our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation in Washington,  
says President Clinton's acquittal in the impeachment trial has 
brought him to the point of wondering whether conservatives should 
continue trying to influence politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he wrote in the letter  
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no other leading conservatives are calling for such  
drastic action, Weyrich's letter underscores the level of 
resentment over Clinton's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there really were a moral majority out there, Bill Clinton  
would have been driven out of office months ago,'' Weyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are angry that he got off,'' said Phyllis  
Schlafly, head of the Eagle Forum. ``They just don't understand it. 
They're shaking their heads: What is the problem?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition director Randy Tate said there is  
``considerable frustration'' over the Clinton case because ``it 
makes it tough to teach kids right from wrong, in the sense that 
the president doesn't know right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who led the  
prosecution team against Clinton, told senators toward the end of 
the trial, ``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we 
are engaged in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting 
to defend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Weyrich goes further than most other conservative  
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate, for example, said conservatives ``are increasingly part of  
mainstream,'' even on issues such as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlafly, also departing from Weyrich's view, said a majority of  
Americans still embrace conservative values. And she believes 
Clinton's victory had more to do with politics than morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only partially a moral problem. I think there is so much  
the Republican Congress can do in so many ways to grab the 
leadership and yet they continue to play a defensive game,'' she 
said. ``Republicans have had Congress since January 1995 and what 
do we have to show for it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, while a leading conservative intellectual, does not  
command a large grassroots organization or necessarily speak for 
large numbers. He led a campaign to rally social conservatives 
behind a Republican presidential candidate in 2000, but the effort 
failed after the prospect he favored, Sen. John Ashcroft of 
Missouri, decided not to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	He's is plowing relatively new ground by suggesting that the  
conservative movement cannot succeed in today's culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The culture we are living in becomes an ever-wider sewer. In  
truth, I think we are caught up in a cultural collapse of historic 
proportions, a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms 
politics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that it may be time for ``separation'' from society,  
Weyrich points to conservatives who teach their children at home, 
form private courts or get rid of their televisions. ``I think that 
we have to look at a whole series of possibilities for bypassing 
the institutions that are controlled by the enemy,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested a conservative roundtable to discuss the movement's  
next step. ``I don't have all the answers or even all the 
questions. But I know that what we have been doing for 30 years 
hasn't worked, that while we have been fighting and winning in 
politics, our culture has decayed into something approaching 
barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Weyrich said he was not suggesting that  
conservatives stop fighting. ``I'm just suggesting that the chance 
of victory that we thought was excellent is now not in the cards. 
We have to take the appropriate action,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Still Probe Salt Lake Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the midst of a Justice Department  
investigation, a former federal prosecutor now working with Salt 
Lake Olympic organizers claimed boosters broke no laws while 
bidding for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did consider a lot of the criminal theories and I don't see  
criminal conduct,'' Beth Wilkinson, a leading lawyer on the team 
that prosecuted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of their activities could be seen as unethical,'' she  
said, ``but that's a long way from being criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, which has five prosecutors working the  
case, has been guiding the investigation through the FBI office in 
Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize the importance of getting the focus back on the  
games themselves, so we're interested in getting this completed as 
soon as possible,'' FBI spokesman George Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources familiar with the investigation,  
prosecutors are looking at possible mail or wire fraud; false 
statements or perjury; tax fraud; and violations of customs laws 
that require declaration of sums of $10,000 or more in cash leaving 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	One former Justice Department official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Tuesday the high priority given the case may make 
charges more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent ethics panel last week revealed that executives  
of the Salt Lake bid committee gave more than $1 million worth of 
cash payments, free vacations, living stipends, shopping sprees and 
free medical care to International Olympic Committee members and 
their families prior to the 1995 IOC vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The report blamed former Tom Welch, the former president of the  
organizers, and Dave Johnson, fired last month as senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson, who left the Justice Department for a Washington law  
firm last September, was retained in December by the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee along with her Los Angeles-based partner, 
Barry Sanders, to conduct an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and Wilkinson said their no-crime conclusion pertains  
only to the SLOC, but lawyer Tom Schaffer, who represents Welch, 
says SLOC attorneys don't think his client broke any laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discussed lots of different scenarios with them on several  
occasions, and the three of us really couldn't come up anything 
that fit,'' Schaffer said. ``There may be other things that Justice 
is looking at that I'm not aware of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel last week said one former bid employee reported  
$30,000 was taken from committee bank accounts to pay for 
legitimate expenses in Budapest in 1995. But the panel, which had 
no power to subpoena bank records, could not determine whether that 
amount was taken out of the United States in cash or travelers 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Mitt Romney, the new chief executive officer for SLOC,  
received standing ovations when he appeared before the Utah House 
and Senate. Romney promised lawmakers that during his three-year 
tenure he would return the games to the athletes and bring the 
Olympics in on budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--Salt Lake bidders paid for ski trips for three USOC members in  
the late 1980s, Howard Peterson, former executive director of the 
U.S. Skiing Association, told USOC's investigating panel. He said 
he identified one of the members and gave information on the other 
two to the USOC investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	--The head of the Dominican Republic's Olympic Committee, Roque  
Napoleon Munoz, denied a newspaper report that he received inflated 
travel expenses from Sweden. He said he was reimbursed for a trip 
he took to Stockholm with his wife to evaluate that city's bid for 
the 2004 Olympics, but said the trip did not cost more than $5,000. 
Swedish documents cited by Stockholm's Dagens Nyheter newspaper 
indicate more than $18,000 was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Christian Rodriguez, secretary general of Chile's Olympic  
committee, submitted his resignation, but denied accusations he 
served as a go-between in gaining favors for expelled Chilean IOC 
member Sergio Santander. 
</P>
<P>
	According to SLOC's ethics report, Rodriguez accompanied  
Santander on a site visit to Utah in 1995 and -- at Santander's 
request -- asked Welch for contributions to Santander's political 
campaign. Rodriguez was managing the campaign. The ethics report 
said Welch contributed $20,050. 
</P>
<P>
	--Primo Nebiolo, president of world track and field, offered  
formal support for IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has 
faced numerous calls from outside the IOC to resign. He said the 
Council of the Association of Summer Olympic International 
Federations, over which he presides, ``is convinced that Samaranch 
is exceptionally qualified to navigate the IOC through these 
troubled waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time like this when strength, wisdom and determination  
are absolutely necessary to reinforce faith in the Olympic 
Movement, his experience and leadership cannot be questioned,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Less than a quarter of Olympic bidders responded to the IOC's  
request for information on rule-breaking behavior by its members, 
the committee said. It said replies were received from 11 cities, 
while two other national Olympic committees were given more time to 
file their reports. Details of the replies were not disclosed and 
the groups granted extensions were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	--With sponsors skittish over the bribery scandal, organizers of  
the Sydney Games were urged by an IOC executive Tuesday to plow a 
$66 million profit-sharing deal back into the budget. ``You would 
solve the financing issue in a stroke of a pen,'' IOC marketing 
director Michael Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Sydney about $130 million short of its target for  
sponsorship revenues, Payne said the controversial profit deal 
should be reviewed. He said the IOC warned the Australians three 
years ago against projecting a surplus for the games. Sydney 
organizers have predicted a $17.7 million surplus.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Fan Pleads Guilty in Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) -- A Minnesota Vikings fan accused of  
setting on fire the clothing and hair of two Green Bay Packers fans 
has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Siegmann, 23, of Eau Claire, was sentenced Tuesday to two  
years' probation and fined $200 for his conduct on Oct. 4, the 
night before the Vikings defeated the Packers in a nationally 
televised game. 
</P>
<P>
	Eau Claire County Circuit Judge Thomas Barland also ordered  
Siegmann -- who called himself ``The Grand Viking'' -- to spend 30 
days in jail or perform 240 hours of community service and to get 
an assessment for drug and alcohol abuse, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegmann was accused of lighting Casey Conners-Herm's left pants  
leg on fire and then setting Meagan Corcoran's left jacket sleeve 
and hair on fire after they identified themselves as Packers fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was seriously injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Siegmann told police he tied a shirt to the end of a piece of  
metal and lit it on fire and was attempting to stir up a rivalry 
between fans by creating an ``Olympic torch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty Tuesday to endangering safety by reckless use  
of a weapon and negligent handling of burning material, court 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, prosecutors dropped one felony count of first-degree  
endangering safety and one of second-degree endangering safety. 
Those charges carried a maximum punishment of seven years in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Demand Cleaner Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency will  
propose, possibly within days, regulations to dramatically reduce 
pollution from automobiles including popular sport utility 
vehicles, according to sources familiar with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft proposal, which is still subject to review by the  
White House, also would require cleaner burning gasoline, 
containing significantly less sulfur, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tougher pollution controls for motor vehicles would be  
phased in beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, most popular sport utility vehicles,  
minivans and pickup trucks would have to meet the same emission 
standards as automobiles, according to the EPA draft proposal. 
Currently some SUVs release more than three times as much 
smog-causing chemicals as cars. 
</P>
<P>
	While some details remained to be worked out, the agency is  
proposing pollution levels for cars and small trucks similar to 
those that already have been announced in California beginning in 
2004, said sources who have been briefed on the general outline of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined Wednesday to comment on the draft  
proposal, which is expected to be formally announced early in March 
after White House review. The final rules are to be completed by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say adoption of the California emission  
standards would result in a 90 percent reduction in releases of 
smog-causing chemicals from passenger cars and trucks, including 
SUVs and minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will dictate how clean cars will be in the first  
decades of the 21st century,'' said Michelle Robinson of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	William Becker, executive director of the association  
representing state air pollution control officials, called the new 
emission standards, if adopted, equivalent to taking 54 million 
cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with the requirement for cleaner burning gasoline, the  
tighter emission requirements will go a long way toward helping 
states and local communities meet future federal air quality 
mandates, said Becker. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobiles account for more than one-fifth of all nitrogen  
oxide emissions and a quarter of the hydrocarbon compounds that are 
responsible for urban smog. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the draft proposal, oil refiners will have to cut sulfur  
levels in gasoline sold nationwide to an average of 30 parts per 
million, phased in beginning in 2004. Currently sulfur levels are 
more than 10 times that amount in most parts of the country outside 
of California which already requires low-sulfur fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA, according to industry sources, rejected an oil industry  
proposal to require low-sulfur gasoline only in areas with serious 
air pollution problems. Automakers had pushed for the nationwide 
low-sulfur gasoline requirement, arguing that high sulfur 
concentrations prevent vehicle emission controls from working 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto industry had lobbied heavily in recent weeks for less  
stringent emission controls on sport utility vehicles, especially 
the large SUVs such as the Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks -- all of which  
currently have to meet less stringent emission requirements because 
they are classified as trucks -- now account for nearly half of all 
vehicles sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the growing popularity of the SUV market, EPA  
officials argued that SUVs have to meet essentially the same 
emissions requirements as cars if air quality goals are to be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, according to one source, has left open the  
possibility that automakers may be given more time to cut emissions 
from the largest SUVs as long as overall fleet emission averages 
comply with the new California-like standard.

<HEADLINE> Battle Ends for Ex-Black Panther </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The three-decade legal battle of Elmer  
``Geronimo'' Pratt ended Wednesday with the district attorney's 
decision to drop further prosecution of the former Black Panther 
who spent 27 years in prison for a murder he said he didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The murder at issue in this case occurred over 30 years ago,''  
said Gil Garcetti, Los Angeles County's top prosecutor. ``Most of 
the witnesses are deceased. It would be virtually impossible to 
retry this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, reached at his home in Morgan City, La., said he was  
relived that the district attorney's office had ``finally come to 
their senses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I am not relieved in that they did not come clean all the  
way in exposing their complicity with this frame-up, this 27-year 
trauma,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco attorney Stuart Hanlon, who spent 25 years seeking  
Pratt's freedom, said after Garcetti's announcement, ``I'm glad 
it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could say I felt uplifted,'' Hanlon said. ``But all I  
feel is frustration and anger that it took this long. It's clear to 
everyone that Pratt was wrongly convicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt was freed in 1997 when a judge ruled that he was denied a  
fair trial because the star prosecution witness concealed the fact 
that he was a police informant. On Tuesday, a California appeals 
court upheld the ruling, granting a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt had been convicted of being one of two men who robbed and  
fatally shot Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed that he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings at  
the time and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly destroyed 
wiretap evidence that would prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt blamed the arrest on a campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI  
against the Black Panthers and other alleged subversives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanlon said he has filed a false conviction lawsuit in federal  
court on Pratt's behalf, seeking damages from the district 
attorney's office, the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he will not seek further prosecution, Garcetti said he  
stands behind the prosecutors who tried the case and won a 
conviction in 1972.

<HEADLINE> NBC Holds Lead in February Sweeps / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC maintained a lead during television's  
February ``sweeps'' period with a strong showing of its Thursday 
night lineup, while Stephen King faced a stormy reception on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of NBC's Thursday shows bettered their season averages,  
led by ``ER.'' The medical drama was the week's most popular show 
as viewers flocked to George Clooney's penultimate appearance as a 
series regular. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 16 share, Nielsen Media  
Research said on Wednesday. CBS was second with a 9.4 rating and 15 
share, followed by ABC's 7.9 rating and 13 share and Fox's 6.7 and 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of NBC's miniseries, ``The '60s,'' finished in  
eighth place for the week. It gave the network solid ratings for a 
night when its traditional sitcoms have not been faring well. 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of ABC's Stephen King miniseries, ``Storm of the  
Century,'' finished in 10th place for the week. That's not as 
strong as past King-based series and was second in its time slot to 
CBS's movie, ``Deep in My Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also received criticism for running ``Storm of the Century''  
advertisements in a crawl beneath other prime-time programs, 
confusing some viewers who thought they were seeing a special news 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	While NBC's new ``Providence'' continues to shine, the news  
isn't so good for two CBS midseason replacements. ``Turks'' and 
``Magnificent Seven'' were both deep in the ratings pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling WB network has an unusually strong 3.7 rating and  
6 share for the week. Its family comedy, ``7th Heaven,'' finished 
with a bigger audience than any other series ever on the network. 
UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share, while Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' took back control of the evening news  
race after two weeks of domination by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' 
NBC had an 8.7 rating and 17 share in the week President Clinton's 
impeachent trial ended, and ABC had an 8.2 and 16. The ``CBS 
Evening News'' was at 7.7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.8; ``Frasier,'' NBC,  
17.4; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 14.9; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.9 ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.4; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 14.4; ``NBC 
Movie of the Week: The '60s, Part Two,'' NBC, 13.4; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: Deep in My Heart,'' CBS, 13.1; ``Storm of the Century,'' 
ABC, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Continue To Wait for Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers have waited for  
Dennis Rodman. And waited, and waited, and waited. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps their patience is wearing a bit thin.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks into it, the same questions are there, it's hard to  
find the answers,'' Rick Fox said after scoring 20 points to help 
the Lakers overpower the Charlotte Hornets 116-88 Tuesday night. 
``If he's coming, the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we put all that stuff aside, the trade talk, the  
Rodman talk. This has been a night we've been waiting for, and we 
went out and made it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Lakers coach Del Harris said he placed a  
moratorium on Rodman discussions with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling my players that I would prefer they don't give any  
more answers to trade rumors or acquisition rumors,'' Harris said. 
``I think we've done enough. I don't think it's healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed an interest in Rodman more than two  
weeks ago. The eccentric seven-time NBA rebounding champion 
reportedly decided last week he wanted to play for them, and a 
source close to the team told The Associated Press late Sunday he 
was expected to be signed by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen, which really shouldn't be considered a major  
surprise since Rodman has proven to be anything but predictable in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	While responding to questions about a civil case involving  
Rodman on Tuesday, attorney Richard Howell was asked if he was 
Rodman's civil lawyer or his sole lawyer, and whether his client 
would join the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm his lawyer lawyer, I know everything,'' Howell replied.  
``And I'm not saying a thing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for representatives of International Creative  
Management, Rodman's new agents, weren't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever he decides to come, if he decides to come, is fine,''  
said Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, who had 20 points and 12 
rebounds against the Hornets despite sitting out the final 17 
minutes. ``If he decides not to come, it's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been that type of a guy, to keep people guessing,  
the last five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was in Las Vegas on Monday, registered under his own name  
at a prominent hotel, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if that annoyed him, that Rodman was in Las Vegas  
rather than with the Lakers, O'Neal replied, ``The only thing that 
annoys me now is we're 3-3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal made that comment before the Lakers snapped a two-game  
losing streak with by far their most convincing win of the young 
season. The Hornets (1-5), meanwhile, lost their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for Rodman, the Lakers learned that Robert Horry,  
hospitalized Sunday due to an irregular heartbeat, will remain on 
the sidelines for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28 was told to sit out the game against the Hornets and  
tonight's contest against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be re-evaluated Thursday,'' he said. ``They say I  
have nothing to worry about. The muscles are fine, the blood flow 
is fine, I've just got an extra beat in my heart, probably caused 
by a virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, (doctors) just want me to take it easy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Horry could return as early as Friday night, when the Lakers  
entertain the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Jones had 19 points, six rebounds and five assists, and  
Kobe Bryant added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, who 
never trailed the outmanned Hornets, playing without injured stars 
Glen Rice and Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Psychologically, we needed a good performance, and we got  
it,'' backup Lakers point guard Derek Harper said. ``We finally put 
together enough consistency to put a team away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Phills scored 20 points and J.R. Reid had 13 points and  
eight rebounds for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets hung tough for 20 minutes, trailing by just three  
points before the Lakers outscored them 14-5 in the final 4:01 of 
the first half to take a 62-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets weren't closer than 10 points in the second half. It  
was 70-60 midway through the third quarter when O'Neal scored four 
straight points to trigger a 12-0 run that blew open the game. It 
was 89-67 entering the final period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a game for a while, but then we let it get  
away from us,'' Hornets coach Dave Cowens said. ``I thought we did 
all right in the first half, but the second half was not our half. 
We made too many mental mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the first of six in eight days for the Lakers, and  
the first of three in four days for the Hornets, who then get five 
days off.

<HEADLINE> Holy Cross Hoops Coach Won't Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- The contract of Holy Cross basketball  
coach Bill Raynor will not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Raynor's contract expires at the end of this season, his fifth  
with the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not an easy decision,'' said Holy Cross Athletic  
Director Richard Regan Jr. But he said the school has made a 
commitment to improve the basketball program and ``take whatever 
steps we feel necessary to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holy Cross posted winning records during Raynor's first two  
seasons. But the Crusaders won only eight games two seasons ago, 
seven last season, and are 6-19 headed into the final week of the 
current season. 
</P>
<P>
	Raynor, who spent 11 years at Holy Cross as coach and assistant  
coach, will guide the team through its final regular season game at 
Lehigh Saturday and through postseason play.

<HEADLINE> Director of `Rushmore' Seeks Blend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Multiplex fare typically lends itself to  
concise, facile plot synopses: ``Undercover cop thwarts 
hijacking.'' ``Mother gets terminal illness.'' ``Heiress and cabbie 
fall in love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's all straight from the Hollywood wham-bam plot-and-script  
mill -- and, not coincidentally, the exact opposite of Wes 
Anderson's philosophy of filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The director and co-screenwriter of the odd cinematic jewel  
``Rushmore'' has little use for conventions like story ideas. He 
starts with characters -- unusual, memorable characters -- and then 
he and his partner, Owen Wilson, build lives and events around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most movies, they know how to sell it -- they have to -- before  
they make the movie,'' Anderson says. ``It's important to have a 
good story. Good characters just happen to be the central thing for 
us. I don't know that it's a great way to work. It's just the way 
it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, a cornstalk of a 29-year-old with an angular, almost  
melancholy face, a misbehaving shock of reddish-brown hair and an 
Ichabod Crane manner, is the diametric opposite of the Hollywood 
director cliche. He is soft-spoken and smiles easily, and he seems 
a little awed at the instant critical acclaim bestowed upon his new 
movie and its cast. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Rushmore,'' a curious exercise in movie-watching, things  
fell together just right. Devoid of what is traditionally 
considered plot, ``Rushmore'' moves along at an unsettling but 
engaging pace. Few watershed ``events'' take place; the film is 
more of a slice of life that happens to have a forward trajectory, 
pushed gently ahead by a slate of weird adults and weirder 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The life that is sliced belongs to Max Fischer (18-year-old  
Jason Schwartzman, Talia Shire's son), a gawky teen-ager who, 
despite enduring wide abuse for his geekiness, rules Rushmore, the 
prep school he attends. He is the founder and president of the 
Rushmore Beekeepers; he is a (pathetic) alternate on the wrestling 
team; he writes and produces elaborate plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Max, while maniacally motivated, is quietly tragic. His grades  
are so bad that he's flunking out, and he continually tells people 
about his father, the neurosurgeon, even as he goes to visit his 
real father, the neighborhood barber. By and by, Max falls in love 
with a teacher (Olivia Williams) and befriends a sad rich guy, Mr. 
Blume (Bill Murray). Thus is set up the eventual muted conflict; 
both boy and man fall for the same woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, known for smarmy sarcasm on-screen, hones it here into a  
pleasingly multidimensional character. Blume is a defeated man 
whose emotions -- all of them, from love to hate -- have gone dull 
with the passage of time. It takes Max to awaken him, and it is Max 
who makes Blume realize some things are worth pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rushmore'' veers in and out of absurdism, all the while  
balancing itself between gentle comedy and subtle drama. Think of 
the Farrellys or the Coens with a touch of Mister Rogers thrown in 
to leaven things. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a movie like this, there's no real genre to use,''  
Anderson says. ``With our film, I don't know that you have any 
expectations. It's like, `Who knows where this is going to go?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson sees a little of ``The Graduate'' and ``Harold and  
Maude'' in ``Rushmore,'' and he says he draws heavily on the French 
New Wave, especially Francois Truffaut. One 1976 Truffaut film, 
``Small Change,'' about a group of boys in a small French town, was 
a particular inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be a fable-ish element,'' Anderson says. ``We  
want to do things where people say it's not quite reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's first film, ``Bottle Rocket,'' co-written like  
``Rushmore'' with Wilson, followed two friends who try out a life 
of crime with some unusual results. It, too, won critical acclaim 
for its whimsy, its originality -- and what Anderson calls 
``documentary-style acting,'' the same thing that makes 
``Rushmore'' so understated and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Rushmore'' -- which was filmed at St. John's, the Houston  
prep school Anderson attended as a teen -- also touched upon a 
favorite Anderson theme: unorthodox, eclectic heroism, no small 
notion for a man who wears dark socks under his red New Balance 
Sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows you can be a success and sort of heroic and still be  
a horrible student. I wish I had seen this when I was 15,'' 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth be told, though he gently denies it, Anderson and Max  
shared some traits. Both were heavily involved in activities. Both 
had chapel partners named Dirk. Both wrote and produced elaborate, 
intricate plays (with Max it is tragedies of Shakespearean 
proportions about Serpico and the Vietnam War; with Anderson it was 
the Headless Horseman and ``Star Wars''). And both have that 
outsider-as-insider mien about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we get a lot of stuff from ourselves, but it's not  
really based on either of us,'' Anderson says of himself and 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the hints of dark doings, ``Rushmore'' always comes  
back to kindness. It's easy to see why; Anderson exudes kind and 
gentle. He surely has a darker side, but in the fight for his soul 
-- at least on celluloid -- victory falls squarely on the side of 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an alienating kind of movie. It's a movie about  
friendship. But it's not something that will be very familiar,'' 
Anderson says. ``The tone of the movie is no one's going to die 
here. If I want people to come away with anything, I want them to 
see that it's optimistic. And with us, I want people to say, 'Let's 
see what's going to happen.'''

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Across Florida and Arizona, there were signs of spring  
Wednesday. With 7 1/2 weeks left until opening day, pitchers and 
catchers got ready for the first spring training workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of work to do here,'' Jim Leyland, the  
Colorado Rockies' new manager, said as he toured his new spring 
training home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati was the first team to open camp Tuesday, and six more  
teams started Wednesday, including the NL champion San Diego 
Padres, who saw country star Garth Brooks report to camp at Peoria, 
Ariz. Brooks, a non-roster player, has no shot at making the major 
league team but could be assigned to the minors if he shows 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day supervised workouts are permitted is Thursday -- 45  
days before the Rockies and San Diego Padres start the season April 
4 at Monterrey, Mexico. Right now, that seems a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last five months, there's been a lot of hard work,'' said  
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who spent millions of Rupert 
Murdoch's dollars to retool the team. ``Right now, the light at the 
end of the tunnel is growing larger and larger. We'll soon be 
involved in actual baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibition games begin March 2, when the New York Mets play St.  
John's University at Port St. Lucie, Fla. Until then, teams will be 
working out and playing intrasquad games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., the New York Yankees showed up, still filled  
with memories of their World Series title and record-smashing 125 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is to get back to the World Series and win it  
again,'' said shortstop Derek Jeter, who a day earlier had won a $5 
million salary in arbitration. ``It doesn't make a difference how 
many games we win. We want to be the champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine teams want to catch up with the Yankees, who set an  
AL record for wins by going 114-48 during the regular season, then 
rolled through the playoffs and swept San Diego in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we have the same resolve on a day-to-day basis that  
we had last year and not get caught up in our celebrity of last 
year -- of what we accomplished,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, still smarting from its loss to San Diego in the  
playoffs, is still trying to get Roger Clemens in a trade with 
Toronto. Astros owner Drayton McLane wants the issue resolved this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he and I agree that it would be a distraction to our  
club that we'd like to try to avoid,'' general manager Gerry 
Hunsicker said. ``I will defer that final decision to him but 
clearly, before the full camp opens next week, we'd like to see 
this thing over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla., Cincinnati Reds pitcher Stan Belinda talked  
about a more personal goal: his fight against multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has put everything in perspective,'' said Belinda,  
diagnosed with the disease last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this to happen was devastating,'' the 32-year-old  
right-hander said. ``There's nothing to prepare you for something 
like this. It's your health. It's your life. I knew I'd get another 
chance to get back on the mound after giving up bad hits or losing 
games. With this, I didn't know, and that was hard to accept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Oakland signed free agent first baseman John Jaha to a minor  
league contract. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dave Stieb, a 41-year-old right-hander, who came out of  
retirement last season to rejoin the Toronto Blue Jays, retired

arbitration case and will get $3.55 million, a $500,000 raise.

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Needs Buyer by Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The J. Peterman Co. has until next Tuesday  
to find a buyer. If the upscale retailer doesn't, it must liquidate 
its assets to pay nearly 1,000 creditors, according to an agreement 
signed by a bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The order issued Tuesday allows Heller Financial Inc. in Chicago  
to lend J. Peterman $361,000 to remain in operation for one week. 
Heller also lent the company $1.96 million last month and an 
additional $408,000 earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Heller attorney Ronald Gold told a judge Tuesday that Heller  
cannot keep lending the company money. Heller is J. Peterman's only 
secured creditor and is owed an additional $7 million in debts 
incurred before the high-end retailer filed for Chapter 11 
protection last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In its Chapter 11 petition, J. Peterman listed $35 million in  
assets and $40 million in liabilities. Chapter 11 allows a company 
to remain in operation while reorganizing its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	John Peterman, who founded the catalog and retail company 12  
years ago, refused to comment about the company's chance of finding 
a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just see how it plays out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Charles Haywood, a University of Kentucky finance professor,  
said he doesn't see J. Peterman finding a buyer in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take deep pockets,'' said Haywood.  
</P>
<P>
	Haywood said he could envision a large department store chain  
coming in and purchasing the company known for its quirky catalog 
copy and made popular by the television show ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another likely scenario: The company will liquidate its assets  
and the largest creditors will oversee that process, putting the 
money from sales in an escrow account to be evenly distributed 
among the creditors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Want Wright To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Both sides in the Paula Jones case  
indicated Wednesday they won't seek a new judge to decide whether 
to hold President Clinton in contempt. The judge in the case had 
offered to step aside because of her contact with a House 
impeachment manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, sources close to Clinton's  
lawyers said their consensus was to not ask U.S. District Judge 
Susan Webber Wright to step aside, but to take a chance at a 
hearing to argue against a contempt charge for Clinton's testimony 
about Monica Lewinsky in the Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, an attorney for Mrs. Jones, said Wednesday his  
side will not ask the judge -- who dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit 
last year -- to remove herself. The dismissal was appealed and case 
was later settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett would not say whether he planned  
to ask the judge to step aside. Nor did Bennett say anything 
Tuesday about the contempt issue during a telephone conference 
among the judge and attorneys involved in Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After that conference, Wright issued an order saying she was  
ready to address the contempt issue. Punishments for contempt range 
from a reprimand to a fine or jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said in her order that she did not believe there was any  
reason for her to step aside. But she had said she would if 
attorneys asked her to because she had contact with Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark. Wright also disclosed Tuesday that her law clerk 
provided an affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright first raised the contempt issue in a footnote to a Sept.  
1 ruling in which she said she was releasing Clinton's testimony in 
a Jan. 17 deposition in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	In that footnote, Wright said she ``has concerns about the  
nature'' of the president's deposition but made ``no findings at 
this time regarding whether the president may be in contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Camby Sued by Spurned Sports Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Marcus Camby has admitted taking  
thousands of dollars in improper gifts from sports agents while 
playing for the University of Massachusetts. Now, one of those 
agents is suing the NBA star for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lounsbury of Wolcott claims he gave $40,000 in cash and  
gifts to Camby, members of Camby's family and the player's friends 
between October 1994 and April 1996. In exchange, Lounsbury claims, 
Camby promised to hire him as his agent when the time came to 
negotiate a professional contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe too much emphasis has been placed on the wrongdoing  
of agents and not enough attention has been paid to the 
irresponsibility and greed of these professional athletes,'' 
Lounsbury's lawyer, John Williams, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said it was Camby who demanded cash, rental cars,  
jewelry and more. 
</P>
<P>
	Damages will be determined by a jury if the lawsuit, filed last  
month, goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby's agent, Alex Johnson, said Camby denies he ever agreed to  
be represented by Lounsbury. Camby has admitted taking only about 
$2,000 from Lounsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done everything in terms of owning up to the things he's  
done with John and the things he's done in the past,'' said 
Johnson, of the ProServ agency. ``This is just a rehashing of 
everything all over again. It's frivolous'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1996, UMass alerted the NCAA that Camby might have  
committed violations by accepting cash and expensive jewelry from 
agents, including Lounsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby said he accepted money from Lounsbury in 1995 and two  
necklaces and a diamond pendant from Wesley Spears, a Hartford 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	UMass was stripped of its 1996 NCAA regional championship and  
was forced to return the money it earned by making it to the Final 
Four of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby was the No. 2 pick in the 1996 NBA draft. He was chosen by  
Toronto and traded to New York before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Lounsbury agreed not to act as a sports agent  
for five years. That agreement with the state Department of 
Consumer Protection stemmed from his purchase of airline tickets 
for two University of Connecticut players, Ricky Moore and Kirk 
King.

<HEADLINE> Researchers: Volcanoes Ruled Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mars may not be finished with its volcanic activity and up to 10  
times more lava was spewed onto the surface of the planet in 
ancient times than previously thought, scientists reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of two studies published in the journal Nature,  
researchers reported evidence that more than 3.5 billion years ago, 
Mars' volcanoes filled one canyon alone with enough molten rock to 
bury the United States beneath a fiery lake four miles deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence included more than 100 layers of what the  
researchers believe is volcanic rock jutting from the walls of the 
2,400-mile-long Valles Marineris canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like thick stacks of lava and it goes down as far as  
we can see,'' about six miles, said Alfred McEwen, a research 
scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	He and colleagues studied photographs obtained by the Mars  
Global Surveyor, a spacecraft that has been orbiting Mars since 
1997 and begins a two-year mission next month to map the entire 
planet in fine detail. 
</P>
<P>
	The research supports the growing view that Martian volcanoes  
were more important than meteor collisions in shaping the planet's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcanic activity would also help explain why Mars apparently  
had a thick, warm atmosphere early in its history. Volcanoes belch 
carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes the atmosphere to heat 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same journal, scientists from the Planetary Science  
Institute of Tucson reported that based on images radioed back by 
the surveyor, Mars' volcanoes -- one of which looms 14 miles above 
its dusty, windswept surface -- may not be finished erupting. 
</P>
<P>
	They examined photos of a lava flow in a volcanic crater and  
estimated it formed 40 million to 100 million years ago. The flow 
was marked with relatively few meteor craters, in contrast with 
older flows that were heavily pockmarked. That suggests the flow is 
relatively young. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying that there's going to be an eruption in 1999,  
but there may still be dormant areas on Mars with the potential for 
future eruptions,'' said William Hartmann, a scientist at the 
Planetary Science Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	He said researchers are analyzing photos that suggest even  
younger flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University  
helping plan NASA's 2001 rover mission to Mars, said he wouldn't be 
surprised if Mars were still volcanic. He noted that the Global 
Surveyor will produce a thermal map showing any surface hot spots.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Oppose Stem-Cell Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Funding of human stem cell research by the  
National Institutes of Health would violate a federal law, 70 House 
members told the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna  
Shalala, the lawmakers objected to plans by the National Institutes 
of Health to fund research using stem cells obtained from human 
embryos or fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are basic biological building blocks. Some forms of  
stem cells extracted from embryos or fetuses theoretically have the 
ability to create any organ or any tissue. Scientists say that by 
guiding the growth of these cells it might be possible to culture 
new organs to replace ailing hearts, or neurons for the treatment 
of brain disease or injury, or insulin-producing cells to cure 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	No government-backed research has been conducted on stem cells  
because a 1996 law specifically forbids spending federal dollars 
for medical research that involves creation of a human embryo for 
research purposes, or conducting research in which a human embryo 
has been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, privately funded researchers not covered by the ban  
last year grew colonies of stem cells from tissue taken from human 
fetuses and embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NIH Director Harold Varmus announced that the agency  
had decided these laboratory-grown cells were not covered by the 
federal ban because they are not human embryos capable of creating 
a new person. Varmus based his announcement on a memo from HHS 
general counsel Harriet Rabb. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter, the House members said federal funding of such  
research ``would violate both the letter and the spirit'' of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that Rabb's memo to Varmus ``appears to be a carefully  
worded effort to justify transgressing that law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said Rabb's memo claims the law only prohibits  
research involving the specific act of destroying an embryo, but 
not the cells that were later grown from embryonic tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers said the federal law also forbids funding of  
research ``which follows or depends upon the destruction of or 
injury to a human embryo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This area of the law has provided a bulwark against  
government's misuse and exploitation of human beings in the name of 
medical progress,'' the letter said. ``It would be a travesty for 
the administration to attempt to unravel this accepted ethical 
standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was initiated by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,  
leader of a House caucus that opposes abortion. Among the 70 
signers were Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas; Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas; Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the Republican 
conference chairman; and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the 
House Judiciary committee. Nine Democrats also signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Boeder, an HHS spokeswoman, said Shalala received the  
letter Tuesday, but has not yet responded. Boeder said the NIH has 
not funded any stem-cell research and is only analyzing what 
studies might be sponsored by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``NIH and the department are very aware of the serious legal,  
ethical and moral issues raised by this research,'' said Boeder.

<HEADLINE> Family of Boy Accused in Death Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The family of one of two young boys initially  
charged with killing an 11-year-old girl for her bicycle sued 
Chicago police for $100 million on Wednesday, saying detectives 
framed the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 7 and 8, had been accused of beating Ryan Harris,  
suffocating her with her panties and molesting her. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dropped on Sept. 4 after semen was discovered in  
the girl's underwear. Experts said it was unlikely that boys so 
young could produce semen. 
</P>
<P>
	R. Eugene Pincham, a former appellate court judge representing  
the 8-year-old boy's family, said Wednesday that detectives pinned 
the murder on the children despite evidence indicating that an 
adult committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by the 8-year-old boy's family contends Allen  
Nathaniel and James Cassidy falsely arrested the boy, interrogated 
him without his parents or a lawyer present and intimidated him 
into a confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for Nathaniel and Cassidy at their district  
headquarters were not returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the police department and for the city of Chicago,  
both named as defendants, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Grant, another attorney representing the family, said the  
boy, once a model student, now is failing in school, suffers from 
nightmares and is afraid to leave his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a child who has been severely traumatized,'' Grant  
said. ``It's state-sanctioned child abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No other suspects have been charged in the crime.

<HEADLINE> Guard Killed in Va. Bank Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A man walked into a bank Wednesday, shot a  
security guard to death and told a teller he would do the same to 
her unless she filled a plastic trash bag with cash by the time he 
counted to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started counting backward, 10, nine, eight ...''  
Chesterfield County Police spokesman Don Kappel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man ran out of the NationsBank branch in the suburb of Bon  
Air and disappeared in an area of shops and homes. Dozens of police 
searched the area but found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The robber resembled a man who had held up the same bank one  
month ago, using a female accomplice, Kappel said. The same branch 
was robbed twice in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had just recently hired the uniformed security guard.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker turned pro in Madison Square  
Garden a little more than 14 years ago. On Saturday night, he will 
fight in the famed arena again, ready to show his career is not at 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than delighted to be 35 years old, but I'm going to  
give a 21-year-old performance,'' Whitaker said Wednesday at the 
final news conference leading to his bout with unbeaten IBF 
champion Felix Trinidad. ``I'm looking forward to getting into the 
middle of ring in the Garden and seeing those lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Whitaker performed under the Garden lights was  
Nov. 15, 1984. He stopped Farrain Commeaux in the second round of a 
scheduled six-round lightweight bout on a card that featured 
several members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Whitaker fought in the Garden he won the WBC  
welterweight title by outpointing James ``Buddy'' McGirt on March 
6, 1993. Whitaker also has held the WBC, WBA IBF lightweight, IBF 
junior welterweight and WBA junior middleweight titles. He has been 
a champion every year from 1984 until 1998, when he didn't fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, a 26-year-old Puerto Rican, barely broke a sweat in  
his only Garden appearance. He stopped Troy Waters of Australia in 
the first round Aug. 27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad fought only once since -- knocking out Mahenge Zulu in  
the fourth round last April 3 in Puerto Rico -- because of 
litigation with promoter Don King. Trinidad lost in court and 
signed a $42.9 million multifight contract with King. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad doesn't think the layoff will affect his performance. A  
bigger question concerns Whitaker's 16 months of inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, who lost the WBC 147-pound title on controversial  
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997, last fought when he 
outpointed Andre Pestriaev in a 12-round welterweight bout Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker tested positive for cocaine after that fight. He  
underwent drug and alcohol rehabilitation in 1998 when he tested 
positive in a random drug test and also was convicted of reckless 
driving for which he received a suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He will not discuss his out-of-ring problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is Trinidad's most prominent opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit slower, but he's strong and he has  
experience,'' Trinidad said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker has beaten such fighters as McGirt, Jose Luis Ramirez,  
Roger Mayweather, Azumah Nelson and got a draw with Julio Cesar 
Chavez in fight he seemingly dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not fighting Ramirez or Chavez -- he's fighting Felix  
``Tito'' Trinidad,'' the champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be carried on HBO following a tape of WBC  
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya's split-decision win over 
Ike Quartey last Saturday. The telecast will begin at 9:30 p.m. 
EST.

<HEADLINE> 15 Die Under Oregon Suicide Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- In the first year under the nation's only  
assisted-suicide law, 15 terminally ill people in Oregon used it to 
end their lives, and there was no evidence they suffered painful, 
lingering deaths as opponents had warned. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, Oregon health officials also said that fears that the law 
would be used as an easy way out by people afraid of financial ruin 
or extreme pain proved unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, health officials found that use of the law has so far  
been driven overwhelmingly by the desire of strong-willed patients 
to exercise some control over the way they died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many physicians reported that their patients had been decisive  
and independent throughout their lives or that the decision to 
request a lethal prescription was consistent with a longstanding 
belief about the importance of controlling the manner in which they 
died,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first report on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act showed that  
doctors prescribed lethal drugs to 23 people in 1998 but that six 
died from their illnesses before using the drugs. Two others still 
were alive as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the 15 who took the lethal drugs were cancer  
patients. The others were suffering from heart or lung diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of those who took their lives was 69.  
</P>
<P>
	Backers of assisted suicide said the report shows the law is  
working well and confirms their predictions that only a small 
number of people would make use of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what we expected -- a year of impeccable implementation,''  
said Barbara Coombs Lee, chief sponsor of the ballot measure that 
established the law. 
</P>
<P>
	First approved in 1994 and reaffirmed by Oregon voters in  
November 1997, the law allows a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose 
of medication to hasten the death of patients who have less than 
six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic Church and others spent millions of dollars  
to try to derail the law. They relied chiefly on the argument that 
some people would die excruciating, torturous deaths after taking 
the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Oregon's Health Division found no evidence of botched  
suicides, and no complications such as vomiting or seizures from 
the lethal doses of barbiturates. Nearly all of those who took the 
drugs were unconscious within five minutes, and most were dead 
within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Four patients died about three hours after taking the drugs and  
one died 11 hours afterward, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the apparent lack of technical problems, the leader of  
the Portland Archdiocese denounced assisted suicide as an immoral 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time a physician writes a prescription for lethal  
medication, we are confronted again with our failure to offer 
compassionate care,'' Archbishop John Vlazny said. ``In allowing 
assisted suicide to continue, the state of Oregon dismisses the 
value of human life. This thought fills me with sadness and 
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Rasmussen, a Salem oncologist who has assisted in two  
suicides, said his patients slipped peacefully into a coma almost 
immediately after eating chocolate pudding laced with barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very positive to have the relatives gather around and  
say their final goodbyes, and to reminisce about their family 
stories,'' Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not surprised by the relatively low number of  
suicides. ``In my experience with cancer patients, they want every 
day they can get,'' he said. They want to live, they don't want to 
die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the case with Barbara Oskamp, a West Linn woman who  
suffers from a terminal brain tumor. She said she doesn't know if 
she will use assisted suicide, but might if it appears she no 
longer is able to take care of herself or becomes a burden to her 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me feelings of fantastic relief to know that I will  
have a choice about how my final days will go,'' she said. ``It 
lowers my fear levels a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Man Averts Fourth Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASTROP, Texas (AP) -- A plea bargain that ended one of the  
state's longest-running capital murder trials left both sides 
feeling like winners -- and losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry Max Cook, who had been tried three times in the June 1977  
slaying of a woman, pleaded no contest Tuesday minutes before the 
start of his fourth trial. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison 
with credit for time served, which means he won't go back to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith County prosecutors got the verdict they had sought since  
Linda Jo Edwards was found slain and sexually mutilated in her 
apartment in Tyler nearly 22 years ago. But they didn't get the 
death sentence they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone connected with this case knows that he's a predator who  
deserves the death penalty for this horrible crime,'' said David 
Dobbs, an assistant district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, 42, became a free man without saying he committed a crime  
he still insists he didn't commit. Still, the plea means he has 
likely lost his dream of becoming an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be free, but at the same time I'm sad because  
it's not what I wanted -- total vindication,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can say what he will,'' said Carolyn Loftin, the victim's  
older sister. ``The judge convicted him of murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Cook beat the 21-year-old Ms. Edwards in the  
head with a plaster statue, stabbed her repeatedly and mutilated 
her. Investigators found his fingerprints on her sliding glass 
door. He lived in the same apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook was on death row twice for the killing, but each conviction  
was overturned on appeal. A third trial ended in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began looking for a deal when they realized the case  
would be dogged by misconduct charges dating to 1978, Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt there was a high likelihood of a hung jury and or an  
acquittal in this case because of the state of the evidence,'' 
Dobbs said. ``We would not have been able to try him again.''

<HEADLINE> New Battle Over Who Can Wage War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the United States sent a peacekeeping  
force to Bosnia, the House and Senate grudgingly agreed in a 
resolution pointedly calling it President Clinton's commitment, not 
theirs. That line may be drawn again should Clinton send troops to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of the unending strain between the White House and  
Congress over war-making, or war-risking, powers. This one isn't 
partisan, it is institutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo mission is on hold at the moment, contingent on a  
peace deal that would be backed by a NATO force Serbs are 
resisting. There is a Saturday noon deadline for them to accept or 
face NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the debate about the U.S. role didn't wait. Nor did Clinton,  
who said in a radio address on Saturday that he is prepared to send 
nearly 4,000 American troops to join about 24,000 from other NATO 
nations to enforce peace between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, a final decision on troops, which I will make in close  
consultation with Congress, will depend upon the parties reaching a 
strong peace agreement,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But any consultations will be on a commitment that already has  
been made. Clinton said he believes that with an agreement, there 
should be an American role. And while promising to work with 
Congress on it, the administration isn't seeking authority to send 
forces. Like his White House predecessors, Clinton maintains that 
power is inherent in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush narrowly won congressional approval for the Persian  
Gulf War against Iraq just before it began, and said he welcomed 
the expression of support although he didn't need it to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration, like previous administrations, takes the  
view that the president has broad authority as commander in chief, 
and under his authority to conduct foreign relations, to authorize 
the use of force in the national interest,'' Undersecretary of 
State Thomas Pickering told the House International Relations 
Committee a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited as precedents the operations ordered by Republican  
presidents without action by Congress. ``Previous constitutional 
violations do not justify subsequent ones,'' replied Republican 
Rep. Tom Campbell of California. 
</P>
<P>
	While that has been argued since the end of World War II, the  
decisions have been made by presidents, sometimes with use of force 
resolutions approved by Congress, more often, without. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress tried to change the balance 25 years ago with the War  
Powers Act, seeking to require congressional approval to keep U.S. 
forces in danger spots abroad. That hasn't worked; presidents can 
simply certify that the operations they order don't trigger its 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton advised congressional leaders, but did not seek consent,  
in ordering U.S. air strikes against Iraq on Dec. 17, the day the 
House was to have started debating his impeachment, which was voted 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was there prior approval of an earlier peacekeeping mission  
to the Balkans, in late 1995. That was to enforce the U.S.-brokered 
peace settlement of ethnic wars in Bosnia, and at one point 
involved 22,500 Americans. There are still about 6,700 U.S. troops 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after Clinton approved the operation, Congress adopted  
a resolution agreeing to it, ``notwithstanding reservations'' about 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, which wasn't binding, said ``the president may  
only fulfill his commitment'' for about a year, the duration he'd 
set but could not keep. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really learned a lesson in Bosnia that setting an  
artificial deadline doesn't work,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said. There would be no deadline on a peacekeeping mission 
to Kosovo, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who argue that Clinton's foreign policy credibility  
was shaken by the impeachment charges despite his Senate acquittal 
say the long-missed Bosnia deadline adds to their mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that wasn't quite as honest as it needed to be,'' said  
Sen. Don Nickles, the Republican whip. ``And so that is affecting 
right now his request for troops into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it isn't a request. The next step is contingent on a peace  
deal for Kosovo, not permission from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to working with Congress in making this final  
decision,'' Clinton said. But he would make it, and he's already 
said what it would be. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-JAMA Editor Blasts AMA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The recently fired editor of the Journal of the  
American Medical Association said he battled almost daily with AMA 
leaders, members and lobbyists to retain editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in today's Chicago Tribune, Dr. George  
Lundberg said he and his editorial staff endured constant pressure, 
including threats and intimidation, during his 17 years running the 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a day went by in considering what to publish  
that I and my editorial staff didn't have to worry about offending 
AMA members, AMA politicians and the AMA Washington office by what 
we published,'' Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure came in the form of telephone calls from irate AMA  
members and letters from state medical societies and AMA officers 
``threatening political action against the editor and the journal 
for publishing what offended them ideologically, or more likely 
imposed on (physicians') ability to earn money,'' Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not discuss specific incidents.  
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. fired  
Lundberg on Jan. 15 after JAMA published a survey of college 
students' sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. Anderson said the article inappropriately 
interjected the organization into a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA and Lundberg later reached an agreement that will let  
him contribute articles to the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said the AMA declined to address Lundberg's  
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg said AMA public relations staffers would make efforts  
to obtain copies of JAMA articles prior to publication so they 
could ``spin them for the AMA's corporate interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he resisted the intimidation and received strong support  
from the JAMA editorial board when he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The editor's job is to edit the journal for patients,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, 65, commutes weekly to Harvard University, where he is  
an adjunct professor of health policy, and is now a lecturer at 
Northwestern University's medical and journalism schools.

<HEADLINE> Changes Set Off Struggle at College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At many colleges, plans for a new athletic  
center, better dormitories and fewer required classes would be 
greeted with cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the University of Chicago, alma mater of Nobel laureates,  
Rhodes scholars and generations of serious intellectuals, the plans 
cut to the heart and mission of one of the world's elite schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing less than the struggle for the soul of the  
University of Chicago,'' said Robert Stone, a member of an alumni 
group opposing the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has always seen itself as unique among American  
schools, a place where students spend nearly two years completing a 
required ``core'' curriculum in humanities and civilization, 
natural and social sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	A faculty vote last year to reduce the number of core classes  
from 21 to 18 helped launch the debate. Now, new dormitories, more 
opportunities for study abroad and a $35 million athletic center 
are planned in an attempt to attract students whom university 
officials fear might opt for Stanford, Northwestern or the Ivy 
League. And the undergraduate college is expanding over the next 10 
years, from about 3,800 to 4,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, who tend to lump the changes into one big, intricate  
plot, call them an attempt to create a ``U. of C. Lite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us feel that not only is this set of proposals a  
betrayal of why we're here and why we came here, it seems like a 
recipe for real financial disaster,'' said Andrew Abbott, a 
sociology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hyde Park is not Palo Alto, it's not Cambridge, it's not  
Princeton. We can't compete in that market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Sonnenschein insists he has no desire to lower  
standards. He believes that the university must grow to stay great, 
and needs income from additional students and alumni to afford 
outstanding faculty and offer financial aid to top students. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is to keep it consistent with our values -- and this  
is a place that knows its values better than any institution in the 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More Nobel laureates -- 70 -- have taught, researched or studied  
at Chicago than anywhere else in the world. The school has produced 
34 Rhodes scholars. Eleven percent of the Class of 2002 scored 
between 1,500 and a perfect 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 
the SAT used by hundreds of colleges in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendra Job, a senior from Beaver Falls, Pa., said such an  
intellectual tradition would be compromised by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a completely different world here,'' she said. ``I'm  
surrounded by geniuses here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some students welcomed the proposals.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the recognition that they need to provide services for  
students and outlets for students is a very good one,'' said Mira 
Lutgendorf, a senior from Iowa City, Iowa. ``I'm just sad the pool 
is coming after I leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics portray Sonnenschein, who came to the university five  
years ago from Princeton, as valuing marketing above scholarship. 
Some question his ability to lead the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very talented man,'' said Abbott. ``He would be a very  
good president of another university. But here, he's like a 
tone-deaf man conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Faces Sexual Assault Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman may end up spending more time  
in civil court than on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed against  
the flamboyant Rodman by cocktail waitress Susan Patterson. She 
claims Rodman jammed a $100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her 
breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Susan Isacoff agreed with Ms. Patterson's  
attorney, Gloria Allred, that the allegations represented 
``outrageous conduct'' and allowed the suit to proceed. But the 
judge deleted any mention of previous sexual assault lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view the result of today's court proceedings as a  
significant victory,'' said Rich Howell, Rodman's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers are in negotiations with the former  
Chicago Bulls star, who is currently without a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may end up spending a significant amount of time in a Los  
Angeles court,'' Ms. Allred said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Eating Out Is on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are eating more healthful meals at  
home but their nutritional gains are in jeopardy as more of them 
eat out, consuming food with more fat and less fiber, iron and 
calcium, a government study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Health-conscious Americans do a good job of making sure their  
meals are high in fiber, iron and other nutrients when they cook at 
home, the report released Tuesday by the Agriculture Department 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proportion of meals eaten away from home nearly doubled  
from 16 percent in 1977-78 to 29 percent in 1995 -- an upward trend 
that will probably continue, the government said. And meals eaten 
away from home haven't kept pace with the nutritional improvements 
in home-cooked foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, food made outside of the home contains more things that  
Americans tend to eat too much of, such as fat and saturated fat. 
And foods eaten away from home contain less of the nutrients that 
Americans don't get enough of, such as calcium, fiber and iron. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep your radar on,'' said Dr. Johanna Dwyer,  
director of the Francis Stern Medical Center in Boston. ``It takes 
a little planning.'' Even little changes can help, Dwyer said, like 
asking for salad dressing on the side or requesting low-fat sauces. 
</P>
<P>
	In analyzing food eaten by consumers in the survey, USDA found  
that fat made up 31.5 percent of the calories in foods at home. But 
it made up 37.6 percent of the calories in away-from-home foods, 
the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiber content of food prepared outside the home was 25  
percent less and the calcium content 20 percent below nutritional 
benchmarks. School foods were even richer in calcium than home 
foods. For iron intake, food prepared away from home was 29 percent 
below the nutritional benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was based on food consumption surveys taken from 1977  
to 1995. Away-from-home food is defined as coming anywhere from 
fast-food places to restaurants, cafeterias and vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should be aware of this nutritional gap,'' said  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ``It reinforces the need for 
nutrition information and education in schools and at home, so that 
everyone can make more healthful food choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans may simply have different attitudes when eating out,  
leading to the nutrition gap, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers may believe that it is less important to consider  
the nutritional quality of food away from home or be less willing 
to sacrifice taste when eating out,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fast-food chains and restaurants have introduced  
reduced-fat foods, only to withdraw them from their menus because 
of consumer disinterest, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
	With the increasing numbers of households in which both adults  
work, and the number of affordable fast-food restaurants, there's 
no sign Americans will revert back to the kitchen table for meals 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to eat out more and more in the future,'' said  
Biing-Hwan Lin, a USDA economist who helped write the report. 
``This eating out may present a challenge to us in improving our 
diet.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Release Cornelius Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cornelius Bennett, a five-time Pro Bowler who led  
the Atlanta Falcons in tackles during their Super Bowl season, was 
released by the team on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning move was announced late in the afternoon in a  
three-paragraph statement, which included no explanation from 
Falcons coach Dan Reeves or general manager Harold Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the release of Bennett apparently stems from his age -- he  
will be 34 by the start of next season -- and a salary cap figure 
that would have been $3.7 million for the final year of the $13.6 
million, four-year contract he signed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons cleared a spot in the lineup for Keith Brooking, the  
team's first-round draft pick a year ago. After a slow start, 
Brooking was playing regularly in passing situations by the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at his home, Richardson declined to comment on the  
release of Bennett, deferring to Reeves. But the head coach was on 
vacation and not available for comment, according to Falcons 
spokesman Charlie Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson did say the decision had nothing to do with  
off-the-field problems. Before last season, Bennett spent 35 days 
in a New York jail for a guilty plea to sexual misconduct charges, 
but he returned to have his best season with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't anything extraordinary,'' Richardson said.  
``There's no hidden agenda. There's nothing that someone ought to 
know, none of that. I'm being honest with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's agent, Eugene Parker of Fort Wayne, Ind., did not  
immediately return a telephone message left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Supposedly one of the NFL's most upstanding players, Bennett's  
reputation took a severe blow after a May 1997 sexual encounter in 
a Buffalo hotel room. The female victim was treated for trauma and 
skin cuts, and Bennett, who is married, pleaded guilty to sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker entered counseling and became a born-again  
Christian. According to his teammates and coaches, he returned to 
the Falcons with a new outlook on life and became one of the 
leading figures in the improbable run to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett led the team with 120 tackles, ending Jessie Tuggle's  
nine-year streak in that category, and was a major part of the 
Falcons' pass coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a Pro Bowler during five of his nine seasons with the  
Buffalo Bills, establishing himself as one of the game's most 
dominating defensive players. His best year was 1991, when he 
played five positions and had 107 tackles and nine sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett played in four straight Super Bowls with the Bills,  
losing each time. He became a five-time loser 2 1/2 weeks ago when 
Denver defeated the Falcons 34-19 in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves Wednesday, free-agent safety Devin Bush signed a  
four-year contract with the St. Louis Rams and offensive lineman 
Dave Widell was released along with Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 25, was a first-round selection by the Falcons out of  
Florida State in 1995. He started 36 games for the Falcons but was 
relegated to a backup role in 1998 after the team signed Eugene 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush appeared in 13 games for the NFC champions. He had 24  
tackles, forced two fumbles and recovered one. 
</P>
<P>
	Widell, 33, played only one game during his lone season with the  
Falcons. The 11-year veteran, who also has played with 
Jacksonville, Denver and Detroit, was inactive for the final 14 
games of the regular season and the entire postseason.

<HEADLINE> Yes, This Economy IS Different / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No question about it, there's a combination of  
features in this economic expansion never seen before. But does it 
add up to a new era, as advocates want you to believe? 
</P>
<P>
	Simply asking the question might ignite a dispute that can raise  
bulges in the temple arteries of investors more inclined to discuss 
issues calmly and coldly. Blame it on that ``new era'' term. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment old-timers, especially those who have remained  
solvent over several decades, say they hear the ``new era'' talk 
every time the economy and markets are healthy and rising. 
</P>
<P>
	By these accounts, most of the talk is generated by naive  
newcomers who have made a few hundred dollars and believe they've 
discovered the previously unmapped route to eternal gains. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, the new-era theorists claim that the impact of  
high technology is giving the economy a boost like it has never 
seen before, reflected in rising productivity and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But, say the old-timers, only the specifics have changed, and  
those who believe in a new era can always find specific details to 
bolster their claims. Like so many before them, they say, the 
new-era types haven't enough experience to know when the ice is 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, the new-era theorists really do have some  
unusual factors going for them. 
</P>
<P>
	While explaining that all expansion are unique, says David Wyss,  
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI economist, there are several key differences 
in this expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin with, there is the sheer length of this expansion, now  
in its eighth year. There was a longer expansion in the 1960s, but 
that one was artificially extended by the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shocks, says Wyss, is the lack of inflation, which  
always rose after three years into other expansions. This time it 
has actually slowed as the expansion aged and strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there's the low factory use rate. In spite of the good  
times, the economy's production is way below its capacity. It means 
we can rev up further without inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another there is the singularity of this expansion, with the  
United States economy almost alone in its growth. In past U.S. 
expansions we always had plenty of company. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more unusual characteristics if you want to go on  
listing them. The amazing level of unemployment is one: It's below 
4.5 percent and, contrary to theory, hasn't caused prices to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	All these factors play into the thinking of the new-era  
theorists and provides them courage in their quest for ever larger 
stock market profits. What more in the way of evidence do you want, 
they ask? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, for one thing say the old-timers, we think it would be  
wise for you to have a better sense of history. The market has 
always gone nutty from time to time, they say, and it's doing it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	They point out that there are explanations for the thriving U.S.  
economy, and that not all of them have to do with high-tech 
gadgetry that's supposed to be make the past seem like Paleozoic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	That matter of low inflation, for example. While wage gains have  
been solid, benefits have been constrained. Commodities are down 
because of bad times abroad. And imports are at bankruptcy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Okay, so this expansion, and the securities markets that depend  
on it, are unique, but are the differences so great that we should 
deem the economy fundamentally changed, as in a new era? 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss offers his opinion: ``The current expansion, while  
outstanding, is not fundamentally different from past patterns.'' 
The low inflation, he says is coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	While he doesn't foresee a dramatic ending to the expansion, and  
in facts believes growth will continue for the near future, that 
old bugaboo inflation will begin to edge higher. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if the past is still a criterion, inflation slowly works  
its ugly way through the entire economy, bring about reactions that 
are likely to remind us that we are still on the same old planet.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Mobster Agrees To Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- For more than a year, federal prosecutors  
claimed Lenine ``Lenny'' Strollo was the leader of the mob in 
Youngstown, plotting the death of a rival, running a numbers game 
and bribing officials. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Strollo, 68, admitted the charges were true.  
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea agreement, Strollo pleaded guilty to  
racketeering and tax evasion charges that included plotting the 
murder of mafia figure Ernie Biondillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo also agreed to testify against three associates and  
provide additional information to prosecutors. If his testimony 
satisfies federal officials, Strollo could serve as little as 12 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave us an offer we couldn't refuse,'' said Strollo's  
lawyer, Herbert Greenman. 
</P>
<P>
	No sentencing date was set.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Kathleen O'Malley reserved the right to  
sentence Strollo to a possible term of life in prison. ``I make you 
no promises,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plea negotiations were expected to continue today for the three  
other defendants: Bernard Altshuler, 68; Lavance Turnage, 26; and 
Jeffrey Riddle, 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo also agreed Tuesday to a plea deal on separate charges  
filed in state court that cover much of the same ground as the 
federal charges. Strollo's attorney and prosecutors declined to 
comment on details of that deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Youngstown for decades has fought a reputation as a haven for  
organized crime and once was nicknamed ``Crime Town U.S.A.'' Mafia 
families from Cleveland and Pittsburgh have engaged in a long fight 
for control of the area, which is between those two cities.

<HEADLINE> Biletnikoff's Daughter Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- A 23-year-old man was being held  
today on suspicion of murdering the daughter of NFL Hall of Famer 
Fred Biletnikoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Haroon Ali, 23, was arrested in San Diego on Tuesday as  
he tried to drive across the border into Mexico, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of his girlfriend, 20-year-old Tracey Biletnikoff,  
turned up on a hillside at quiet Canada College in San Mateo 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff had disappeared early Tuesday after a friend  
called San Mateo police to report that she and Ali were involved in 
a domestic disturbance. Police were unable to find the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance workers found her partially clothed body hours later  
near an empty parking lot while picking up garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a homicide,'' San Mateo County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Cody  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali was convicted in 1994 for kidnapping a former girlfriend  
after she broke up with him, Deputy District Attorney Steve 
Wagstaffe said today. A judge placed him on probation and ordered 
him to undergo drug and alcohol treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped Ali in Ms. Biletnikoff's car  
Tuesday night, Cody said. Deputies flew down to Southern California 
to bring him back to San Mateo County, a process that could take up 
to five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody would not give details of the killing or say whether Ms.  
Biletnikoff had been sexually assaulted. Authorities said only that 
she appeared to have been beaten. An autopsy was being performed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether she was a student at the community college,  
Cody said there was a connection but would not elaborate. She had 
been working as a drug counselor in San Mateo and had been dating 
Ali for some months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff's brother said she had been living with their  
father in the east San Francisco Bay area and was a student at the 
College of San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
	Biletnikoff and his former wife, who lives in Southern  
California, were notified of their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty devastated, as you would expect,'' Cody said.  
</P>
<P>
	Biletnikoff, 55, who has four other children, is in his ninth  
year as wide receivers coach with the Oakland Raiders. He played 
for the Raiders from 1965-78 and was named MVP of Super Bowl XI. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the team's all-time leading receiver with 589 catches  
until Tim Brown broke that record two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sympathy and prayers are with the Biletnikoff family,''  
Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said in a prepared statement.

	``Believe'' (Warner Bros.) -- Cher  
</P>
<P>
	``The Dance Album'' (Interhit) -- Engelbert Humperdinck  
</P>
<P>
	``Plagiarism'' (Oglio) -- Sparks  

</P>
<P>
	Slickly produced, Cher, Sparks and Engelbert Humperdinck's  
latest albums meld pop and dance music for some hot boogie nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher's ``Believe'' album manages to show some heart and soul  
through her distinctive vocals despite a sweatless sound mix and 
robotic composition. ``The Power,'' ``Dov'e L'amore'' and ``We All 
Sleep Alone'' are bright spots in a rather loveless affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparks, a venerable American band that made its biggest  
impression overseas during the mid-1970s, rightfully pays tribute 
to itself with ``Plagiarism,'' a brilliant album by Sparks brothers 
Ron and Russell Mael reworking their finest minutes of sincere 
camp, subtle comedy and high emotion. Special guests include Faith 
No More, Erasure and Jimmy Somerville. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced by Tony Visconti, ``Plagiarism'' shows its continental  
flair with Sparks classics like ``The No. 1 Song in Heaven,'' 
``Beat the Clock'' and ``Angst in My Pants.'' You can find 
melodrama in ``When Do I Get to Sing `My Way'?'' and ``This Town 
Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their back catalog reissued as well, ``Plagiarism'' shows  
Sparks for the versatile pop geniuses they've always been. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelbert Humperdinck dashes back from the casino lounge to get  
down with ``The Dance Album.'' The Hump revamps smooth favorites 
like ``Quando Quando Quando,'' ``A Man Without Love,'' ``Spanish 
Eyes'' and ``Last Waltz.'' ``The Dance Album'' succeeds in a 
playful way, but it's time to move on to newer material so 
Humperdinck's grand voice could really shine.

	``Tomorrow Hit Today'' (Reprise) -- Mudhoney  

</P>
<P>
	Before it became a genre tag, grunge (also known as the G-word)  
was used to describe Mudhoney's seminal late 1980s records, which 
were a volatile hybrid of '60s and '70s garage rock, with a touch 
of blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow Hit Today'' drips with some of Mudhoney's most  
touching songs yet. Tunes like ``Oblivion,'' ``Poisoned Water,'' 
``Move With the Wind'' and ``A Thousand Forms of Mind'' run the 
emotional gamut from savage indignation to sober reckoning with 
Mudhoney's tragic-comedy element intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The album has veteran producer Jim Dickinson, who helps flesh  
out Mark Arm's vocals, Steve Turner's incisive guitar and the 
rhythm section of Matt Lukin and Danny Peters. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Seattle band probably won't ever reach the popularity  
of Pearl Jam (Pearl Jam members played with Arm and Turner in 
pre-grunge group Green River), Mudhoney continues to cut the 
deepest tracks of the decade-long trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow Hit Today'' contains an unlisted country-tinged bonus  
track at the end of the disc as well. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	``In Their Eyes: '90s Teen Bands Vs. '80s Teen Movies'' (Cheap  
Date	
/Rhino) -- various artists 

</P>
<P>
	This compilation brings back the schoolhouse pop of 1980s teen  
movies by covering songs from the soundtracks of all the John 
Hughes classics plus ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' ``Valley 
Girl'' and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grown-Ups do a girl-group version of ``Pretty in Pink''  
that's as touching as the original from the Psychedelic Furs. 
Simple Mind's ``Don't You (Forget About Me),'' the heart-tugger 
from ``The Breakfast Club,'' is done with sincerity by the Gadjits. 
Coolest is the Rondelles' raw take of Modern English's ``I Melt 
With You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other tracks include Peter Gabriel's ``In Your Eyes,'' performed  
by the Stinky Puffs; the Knock-Ups' sassy version of Josie Cotton's 
``Johnny, Are You Queer?''; and Aussie balladeer Ben Lee and 
Spitoon's countrified take on the Thompson Twins' ``If You Were 
Here'' from ``Sixteen Candles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Donnas, goddaughters of such bands as Girlschool and Sweet,  
close this teen movie tribute with Alice Cooper's ``School's Out'' 
from ``Rock 'n' Roll High School.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can look back without anger with ``In Their Eyes,'' and also  
appreciate the nifty Jaime Hernandez comic book art that graces the 
album cover as well.

	``Sheet Music'' (DCC) -- Nancy Sinatra  

</P>
<P>
	``Sheet Music,'' a sumptuous 21-track collection of Nancy  
Sinatra's favorite classic love songs, is a perfect recipe for 
relaxation even if your swinging days are over. 
</P>
<P>
	The swaying string arrangements in her version of the Doors'  
``Light My Fire'' spark this album which also includes George 
Harrison's ``Something'' and Paul McCartney's ``Maybe I'm Amazed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other delights include Nancy's previously unreleased take on  
``California Dreamin','' and her spin on the Kinks' ``Tired of 
Waiting for You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fell in Love With a Poet,'' by Kim Carnes, and ``Until It's  
Time for You to Go,'' by Buffy St. Marie, also work well here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nice 'n Easy,'' ``The Shadow of Your Smile'' and ``Call Me''  
represent the Nancy Sinatra-Lee Hazlewood productions here, with 
most of the other tracks produced by Billy Strange, Jimmy Bowen and 
Duane Eddy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gem in this musical tiara is the dreamy ``Kinky Love,''  
which exemplifies Nancy Sinatra's silky style. 
</P>
<P>
	So dim the lights and slip away with a little ``Sheet Music.''

<HEADLINE> INS To Deploy 1,600 New Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top immigration official said  
Wednesday she has no plans to leave her job despite sharp criticism 
from two Republican congressmen who questioned her agency's 
competence in fighting illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Doris Meissner also announced that the Immigration  
and Naturalization Service will dispatch 1,600 new employees across 
the country this year to enforce immigration law, speed up the 
naturalization process and process travelers entering the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	One thousand new Border Patrol agents will be deployed, mostly  
at the southwestern border, to beef up enforcement in Arizona and 
Texas and to break smuggling rings that moved to the El Centro, 
Calif., area after a crackdown in San Diego. Meissner said the INS 
will send 485 agents to Texas, 395 to Arizona, 83 to California, 15 
to New Mexico and 22 to three places on the United States' northern 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the INS still is looking for ways to deal with a  
shortage of detention space but has no plans to release illegal 
aliens convicted of such crimes as burglary, assault and drug 
offenses to make room for offenders with more serious criminal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration plans to ask Congress for an  
additional $80 million this year for the 3,000 new detention beds 
it expects to need for Central Americans who have fled or are 
fleeing the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the agency is working on plans to regain some of the  
discretionary power to release criminal aliens who are not a threat 
to the community to free up detention space, she said. That 
authority was canceled by an immigration overhaul bill Congress 
passed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and Rep. Elton Gallegly,  
R-Calif., sent a letter asking Attorney General Janet Reno to 
replace Meissner if she does not act quickly to improve the 
detention and deportation of illegal aliens. They also said they 
hoped the letter would kill any discussion of releasing criminal 
aliens at the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Smith said he believed the INS had reversed  
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense has prevailed at the INS,'' he said. ``It is  
inconceivable why they even considered an idea that would so 
endanger the public. ... I am hopeful that now the agency will 
focus on fixing its mismanagement of handling criminal aliens to 
make the best use of its budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The INS budget stands at a record $3.9 billion for this fiscal  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Smith and Gallegy told reporters about their letter,  
the White House released a statement expressing President Clinton's 
full support and confidence in Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intention of resigning,'' Meissner told reporters  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> FDA Overturned in Cholesterol Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered the Food and  
Drug Administration to lift its ban on an imported 
cholesterol-reducing substance, a ruling that may hamper the 
government's ability to regulate natural remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA had banned imports of red yeast powder from China that  
contains mevinolin. Because mevinolin is identical to a synthetic 
drug -- sold as Mevacor and prescribed to lower cholesterol -- the 
agency regarded the powder as an unapproved drug. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Court Judge Dale Kimball late Tuesday granted  
a motion by Pharmanex -- which markets the powder under the name 
Cholestin -- that the agency's ban was unlawful under the 1994 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and should be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball said Cholestin clearly is ``a product (other than  
tobacco) intended to supplement the diet'' and fits the definition 
of ``dietary supplement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA on May 20, 1998, banned Pharmanex from importing red  
yeast rice for the manufacture of Cholestin. But less than a month 
later, Kimball granted a preliminary injunction that allowed 
Pharmanex to import a limited amount of red yeast powder pending a 
final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the preliminary injunction against the FDA, Kimball  
also agreed with Pharmanex that the company would suffer 
irreparable injury if the FDA's ban remained in place. He noted 
that the FDA was not claiming that there was a safety issue 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was the first challenge to the FDA's powers under  
the act, which provides for the widespread sale of herbs, teas and 
capsules containing ingredients that are not FDA-approved as safe 
and effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball's ruling allows the FDA to regulate Cholestin only as a  
dietary supplement -- not as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmanex president Bill McGlashan said today he was ``pleased''  
with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision also reflects that good science, while  
contributing to the health of Americans, does not transform a 
natural health supplement into a drug,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA did not immediately return a telephone call seeking  
comment today. Pharmanex was acquired in October by Nu Skin 
Enterprises of Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball's ruling allows Pharmanex to continue importing the red  
yeast rice to its Farmington, Utah, factory, which churns out up to 
90,000 capsules a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mevinolin is identical to the synthetically produced  
cholesterol-reducing drug lovastatin, which Merck &AMP; Co. sells under 
the brand name Mevacor. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA claimed it could ban imports of the red yeast powder  
because of two major restrictions outlined in the federal act. 
</P>
<P>
	First, any FDA-approved drug ingredients cannot also be sold as  
dietary supplements unless they were sold as a supplement or food 
before the drug's approval. Second, supplement manufacturers may 
claim only general benefits for the ingredient, rather than cures, 
preventions or treatments of diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA regulators said Cholestin ran afoul of the law on both  
counts: It was not sold as a supplement before Mevacor was 
approved, and Pharmanex has made improper claims about its 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kimball said last summer that the central question was  
whether Cholestin was a dietary supplement under the 1994 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers spend $5 billion a year on dietary supplements, and  
the 1994 law was sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a regular 
user of supplements and champion of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of Hatch's law contend it blurred the line between  
minimally regulated supplements and federally approved, rigorously 
tested drugs.

<HEADLINE> Pats May Get Bonus in Stadium Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft  
may pocket some of the difference if construction costs for the 
team's Hartford stadium run below what the state has agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut has pledged up to $280 million for the 68,000-seat  
stadium, scheduled to be built by 2002. The state will pay another 
$94 million in other costs, including securing the construction 
site and cleaning up environmental contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft will pick up the tab if construction costs run more than  
$280 million. But if he cuts costs while building the stadium, he 
may be able to rake in some of the savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the stadium deal were made public in a 226-page  
development agreement released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the state felt it was in its best interest to provide some  
kind of incentive to save the state money, they could negotiate an 
agreement,'' according to Scott Murphy, the state's chief lawyer 
who drew up the development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said Wednesday there is nothing unusual about offering  
Kraft incentives if they could save the state money. He noted the 
development agreement does not obligate Connecticut to strike such 
a deal with the NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kraft did get a bonus, it wouldn't amount to much, Murphy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is something negotiated, it would be unspectacular in  
its particulars,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the plan say anything that goes to Kraft is too much.  
</P>
<P>
	``First, they get a totally free ride, and then they say they  
want more of a free ride,'' said consumer activist Ralph Nader. 
``This is unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the development agreement sets the terms of the  
Patriots' 30-year lease, the contract does offer Kraft some escape 
hatches. And the deal still needs the blessing of the NFL, which 
isn't expected to take up the issue before May.

<HEADLINE> Black Marine Beaten, Paralyzed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sitting in a wheelchair with only the slightest  
movement in his left hand, Lance Cpl. Carlos Colbert still has his 
voice to describe how five men savagely changed his life at a 
Memorial Day party. 
</P>
<P>
	The black Marine, who is paralyzed, faced the white men who  
drunkenly beat him, broke his neck and left him motionless on the 
ground in what prosecutors say was a racist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame y'all for what you did because y'all were taught  
(to hate),'' Colbert, 21, said today. He has trouble speaking 
because of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you're apologizing because you got caught. You don't care  
about me. ... You just don't want to get caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Marie Colbert, said that even if the men were given  
100 years, it wouldn't free her son from his life imprisonment in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Lawson, 20; Trenton Solis, 18; Robert Rio, 23; Jed Jones,  
21; and Steven Newark III, 18, pleaded guilty last month to felony 
assault and avoided potential life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson, who admitted the attack was racially motivated, was  
sentenced to nine years. The others were to sentenced to one year 
in prison and five years probation. They were given credit for time 
served since their September arrest, and ordered not to drink 
alcohol and to undergo anger management counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Craig Rooten said Tuesday that Colbert wanted the  
case to go to trial, but understood the guilty pleas ensured jail 
time for his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people involved and there was a lot of  
alcohol involved, making it a difficult case to sort out,'' Rooten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert, of Forestville, Md., was one of just a few blacks who  
attended a party last May at the home of Tim Bullard, a fellow Camp 
Pendleton Marine. At least 100 people packed the small house at 
Santee, a rural community 20 miles northeast of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	When a fight broke out in the front yard, there were no  
streetlights to illuminate what was happening and most of the 
people were drunk, Rooten said. Police interviewed about 50 people 
over four months before making any arrests since few stories were 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	One common denominator was that the attackers punched and kicked  
Colbert while shouting racial slurs and ``white power,'' Rooten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert's memory of the attack was that a fellow Marine went  
outside to help a woman who was hit by a ``skinhead.'' When he 
heard the commotion, he went outside to see what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of the corner of my eye I saw a guy coming toward me with  
brass knuckles,'' Colbert told The San Diego Union-Tribune. ``I 
felt it on my neck. . . . He came up behind me and broke my neck. I 
fell flat on my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing last month, Judge Frederic Link asked Lawson if he  
beat Colbert because he was black and he tearfully said: ``That is 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of some of the attackers recently went on a radio  
talk show, saying their sons were coerced into confessing that the 
crime was racially motivated, and it really was just a drunk brawl. 
A witness called in to say that such hatred isn't created by 
alcohol, it only enhances it. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert spent several months at a Veteran's Administration  
hospital in Long Beach before moving to a Virginia hospital closer 
to his family's Maryland home. He was recently moved to a home 
modified for his wheelchair, Rooten said.

<HEADLINE> Conoco Has Asia Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- U.S. oil company Conoco Inc. today  
announced plans to invest $2 billion in the Asia Pacific region 
over the next five years, including $100 million in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco's chief executive officer, Archie Dunham, disclosed the  
plans at a news conference held to announce that the company's Thai 
unit has opened 100 service stations branded with the name JET. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco is the ninth-largest oil company in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	Conoco opened its first gas station in Thailand in 1993, and  
last year spent one billion baht ($27.17 million) opening 25 new 
gas stations with adjoining Jiffy convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunham said the $100-million slated for Thai operations will go  
into opening another 100 new gas stations and convenience stores by 
the year 2002. In 1999 alone, the company would open 5-6 new gas 
stations and convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the $2 billion budget for the Asia-Pacific  
region will go to existing gas and oil exploration and production 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be sure, Asia is overshadowed by economic and political  
difficulties at the moment,'' Dunham said in statement. ``But we 
regard these difficulties as purely transitional. Long-term, we see 
a very bright future ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco may spend more than $100 million in Thailand if it can  
find suitable partners for investing in refineries, he said. The 
company has a 40 percent stake in a refinery in Malaysia and plans 
to expand capacity elsewhere in Asia, though not necessarily 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a pure economic point of view, if we find a very good  
opportunity, very profitable opportunity, we'll invest (in a 
refinery) here,'' Dunham said. At the moment, however, Conoco is 
not holding talks with any Thai refiners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco set up its Thai unit, Conoco (Thailand) Ltd., in 1991.  
The local unit has spent a cumulative total of $122.28 million and 
is expected to break even either this year or next. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco (Thailand) has a 3.4 percent share of the Thai gasoline  
market which it hopes to increase to 7 percent in five years, 
Dunham said.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Lt. Gov. Finds Nothing To Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The first Republican to be elected  
lieutenant governor of Alabama this century has been left with very 
little to do, thanks to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Windom spent $5.3 million to win the No. 2 spot in this  
heavily Democratic state. But a week before he could take office, 
the state Senate stripped the post of its most powerful duties -- 
appointing committees, picking committee chairmen and controlling 
the fate of many bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's move was instigated by Democratic Gov. Don  
Siegelman, who was lieutenant governor when he got elected last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman wanted to prevent Windom from carrying out a vow to  
block a vote on the new governor's No. 1 campaign proposal: 
creation of a state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We elected Siegelman governor. We didn't elect him dictator,''  
complained Windom, who has threatened to take the dispute to court. 
``Don Siegelman wants to be governor and lieutenant governor, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama is one of 18 states where the governor and lieutenant  
governor run separately and can be from different political 
parties. That was never a problem this century, since Alabama has 
pretty much been a one-party state for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But times are changing in the Deep South, and Republicans are  
making themselves heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom was heavily financed by business groups, which tangled  
with Siegelman for years over tort reform. Siegelman, who was 
lieutenant governor the past four years, was repeatedly blamed for 
the death of bills aimed at restricting punitive-damage verdicts by 
juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom pulled off a narrow victory over a senator who had been  
Siegelman's right-hand man. But the Democrats increased their 
majority in the Senate in the same election, giving them the 
numbers to strip Windom of his power -- which they did in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, we won, but I don't think we got what we thought  
we were going to get,'' said Wayne Bonner, chairman of a 
construction industry political action committee that bankrolled 
Windom. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the power now rests with the Senate's top Democrat, who  
said the move was merely an effort to permit power to be held by 
the majority party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing the evolution of a two-party state,'' said Lowell  
Barron, Senate president pro tem. ``We're trying to organize like 
the U.S. Senate is organized and like most states are organized.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With impeachment behind him and the  
Republican-controlled Congress in recess, President Clinton is 
hoping this week to gain the upper hand in the debate over how to 
divide the federal budget surplus while saving Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign gears up today with satellite-linked town hall  
meetings aimed at selling young people on the president's plan to 
shore up the retirement system and Medicare. Clinton goes to New 
Hampshire on Thursday to talk about tax credit proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say they want to sharpen the  
distinctions between the president's insistence on dealing with 
Social Security before trimming taxes and the Republicans' emphasis 
on across-the-board tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart,  
is between ``progressive tax cuts that are targeted for those who 
need them most as opposed to an across-the-board tax cut that does 
nothing to help save Medicare and provides only modest benefits to 
middle-income Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some authorities contend the surest way to shore up  
Social Security is to raise taxes and reduce benefits, Clinton 
adviser Paul Begala said today that such unpopular actions are 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the surplus, we are not now at a time when we need deep  
and drastic cuts in Social Security,'' Begala said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' ``So we can take that surplus and invest in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have agreed in principle with Clinton's call to  
devote 62 percent of the anticipated budget surpluses to shoring up 
the Social Security system over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on Clinton's proposal to dedicate 15  
percent of the surplus to Medicare, and Republicans have roundly 
criticized a proposal to use another 11 percent to establish 
401(k)-style accounts for working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other  
GOP lawmakers presided over the first in a series of small town 
meetings Monday to build support for their proposal to cut taxes by 
$743 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty-two percent should be set aside to save Social  
Security,'' said Republican National Committee spokesman Tom Yu. 
``The rest should go back to the taxpayer. It's an overpayment in 
taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, makes his pitch via satellite today to 
41 college campuses in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to convince students, and Congress, that fixing the  
retirement system now is the best plan for their future. ``Then 
it's a debate over how do you do tax cuts,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of slashing taxes across the board, Clinton wants to  
target tax cuts where he believes they are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly proposed retirement funds, called Universal Savings  
Accounts, would target tax credits to low- and middle-income 
working Americans who choose to save more for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the key political battleground of New Hampshire on Thursday,  
Clinton plans to focus on his proposed $1,000 tax credit on helping 
families cope with the burdens of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would provide up to $500 in tax credits for  
stay-at-home parents caring for children under age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu said Republicans weren't worried about Clinton stealing the  
spotlight while lawmakers were on a recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many members of Congress and senators are going to be holding  
town hall meetings and listening to their constituents during the 
recess,'' Yu said. ``They're not taking the day off by any means.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Release CB Steve Atwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos released safety Steve Atwater  
on Wednesday, one day after making Dale Carter the highest-paid 
cornerback in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos and Carter reached agreement Tuesday on a six-year,  
$38 million contract that includes an $8 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, 29, was one of the top prizes in this year's free-agent  
class, and by signing him the Broncos showed their commitment to 
trying to win a third straight Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're very serious about a three-peat,''  
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a No. 1 pick of the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992, was  
named to start in four straight Pro Bowls from 1994-97 and was an 
unrestricted free agent. The Chiefs could have matched Denver's 
offer but chose not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too large,'' Kansas City general manager Carl Peterson  
said. ``It's an amazing contract. I'm surprised at the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To free up space under the league's salary cap to sign Carter,  
the Broncos on Wednesday released Atwater, who was scheduled to 
count nearly $3.3 million against Denver's salary cap next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, 32, has played in eight Pro Bowls, but he has been  
bracing for his exit from Denver since being replaced on passing 
downs this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos said that after Atwater has explored all options  
available to him, it is possible he may still return to the Broncos 
for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is a big shock to me,'' he said. ``When  
they were taking me out of games, that said something right there. 
They had needs to address. I have nothing but great things to say 
about my time in Denver. It was 10 great seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he spoke with Atwater before  
releasing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, 6-foot-1 and 188 pounds, had a sub-par season in 1998  
because of a broken forearm he incurred Nov. 1. He is a proven 
cornerback, however, who has the speed to blanket any receiver and 
the strength to make any tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had 54 tackles and two interceptions last year. He is one  
of two active players, along with Deion Sanders, to score 
touchdowns on a punt return, interception return and as a wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have one of the best (cornerback) tandems in  
the league,'' Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said of Carter and 
Ray Crockett. ``You can't believe what that does for a defense when 
you have two corners like this. It's going to make things nice for 
(defensive coordinator) Greg Robinson when he's putting game plans 
together. He can do anything now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing also means that cornerback Darrien Gordon will be  
playing elsewhere in 1999. Gordon, exposed in the expansion draft 
but not claimed, was allowed to become an unrestricted free agent 
after starting for two seasons at right cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs, who have lost free agents Carter, Neil Smith and  
Keith Traylor to the Broncos in the past two seasons, immediately 
began wooing Gordon.

Sacramento, Calif., to Sheffield, England, were discussed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league was tentatively formed in December as a partnership  
between the North American Premier Soccer Alliance and the English 
Professional Indoor Football League. Final details were worked out 
this week, and the teams -- eight from North America and four from 
England -- will kick things off in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has developed even faster than I could have  
anticipated,'' said Gordon Jago, a longtime indoor soccer coach and 
the league's first commissioner. ``Once the idea got out there, a 
number of people were eager to jump on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WISL begins play on July 3, when the Dallas Sidekicks visit  
a club in Sheffield, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The league features American teams in Dallas, Houston,  
Sacramento, Phoenix, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City; the 
Mexican club La Raza de Monterrey; and English franchises in 
London, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
	An eighth North American team, which will play at The Pond in  
Anaheim, Calif., is expected to be added as soon as scheduling 
conflicts are worked out. A team in St. Louis is expected to join 
the WISL in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has its roots in the lucrative exhibitions regularly  
played by North American indoor soccer teams against clubs from 
Europe, Latin America and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the four-team PSA hosted sides from Brazil, Mexico,  
Argentina, El Salvador and Canada in addition to their regular 
league schedule. The exhibitions typically draw thousands of 
expatriate fans who turn out to support their home team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jago was trying to recruit English clubs for PSA exhibition  
matches when he made contact with Terry Smith, a former New England 
Patriots player now living in England. Smith was in the process of 
starting his own league of six English indoor teams which would 
play exhibitions in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You're doing what I'm doing, and we should work  
together,''' Jago said. ``This idea is a good one because of the 
way fans are drawn to those big games against big opponents. 
Obviously, our league won't be there right away, but it seems a 
good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's eight North American teams will equally split the  
cost of traveling to England, Jago said, while the English clubs 
will do the same for their trips to the States. The teams will 
travel in pairs and play several games during their two-week trips 
across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very much a sharing league, and we have to be  
conscious of the bottom line,'' Jago said. The league is also 
pursuing sponsorship deals with airlines to underwrite costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The league will play under North American indoor soccer rules,  
which are similar to hockey. Different rules are used in most 
English indoor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	There are five field players and a goalkeeper to each side, and  
free substitution is allowed. The field is approximately the size 
of a hockey rink, complete with dasher boards and penalty boxes.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Chinese gymnast paralyzed during the  
Goodwill Games watched helplessly from the back seat of a car while 
a man who offered to help fix a flat tire stole her guardian's 
pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang Lan's guardian, Gina Liu, pulled her car to the edge of a  
Manhattan service road Tuesday afternoon. Police said a man walked 
by and offered to assist. He and Liu changed the tire while the 
17-year-old gymnast remained in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The man then stood up, stretched, dusted off his hands and  
snatched the 45-year-old woman's bag, which had $400 in it, from 
the front seat, then ran away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they did not have any suspects.  
</P>
<P>
	Sang, a member of the Chinese national team, was severely  
injured during a warmup exercise at the Goodwill Games last summer 
in Uniondale, N.Y. She was paralyzed from the neck down, but has 
regained some strength in her shoulders, elbows and wrists, and can 
raise her arms.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Browns Still Busy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns need the players and have the most money to  
spend, so it's no surprise they are the most active team early in 
the free-agent season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who left themselves far under the salary cap by  
limiting themselves generally to young players in the expansion 
draft last week, added three players Tuesday, led by veteran 
linebacker Chris Spielman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who also signed free-agent offensive tackle Orlando  
Brown and cornerback Corey Fuller, are banking on Spielman to give 
them solid linebacking and leadership for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who played in four Pro Bowls as a member of the  
Detroit Lions, is coming back after not playing in 1998 because his 
wife was being treated for breast cancer. Stefanie Spielman is now 
cancer free. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned what real courage is from her,'' Spielman said.  
``What real toughness is, and what unconditional love is. You don't 
know what stress is until you're waiting for a biopsy report. 
That's stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns acquired the 33-year-old Spielman from  
Buffalo for past considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the kind of player any coach would want,'' Browns coach  
Chris Palmer said. ``He's a winner with an intense desire to 
excel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman grew up in Massillon, Ohio, and played in college at  
Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be home,'' he said. ``I'm a Northeast Ohio guy.  
I'm about as Northeast Ohio as you can get. Steel mill or whatever 
you want to call it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 6-foot-7, 350-pound tackle nicknamed ``Zeus,'' will be  
the second former Browns player to return to Cleveland. Last week, 
the Browns used their final expansion draft pick to select 
cornerback Antonio Langham. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who reportedly signed a seven-year, $26 million deal,  
gives the Browns three young, quality offensive linemen. The 
28-year-old Brown will join guard Jim Pyne and center Dave 
Wohlabaugh, who signed a seven-year, $26.25 million contract 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller played for Minnesota last season and Brown was in  
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was one of four Ravens players signed by other teams  
Tuesday as the New York Jets signed a tight end and might lose 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jacksonville Jaguars signed Kyle Brady to an offer sheet  
that would make him the highest-paid tight end in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets have seven days to match the five-year, $14.4 million  
offer because Brady is a transition player. The deal reportedly 
includes a $4 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady caught 30 passes last season for a career-high 315 yards  
and five touchdowns. The Jets selected him with the ninth overall 
pick in 1995 from Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady's deal with the Jaguars would average $2.88 million,  
moving him past the $2.87 million average earned by Denver tight 
end Shannon Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are not expected to match the offer because earlier in  
the day, the Jets prepared for Brady's departure by signing 
two-time Pro Bowler Eric Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Green caught 34 passes for 422 yards and one touchdown last  
season with the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Eric is a good addition to the team and should improve  
our running game substantially,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets also signed defensive end Mike Frederick, who played  
primarily on special teams and as a reserve in 1998 for Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle James Jones, an unrestricted free agent who  
spent the past three seasons with the Ravens, signed with the 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, made 75 tackles in each of the past two seasons,  
highs in his eight-year NFL career. Last season he had 5.5 sacks, 
forced a fumble and had a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Since entering the NFL out of Northern Iowa, Jones has played in  
128 games, making 108 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos agreed to terms with cornerback Dale Carter,  
who played seven years for Kansas City and made four consecutive 
trips to the Pro Bowl from 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter played in 11 games with the Chiefs last season and had  
two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Eagles bolstered their wide receiving corps  
with the addition of free agents Charles Johnson and Torrance 
Small. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson signed a five-year deal worth $15 million, according to  
his agent, Joel Segal. Johnson, who played the last five seasons 
with the Pittsburgh Steelers, also will receive a $3 million 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on top of the world right now,'' said Johnson, who caught  
65 passes for 815 yards and seven touchdowns last year. ``This 
means a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small, who played with Indianapolis last season, signed a  
four-year deal worth $9 million, agent Rich DeLuca said. Small had 
45 receptions for 681 yards and seven touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers did sign one of their own free agents, strong  
safety Lee Flowers. He agreed to a $10 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens signed one player in addition to the four they lost,  
and they intensified their effort to lure free-agent quarterback 
Scott Mitchell to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Evans, who spent the previous six seasons with the  
Vikings, was signed to play fullback. He will be used primarily to 
clear a path for running backs Priest Holmes and Errict Rhett.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. handily beat Wall  
Street expectations, earning $960 million, or 92 cents a share in 
its fiscal first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared to $929 million or 86 cents a share, in the  
year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 
the company to earn 83 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've achieved a good profit outcome despite softness in some  
of our businesses and weak revenue growth,'' said Hewlett-Packard 
president Lewis Platt on Tuesday. ``Our profit reflects the fact 
that we continue to tune our business models and cost structures. 
Manufacturing efficiencies have risen substantially, and we've kept 
tight controls on discretionary spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Platt said the company is still not meeting growth objectives.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stay sharply focused on stimulating business while  
remaining sensitive to the need for careful expense management,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the three months ended Jan. 31 was $11.94 billion,  
compared with $11.82 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for the quarter were down 1 percent at $12.2 billion,  
compared with $12.4 billion in the same period last year. Orders in 
the United States fell 3 percent, to $5.2 billion. Orders from 
outside the United States remained steady at $7.1 billion.

<HEADLINE>  Eagles Sign Pederson To Be New QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles signed free agent  
Doug Pederson to a $4.5 million, three-year contract on Wednesday 
to be the starting quarterback for the NFL's worst offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, 31, has never started an NFL game and had thrown just  
32 regular-season passes in the league during a career that began 
in 1992 on the Dolphins' practice squad. He has been Brett Favre's 
backup the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very smart individual who has size and that helps,''  
said Eagles coach Andy Reid, who was Green Bay's quarterbacks coach 
before being hired by the Eagles. ``He also has the physical 
ability to run and throw the ball. He's been able to study the West 
Coast offense for the last three years, so he knows the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson will be called upon to resuscitate an offense that  
scored only 161 points last season, 80 fewer than the next worst 
team. The Eagles went through three quarterbacks -- Bobby Hoying, 
Rodney Peete and Koy Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step,'' Pederson said. ``You can't turn away from  
that. But I'm ready. I'm willing to take that step,'' Pederson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, undrafted after throwing 33 touchdowns and 41  
interceptions at Northeast Louisiana, had his most active year in 
1998. He completed 14 of 24 passes, including 10 of 16 for 128 
yards and two touchdowns in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around enough to know that it's a game about winning  
and I want to win. That reaction (from the fans) is fine,'' 
Pederson said. ``I guess that's part of the history of Doug 
Pederson. I've been a backup to Dan Marino, I've been a backup to 
Brett Favre. This is my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said the signing would not impact the team's strategy for  
the NFL Draft, which begins April 17. The Eagles, many believe, 
will use high draft pick on a quarterback.

<HEADLINE> 9 Charged in Attack on Disabled Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEANSBURG, N.J. (AP) -- Authorities have arrested a ninth person  
in the beating of a learning-disabled man who was lured to a party, 
forced to wear women's clothing and taped to a lawn chair. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the accused allegedly picked up the 23-year-old man from  
his job at a restaurant and took him to the party on Jan. 30, said 
James K. Pigott, a deputy police chief who announced the arrests on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Krochmaluk had his head shaved and was beaten with shower  
curtain rods and a toilet brush, Pigott said. He was threatened 
with a knife and taken to a wooded area, where a pillowcase was put 
over his head and he was punched, Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
	With one eye swollen shut, Krochmaluk reached a security guard  
booth at a business and police were called. He was treated at a 
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused were bent on revenge for two incidents involving the  
Krochmaluk at previous parties, including once telephoning his 
father and saying others wouldn't let him leave, Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges ranged from kidnapping, aggravated assault and  
conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. The latest arrest came 
late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Taking Iraq Threats Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraq has three main options for carrying out  
its threat to attack Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for supporting 
recent U.S. air attacks, but none is likely to succeed, U.S. 
defense officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq could fire Scud missiles, attack by air with planes, or  
launch a terrorist attack, Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense 
Secretary William Cohen, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these would be difficult, given the circumstances that  
Iraq faces today,'' Bacon said, referring to the deterioration of 
Iraq's military since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the effect of the 
U.N. economic embargo and the strength of U.S. forces in the area 
that could retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's state-controlled media warned U.S. allies Tuesday they  
will pay a high price for playing host to American and British 
warplanes that patrol ``no-fly'' zones over Iraq. The planes have 
attacked Iraqi air defense installations almost daily in recent 
weeks in what the Pentagon calls self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Monday that  
Baghdad would attack Incirlik Air Base in south-central Turkey -- 
used by U.S. and British warplanes -- if the jets continue 
patrolling Iraqi skies. It was the first time in years Iraq has 
threatened to attack its northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not he means this threat to be taken seriously, we  
have to take seriously threats like this,'' Bacon said. He said 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is searching for a way to intimidate 
his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign of Saddam Hussein's desperation and isolation that  
Iraq is making such threats,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ankara, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz defended his  
government's threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. and British planes are killing Iraqis, are destroying  
Iraqi property, and this is not acceptable,'' Aziz said Tuesday. 
``A Turkish air base should not be used by the Americans and 
British to hurt Iraqis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said Incirlik is at ``the very outer edge'' of the range  
of Scud ballistic missiles that Iraq might use against Turkey and 
is protected by a small contingent of U.S. Army Patriot 
anti-missile missiles. Iraq says it has no more Scud missiles, but 
U.N. arms inspectors are not sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said Iraq's depleted air force would stand little chance  
against U.S. and allied air defenses in Turkey, Kuwait or Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that they have significant air power to be able  
to launch a longer-range attack against bases deep inside another 
country's territory, and it would be extremely unwise for them to 
try to do that,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Bears Sign DE Clyde Simmons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- It took the Chicago Bears two tries to  
get Clyde Simmons. And they have new coach Dick Jauron to thank for 
finally sealing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The free agent defensive end, whose 114 career sacks are  
10th-best in the NFL, signed a two-year, $4 million deal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of confidence in Dick,'' Simmons said. ``I've  
played in his scheme for a couple of years. I know what he brings 
to the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons notched 16 sacks during two seasons at Jacksonville  
(1996 and 1997) while Jauron was the Jaguars' defensive 
coordinator. But the Jaguars let him go to make room for Tony 
Brackens. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons visited Chicago last year during his free agency tour  
but signed with Cincinnati instead. He started all 16 games for the 
Bengals and finished with five sacks, second-best on the team, and 
30 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simmons wasn't quite comfortable with Cincinnati's 3-4  
defense after playing most of his 13-year career in 4-3 schemes. So 
when the Bears made another pitch this year, he was happy to 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really good about getting Clyde because of his  
relationship with Dick,'' said Mark Hatley, the Bears' vice 
president of player personnel. ``Clyde liked it here the last time 
he was here, and Dick's real close to him. He felt like he'd fit in 
here and he'd really be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons has made the Pro Bowl twice (1991 and 1992) in his  
career. He has six touchdowns, 12 blocked kicks, 21 forced fumbles 
and 12 fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, though, he knows he's a long way removed from the North  
Carolina boy who guarded Michael Jordan a few times when they 
played high school basketball. And he's not the same athlete who 
had 19 sacks for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was an every-down player for the Bengals last year, and  
he can do it again for the Bears if that's what they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``People recognize me as a pass rusher, but I believe I can play  
the run as well as anybody,'' he said. ``If they need me to be an 
every-down player, I'll be that. If they need me to be a pass 
rusher, I'll be that. If they need me to be a run-stopper, I'll be 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they need me to do, that's what I came here to do.''  
</P>
<P>
	While Jauron said Simmons could wind up being a starter, his  
signing won't stop the Bears from pursuing New York Giants 
defensive end Chad Bratzke. The free agent has postponed all of his 
visits due to his father's death, but the Bears hope to bring 
Bratzke in sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Simmons' statistics are impressive, Jauron said the  
Bears wanted him for more than simply his production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, 'I'd like to say we're bringing you because you're  
a great player. But the truth is, we're bringing you because you're 
a great player and a great person.' And we need a lot of both of 
those,'' Jauron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons drew interest from other teams, including the Bengals.  
But the Bears' enthusiasm and the opportunity to play for Jauron 
made the choice easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bears stepped up to the front and showed they wanted me  
here now,'' Simmons said. ``So that's why I'm here.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 8.53; Nasdaq Down 38.11 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials hovered around  
unchanged in mid-afternoon, but the Nasdaq composite was still 
lower in disappointment over Dell Computer's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 8.53 at 9,305.56, having bailed out of a 77-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned mixed after a weak morning. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 0.47 at 1,241.40, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 38.11 at 2,275.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the big board by a  
4-to-3 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 
471.04 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``All things considered, its a pretty decent day,'' said Bryan  
Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential. ``But we've got low 
volume, the breadth is negative, there are more losers than 
winners, more stocks are making new lows than new highs. The bottom 
line is the market's got to churn around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are testing the mettle of investors,'' he added,  
``especially in the Internet stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Lawler, manager of equity trading Dreyfus Corp., was  
similarly unimpressed. ``Until I see a better tone to the market in 
general, not just one day to the next, a better advance-decline 
ratio, then I'll get a little more excited about the market. But 
until then, I think we're just going to tread water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's fourth-quarter earnings, released late Tuesday, met  
analysts' expectations of 31 cents a share. But its revenues didn't 
grow as much as analysts had hoped. Dell's shares were down 7 3/4 at 
81 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related shares were mostly lower. Dow component  
Hewlett-Packard was down 1 3/4 at 68 3/4. The computer maker's earnings, 
also released late Tuesday, beat analysts' per-share expectations, 
but its 1-percent revenue growth did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Applied Materials, which also reported earnings late Tuesday,  
was up 1 3/4 at 69 5/8 in Nasdaq trading. Applied Materials posted 
operating income of 11 cents a share, above analysts' consensus 
target of 6 cents, but well below last year's 52 cents. Revenue 
fell to $742 million from $1.31 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were supported by industrial issues after  
the Federal Reserve reportd that industrial production was 
unchanged in January after a lackluster 1998. Economists said the 
data eased fears that the central bank might raise interest rates, 
despite the fact that the Commerce Department also reported today 
that housing starts jumped a very strong 3.8 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component General Motors was up 2 11/16 at 85 3/4. Financial  
stocks, which benefit from lower interest rates, were higher as 
well, with American Express up 2 1/4 at 104 6/16. United Technologies 
was up 1 5/8 at 122 3/4. The company's chief investment officer confirmed 
Tuesday that United Technologies' automotive unit is up for sale.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Star's Father Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- Men armed with rifles kidnapped the  
father of Mexican soccer star Jorge Campos on Wednesday at a sports 
field named for his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos, the flamboyant goalkeeper for Mexico, rushed home from  
Hong Kong, where he was with the national team, according to Mexico 
City radio station Formato 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Two relatives confirmed the kidnapping on condition of  
anonymity, saying they feared for the life of Alvaro Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were six or eight people with their faces uncovered ...  
but nobody recognized them,'' said one relative. ``They took out 
their guns and took him aboard a pickup truck to an unknown 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formato 21 reported that the truck had been discovered a few  
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials said they couldn't comment on the case until  
the family filed a complaint. But Wednesday night, dozens of pickup 
trucks sped through Acapulco's southern outskirts, filled with 
state police officers carrying automatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvaro Campos was seized at the Jorge Campos football field in  
Plan de los Amates, a former farming village that has been taken 
over by Playa Diamante tourist development on the southern end of 
Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not had contact with the kidnappers. We are waiting to  
have some contact with them because we fear for his life,'' one of 
the relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acapulco is the most famous city in Guerrero, a state that has  
been plagued by kidnappings in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos, Mexico's starting goalkeeper at the World Cup in France,  
also plays in Major League Soccer for the Chicago Fire. He returns 
to Mexico during the offseason to play for a club team.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Lukewarm to Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican calls for a sweeping tax cut  
generate substantial support among core GOP voters, but not among 
ticket-splitters whose backing likely will be critical to GOP 
Senate candidates in 2000, says a confidential survey taken after 
last November's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans to expand beyond their loyal base, the survey  
says the GOP must stress plans to use the federal budget surpluses 
for ``debt reduction and Social Security'' as well as tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also says that three issues on which Americans say  
they favor Republicans for leadership -- taxes, defense and the 
budget -- ``are in the bottom half of the list of policy concerns'' 
among those who cast ballots last fall. A copy of the poll -- 
distributed to the rank and file last month -- was made available to 
The Associated Press. The GOP campaign committee declined comment, 
and the polling firm did not respond to a call. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, according to an accompanying memo circulated by Sen.  
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the GOP's senatorial campaign 
committee, the issues ripe for concentration are fixing Social 
Security, cutting taxes and improving schools while helping college 
students pay for their education. 
</P>
<P>
	But McConnell's memo also says, ``We should be under no illusion  
that there is steadfast support for tax cuts outside of our base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how they wanted to allocate any surplus, 27 percent of all  
voters surveyed said education, health care and other programs; 26 
percent said shoring up Social Security; 23 percent said cut taxes, 
and 20 percent said reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Voter Opinion Survey interviewed 1,000 registered  
voters between Nov. 18 and Nov. 24 last year. The margin of error 
was 3.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was done shortly after an election that produced  
disappointing results for Republicans, including the loss of five 
seats in the House and no net gain in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a footnote devoted to House races, the pollsters concluded  
that a costly Republican campaign of impeachment-linked TV 
commercials in late October, dubbed ``Operation Breakout,'' had 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not motivate the Republican base voter, who was already  
motivated. It did anger Democrats and motivated them more. 
In-betweeners tended to switch to voting Democratic by about 10 
percent,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was commissioned in part to generate issues that  
would ``benefit Republicans and put Democrats on the defensive'' in 
the Senate, and to help Republicans running in 2000. ``With small 
odds of getting many Democrats to cross over, the key to winning in 
'00 will be the Republican base and Ticket Splitters,'' said the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, McConnell offered a frank assessment.  
</P>
<P>
	``Here is our dilemma in a nutshell,'' he wrote. ``A plurality  
of Republican voters rated tax cuts as the highest priority for 
dividing up the surplus, but among ticket-splitters, tax cuts were 
the least popular choice.'' Preserving Social Security was the 
highest among this group. 
</P>
<P>
	A tax cut must be part of any GOP agenda, McConnell wrote,  
because it ranks well among actual voters, it is the only issue 
that holds the Republican voter base together and ``sad to say, it 
is just about the only issue that people uniformly cite as a reason 
to vote Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are already moving aggressively on tax cuts.  
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was in Michigan the day  
after President Clinton's impeachment trial ended, touting calls 
for an across-the-board tax cut. Among presidential candidates, 
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the House Budget Committee chairman, is 
campaigning on a platform of a 10 percent across-the-board rate 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	On Social Security, McConnell said proposals for letting  
individuals invest some of their payroll taxes privately outpoll 
President Clinton's alternative of having the government make the 
investment. But there is a contradiction: ``Although voters 
increasingly favor having more choice in investing their Social 
Security taxes, they remain highly anxious about retirement income 
security and having to figure out how to invest the money on their 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education, an issue that has traditionally favored Democrats, is  
the top-ranked issue, the poll showed, and voters ``strongly 
support Republican education reforms that are anathema to the 
teachers' union.'' These include making it easier to remove 
disruptive students from school and bad teachers from the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But voters are ``still highly divided'' on some prominent GOP  
education proposals, such as letting tax-supported vouchers pay for 
private school, or school choice.

<HEADLINE> Marine Jet's Altimeter Needle Stuck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The altimeter aboard a Marine Corps  
jet that severed an Italian ski gondola cable gave wildly incorrect 
readings during tests after the fatal accident, an electronics 
expert testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The altimeter, which uses radar signals bounced between the  
plane and the ground to indicate altitude, was sometimes off by as 
much as 650 feet, Robert Fitzgerald, an instrument expert from the 
Naval Aviation Depot in Jacksonville, Fla., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Capt. Richard Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler,  
have blamed his altimeter as one reason he swooped too low near the 
Italian village of Cavalese last February and snapped the cable, 
plunging 20 people to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter and could be sentenced to life in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ashby's EA-6B Prowler hit the cable because he  
flew too fast and well below the altitude limit of 1,000 feet. The 
cable was strung across a valley in the Italian Alps at about 370 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Capt. Bryan Thayer, a former pilot in Ashby's squadron,  
testified there were no guidelines in the cockpit of Ashby's plane 
that showed the 1,000-foot minimum altitude the squadron was to 
maintain on training flights. Thayer was present when military 
police inventoried the cockpit's contents the day of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few weeks later, he said, the guidelines mysteriously  
showed up among the cockpit's contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorneys say that because of poor communication between  
the Marine Corps and the Air Force, which issued the guidelines, 
Ashby did not have enough information to avoid the gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald testified Tuesday that when he reviewed the tests of  
the altimeter on videotape, he noticed its needle stuck three times 
-- at 650 feet when it should have read 500 feet, and again at 650 
feet and 320 feet, when each time it should have shown zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``The needle's circuitry was not working,'' Fitzgerald said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Maj. William Webber said Ashby filed a  
complaint, called a ``gripe,'' about the radar altimeter sticking a 
week after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gripe that Capt. Ashby made described circumstances very  
similar to what we saw in the test,'' Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Other experts testified Tuesday that most of the other  
instruments aboard the jet, which was built in 1988, weren't 
perfect but appeared to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is awaiting trial next month for the deaths.

<HEADLINE> NFL To Add Los Angeles or Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Los Angeles and Houston both lost NFL franchises  
in the past five years. By next month, one of those cities can look 
forward to having a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue anticipates no serious opposition to  
adding a 32nd franchise, setting up a vote when the owners meet in 
Phoenix on March 14-18. The new team could begin play by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general feeling is we should have 32 teams,'' said  
Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, a member of the expansion 
committee that met for nearly four hours Tuesday at an Atlanta 
airport hotel. ``Los Angeles and Houston are both viable markets 
that should be in the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would mark the league's fourth expansion this decade.  
Jacksonville and Carolina joined the NFL in 1995 and the new 
Cleveland Browns begin play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the L.A. and Houston markets have fan interest,  
large populations and television appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very close race,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	There is only one group, headed by Robert McNair, vying for the  
franchise in Houston, and it has a plan for a new retractable-roof 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rival groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise, each with its own stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz has lined up an all-star roster of  
investors, including actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, to build 
a combined stadium and shopping mall in Carson, 21 miles south of 
downtown. Developer Ed Roski Jr. and billionaire Eli Broad are 
proposing to renovate the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders  
returned to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. The Houston Oilers left for Tennessee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the league might assist in the funding of the Los  
Angeles stadium, but the money would go toward one of the plans 
already proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say if the league is committed to picking one of  
the two ownership groups, indicating there is some trepidation 
among the owners about the warring bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two different ownership groups and two different  
stadium plans,'' he said. ``That's something we've got to work 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion decision likely will spawn a whole new set of  
issues, with realignment at the head of the list. Tagliabue said 
the expansion committee discussed various scenarios Tuesday, using 
both Los Angeles and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Realignment is a hot-button issue in a league where Arizona and  
Dallas are part of the NFC East, Atlanta and Carolina are members 
of the NFC West, and the three teams in Florida are spread over 
three separate divisions in both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, the league's finance committee decided it  
needs more information about an $800 million bid by Howard Milstein 
to purchase the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants to ensure that Milstein is not violating the  
rule against borrowing more than $100 million using the team as 
collateral to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving as promptly as we can. It's important to  
Washington and important to the league,'' Tagliabue said. ``But 
it's not as important that we complete this deal today or tomorrow 
as it is to make the right decision for the next quarter-century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Tagliabue also hopes to have a  
decision by the March meeting on whether Edward DeBartolo Jr., 
owner of the San Francisco 49ers, can resume active control of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo ceded day-to-day control to his sister, Denise  
DeBartolo York, when he was targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud 
probe. He pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a felony 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said the NFL is still committed to having the 2003 Super  
Bowl in San Francisco -- if a new stadium is built to replace 3Com 
Park. That issue will be discussed next month as well, with the 
owners having the option of taking away the title game.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Newspaper Survives Twister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The morning after a tornado devastated  
downtown Clarksville, residents awoke to a stunning sight -- 
uprooted trees, ruined buildings, debris strewn like confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	And newspapers on their doorsteps.  
</P>
<P>
	The twister that touched down just before dawn on Jan. 22 hit  
The Leaf-Chronicle's office head-on, demolishing the newsroom. But 
the staff never skipped a beat, publishing the next day's paper and 
every day since. 
</P>
<P>
	They have moved their offices three times -- from the publisher's  
house to a hotel lobby to an abandoned supermarket, where a neon 
``Fresh!'' sign shines next to The Leaf-Chronicle banner and the 
city editor sits in the ``nuts'' aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper still gets letters thanking the staff for its  
Herculean effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see the newspaper show up (the morning after the tornado)  
and to know that they were still out there, that was wonderful,'' 
said Anthony Golden, a psychology professor at Austin Peay State 
University whose own office was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado cut about a five-mile swath through Clarksville, a  
city of 89,000 on the Kentucky border. The twister touched down 
near the Cumberland River and ripped apart a five-block area in the 
historic downtown, then tore through the center of Austin Peay and 
skipped its way into a residential neighborhood. Incredibly, only 
five people suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Two landmark churches, the huge county courthouse, the city  
museum and dozens of homes and businesses were damaged or 
destroyed. The tornado ripped the ceiling and walls off The 
Leaf-Chronicle's second-story newsroom before the rain came, 
soaking everything inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Photo editor Fred Dye had been up all night working at home when  
the storm hit at 4:15 a.m. His first instinct was to head to the 
paper, so he grabbed a camera and raced downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got there he found another photographer and a security  
guard. In the rainy darkness, they crawled into the newsroom to 
salvage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	They took the computers back to Dye's home, ran an extra phone  
line from his upstairs neighbor's apartment and had photos of the 
tornado damage ready before 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Editorial page editor Alane Megna was at home on the phone with  
the paper's publisher trying to gauge the damage when a TV station 
reported the newspaper building had been destroyed. Her mother saw 
the report and called. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost shouted at the poor woman because she was saying,  
'Well, if the building's gone, you're not going to have a newspaper 
tomorrow.' And I said, 'We will have a newspaper, Mom! I don't know 
how we're going to publish it yet but there will be a 
Leaf-Chronicle tomorrow if I have to take my little printer and 
print it,''' Megna said. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't necessary.  
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Gene Washer put out word that the office would  
relocate to his house and the Kentucky New Era newspaper about 25 
miles north in Hopkinsville, Ky., would lend its presses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, newly hired executive editor Richard Stevens headed to  
Clarksville from his home in Nashville, 40 miles southeast. It was 
his first day of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met most of my staff at 1 p.m. in a parking lot in the  
rain,'' Stevens said, shaking his head in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
	He took about two dozen staffers to Hopkinsville; the rest  
stayed in Clarksville to report on the tornado. Twelve hours after 
Stevens met his staff, the New Era's presses rolled out 32,000 
copies of a 24-page Leaf-Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the night, Washer stood in a parking lot  
watching carriers high-five each other as the papers arrived in 
Clarksville. Then he went home to wait for his own copy to arrive 
in his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, when I took it out, big old tears came down my  
eyes.'' Washer said. ``That was a very emotional moment for me. 
I've been here 36 years and I just couldn't imagine this thing not 
going to press under my watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of Clarksville, Leaf-Chronicle staffers still are  
dealing with the disaster. They continue to work 12-hour days. It 
will be at least six months until their office is rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	The next few weeks may be the toughest, said Mike Jacobs, editor  
of the Grand Forks Herald in Grand Forks, N.D. His paper won the 
1998 Pulitzer Prize for public service after publishing through a 
fire and floods that destroyed its building and much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the initial excitement kept his employees from thinking  
about the devastation, but they eventually had to tally up the 
emotional damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't minimize the loss of the workplace. People spend a  
lot more time awake at work than they do at home,'' Jacobs said. 
``People make their workplace an extension of themselves, and 
that's lost in the disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf-Chronicle copy desk chief Dena Christian waited more than  
two weeks before going back to see the damaged newsroom. She pulled 
a photo of the ruined building out of her purse and pointed out a 
mangled desk she believes was hers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found a coffee cup. That was all I was able to bring back,''  
she said sadly. ``Years of files. I had a lot of personal items ... 
they're gone, gone, gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But something has been gained, Leaf-Chronicle staffers say: a  
new pride in the community and the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very tightknit group before the tornado. But in the  
face of all this adversity and disaster this newspaper has grown by 
leaps and bounds,'' production manager Duke Friedel said. ``We're 
going to be much stronger and much better coming out of this.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Leaders To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is inviting congressional  
leaders to a White House meeting next week in hopes of shifting the 
public focus away from impeachment and onto the year's legislative 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued the invitations on Tuesday. Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., accepted the invitation and 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was also expected to attend, 
spokesmen for the two leaders said. Also invited were House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The session, which may be next Tuesday, is aimed at discussing  
``the agenda for this year,'' said White House spokesman Barry 
Toiv. Republican aides said the meeting could well include 
discussion of the upcoming year's leading domestic issues, such as 
Social Security, tax cuts and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks we can accomplish a lot, and he wants to get off to  
a quick start,'' Toiv said of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting would be the congressional leaders' first  
face-to-face encounter with the president since the Senate voted 
Friday to acquit him of perjury and obstruction of justice charges.

<HEADLINE> TV Under Fire by Advocacy Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If television isn't very good -- and a fair  
number of people are vocal about saying so -- how can it be made 
better? And who defines what better is? 
</P>
<P>
	The debate surrounding two new studies critical of TV  
demonstrates how differently the medium is viewed from different 
perspectives and how complicated any effort to change it is. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that television is  
often irresponsible in its depiction of sex, would like programs to 
be more forthright in featuring such topics as contraception, 
abstinence and safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying television is immoral. ... We're not saying  
get sex off TV,'' said Vicky Rideout, who directed the report for 
the nonprofit foundation that studies health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply saying young people are watching a lot of  
television. TV is an important part of how young people form 
attitudes toward sex,'' Rideout said in releasing findings that 
half of 1,300-plus broadcast and cable shows included sexual 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fraction of programs show the risks or responsibilities  
of sex, the study found -- although TV executives and producers at a 
daylong Kaiser conference insisted they are not derelict. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' they note, has addressed AIDS and teen pregnancy. The WB  
drama ``Felicity'' featured an episode in which its title 
character, a virginal college freshman, learns about condoms from a 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dawson's Creek,'' another popular WB series, includes two  
teen-age characters who abstain from sex (and, for the record, 
others who don't). 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Dawson's a virgin and Joey's a virgin is a big,  
big topic of conversation in high schools across America,'' said WB 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Kellner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parents Television Council, a conservative media watchdog  
group, also believes television is influential. But chairman L. 
Brent Bozell III has a sterner perspective than the Kaiser 
researchers on how that influence is being used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prime-time TV today is infested with raw sexual content,  
filthy language and gratuitous violence. And tens of millions of 
impressionable children every night are being pounded with this 
sewage,'' Bozell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a list of programs deemed ``family-unfriendly,'' the group  
includes ``Spin City'' because it ``condones casual sex and the 
homosexual lifestyle.'' One scene criticized by the group shows an 
unmarried couple having sex, with a condom package visible. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the council would prefer to see less sex  
altogether, and more messages about the value of education, respect 
for authority and the importance of faith. It released a report 
naming companies that sponsor ``family-unfriendly'' shows such as 
``Spin City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But scenes or characters that earn a slap from the Parents  
Television Council might earn praise from other groups trying to 
encourage safe sex or tolerance of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	With pressure from so many groups, and with so many competing  
demands, how are broadcasters to respond? 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine television as the fulcrum of a teeter-totter, with  
advocacy groups, viewers and politicians all piling on to make it 
tilt their way. If the networks deserve any compassion, this could 
be a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Honig, the PTC's executive director, says the group doesn't  
``want a G-rated society. We recognize it's not going to be that 
way. We just want some responsibility in dealing with these 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast television will not go back to the illusory, sexless  
perfection of ``Father Knows Best.'' Audiences and advertisers have 
yet to signal they are fed up with the raciness of many TV comedies 
or dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	And how are networks to go forward?  
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters believe that a schedule full of clean-scrubbed fare  
like ``Touched by an Angel'' or ``7th Heaven'' would limit their 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally unlikely is a programming slate that trades titillation  
for real controversy. A handful of dramas -- ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; 
Order,'' ``NYPD Blue'' -- give thoughtful attention to abortion, 
affirmative action, child abuse and other social issues, but 
networks know they risk stepping on a land mine each time. 
</P>
<P>
	The medium's traditional fear of controversy, stems, of course,  
from its respect for the bottom line. Be too bold, risk losing 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The PTC understands the pressure points. The group slapped six  
major corporations on the wrist last week, stepping up its campaign 
to hold companies responsible for the shows they sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies responded to The Associated Press:  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a very good advertiser in respect to upholding the right  
kind of values,'' said Pillsbury. ``We want to do anything we can 
to support family-friendly programming,'' said Procter &AMP; Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks, of course, acknowledge that sponsors wield a  
certain power. Susanne Daniels, WB's programming head, encouraged 
advocacy groups attending the Kaiser conference to work directly 
with advertisers and help them understand ``the times are 
a-changin.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The times may be, but can television?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Stock Prices Fall in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell slightly Wednesday as  
investors took profits after Tuesday's sharp rise. Many Asian stock 
markets remained closed for the Chinese New Year, while trading was 
quiet in those that were open. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 14,158.67  
points, down 73.97 points, or 0.52 percent. On Wednesday, the 
average gained 177.92 points, or 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling by domestic institutional investors and renewed concerns  
about the health of the Japanese economy drove down share prices, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Wednesday that Japan's NEC  
Corp. is likely to post greater losses for the fiscal year ending 
March 31 than previously forecast, fueling fears that overall 
corporate earnings would be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed really. There aren't that many reasons to  
buy stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``While company earnings may stabilize with the government's  
efforts, there is still no sign of an economic recovery,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar continued a rally against  
the Japanese yen, which began on Tuesday after the Japanese Finance 
Ministry announced it would lower the yields of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 118.62 yen, up 1.62 yen from  
Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.74 yen 
overnight. The New York rate was the highest level for the 
greenback since Dec. 9, when it hit 118.75 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, shares plunged as local retail investors sold  
shares in financial and property stocks on market rumors that 
property company Quality Houses PCL failed to reach an agreement on 
debt restructuring with its lenders and might have to reduce its 
capital. The company later refuted the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index dropped 12.34 points, or  
3.5 percent, to 338.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and  
South Korea were closed for Chinese New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell slightly, with the index dragged  
down by late selling in PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia shares. The JSX 
Composite Index closed down 0.873 point, or 0.2 percent, at 397.975 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares ended nearly flat in thin trading. The  
PSE index fell 0.30 point to 1,918.57. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, led by  
telecommunications stocks and other blue chips such as the banks 
and News Corp. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,882.2, up 0.8 
percent, or 22.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed up, led by market  
bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital 
index closed at 2,183.25 points, up 1.5 percent, or 31.75 points.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Keeps Sunday Baseball Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ESPN has scheduled an entire season of Sunday  
night baseball. Don't count on all the games being shown, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The final three games on ESPN's schedule released Wednesday  
conflict with the cable network's NFL telecasts, raising the 
possibility that baseball will pull those games off ESPN for the 
second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN wants to move the games to ESPN2 to accommodate its $4.8  
billion deal with the NFL. Baseball officials didn't allow that 
move last year and aren't expected to change their stance this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still negotiating. Nothing has been resolved,'' baseball  
spokesman Rich Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	An ESPN spokesman said the network and baseball are in ongoing  
discussions in an attempt to resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's contract with baseball states that games can only be  
moved to ESPN2 with baseball's permission. That condition cannot be 
``unreasonably withheld,'' but baseball officials were unwilling to 
grant that permission last year because they refused to take a back 
seat to another sport during their pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has agreed to move games to ESPN2 in the past, and did  
so last May in order to accommodate the NHL playoffs. But baseball 
wouldn't allow it last September -- ESPN's first with an entire 
season of the NFL -- and gave the rights back to the local 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers missed the night Cal Ripken ended his record consecutive  
games streak at 2,632 games. They also missed one of Mark McGwire's 
contests against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's conflicting games are scheduled for Sept. 12, 19,  
and 26. The games are Milwaukee at Colorado, San Francisco at San 
Diego and Houston at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN is available to about 76 million homes while ESPN2 is  
available in about 63 million.

<HEADLINE> IOC Probe Found No Criminal Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A former federal prosecutor working on the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee's investigation into the Olympics 
bribery scandal said she found no indication of criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	While SLOC, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International  
Olympic Committee all have been conducting separate investigations 
of ethical misconduct, the U.S. Justice Department and Utah 
Attorney General's Office have been looking for criminal 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Wilkinson, a leading attorney on the Justice Department  
team that prosecuted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, said she 
found evidence of ethical lapses, but no breaches of criminal law 
on the part of the bid committee, the predecessor to SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did consider a lot of the criminal theories and I don't see  
criminal conduct,'' Wilkinson said Tuesday. ``Some of their 
activities could be seen as unethical, but that's a long way from 
being criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent SLOC ethics panel last week revealed that  
executives of the Salt Lake bid committee gave more than $1 million 
worth of cash payments, free vacations, living stipends, shopping 
sprees and free medical care to IOC members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The lavish spending occurred before the 1995 IOC vote in  
Budapest giving Salt Lake City the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former executives of the bid committee and later the SLOC  
were blamed by the ethics panel for the excesses. President Tom 
Welch resigned in mid-1997 amid a spousal abuse charge and on Jan. 
8 was stripped of his $500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month 
consulting contract. Senior Vice President Dave Johnson resigned 
under pressure on Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson, who left the Justice Department for a private law  
firm in Washington last September, and her partner, Barry Sanders 
of Los Angeles, were retained by the SLOC in December to conduct 
their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and Wilkinson said their no-crime conclusion pertains  
only to their client, the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Schaffer, the Salt Lake attorney representing Welch, said  
it's clear the SLOC attorneys do not believe Welch committed 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discussed lots of different scenarios with them on several  
occasions and the three of us really couldn't come up anything that 
fit,'' Schaffer said. ``There may be other things that Justice is 
looking at that I'm not aware of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, which has five prosecutors working the  
case, has been guiding the investigation through the FBI office in 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	One former Justice Department official speaking on condition of  
anonymity said Tuesday the high priority given the case may make 
charges more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real incentive when you have that many people  
devoted to not just walk away and say, `No crime,''' the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources familiar with the investigation,  
prosecutors are looking at possible mail or wire fraud; false 
statements or perjury; tax fraud; and violations of customs laws 
that require declaration of sums of $10,000 or more in cash leaving 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel last week said one former bid employee reported  
$30,000 was taken from committee bank accounts to pay for 
legitimate expenses in Budapest in 1995. The panel, which had no 
power to subpoena bank records, could not determine whether that 
amount was taken out of the United States in cash or traveler 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mitt Romney, the new chief executive officer for SLOC, received  
standing ovations when he appeared before the Utah House and 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, hired Thursday to lead the scandal-tainted Olympic  
organization for the next three years, told lawmakers he intends to 
return the games to the athletes and to bring the Olympics in on 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised an aggressive fundraising drive. ``I want money,''  
said the Boston businessman, who plans to ``count on Utah 
businesses to contribute to the games -- big time.'' Sen. Parley 
Hellewell, R-Orem, who runs a plumbing service business, handed 
Romney a crisp $100 bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--Salt Lake bidders paid for ski trips for three USOC members in  
the late 1980s, Howard Peterson, former executive director of the 
U.S. Skiing Association, told USOC's investigating panel. He said 
he identified one of the members and gave information on the other 
two to the USOC investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	--The head of the Dominican Republic's Olympic Committee, Roque  
Napoleon Munoz, denied a newspaper report that he received inflated 
travel expenses from Sweden. He said he was reimbursed for a trip 
he took to Stockholm with his wife to evaluate that city's bid for 
the 2004 Olympics, but said the trip did not cost more than $5,000. 
Swedish documents cited by Stockholm's Dagens Nyheter newspaper 
indicate more than $18,000 was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Christian Rodriguez, secretary general of Chile's Olympic  
committee, submitted his resignation, but denied accusations he 
served as a go-between in gaining favors for expelled Chilean IOC 
member Sergio Santander. 
</P>
<P>
	According to SLOC's ethics report, Rodriguez accompanied  
Santander on a site visit to Utah in 1995 and -- at Santander's 
request -- asked Welch for contributions to Santander's political 
campaign. Rodriguez was managing the campaign. The ethics report 
said Welch contributed $20,050. 
</P>
<P>
	--Primo Nebiolo, president of world track and field, offered  
formal support Tuesday for embattled IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, who has faced numerous calls to resign from outside the 
IOC. He said the Council of the Association of Summer Olympic 
International Federations, over which he presides, ``is convinced 
that Samaranch is exceptionally qualified to navigate the IOC 
through these troubled waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time like this when strength, wisdom and determination  
are absolutely necessary to reinforce faith in the Olympic 
Movement, his experience and leadership cannot be questioned,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has faced numerous calls to resign from outside the  
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--Less than a quarter of Olympic bidders responded to the IOC's  
request for information on rule-breaking behavior by its members, 
the committee said. It said replies were received from 11 cities, 
while two other national Olympic committees were given more time to 
file their reports. Details of the replies were not disclosed and 
the groups granted extensions were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	--With sponsors skittish over the bribery scandal, organizers of  
the Sydney Games were urged by an IOC executive Tuesday to plow a 
$66 million profit-sharing deal back into the budget. ``You would 
solve the financing issue in a stroke of a pen,'' IOC marketing 
director Michael Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Sydney about $130 million short of its target for  
sponsorship revenues, Payne said the controversial profit deal 
should be reviewed. He said the IOC warned the Australians three 
years ago against projecting a surplus for the games. Sydney 
organizers have predicted a $17.7 million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the IOC's contract with Olympic cities, 90  
percent of any surplus goes to the host country and 10 percent to 
the IOC. Of the 90 percent set aside for the host country, 10 
percent goes to the national Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Olympics Minister Michael Knight suggested for the  
first time that the Olympics could get by without the extra 
sponsorship revenue. ``You can run a pretty fantastic Olympic Games 
on $2.4 billion (Australian),'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NC State's Inge Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Kenny Inge, North Carolina State's  
leading rebounder and second-leading scorer, was suspended 
indefinitely Wednesday and did not make the trip for the game at 
No. 14 North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Herb Sendek said Inge was suspended for ``attitude  
inconsistent with the mission of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolfpack lost 62-53 with Ron Kelley, Inge's replacement,  
leading the team with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that it serves anyone going into a lot of  
detail,'' Sendek said when asked about Inge's status. ``In a 
nutshell, it was an attitude and disposition not consistent with 
our team's mission -- period. No other decisions have been made 
beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sendek said Inge practiced with the team Monday and Tuesday, but  
would not participate in any basketball activities until further 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the team (Wednesday afternoon) and at least to me there  
was no reaction. Nobody said anything,'' Sendek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Inge, who averages 12.1 points and 6.4 rebounds,  
did not play the final 6:49 of regulation and the overtime in an 
82-79 at Virginia on Sunday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Boston Accused in Housing Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government accused Boston housing  
officials Wednesday of ignoring complaints that whites opposed to 
integration harassed minority tenants with such tactics as beating 
children and placing human waste outside apartment doors. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against the Boston Housing Authority constitute the  
first time that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has 
accused a city housing authority of a pattern of ``systematic 
discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Housing discrimination is an ugly part of our nation's past  
that has no place in America today,'' Housing Secretary Andrew 
Cuomo said in announcing the charges stemming from a three-year 
investigation of alleged racial and ethnic and ethnic harassment in 
the Bunker Hill and Old Colony public housing developments from 
1992 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Both housing developments, located in predominantly white areas  
of Boston, had been targets of integration efforts by public 
housing officials since the late 1980s, Cuomo said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine minority families with a total of 25 children complained  
they were harassed by whites opposed to the integration. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the families appeared at the news conference and weren't  
identified by HUD officials. But Cuomo said the harassment included 
beating minority children, placing human waste outside apartment 
doors, firing a BB gun into a child's bedroom, breaking car 
windows, slashing tires, setting fires outside one resident's 
apartment and verbal and written ethnic and racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Housing Authority failed to take action to protect  
the families and also failed to transfer the victims to safer 
developments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Housing Authority Administrator Sandra B. Henriquez  
declined to comment on the allegations but said in a faxed letter 
that the Boston authority has shown a ``commitment to fair housing 
and civil rights'' since launching a Civil Rights Protection Plan 
in June 1996 to address racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, which wasn't in place during the time of the  
harassment charges, police coverage at public housing developments 
was increased, tighter new tenant transfer policies were adopted 
and a new 24-hour harassment hot line was established to report 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said his department is conducting a 30-day review of  
whether Boston housing officials have properly implemented the 1996 
plan. A HUD special counsel will recommend to Cuomo whether 
additional sanctions against the Boston authority, ranging from 
withholding or reducing federal funding to monitoring and providing 
technical assistance, are needed.

<HEADLINE> Valdez Skipper To Begin Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- The former skipper of the Exxon Valdez  
will finally begin tidying up Anchorage as punishment for his role 
in one of the nation's worst environmental disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Hazelwood will don a reflective vest this summer and join  
a 10-member city crew that picks up litter along highways and from 
area parks, Fred Fulgencio, community service supervisor for 
Anchorage, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As captain of the Exxon Valdez, Hazelwood ordered the 984-foot  
tanker to shift position to avoid icebergs in the shipping lanes of 
Valdez Arm on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood then went below to his cabin, leaving 3rd Mate Gregory  
Cousins in control of the vessel. Cousins ran the vessel onto Bligh 
Reef just after midnight, spilling about 11 million gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood was found guilty in 1990 of a misdemeanor count of  
negligent discharge of oil. A jury acquitted him of felony criminal 
mischief and two other misdemeanors -- reckless endangerment and 
operating a vessel while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Karl Johnstone had ordered Hazelwood to perform 1,000  
hours of community service and said some of that time should be 
spent cleaning rocks oiled by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence remained on hold during eight years of appeals.  
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood's lawyers had asked that he be allowed to serve his  
community service in his home state of New York. An Alaska court 
refused but agreed in November to let Hazelwood serve 200 hours of 
community service a year over the next five-year period, spending 
one month each summer tidying up Anchorage through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to clean up spilled oil in Prince William Sound ended in  
the early 1990s. Tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals were 
killed by the oil that polluted more than a thousand miles of 
Alaska shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood lost his job with Exxon following the wreck. Since  
1992, he has worked as a claims adjuster for a New York City law 
firm.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Veterans Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after appearing in the Super Bowl, Steve  
Atwater and Cornelius Bennett were released by their NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, who played in five Super Bowls and eight Pro Bowls, was  
not stunned by being cut. At 32, he was replaced on passing downs 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is a big shock to me,'' said Atwater, one  
of the best tacklers at safety in the game. ``When they were taking 
me out of games, that said something right there. They had needs to 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing but great things to say about my time in  
Denver. It was 10 great seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater was released one day after Denver signed cornerback Dale  
Carter to a six-year, $38 million contract with an $8 million 
bonus. Denver needed salary cap room and cut Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a No. 1 pick of the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992, made  
four straight Pro Bowls (1994-97) and is expected to start in place 
of cornerback Darrien Gordon, in whom the Chiefs have showed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we're very serious about a three-peat,''  
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said of the acquisition of Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have one of the best tandems in the league,''  
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said of Carter and Ray Crockett. 
``You can't believe what that does for a defense when you have two 
corners like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who played linebacker for the Buffalo Bills in all four  
of their Super Bowl defeats in the early 1990s, helped Atlanta get 
to the NFL title game in January. The Falcons lost to Denver 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Pro Bowler led the Falcons in tackles, but he is  
33 and would earn $3.7 million for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also want to make room for last year's top draft  
pick, Keith Brooking, who played regularly in passing situations at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also released offensive lineman Dave Widell and saw  
safety Devin Bush sign a four-year contract with the St. Louis 
Rams. Bush was a first-round selection in 1995 and started 36 games 
in his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Another veteran looking for work is wide receiver Chris  
Calloway, who was cut by the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my two years here, this was the toughest move I've had to  
make,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``We've improved the quality 
and the depth at the receiving position. That, along with the 
salary cap, forced us to go in this direction. Chris is a true 
professional and I wish him nothing but the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway, 30, would have earned just over $1 million this  
season, including a $500,000 roster bonus due on March 1. A starter 
since 1993, Calloway had 62 receptions for 812 yards and six 
touchdowns this season, all team highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had a good career with the Giants,'' Calloway said. ``I  
appreciate my time here and the opportunity the organization gave 
me to play. I hope to continue to play somewhere this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Middle linebacker Corey Widmer will be back with the Giants  
after signing an $11.2 million, four-year deal. Widmer became a 
starter in 1996 and last season he finished with 85 tackles, a 
fumble recovery and five passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important to me to stay here,'' said Widmer, a  
seventh round draft choice in 1992. ``It meant a lot that I can 
stay here and continue my relationship with this organization and 
its fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One quarterback he might face in the NFC East is Doug Pederson,  
who joined Philadelphia for $4.5 million over three years. Pederson 
was Brett Favre's backup in Green Bay and worked with Eagles coach 
Andy Reid, who was quarterbacks coach for the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, 31, has never started an NFL game and has thrown just  
32 regular-season passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step,'' said Pederson, who joins a team that used  
three quarterbacks last season -- Koy Detmer, Rodney Peete and Bobby 
Hoying. ``You can't turn away from that. But I'm ready. I'm willing 
to take that step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Clyde Simmons, whose 114 career sacks are 10th in  
NFL history, signed a two-year, $4 million deal with Chicago. 
Simmons, 35, started all 16 games for the Cincinnati Bengals in 
1998 and finished with five sacks, second-best on the team, and 30 
tackles. He made the Pro Bowl twice with Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> LA Expected To Host DNC Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee has begun  
``intensified discussions'' with Los Angeles for hosting the 
party's 2000 presidential convention, a party spokeswoman said 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Party sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested  
that Los Angeles was all but certain to get the nod. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino was told in a telephone call  
Wednesday from Joe Andrew, head of the party's site selection team, 
that the convention contract had been offered to Los Angeles, said 
Menino's spokeswoman, Jacque Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the selection process, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said Los Angeles officials had been given a draft 
contract for the convention. But party and city officials were 
still negotiating terms ``almost line by line,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic National Committee has not made a final  
decision on the city to host the 2000 Democratic National 
Convention,'' DNC spokeswoman Melissa Bonney Ratcliff said 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have intensified discussions with Los Angeles  
recently, nothing has been finalized,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks senior Democratic officials have been looking to Los  
Angeles to host the party's next convention. But they have 
maintained Boston and Denver as options in case the party in Los 
Angeles can't resolve differences on money and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the situation said that while Los Angeles  
has inched closer to formally being awarded the convention, it's 
still not a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNC hopes to make a formal, public announcement in early  
March,'' Ratcliff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before receiving the phone call from Andrew, Menino had told a  
Boston press conference he was confident that the DNC was going 
with Los Angeles -- and the state's 54 electoral votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a secret anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grossman, outgoing chairman of the DNC, said no final  
decision had been made. But he said Los Angeles is ``perhaps the 
clear front-runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said he was heartened by  
reports in the Boston media that Boston was out of contention. But 
both he and the city's chief negotiator said they have not been 
told of a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be optimistic,'' said Lucy McCoy, director of  
the Los Angeles host committee. ``We're negotiating, and the DNC is 
negotiating with Denver and Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans decided last month to hold their 2000 convention in  
Philadelphia. Indianapolis, New Orleans, New York and San Antonio 
had also sought to host the GOP convention.

<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Johnny Cash  
</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* Johnny Cash is the Man in Black, the patriarch of  
country music with a 45-year career as the troubadour of the 
outsider etched into his granite face. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Cash was born Feb. 26, 1932, in a three-room  
railroad shack near Kingsland, Ark. Under a New Deal program, the 
Cash family relocated to northeastern Arkansas in 1935, where Cash 
worked as a child laborer on his dad's cotton farm. 
</P>
<P>
	After a hitch in the Air Force -- he spent much of his time in  
Germany, where he learned to play guitar and write songs -- Cash 
moved to Memphis, Tenn., where he won a contract with Sun Records 
in 1955. Cash later moved to Columbia Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Through more than four decades of troubles, triumphs and varying  
degrees of commercial success, Cash has consistently toured and 
recorded music. He has sold more than 50 million records. His list 
of country and pop hits includes ``Folsom Prison Blues,'' ``I Walk 
the Line, ``Ring of Fire'' and ``A Boy Named Sue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his career, Cash scored rock 'n' roll hits like  
``Ballad of a Teenage Queen,'' and was known as an 
amphetamine-addicted hell-raiser who tore up hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s and '70s, he became a country music superstar,  
blending folk music, country and gospel into a unique stew. ``The 
Johnny Cash Show'' aired on ABC from 1969-71, one of the first 
network variety shows with a country music performer as host. 
</P>
<P>
	His country music popularity faded in the 1980s, but in recent  
years a younger generation discovered him and gave his career new 
life. His audience these days includes senior citizens and people 
in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and  
the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1997 concert in Flint, Mich., Cash announced that he has  
Parkinson's disease, which attacks the nervous system. It can cause 
blackouts, tremors and stiff muscles that restrict mobility.

<HEADLINE> Counts Dropped in Whites-Only Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed weapons  
and robbery charges against two men accused of plotting to set up a 
whites-only nation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele's ruling Wednesday doesn't  
affect the murder and conspiracy charges against Chevie Kehoe and 
Daniel Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee, both 24, are charged with murder in the 1996  
killings of William and Nancy Mueller and her 8-year-old daughter, 
Sarah Powell. Their bodies were found in the Illinois Bayou near 
Russellville. 
</P>
<P>
	They had also been charged in a grand jury indictment with  
conspiring to rob the Muellers in January 1996, and with use of 
firearms in the robbery conspiracy. Those charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors had asked last week that those charges be  
dropped. Their reasons were not immediately clear -- Eisele has 
issued a gag order barring attorneys from discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe, of Colville, Wash., and Lee, of Yukon, Okla., were  
indicted in December, along with Kehoe's father, Kirby Kehoe, 50, 
of Yaak, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Kehoe on Feb. 8 pleaded guilty to a federal  
racketeering charge, and the government agreed to drop other 
charges against him. His plea agreement has been sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee are scheduled for trial March 1. The government is  
seeking the death penalty for both men. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kehoe family first drew national attention when Chevie and a  
brother, Cheyne, were accused of firing at police in Ohio last 
February. The exchange was captured on videotape and broadcast 
nationally.

<HEADLINE> Questions Abound for Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pitchers and catchers begin showing up  
Thursday at the Pittsburgh Pirates' spring training camp, at least 
those who aren't there already. The big question is: Which position 
players will arrive next week? 
</P>
<P>
	With general manager Cam Bonifay clearly interested in dealing  
outfielder Al Martin and second baseman Tony Womack, a once-settled 
Pirates' lineup may undergo additional tinkering before the full 
squad reports next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But will those changes come now, in a few weeks or just before  
the April 5 opener against Montreal? 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay is refusing to comment about some possible changes, but  
has said repeatedly, ``You're always looking to make your ballclub 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed trade with Arizona involving Martin and Womack and  
the Diamondbacks' Bernard Gilkey still was on a very tentative hold 
Wednesday, partly because free agent infielder Pat Meares had not 
accepted the Pirates' $1.5 million, one-year offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still talking to a number of clubs,'' said Steve Comte,  
Meares' agent. ``We're still trying to do what's best for Pat. Cam 
is pushing to get something done, but we've got to do what's best 
for Pat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates want Meares to play shortstop partly so they can  
move Mike Benjamin to his preferred position of second base until 
rookie Warren Morris is ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares reportedly has a $750,000, one-year offer from the  
Anaheim Angels, but he prefers a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody would prefer a multiyear contract, sure, in a  
perfect world, but we're far from being in a perfect world,'' Comte 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Meares doesn't show up at the Pirates' camp in  
Bradenton, Fla., a number of players already are there, even though 
pitchers and catchers aren't due until Thursday and position 
players aren't due until Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Schmidt, Jason Christiansen, Pete Schourek, Todd Van  
Poppel are among those who have been working out at camp all week, 
and first baseman Kevin Young arrived late last week. Also in camp: 
Womack, who said he is focused only on getting ready for the season 
despite the swirling trade rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the full squad shows up, Bonifay and manager Gene Lamont  
will begin answering a number of still-puzzling questions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Can the Pirates sign Young, their most efficient run producer  
the last two seasons? 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he won't extend contract talks past the first day of  
camp, but the two sides currently are far apart. The Pirates 
offered $16.5 million over three years; Young wants nearly $30 
million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want Brian Jordan money, but I would like to be paid  
like Jose Offerman,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan recently left St. Louis to sign a $40 million, five-year  
contract with Atlanta. Offerman agreed to a $26 million, four-year 
deal with Boston that some baseball executives assailed as being 
just as exorbitant as Kevin Brown's $105 million, seven-year 
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Where will Al Martin play? In Arizona? In Los Angeles? And, if  
he remains with the Pirates, where does he play in Pittsburgh? 
</P>
<P>
	He is penciled in as the fourth outfielder behind Brian Giles,  
Brant Brown and Jose Guillen but, as Young said, it is difficult to 
imagine Martin not being in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	--Will Lamont carry 12 pitchers or 11?  
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have stayed with a 12-man staff the last two seasons  
but, now that the pitching staff has begun to mature, may carry 
only 11. That means that either left-hander Jeff Wallace, coming 
off elbow surgery, or Rule 5 draft pick Scott Sauerbeck might not 
make the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can Morris win the second base job?  
</P>
<P>
	If Womack leaves, the Pirates will give a much longer look to  
Morris, the former Texas Rangers farmhand who excelled last year in 
Double-A. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can Chris Peters pitch like he did in the second half of last  
season? Lamont has said he regrets not moving Peters into the 
rotation until July. Now, Peters (8-10, 3.47 ERA) must pitch well 
enough to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
	--Is Chad Hermansen the real deal? Is Kris Benson really a  
disappointment? 
</P>
<P>
	No two minor leaguers will be followed as closely in camp as  
Hermansen, who has hit at every level of the minors but has fielded 
well at none, and Benson, the top pick in the 1996 draft, who still 
has not lived up to expectations.

<HEADLINE> Woods-Duval Rivalry Seems Natural  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They're a study in contrasts, Tiger Woods  
with his wraparound smile and outgoing personality, and David Duval 
with his wraparound sunglasses and introverted manner. 
</P>
<P>
	They also have a lot in common, and not just their ability to  
strike a golf ball perhaps as well as anyone ever has. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're killers in the competitive sense. They go out there  
and try to dominate,'' Ben Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	A student and an ambassador of the game as well as the winner of  
two Masters and 17 other tour titles, the 47-year-old Crenshaw is 
awed by Woods, 23, and Duval, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger is doing an incredible job of concentrating, considering  
everything he goes through,'' said Crenshaw, alluding to the 
demands on Woods' time and the circus-type atmosphere when he's on 
the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He puts up with so much and so much is expected of him.  
Because of how he can play, people expect him to win every 
tournament. That, of course, is impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw is similarly impressed by Duval, who rarely shows much  
emotion whether he's playing well or playing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	``David's one of those fellows that nothing bothers. He does a  
beautiful job of putting it behind him when he hits a bad a shot or 
something goes wrong,'' Crenshaw said. ``That's really hard for 
most of us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Woods and Duval at the top of their games and the top of  
the game as well, it would seem that a natural rivalry, like the 
one between Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus some 30 years ago, is 
being born. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw hopes so.  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't do anything but help golf,'' he said. ``They're both  
incredible players and I think they're going to push each other to 
be even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great for the sport, great for the people who  
follow the game. They're both so good. Both of them can do so many 
different things it's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods also thinks a perceived rivalry between the two would give  
golf a boost, but he doubts it will occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great for him and me,'' Woods said. ``(But) I  
don't see that happening because there are just too many good 
players out here. It's not just a handful of guys who can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the top handful may have trouble keeping up with Woods and  
Duval, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods won for the first time in nine months last weekend at San  
Diego, when he shot a course-record 62 to come from far behind on 
Saturday, then shot a 65 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who skipped that tournament to take another ski trip, has  
won twice this year and nine times in his last 30 starts. He began 
1999 with a runaway win in the season-opening Mercedes 
Championships. Then he charged into the record book with his 
victory at La Quinta, Calif. last month, shooting a 59 that was the 
lowest closing round and matched the lowest 18-hole score in PGA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods edged Duval after Wednesday's pro-am in the Nissan Open;  
they finished their rounds about the same time, and Woods made it 
to the press tent first for interviews. Duval then declined to come 
to the interview room as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 *DIVOTS:* Woods played with the pros for the first time in the event  
at Riviera Country Club in 1992, when he was 16. He missed the cut 
with cards of 72-74. ``I remember being real nervous. I got a 
chance to experience it, though, and see what I needed to compete 
on that level,'' he said. ... Woods finished second in the Nissan 
last year, losing to Billy Mayfair in a playoff. ... Crenshaw, 
captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, called Duval immediately after 
Duval shot 59 on the final day of the Bob Hope Classic. ``I knew he 
was going skiing so I told him to be careful,'' said Crenshaw, who 
wants a healthy Duval on the team. ... John Daly withdrew from the 
Nissan early in the week to visit his parents in Arkansas. Tom 
Lehman, coming back from shoulder surgery, also withdrew. ... The 
tournament is back at Riviera after being played last year at 
Valencia Country Club while Riviera was being prepared for the 
Senior Open.

<HEADLINE> Royals Sign Holdout Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Pitcher Jeff Austin, the last  
first-round pick from the 1998 amateur draft to sign, agreed 
Wednesday to join the Kansas City Royals for a signing bonus worth 
about $2.55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the fourth pick overall in the draft, had held out and  
threatened to return to Stanford for the semester that starts next 
month. The Royals had until the end of May to sign him or they 
would have lost his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started throwing again when the weather warmed up and have  
been working very hard lately,'' Austin said. ``I think I'm in 
pretty good shape right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was selected Player of the Year by  
Baseball America after his junior season at Stanford. He is known 
for his breaking ball and his control, striking out 136 and walking 
just 32 last season while going 12-4 with a 3.11 ERA and eight 
complete games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is a quality person and a quality pitcher -- one that has  
the potential to help us for a number of years,'' general manager 
Herk Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make every effort to sign the players that we  
select,'' Robinson said. ``With those picks and with the success 
we've enjoyed in our last couple of drafts, we are putting together 
a strong nucleus of young talent to take us into the next decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin will report to spring training Sunday with 36 other  
pitchers. The Royals held out the possibility that he would play in 
the majors this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two, possibly three starting jobs open,'' manager  
Tony Muser said. ``These are jobs somebody can win.''

<HEADLINE> Tech Firms To Fight Movie Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Five major technology firms are combining their  
efforts to develop ways to prevent illegal copying of digital 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM Corp. and four Japanese electronics makers -- Hitachi Ltd.,  
NEC Corp., Sony Corp. and Pioneer Electronics Corp. -- said Tuesday 
they will together develop technology to ensure that people 
watching digital movies over satellite services, cable networks and 
the Internet can't make copies without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies hope to have electronic watermarking technology  
put into digital video disk players and recorders by the end of the 
year. Eventually, high-definition TV sets, persnal computers and 
digital video cassette recorders would be equipped with the 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital movie effort comes as the music industry is battling  
increasingly popular technology that lets people make illegal

<HEADLINE> Picks for Winners at Grammy Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This could be the year that critics and the  
Grammy Awards find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The music awards show, frequently maligned for being years  
behind popular tastes, gave the most nominations this year to 
hip-hop star Lauryn Hill, who critics agree put out one of 1998's 
best albums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' will compete for album of  
the year, and the Fugees front woman also has the chance to win 
best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe there's hope for the Grammys yet. Bob Dylan took the  
honors last year for a critically acclaimed album, so the National 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is moving in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners and losers become clear Wednesday night when the Grammys  
are awarded in a televised show from the Shrine Auditorium in Los 
Angeles beginning at 8 p.m. on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Our handicapping of the top Grammy races:  
</P>
<P>
                         	RECORD OF THE YEAR   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``The Boy Is Mine,'' Brandy &AMP; Monica; ``My Heart Will  
Go On,'' Celine Dion; ``Iris,'' Goo Goo Dolls; ``Ray of Light,'' 
Madonna; ``You're Still the One,'' Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Twain. If this were February 1998, no one  
would bet against ``My Heart Will Go On,'' since the song was 
everywhere. But a lot of time has passed, and ``Titanic'' fever has 
cooled. ``The Boy Is Mine'' and ``You're Still the One'' were the 
two most unavoidable songs of last summer. Twain's song has a 
steel-reinforced hook and effortlessly bridges country and pop; 
she's our bet for an upset win. 
</P>
<P>
                         	ALBUM OF THE YEAR   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``The Globe Sessions,'' Sheryl Crow; ``Version 2.0,''  
Garbage; ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' Lauryn Hill; ``Ray of 
Light,'' Madonna; ``Come on Over,'' Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Hill. Interesting that the Grammys have  
suddenly discovered Madonna, someone they probably wished had gone 
away 10 years ago. Both she and Hill expertly blended two musical 
forms and gave them their own style -- Madonna with electronica and 
pop, Hill with rap and soul. Hill's album was more successful, so 
that gives her the edge. 
</P>
<P>
                          	SONG OF THE YEAR   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,'' Diane Warren;  
``Iris,'' John Rzeznik; ``Lean on Me,'' Kirk Franklin; ``My Heart 
Will Go On,'' James Horner &AMP; Will Jennings; ``You're Still the 
One,'' Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange and Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: The husband and wife team of Lange and Twain.  
Voters tend to double up on record and song of the year winners, so 
we'll bet on a Twain sweep. Warren is a made-for-Grammy songwriter 
but she hasn't broken through yet. This Aerosmith recording will 
keep her waiting. 
</P>
<P>
                            	NEW ARTIST   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: Backstreet Boys; Andrea Bocelli; Dixie Chicks; Lauryn  
Hill; Natalie Imbruglia. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Hill, in a close competition. Bocelli will  
have a lot of support, at least from women. The Backstreet Boys are 
very popular, but not many teen-age girls are voting. Imbruglia 
could win, but no lip gloss salespeople are voting. 
</P>
<P>
                    	FEMALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``My Favorite Mistake,'' Sheryl Crow; ``My Heart Will  
Go On,'' Celine Dion; ``Can't Take My Eyes Off of You,'' Lauryn 
Hill; ``Torn,'' Natalie Imbruglia; ``Adia,'' Sarah McLachlan. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Dion. She has to win something for all that  
emoting, doesn't she? 
</P>
<P>
                     	MALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``Save Tonight,'' Eagle-Eye Cherry; ``My Father's  
Eyes,'' Eric Clapton; ``Anytime,'' Brian McKnight; ``Lullaby,'' 
Shawn Mullins; ``You Were Meant for Me,'' Sting. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Clapton. Can you really see anyone else  
taking this? The sympathy vote will be overwhelming. We do like 
``Save Tonight,'' though. And it would be fun to hear someone say, 
``the Grammy goes to Eagle-Eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
                    	MALE ROCK VOCAL PERFORMANCE   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``Everybody Here Wants You,'' Jeff Buckley; ``Almost  
Saturday Night,'' John Fogerty; ``Have a Little Faith in Me,'' John 
Hiatt; ``Fly Away,'' Lenny Kravitz; ``Your Life Is Now,'' John 
Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Kravitz. It's an interesting competition,  
between a posthumous release (Buckley), a song nearly three decades 
old (Fogerty), a song 12 years old (Hiatt), and an artist the 
industry seems to have forgotten (Mellencamp). Kravitz wins by 
process of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
                            	ROCK SONG   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``Bitter Sweet Symphony,'' Richard Ashcroft, Mick  
Jagger and Keith Richards; ``Celebrity Skin,'' Billy Corgan, Eric 
Erlandson and Courtney Love; ``Closing Time,'' Dan Wilson; ``Have a 
Little Faith in Me,'' John Hiatt; ``Uninvited,'' Alanis Morissette. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Morissette. Here's the category most likely  
to provoke a brawl at the awards ceremony. Ashcroft was forced to 
add Jagger and Richards to the credits under threat of a lawsuit 
after sampling a snippet of their past work, and Love and Corgan 
have been sniping over how much the Smashing Pumpkins leader 
contributed to Hole's album. Fight, fight, fight! 
</P>
<P>
                      	CONTEMPORARY FOLK ALBUM   	
</P>
<P>
	--Nominees: ``Mermaid Avenue,'' Billy Bragg and Wilco; ``El  
Corazon,'' Steve Earle; ``Spyboy,'' Emmylou Harris; ``Step Inside 
This House,'' Lyle Lovett; ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' Lucinda 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner is: Williams. This is one of the best collection  
of nominees in any category, in any year. Too bad they can't all go 
home with a trophy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With impeachment behind him and the  
Republican-controlled Congress in recess, President Clinton is 
hoping this week to gain the upper hand in the debate over how to 
divide the federal budget surplus while saving Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign gears up today with satellite-linked town hall  
meetings aimed at selling young people on the president's plan to 
shore up the retirement system and Medicare. Clinton goes to New 
Hampshire on Thursday to talk about tax credit proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say they want to sharpen the  
distinctions between the president's insistence on dealing with 
Social Security before trimming taxes and the Republicans' emphasis 
on across-the-board tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart,  
is between ``progressive tax cuts that are targeted for those who 
need them most as opposed to an across-the-board tax cut that does 
nothing to help save Medicare and provides only modest benefits to 
middle-income Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office today projected that  
Clinton's plan could lead to roughly $800 billion in budget 
deficits by 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials in the past have taken issue with the  
CBO's analysis on Social Security, but Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., 
called the estimates proof that ``the president's approach to 
Social Security reform is to resurrect the days of deficit 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some authorities contend the surest way to shore up  
Social Security is to raise taxes and reduce benefits, Clinton 
adviser Paul Begala said today that such unpopular actions are 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the surplus, we are not now at a time when we need deep  
and drastic cuts in Social Security,'' Begala said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' ``So we can take that surplus and invest in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have agreed in principle with Clinton's call to  
devote 62 percent of the anticipated budget surpluses to shoring up 
the Social Security system over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on Clinton's proposal to dedicate 15  
percent of the surplus to Medicare, and Republicans have roundly 
criticized a proposal to use another 11 percent to establish 
401(k)-style accounts for working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other  
GOP lawmakers presided over the first in a series of small town 
meetings Monday to build support for their proposal to cut taxes by 
$743 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty-two percent should be set aside to save Social  
Security,'' said Republican National Committee spokesman Tom Yu. 
``The rest should go back to the taxpayer. It's an overpayment in 
taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, makes his pitch via satellite today to 
41 college campuses in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to convince students, and Congress, that fixing the  
retirement system now is the best plan for their future. ``Then 
it's a debate over how do you do tax cuts,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of slashing taxes across the board, Clinton wants to  
target tax cuts where he believes they are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly proposed retirement funds, called Universal Savings  
Accounts, would target tax credits to low- and middle-income 
working Americans who choose to save more for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the key political battleground of New Hampshire on Thursday,  
Clinton plans to focus on his proposed $1,000 tax credit on helping 
families cope with the burdens of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would provide up to $500 in tax credits for  
stay-at-home parents caring for children under age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu said Republicans weren't worried about Clinton stealing the  
spotlight while lawmakers were on a recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many members of Congress and senators are going to be holding  
town hall meetings and listening to their constituents during the 
recess,'' Yu said. ``They're not taking the day off by any means.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Urged To Reassure About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The customer is clearly distraught as he  
approaches the teller's window. ``What happens if the bank's 
computers go haywire on New Year's Eve?'' he wails. ``Will I lose 
all my money?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such scenarios are being played out in banks and thrifts across  
the country -- on videotape. Bank managers are using role playing 
and other training techniques to prepare tellers and other 
employees for the onslaught of customers' nervous questions on the 
Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers have been telling people not to panic, trying to  
counteract doomsday scenarios of millions of Americans draining 
their bank accounts this year. ATM machines, credit cards, checks 
and banking services will be functioning normally, industry 
officials have promised. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of federal bank regulatory agencies issued guidelines  
Wednesday to help banks and other financial institutions get that 
message to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The institutions ``can address customer expectations by  
underscoring that maintaining customer confidence in the financial 
services system -- now and after the Year 2000 -- is a top priority 
of the institution and its senior management,'' said the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, S&AMP;Ls and credit unions need to make clear to customers  
what they are doing to ensure that people have access to their 
money and continue to receive accurate information on their 
accounts, the government group said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the effort could include training of tellers and other  
employees to answer customers' questions, brochures on Year 2000 
issues, toll-free ``hot lines'' that customers can call, and Year 
2000 seminars and Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also suggested that financial institutions point out  
to customers that the Year 2000 date change will not affect their 
$100,000 federal deposit insurance coverage on each account. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are doing this already and are certainly concerned about  
getting their message out,'' said John Hall, a spokesman for the 
American Bankers Association, the industry's biggest trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the bulk of technical Year 2000 problems have been  
solved, Hall said, ``We recognize it's a communication problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem reflects programming in many older  
computers that recognizes just the last two digits of a year in 
reading a date. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely to 
interpret Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1, 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry is spending more than $8 billion to retool  
its computer systems, which are being tested this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials also have warned that withdrawing massive  
amounts of cash from their accounts could make consumers vulnerable 
to being robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has ordered an additional $50 billion of new  
currency to be put into circulation in the event people make a run 
on banks and automated teller machines late in the year. Fed 
governors have assured Congress there will be sufficient cash 
available to the system to cover a wave of bank withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, $200 billion in currency will be stored in  
government vaults, up from the $150 billion normally held in 
reserve. That's in addition to the $460 billion in notes 
circulating in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of a Senate committee on  
Year 2000 problems, has said the financial services sector -- 
including the banking and securities industries -- appears to be 
``in the best shape'' of all the seven priority areas he has 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council is  
comprised of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., the National Credit Union Administration, the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift 
Supervision.

<HEADLINE> Milken Company Buys Consulting Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A company co-founded by former junk bond king  
Michael Milken has acquired Lexecon Inc., a legal and economics 
consulting firm that specializes in supplying expert witnesses in 
high-stakes corporate lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextera Enterprises Inc., a unit of Milken's Knowledge Universe  
LLC, acquired Lexecon for nearly $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, made public in a filing with the Securities  
Exchange Commission on Jan. 21, marks the latest expansion of 
Knowledge Universe, a company founded in 1997 by Milken, his 
brother Lowell Milken, and Oracle Corp. chairman and chief 
executive officer Lawrence J. Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was mentioned in a January update of a prospectus filed  
by Nextera in preparation for an initial public stock offering. 
Officials with the two companies said they could not comment on the 
deal because of the pending offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospectus lists the Milken brothers and Ellison as the sole  
directors of Knowledge Universe, which holds a majority of 
Nextera's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In its prospectus, Nextera, based in Lexington, Mass., said it  
planned to raise $87 million through its stock offering. The date 
has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospectus said Nextera paid $31 million in cash and 2.8  
billion shares of stock for Lexecon. The document does not put a 
value on Nextera stock, but it estimates the total value of assets 
acquired in the deal at $58.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Lexecon's principals include Daniel Fischel, dean  
of the University of Chicago and author of a book defending Milken, 
who was served two years in prison and paid more than $1 billion in 
fines after pleading guilty in 1990 in connection with a vast 
insider trading scandal. He has been on probation since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexecon's roster of witnesses has included economist Merton  
Miller, who in 1990 shared a Nobel prize with Harry M. Markowitz 
and William F. Sharpe for their pioneering work in the theory of 
financial economics.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Wants Shooting Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson asked state  
officials to press for a federal investigation into the police 
shooting of Tyisha Miller, a black teen killed as she sat 
unresponsive in her car. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller, 19, was shot a dozen times by four officers on Dec.  
28. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers called to the scene by relatives said they found Ms.  
Miller sitting in her Nissan Sentra at a gas station parking lot, a 
gun in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the officers -- three white and one Hispanic -- said  
Ms. Miller fired at them with the handgun, but later said she 
grabbed at the gun after an officer broke a window. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will our skin color be a bait or a magnet for police crime? We  
must end the violence,'' Jackson said at a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You turn to police and you call them for help and help comes  
firing bullets. That's like death squads. That's like tyranny. 
People deserve better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The county district attorney's office is conducting a grand jury  
investigation to determine whether charges should be filed against 
the officers, who are on paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is making a preliminary inquiry to determine whether  
there should be a full civil rights investigation, said U.S. 
Attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson met Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis, asking him to urge  
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Ms. Miller's death.

<HEADLINE> Hoyts Cinema May Sell U.S. Screens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Hoyts Cinema Group Ltd. has hired an  
investment banker to handle the possible sale of its 965 screens in 
the United States, or any potential merger or acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is scheduled to release its half-year earnings next  
week, and a spokesman said until then it would not comment further 
on its retention of B.T. Wolfensohn, part of Bankers Trust, to 
handle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyts operates 965 cinema screens at 120 U.S. sites, up from 634  
screens at 93 sites three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a large amount of actual and rumored corporate  
activity in the U.S. cinema of late,'' Hoyts chief executive 
officer Peter Ivany said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consequently, we thought it incumbent on us that we are fully  
cognizant of all opportunities available to us including 
acquisition, merger or sale of our U.S. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ivany said the strategic review of operations may not  
result in any change to Hoyts' business.

<HEADLINE> School Desegregation Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- City schools and the NAACP reached a  
last-minute settlement over race-based admissions on the same day a 
federal trial was to begin deciding the constitutionality of San 
Francisco's school desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
	The program bars any school from having more than 45 percent of  
any one racial or ethnic group, a practice the families of three 
Chinese-American students alleged kept the youngsters out of their 
preferred schools. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Orrick ordered details of Tuesday's  
agreement between the school district and the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People kept confidential until a 
hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	But participants' comments indicated that court-ordered limits  
on racial and ethnic groups at each school in the 63,000-student 
district would be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Girard, lawyer for the three Chinese-American students  
and their parents, who filed the lawsuit in 1994, said the 
agreement is ``a balanced resolution'' that achieves the 
plaintiffs' objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely worth the fight,'' said Charlene Loen,  
whose 14-year-old son, Patrick Wong, was denied admission to elite 
Lowell High School in 1994 because the school then required higher 
test scores from Chinese Americans than other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	That policy has been changed, but the court order still has the  
effect of curbing Lowell's Chinese-American enrollment, the largest 
of any group. Wong, 18, now attends the University of California, 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 order, which resolved a 1978 discrimination suit by the  
NAACP, contained a 45 percent ceiling on any racial or ethnic group 
at a school. The limit is 40 percent at alternative or ``magnet'' 
schools. Those include Lowell, which has an entrance exam and 
counts U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and the late Gov. 
Pat Brown among its alumni. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft settlement would prohibit assigning students based on  
race or ethnicity but would let the district consider their 
socioeconomic status, said Patrick Manshardt, a lawyer for the 
state Board of Education who saw the draft but was not part of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes at a time of increasing judicial hostility  
to race-based admissions. In November, a federal appeals court 
struck down race as an admissions factor at the prestigious Boston 
Latin School, a ruling the school board decided not to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco settlement will not end desegregation efforts,  
insisted NAACP lawyer Peter Cohn. He said the agreement would 
``continue to protect the educational rights of all children.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 101.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials dove into the close for the  
second day in a row on Wednesday, matching big losses in the 
broader market that resulted from aggressive sales of technology 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 101.56 at 9,195.47  
after sliding 95 points in the final hour. Earlier in the session, 
the index bailed out of a 77-point loss and stayed positive for a 
brief time, only to retreat again. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the big drop in the index, the leadership was thin.  
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by only a small margin on 
the New York Stock Exchange, and volume was 878.8 million shares, 
anemic by recent standards although still up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares, which have led the market higher since  
October, are providing the same exclusive leadership downward. 
Other sectors of the market -- manufacturing shares, for example -- 
have been unable to support the major indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's this loss of the key leadership which is bothering the  
market,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower all day, with the  
Nasdaq composite again posting a big loss of 64.96, and closing at 
2,248.91, as technology issues slid lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was down 17.84 at 1,224.03.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq loss was again sparked by Dell. The computer maker's  
fourth-quarter earnings, released late Tuesday, met analysts' 
per-share expectations, but revenues didn't grow as much as 
analysts had hoped. Dell tumbled 7 3/16, or 8.1 percent, to 81 5/8 and 
was the most heavily traded Nasdaq stock. The shares dipped as low 
as 77 3/8 during the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related shares fell as well. Dow component  
Hewlett-Packard fell 2 3/8 to 68 1/8. The computer maker's earnings, also 
released late Tuesday, beat analysts' per-share expectations, but 
its 1-percent revenue growth did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Applied Materials, which reported strong earnings late  
Tuesday, ended 1/2 point lower at 67 3/8 in Nasdaq trading after giving 
up an earlier gain of 3 3/4 point. Applied Materials posted operating 
income of 11 cents a share, well above analysts' consensus target 
of 6 cents, but revenue fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks put in another volatile day, with America Online  
falling 6 1/2 to 153, but e-Bay rising 1 7/8 to 233, amid reports that 
AOL was about to take a minority position in the online auction 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nasdaq trading, Amazon.com, fell 5 1/8 to 93 1/2, but Geoworks  
Corp. rose 1 7/8 to 5 1/4, after Amazon agreed to acquire a 7-percent 
minority stake in the tiny software firm for about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors attempted to support the Dow Jones industrials by  
bidding up industrial stocks early in the day, after the government 
reported that industrial production was unchanged in January after 
a lackluster 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the industrial production data doused fears that  
the central bank might raise interest rates, despite the fact that 
the Commerce Department also reported today that housing starts 
jumped a very strong 3.8 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	But a morning rally in industrial shares didn't hold. Dow  
component General Motors ended down 1/2 at 82 5/8, after giving up a 
strong gain of 4 1/16. United Technologies ended up 5/8 at 121 3/4, 
after gaining nearly 3 points earlier in the session. The company's 
chief financial officer confirmed Tuesday that United Technologies' 
automotive unit is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action on Wall Street, the American Stock Exchange's  
market value index declined 7.19 to 688.65, and the Russell 2000 
index of medium-sized companies tumbled 6.86 to 389.54. The New 
York Stock Exchange market index lost 6.38 to close at 580.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, Tokyo's Nikkei index eased 0.52  
percent. London's FT-SE 100 index fell 0.49, Frankfurt's DAX 
dropped 1.93 percent, and the CAC in Paris declined 0.32 percent, 
all on nervousness about technology stocks in New York.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Ilgauskas Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, a 7-foot-3  
Lithuanian who signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension 
last month, will miss the rest of the NBA season because of a 
fractured bone in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers general manager Wayne Embry said Wednesday night that  
doctors have told the team Ilgauskas will need at least 3 1/2 months 
to recover before he can start playing basketball again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous loss for this year,'' Embry said. ``We have  
to pick it up from here and move forward. What's encouraging is 
that we got an early diagnosis and the outlook is favorable for his 
return next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Vitaly Potapenko will replace Ilgauskas in the starting  
lineup, but the Cavaliers have no other center on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In five games this season, Ilgauskas averaged 15.2 points and  
8.8 rebounds. But he started experiencing pain in the fifth game, 
against San Antonio, last Thursday night, and sat out Cleveland's 
win against Orlando because of foot pain Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The fracture was discovered after Ilgauskas underwent a series  
of scans. Doctors placed his left foot in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have this type of injury come up is very discouraging and  
disappointing,'' Cavaliers coach Mike Fratello said. ``He will work 
hard on other things while he cannot play and hopefully come back 
next season ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury, involving the navicular bone, is similar to a  
fracture Ilgauskas previously had in his right foot, but team 
doctors said there is no reason to believe the bones in his feet 
are fragile and susceptible to chronic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas was among the elite rookies in the NBA last season,  
when he became a starter and averaged 13.9 points. He was the most 
valuable player of the rookie game during the NBA All-Star weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland selected him in the first round, the 20th pick  
overall, in the 1996 NBA draft, but he missed the next season 
because of a broken bone in his right foot. He underwent surgery on 
that foot in October 1996. He also had a broken bone in the right 
foot in 1995 while playing for the Atletas basketball Club in his 
hometown of Kaunas, Lithuania.

<HEADLINE> SEC Puts New Y2K Database on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has put  
a new database on its Web site giving investors access to the Year 
2000 readiness reports filed by brokerage firms, mutual funds and 
other financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The database now has more than 13,000 reports describing  
companies' computer readiness for the Year 2000 date change, how 
much it is costing them to prepare, and their contingency plans in 
case the systems fail, the SEC said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency says it views the Year 2000 problem  
as a serious issue that, if not adequately addressed, could disrupt 
the functioning of many of the world's computer systems. To prevent 
disruptions, companies need to examine their computer systems, 
retool them, and test the systems and their interactions with other 
companies' systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC recently charged 37 relatively small brokerage firms and  
nine stock-transfer agents with failing to fully disclose their 
Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the SEC's chief accountant said a check of financial  
reports that publicly traded companies must submit to the agency 
shows that many of them are still not complying with Year 2000 
disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more than half the companies in an unspecified sample  
failed to disclose how much it is costing them to get their 
computer systems ready for the millennial change, while close to 
half didn't describe their contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Y2K, the Year 2000 problem reflects programming in many  
older computers that recognizes just the last two digits of a year 
in reading a date. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely 
to interpret Jan. 1, 2000 as Jan. 1, 1900. That could cause massive 
computer failures, lost data, or broken connections with clients.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Book Gets Publishing Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky's book detailing her affair with  
President Clinton will be published on March 5, her publisher said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica's Story,'' the result of Lewinsky's collaboration with  
Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton, will be released 
simultaneously in the United States and Britain, said Lorraine 
Tyler, spokeswoman for Michael O'Mara publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael O'Mara, chairman of the publishing company, has said  
Lewinsky was drawn to his publishing house by Morton's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``She likes the idea of an author who is used to writing  
sympathetic books about women who have relationships with powerful 
men,'' O'Mara said. ``It wasn't the money. She could have got much 
higher prices elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky has agreed to give her first TV interview to ABC's  
Barbara Walters, but it can't be done until Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr grants permission. ABC is hoping to run the interview 
during the February ``sweeps'' period, which ends March 3.

<HEADLINE> Sears Promises Overhaul in Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- The softer side of Sears last year  
saw sharply softer sales, prompting the nation's largest retailer 
to begin implementing aggressive new measures aimed at producing a 
``second revolution'' in its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. executives said Wednesday they hope to  
revitalize sluggish sales at their department stores with new lines 
of clothing and in-store displays aimed at younger audiences, price 
cuts of up to 15 percent on certain clothes, the introduction of 
dinnerware, flatware, gardening and other housewares and new credit 
card promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest department store chain also revealed it is  
considering dumping or sharply scaling back its long-running 
``Softer Side of Sears'' advertising campaign as it struggles to 
win back customers lost to such competitors as Kohl's Corp., 
Target, the Gap and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The softer side has brought us a long way indeed,'' company  
chairman and chief executive Arthur Martinez said during a meeting 
with Wall Street analysts and investors. ``But we expect it to 
morph into something else. I don't think it disappears, I think it 
transforms and modifies itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sears executives acknowledged they became too complacent  
following the retailer's phoenix-like rise from the brink of 
bankruptcy earlier this decade. They promised more aggressive 
measures against the increasingly tough competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about focus,'' Martinez said. ``The issue we saw  
emerging in the business was lack of sales momentum. We're working 
to restore focus and accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department stores last year generally lagged in sales to  
specialty chains and discounters as shoppers sought bargains and 
wide selections. But Sears performed worse than most. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears in 1998 saw sales at stores open at least a year, an  
industry measure of performance, tumble 4 percent in the men's wear 
category, 1 percent in women's wear and 2 percent in children's 
wear. During the crucial holiday shopping period, the retailer saw 
overall same-store sales fall 1.6 percent, well below the average 
increase of other retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears executives said some of the chain's clothing has gone  
stale for shoppers, with Martinez noting its mall-based stores 
continued to heavily stock Levi's jeans last year, while 
competitors were turning to the more popular cargo and painter's 
pants favored by younger shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Mettler, Sears' president for merchandising, said the  
company consistently beats mall-based stores on price but last year 
failed to get that message across in promotions. The company is 
working with its advertising agencies to develop new print, 
television and radio campaigns that focus more intently on price 
and less on Sears as a quality place to shop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company this fall will launch new lines of casual clothes  
called Crossroads and Fieldmaster, as well as clothes made by 
Bennetton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to attract the younger customer base,'' Martinez  
said. ``I hate to use the words 'hip or cool' ... but in terms of 
customer attraction and customer interest, we would like to talk 
not just to a chronologically younger customer but a younger 
attitude customer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ray of light in Sears' operations last year was its strong  
credit operations, which came as customers continued to flock to 
big-ticket items such as refrigerators and washing machines and as 
delinquencies improved. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alan Lacy, the company's chief financial officer, said  
improvements can be made by targeting existing customers with 
special sales and rewards programs for using their Sears card. The 
company also is offering lower percentage rates for more 
credit-worthy customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears also announced it plans in coming months to increase its  
presence on the Internet with the launch Appliance.com, a site that 
will sell major appliance brands and models online. Sears now sells 
tools on its site, Craftsman.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer hopes to dominate the category by promising  
delivery in most areas within 48 hours and by leveraging the Sears 
name, said Jane Thompson, president of Sears Direct division.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ark. Gov. Won't Get New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge turned down former Gov.  
Jim Guy Tucker's bid for a new trial, rejecting a claim that a 
woman who sat on his jury was so biased against him that Tucker 
couldn't get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was convicted in 1996 of fraud and conspiracy and served  
18 months of home detention. He claimed a woman who married into 
the family of a political detractor had no business sitting on his 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater prosecutors had promised not to try Tucker again if  
his arguments had been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's lawyers had said that any fair-minded judge would have  
dismissed Renee Johnson from the jury if her connections to the 
governor's political enemies were known. 
</P>
<P>
	A week into the trial, Ms. Johnson married Charles Hayes, a man  
whom Tucker had twice denied clemency. Hayes is the nephew of 
Robert ``Say'' McIntosh, a longtime Tucker critic who taunted the 
governor after the jury returned its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was convicted with James and Susan McDougal, who were  
President Clinton's business partners in the Whitewater land 
development that gave Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation its name. McDougal died in prison last year and Mrs. 
McDougal served 2 1/2 months of a 24-month prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served 18 months on a contempt citation after refusing  
to talk to a grand jury. She faces a criminal contempt trial next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker's wife, Betty, said the ex-governor was out of town and  
not available for comment. Defense lawyer W.H. ``Buddy'' Sutton 
said he had not read the opinion and had not yet decided whether to 
return to the appeals court. Whitewater prosecutors also did not 
comment on the decision.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Chocolate Exports Sink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Exports of Swiss chocolate fell last  
year for the first time in 10 years as economic crises in Asia and 
other parts of the world slowed sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland exported 5 percent less of its renowned chocolate  
last year than in 1997, with some 63,400 tons shipped abroad, the 
manufacturers' association Chocosuisse reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher prices helped offset some of the decline in volume --  
exports brought in the equivalent of $297 million, down 1 percent 
from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales to Asia and Eastern Europe were down, Switzerland's  
business was up in other parts of Europe, the United States and 
Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign OT Tony Berti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos on Wednesday signed tackle Tony  
Berti, a 300-pound offensive player who is entering his fifth NFL 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-year deal was worth $400,000, according to head coach  
Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Berti, 26, a free agent who blocked for running back Rashaan  
Salaam while at Colorado, originally was chosen by San Diego in the 
sixth round of the 1995 draft and played in 33 games there. 
</P>
<P>
	Berti was released by the Chargers after a knee injury before

<HEADLINE>  Trial Opens in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Investigators knew they had something far  
more sinister than a hit-and-run accident when they discovered a Ku 
Klux Klan-engraved cigarette lighter on the bloody trail of a man 
who was dragged to his death, a sheriff testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when we started having some bad thoughts,'' Jasper  
County Sheriff Billy Rowles told jurors Tuesday. ``I knew somebody 
had been murdered because he had been black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors put the sheriff on the stand as the first witness in  
the murder trial of 24-year-old John King, a man who prosecutors 
contend was organizing a new white supremacist group for which he 
hoped to recruit members with the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he was trying to form his own personal hate group  
in Jasper,'' District Attorney Guy James Gray said after the first 
full day of testimony. ``This killing was to promote his own 
personal agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was to resume today.  
</P>
<P>
	King, an unemployed laborer and ex-convict who served time for  
burglary, faces life in prison or death by injection if convicted 
of the June 7 killing of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 49, was chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged  
for three miles before his body -- minus a head, neck and arm -- was 
dumped on a road across from a black church and cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 23, are to  
be tried later on the same murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowles testified that the evidence wasn't consistent with a  
routine hit-and-run accident: There were no skid marks, and the 
bloody trail did not run parallel to the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going through my mind. ... Somebody's dragging  
something,'' Rowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gray's opening statement to the jury of 11 whites and one  
black, he said t letters King wrote and tattoos that made him a 
walking racism exhibit would tie him to the killing, as would 
physical evidence including the lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was engraved with King's prison nickname, ``Possum'' and with  
three interlocking Ks, the KKK symbol, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's blood also was found on King's shoes, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also showed jurors photographs of Byrd's remains and  
tattered remnants of Byrd's clothing. Several members of Byrd's 
family began sobbing as the clothing was revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors portray King as unabashedly racist, a man who  
bragged about his tattoos depicting scenes including a black man 
hanging from a tree, Nazi swastikas and a Woody Woodpecker cartoon 
character wearing a Klan robe and hood. 
</P>
<P>
	Correspondence seized from his apartment the day after Byrd's  
death and entered into evidence Tuesday included 22 pages of 
handwritten by-laws and a code of ethics for King's ``Confederate 
Knights of America Texas Rebel Soldiers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs -- who declined an  
immediate opening statement -- objected to introduction of the 
written material and photos of King's tattoos, on grounds these 
items were protected by freedom of expression. The judge overruled 
the objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Chapman, 18, testified that she received 19 letters  
from King while he was in prison, some of them filled with racist 
venom. In one, King signed off: ``White is right.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Holds Lead in February Sweeps / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was just like old times for NBC, with people  
staying at home on a Thursday night, glued to their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's powerhouse Thursday schedule, frayed a bit from a  
loss of viewers this season, rebounded with strong numbers last 
week to help NBC maintain a lead during the crucial February 
``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of NBC's Thursday shows bettered their season averages,  
led by ``ER.'' The medical drama was the week's most popular show 
as viewers flocked to George Clooney's penultimate appearance as a 
series regular. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 16 share, Nielsen Media  
Research said Wednesday. CBS was second with a 9.4 rating and 15 
share, followed by ABC's 7.9 rating and 13 share and Fox's 6.7 and 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of NBC's miniseries, ``The '60s,'' finished in  
eighth place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of ABC's Stephen King miniseries, ``Storm of the  
Century,'' finished in 10th place for the week. That's not as 
strong as past King-based series and was second in its time slot to 
CBS's movie, ``Deep in My Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also received criticism for running ``Storm of the Century''  
advertisements in a crawl beneath other prime-time programs, 
confusing some viewers who thought they were seeing a special news 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	While NBC's new ``Providence'' continues to shine, the news  
isn't so good for two CBS midseason replacements. ``Turks'' and 
``Magnificent Seven'' were both deep in the ratings pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling WB network had a 3.7 rating and 6 share for the  
week, recording the most total viewers of any week in its history. 
The WB family comedy, ``7th Heaven,'' finished with a bigger 
audience than any other series ever on the network. UPN had a 2.1 
rating and 3 share, while Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' took back control of the evening news  
race after two weeks of domination by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' 
NBC had an 8.7 rating and 17 share in the week President Clinton's 
impeachment trial ended, and ABC had an 8.2 and 16. The ``CBS 
Evening News'' was at 7.7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 21.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.8; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.4; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 14.9; ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' NBC, 14.9 ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.4; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 14.4; ``NBC Movie of the Week: The '60s, Part Two,'' 
NBC, 13.4; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Deep in My Heart,'' CBS, 13.1; 
``Storm of the Century,'' ABC, 12.3.

	Kurdish Rebel Leader Held in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was  
abducted by a team of Turkish commandos dispatched to Nairobi after 
intelligence officials determined he was in hiding in the Kenyan 
capital, news reports said today. The reports were the first 
details of the covert operation to capture Ocalan, who was brought 
to Turkey yesterday to face trial on terrorism charges, which carry 
a possible death penalty. 

</P>
<P>
	Kurdish Protests Diminish in Europe  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Enraged Kurds occupied diplomatic  
headquarters in Switzerland and London for a second day today, 
protesting the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan. While 
riots and protests across Europe had diminished, Kurds in 
Switzerland continued stakeouts and launched a new one, pushing 
their way into the Geneva offices of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees early today. They left after 2 1/2 hours. 

</P>
<P>
	Romanian Miners' Leader Arrested  
</P>
<P>
	STOENESTI, Romania (AP) -- The rebellious leader of Romanian coal  
miners was arrested today after pre-dawn clashes between police 
troops and miners. Dozens were injured and 200 arrests made. Miron 
Cozma's arrest came as he and about 2,000 miners headed to 
Bucharest to protest an 18-year prison sentence handed down against 
him this week for his role in a deadly 1991 miners' protest. 

</P>
<P>
	Cleric May Be Linked to Bin Laden  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- FBI and court documents show that the head of a  
suburban Dallas mosque has a decade-long history of contacts with 
front organizations for Osama bin Laden's international terrorist 
network, The Dallas Morning News reported today. Moataz Al-Hallak, 
imam of the Islamic Society of Arlington mosque, was named on 
telephone and mailing lists for a bin Laden group supporting Afghan 
guerrillas in 1990, the newspaper said. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton May Be Cited in Jones Case  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge said she is ready to  
consider citing President Clinton for contempt for denying under 
oath that he had a relationship with Monica Lewinsky. U.S. District 
Judge Susan Webber Wright, who oversaw Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit against Clinton, said she waited because of the 
trial and an appeal of Mrs. Jones' case. The appeal ended when the 
president and Mrs. Jones reached an $850,000 settlement last year. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Pushing Social Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is hoping this week to gain  
the upper hand in the debate over how to divide the federal budget 
surplus while saving Social Security. The campaign gears up today 
with satellite-linked town hall meetings aimed at selling young 
people on the president's plan to shore up the retirement system 
and Medicare. Clinton goes to New Hampshire on Thursday to talk 
about tax credit proposals. 

</P>
<P>
	Milosevic Rejects NATO Troops  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic dealt a blow  
today to prospects for a Kosovo peace deal, rejecting a 
take-it-or-leave-it proposal that foreign troops enforce any 
accord. The Yugoslav president's latest defiance increased chances 
of NATO intervention, with only three days remaining until a 
deadline set by world powers for Serbia and ethnic Albanians to 
reach an agreement at talks in Rambouillet, France. 

</P>
<P>
	Ex-JAMA Editor Blasts AMA  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The recently fired editor of the Journal of the  
American Medical Association said he battled almost daily with AMA 
leaders, members and lobbyists to retain editorial independence. In 
an interview published in today's Chicago Tribune, Dr. George 
Lundberg said he and his editorial staff endured constant pressure, 
including threats and intimidation, during his 17 years running the 
journal.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices fell today as the Nikkei shed

	Knicks 95, Raptors 85  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Oakley returned to Madison Square Garden  
a bitter man last night, giving the cold shoulder to his former 
teammates while getting a warm response from the crowd as the 
Knicks beat the Toronto Raptors 95-85. Oakley, still upset over the 
trade that ended his 10-year career in New York, criticized the 
organization prior to the game and then stood off to the side and 
refused to shake hands with any of the Knicks before the opening 
tipoff.

	Jasper Jurors Hear Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- An ex-girlfriend of accused racist killer  
John William King linked him today to a gray pickup truck and a 
pair of sandals. Prosecutors say the truck was used to drag James 
Byrd Jr., a black man, to his death and that King's sandals were 
marked with his blood. Keisha Adkins, 21, testified today that the 
night of the June killing she saw King and two companions drive 
away in the truck to which prosecutors say the victim was later 
chained. 

</P>

	Freighter May Have Spilled Even More  
</P>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Salvage crews were getting ready to tow  
the broken bow of a grounded freighter far out to sea, the Coast 
Guard said. Some 70,000 gallons of the molasses-like fuel oil may 
have spilled -- far more than originally believed. A salvage tug was 
expected to drag the carcass of the New Carissa about 200 miles 
into the Pacific Ocean, possibly at high tide today. 

</P>
<P>
	Man Dies After Crashing Into School  
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- A 73-year-old man died after he lost  
control of his car, crashed through the window of an elementary 
school and landed on a student's desk in a second-grade classroom 
today. None of the 22 students were hurt. The desks were empty 
because the students were out of their seats checking on a pet 
guinea pig when the car crashed into the ground-level classroom, 
school officials said. 

</P>
<P>
	Turkey Empties Prison for Ocalan  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey has emptied an island prison to  
make way for a single inmate -- Abdullah Ocalan. About 250 prisoners 
were cleared off Imrali Island to make way for the Kurdish 
guerrilla leader. Turkish special forces captured Ocalan in Kenya 
on Monday. He faces trial on charges of terrorism that carry the 
death penalty. Turkey accuses Ocalan of causing the deaths of 
37,000 people since 1984 while leading his Kurdistan Workers 
Party's fight for autonomy in the nation's southeast. 

</P>
<P>
	3 Dead in Kurd Shootout in Berlin  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Dozens of Kurdish protesters stormed the Israeli  
consulate in Berlin today, and three were shot dead, Israeli 
officials said. The violence came a day after the arrest of Kurdish 
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan sparked demonstrations across Europe. 
At least 16 people were injured in the melee at the four-story 
building near Berlin's largest Turkish neighborhood, German police 
said. The Kurds appeared to be reacting to news reports that 
Israel's Mossad intelligence agency helped Turkey track down 
Ocalan. Israel denied any role in Ocalan's arrest. 

</P>

	Lautenberg Won't Seek 4th Term  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Frank Lautenberg will announce today that  
he will not seek a fourth term in 2000, The Associated Press has 
learned. An aide to the senator said Lautenberg, a New Jersey 
Democrat, has scheduled a news conference in Newark to make the 
announcement. Lautenberg, who turned 75 last month, has insisted 
for months that he wanted to win another term in hopes of becoming 
a committee chairman should Democrats win back control of the 
Senate. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Rejects Tighter Currency Links  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration reiterated today  
its opposition to the idea of greater links between major world 
currencies. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said he believed 
proposals to link more closely the dollar with the Japanese yen and 
Europe's new euro would likely put U.S. domestic economic interests 
at odds with maintaining some type of fixed exchange rates.

	Judge Gives Pilots' Union More Time  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today gave American Airlines'  
pilot union more time to defend itself against contempt charges. 
The charges stemmed from the union's failure to halt a sickout that 
at one point grounded more than half the flights of the nation's 
second-largest airline.

``It doesn't get much better than this,'' Graf said. ``I've got my

<HEADLINE>  O'Neill Breaks 200 Butterfly Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALMO, Sweden (AP) -- Susie O'Neill of Australia shattered  
swimming's oldest record Wednesday, breaking the 200-meter 
butterfly world mark with a time of 2 minutes, 05.37 seconds in a 
World Cup short course meet. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, 25, improved the record of 2:05.65 set by Mary T.  
Meagher of the United States on Jan. 2, 1981 at Gainesvile, 
Florida, by .28 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, the reigning Olympic and world champion, finally got  
the world record nearing the end of her brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Madame Butterfly'', she has said that she will  
retire after next year's Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	During another World Cup meet at Hobart in her native Australia

<HEADLINE>  O'Neill Breaks 200 Butterfly Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALMO, Sweden (AP) -- Susie O'Neill of Australia shattered  
swimming's oldest record Wednesday, breaking the 200-meter 
butterfly world mark with a time of 2 minutes, 05.37 seconds in a 
World Cup short course meet. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, 25, improved the record of 2:05.65 set by Mary T.  
Meagher of the United States on Jan. 2, 1981 at Gainesvile, 
Florida, by .28 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, the reigning Olympic and world champion, finally got  
the world record nearing the end of her brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Madame Butterfly'', she has said that she will  
retire after next year's Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	During another World Cup meet at Hobart in her native Australia  
last month, O'Neill failed in an attempt to break Meagher's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's better not to aim for a world record,'' she said.  
``That's what I did in Hobart, but I failed.

<HEADLINE> Bob Smith the teacher, coach, husband, dad, senator, president? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith is a former teacher who says  
the public has a lot to learn and a former high school baseball 
coach who has spent his political career way out in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the former real estate agent is bidding on some prime  
property: the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Decelle, a retired teacher who supervised Smith's first few  
years working in the classroom, remembers the passion for 
government the young civics teacher tried to impart to his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Decelle, a lifelong Democrat, also remembers the heated  
political discussions the Republican Smith sparked with other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to use the word opinionated, but that's what he  
is. What you see is what you get,'' Decelle said. ``He says one 
thing and does what he says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 57, is unafraid to take a stand, even if everyone else  
remains seated. He was one of only five senators who voted against 
the 1991 Civil Rights Act, one of three senators who voted against 
the National Energy Policy Act in 1992 and one of three to vote 
against the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Supreme Court 
justice. He voted against funding for Head Start, food stamps and 
emergency aid for hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was right, and the other 93 senators were wrong,'' he said  
about the Civil Rights vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters laughed in a 1997 hearing when Smith called President  
Clinton fund-raising mess ``probably the biggest scandal in the 
history of the republic.'' He also faced ridicule several years ago 
after giving a passionate speech against allowing elephants on 
Capitol grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith insists his extreme views will draw people together  
instead of alienating them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people deserve honesty and I think there are a broad  
range of voters out there who agree with me,'' he said in a 
telephone interview Wednesday. ``Clearly, there are enough people 
out there who agree with me for me to win the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just issues. It's integrity, it's a passion of  
wanting to lead,'' he said. ``It's a simple kind of feeling, a 
feeling of patriotism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has visited 20 states in the year and a half since he  
began considering a run, with frequent stops in Iowa, home of the 
first presidential caucuses. Wherever he goes, he says he tells 
people about the life experiences that shaped his views: growing up 
without his father, who was killed in a World War II airplane 
crash, serving in the Navy in Vietnam, serving his community as a 
teacher and school board member. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to introduce myself as a real person: Bob Smith the  
school teacher, the coach, the dad, the husband, then the 
senator,'' he said. ``I think people need to know who you are. If 
you're a good person in your life, you have a better chance of 
being a good president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won his first House seat in 1984 after two unsuccessful  
campaigns and was re-elected twice. He was elected to the Senate in 
1990 and re-elected by a narrow margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Beaulieu, a 70-year-old Newmarket businesswoman who has  
supported Smith from the start, says the early losses reveal as 
much about Smith as the wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good loser,'' she said. ``If you can't be a good  
loser, you can't be a good winner. He never saw it as losing. It 
was just on to the next election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beaulieu said Smith won her over with his honesty: ``He doesn't  
talk double-talk. He speaks plain language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he comes from this first presidential primary state,  
the favorite-son factor is not looming large. In a recent poll of 
New Hampshire Republicans, only 4 percent said they would vote for 
Smith in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Woodburn, chairman of the state Democratic Party, is  
offering $100 to the first Republican officeholder or GOP leader to 
endorse Smith publicly. No one has claimed the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're poking fun at Bob Smith to illustrate a serious lack of  
support he has,'' Woodburn said. ``We're trying to find where that 
lonely Republican is who will publicly support Bob Smith.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With impeachment behind him and the  
Republican-controlled Congress in recess, President Clinton is 
trying to gain the upper hand in the debate over how to divide the 
federal budget surplus while saving Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign geared up today with satellite-linked town hall  
meetings aimed at selling young people on the president's plan to 
shore up the retirement system and Medicare. Clinton goes to New 
Hampshire on Thursday to talk about tax credit proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is fundamentally very simple choice,'' Clinton said.  
``Will our first priority be spending the budget surplus that we 
have worked so hard to create on a terrifically appealing tax cut 
in the moment, or will our first priority be investing whatever the 
necessary amount of the surplus is for at least the next 15 years 
to strengthen Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the events are designed to sharpen  
the distinctions between the president's insistence on dealing with 
Social Security before trimming taxes and the Republicans' emphasis 
on across-the-board tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 200 years, the test of each generation of Americans has  
been not simply how well they did in their own time but whether 
they left our country in better shape for future generations,'' 
Clinton said from the East Room of the White House, where dozens of 
students gathered. ``Because of the size of the Baby Boom 
generation ... we have a special responsibility to the generation 
represented by most of you in this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office today projected that  
Clinton's plan could lead to roughly $800 billion in on-budget 
deficits by 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials in the past have taken issue with the  
CBO's analysis on Social Security, but Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., 
called the estimates proof that ``the president's approach to 
Social Security reform is to resurrect the days of deficit 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some authorities contend the surest way to shore up  
Social Security is to raise taxes and reduce benefits, Clinton 
adviser Paul Begala said today that such unpopular actions are 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the surplus, we are not now at a time when we need deep  
and drastic cuts in Social Security,'' Begala said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' ``So we can take that surplus and invest in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have agreed in principle with Clinton's call to  
devote 62 percent of the anticipated budget surpluses to shoring up 
the Social Security system over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no agreement on Clinton's proposal to dedicate 15  
percent of the surplus to Medicare, and Republicans have roundly 
criticized a proposal to use another 11 percent to establish 
401(k)-style accounts for working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other  
GOP lawmakers presided over the first in a series of small town 
meetings Monday to build support for their proposal to cut taxes by 
$743 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty-two percent should be set aside to save Social  
Security,'' said Republican National Committee spokesman Tom Yu. 
``The rest should go back to the taxpayer. It's an overpayment in 
taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, makes his pitch via satellite today to 
41 college campuses in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to convince students, and Congress, that fixing the  
retirement system now is the best plan for their future. ``Then 
it's a debate over how do you do tax cuts,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of slashing taxes across the board, Clinton wants to  
target tax cuts where he believes they are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly proposed retirement funds, called Universal Savings  
Accounts, would target tax credits to low- and middle-income 
working Americans who choose to save more for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the key political battleground of New Hampshire on Thursday,  
Clinton plans to focus on his proposed $1,000 tax credit on helping 
families cope with the burdens of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would provide up to $500 in tax credits for  
stay-at-home parents caring for children under age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu said Republicans weren't worried about Clinton stealing the  
spotlight while lawmakers were on a recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many members of Congress and senators are going to be holding  
town hall meetings and listening to their constituents during the 
recess,'' Yu said. ``They're not taking the day off by any means.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Oppose Stem-Cell Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Funding of human stem cell research by the  
National Institutes of Health would violate a federal law, 70 House 
members told the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna  
Shalala, the lawmakers objected to plans by the National Institutes 
of Health to fund research using stem cells obtained from human 
embryos or fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are basic biological building blocks. Some forms of  
stem cells extracted from embryos or fetuses theoretically have the 
ability to create any organ or any tissue. Scientists say that by 
guiding the growth of these cells it might be possible to culture 
new organs to replace ailing hearts, or neurons for the treatment 
of brain disease or injury, or insulin-producing cells to cure 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	No government-backed research has been conducted on stem cells  
because a 1996 law specifically forbids spending federal dollars 
for medical research that involves creation of a human embryo for 
research purposes, or conducting research in which a human embryo 
has been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, privately funded researchers not covered by the ban  
last year grew colonies of stem cells from tissue taken from human 
fetuses and embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NIH Director Harold Varmus announced that the agency  
had decided these laboratory-grown cells were not covered by the 
federal ban because they are not human embryos capable of creating 
a new person. Varmus based his announcement on a memo from HHS 
general counsel Harriet Rabb. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter, the House members said federal funding of such  
research ``would violate both the letter and the spirit'' of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that Rabb's memo to Varmus ``appears to be a carefully  
worded effort to justify transgressing that law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said Rabb's memo claims the law only prohibits  
research involving the specific act of destroying an embryo, but 
not the cells that were later grown from embryonic tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers said the federal law also forbids funding of  
research ``which follows or depends upon the destruction of or 
injury to a human embryo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This area of the law has provided a bulwark against  
government's misuse and exploitation of human beings in the name of 
medical progress,'' the letter said. ``It would be a travesty for 
the administration to attempt to unravel this accepted ethical 
standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was initiated by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,  
leader of a House caucus that opposes abortion. Among the 70 
signers were Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas; Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas; Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the Republican 
conference chairman; and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the 
House Judiciary committee. Nine Democrats also signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Boeder, an HHS spokeswoman, said Shalala received the  
letter Tuesday, but has not yet responded. Boeder said the NIH has 
not funded any stem-cell research and is only analyzing what 
studies might be sponsored by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``NIH and the department are very aware of the serious legal,  
ethical and moral issues raised by this research,'' said Boeder.

<HEADLINE>  Whitaker Says His Age Won't Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker turned pro in Madison Square  
Garden a little more than 14 years ago. On Saturday night, he will 
fight in the famed arena again, ready to show his career is not at 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than delighted to be 35 years old, but I'm going to  
give a 21-year-old performance,'' Whitaker said Wednesday at the 
final news conference leading to his bout with unbeaten IBF 
champion Felix Trinidad. ``I'm looking forward to getting into the 
middle of ring in the Garden and seeing those lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Whitaker performed under the Garden lights was  
Nov. 15, 1984. He stopped Farrain Commeaux in the second round of a 
scheduled six-round lightweight bout on a card that featured 
several members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Whitaker fought in the Garden he won the WBC  
welterweight title by outpointing James ``Buddy'' McGirt on March 
6, 1993. Whitaker also has held the WBC, WBA IBF lightweight, IBF 
junior welterweight and WBA junior middleweight titles. He has been 
a champion every year from 1984 until 1998, when he didn't fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, a 26-year-old Puerto Rican, barely broke a sweat in  
his only Garden appearance. He stopped Troy Waters of Australia in 
the first round Aug. 27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad fought only once since -- knocking out Mahenge Zulu in  
the fourth round last April 3 in Puerto Rico -- because of 
litigation with promoter Don King. Trinidad lost in court and 
signed a $42.9 million multifight contract with King. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad doesn't think the layoff will affect his performance. A  
bigger question concerns Whitaker's 16 months of inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, who lost the WBC 147-pound title on controversial  
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997, last fought when he 
outpointed Andre Pestriaev in a 12-round welterweight bout Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker tested positive for cocaine after that fight. He  
underwent drug and alcohol rehabilitation in 1998 when he tested 
positive in a random drug test and also was convicted of reckless 
driving for which he received a suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He will not discuss his out-of-ring problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is Trinidad's most prominent opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit slower, but he's strong and he has  
experience,'' Trinidad said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker has beaten such fighters as McGirt, Jose Luis Ramirez,  
Roger Mayweather, Azumah Nelson and got a draw with Julio Cesar 
Chavez in fight he seemingly dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not fighting Ramirez or Chavez -- he's fighting Felix  
``Tito'' Trinidad,'' the champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be carried on HBO following a tape of WBC  
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya's split-decision win over 
Ike Quartey last Saturday. The telecast will begin at 9:30 p.m. 
EST.

	The ballet's performance of ``Nine Lives: The Songs of Lyle  
Lovett,'' opens at the Shubert Theater on Thursday and runs through 
Feb. 28. The Lovett songs featured include ``Blues Walk,'' ``Nobody

<HEADLINE>  Whitaker Says His Age Won't Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pernell Whitaker turned pro in Madison Square  
Garden a little more than 14 years ago. On Saturday night, he will 
fight in the famed arena again, ready to show his career is not at 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than delighted to be 35 years old, but I'm going to  
give a 21-year-old performance,'' Whitaker said Wednesday at the 
final news conference leading to his bout with unbeaten IBF 
champion Felix Trinidad. ``I'm looking forward to getting into the 
middle of ring in the Garden and seeing those lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Whitaker performed under the Garden lights was  
Nov. 15, 1984. He stopped Farrain Commeaux in the second round of a 
scheduled six-round lightweight bout on a card that featured 
several members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Whitaker fought in the Garden he won the WBC  
welterweight title by outpointing James ``Buddy'' McGirt on March 
6, 1993. Whitaker also has held the WBC, WBA IBF lightweight, IBF 
junior welterweight and WBA junior middleweight titles. He has been 
a champion every year from 1984 until 1998, when he didn't fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, a 26-year-old Puerto Rican, barely broke a sweat in  
his only Garden appearance. He stopped Troy Waters of Australia in 
the first round Aug. 27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad fought only once since -- knocking out Mahenge Zulu in  
the fourth round last April 3 in Puerto Rico -- because of 
litigation with promoter Don King. Trinidad lost in court and 
signed a $42.9 million multifight contract with King. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad doesn't think the layoff will affect his performance. A  
bigger question concerns Whitaker's 16 months of inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, who lost the WBC 147-pound title on controversial  
decision to Oscar De La Hoya on April 12, 1997, last fought when he 
outpointed Andre Pestriaev in a 12-round welterweight bout Oct. 17, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker tested positive for cocaine after that fight. He  
underwent drug and alcohol rehabilitation in 1998 when he tested 
positive in a random drug test and also was convicted of reckless 
driving for which he received a suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He will not discuss his out-of-ring problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker is Trinidad's most prominent opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit slower, but he's strong and he has  
experience,'' Trinidad said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker has beaten such fighters as McGirt, Jose Luis Ramirez,  
Roger Mayweather, Azumah Nelson and got a draw with Julio Cesar 
Chavez in fight he seemingly dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not fighting Ramirez or Chavez -- he's fighting Felix  
``Tito'' Trinidad,'' the champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be carried on HBO following a tape of WBC  
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya's split-decision win over 
Ike Quartey last Saturday. The telecast will begin at 9:30 p.m. 
EST.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Pilots' Union More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge has extended his order requiring  
American Airlines' pilot union encourage its members to show up for 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said Wednesday he would extend  
from March 8 to May 12 his temporary restraining order to the 
Allied Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	For 10 days this month, thousands of pilots, frustrated with  
contract talks, called in sick. The results were delays for more 
than 600,000 passengers and cancellations of about 6,600 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge on Wednesday also delayed his decision for more than  
six weeks on how to punish the union for originally ignoring his 
order to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to cool down and take the loaded guns away from each  
other's heads,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The APA asked Kendall to allow it extra time to examine  
American's claim of $58.7 million in damages suffered when 
thousands of flights were grounded from 4 p.m. last Wednesday until 
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, American estimates that the job action cost it more  
than $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall had ordered the pilots back into their cockpits last  
Wednesday. On Saturday, he held the union and two top board members 
in contempt and said he would fine them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall continued the damages hearing until April 12.  
</P>
<P>
	The sickout began Feb. 6 after American pilots lost patience  
with Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., parent company of the 
airline. According to the APA, the company had ignored their 
contract by purchasing Reno Air Corp. and not immediately 
increasing pay for all pilots affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations continued on the issue Wednesday, but the sticking  
point remained that the union wants pilots to be paid retroactively 
to Dec. 23, the date of the airline purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said it proposed to immediately increase pay up  
to 56 percent for pilots of Reno Air, which was purchased by AMR in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid.

<HEADLINE>  Rivera Has Arbitration Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals beat left-hander Darren Oliver in salary  
arbitration Wednesday, and New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera 
went through with his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, 28, was awarded a $500,000 raise to $3.55 million by the  
three-man panel of Richard Bloch, Jerome Ross and William H. Holly 
rather than the $4.15 million he sought. 
</P>
<P>
	With the win, owners are 6-1 against players this year, losing  
only to New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who on Tuesday won 
a $5 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hearing in Tampa, Fla., Rivera asked arbitrator James  
Duff for a raise from $750,000 to $4.25 million, while the team 
argued the reliever should be paid $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old right-hander was 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA and 36  
saves in 41 chances last season but his strikeout total dropped to 
36 in 61 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected Thursday, when two of the final three  
cases are scheduled to be argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, a left-hander acquired from Texas on July 31 along with  
third baseman Fernando Tatis for pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and 
shortstop Royce Clayton, was a combined 10-11 with a 5.73 ERA in 
1998, including 4-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 10 starts with the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Oliver is 45-31 with a 4.64 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Reds Starting Down Slippery Slope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds have started down a slippery slope.  
</P>
<P>
	First, they agree to facial hair.  
</P>
<P>
	Next, it's going to be earrings.  
</P>
<P>
	And we all know what happens after that. Now playing left field  
... Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cincinnati,'' outfielder Dann Bilardello said during the  
good old days, ``we were lucky to have eyebrows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No more. On Monday, owner Marge Schott rescinded a 32-year-old  
ban on facial hair first put into place by general manager Bob 
Howsam in response to Vietnam War protests. And trust us, the 
organization did not make this move without some weighty 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the same team, after all, that went to great lengths  
during the Communist-under-every-bed scare of the early 1950s to 
remind everyone that its name was actually the ``Redlegs,'' and not 
simply the ``Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But progress has its price, and besides, Schott is a sucker for  
kids. And so what sealed the deal was a plea from Greg Vaughn, 
acquired in a Feb. 2 trade from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	`I have two kids who have never seen their daddy without a  
goatee,'' the slugger said. ``They wouldn't recognize me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More to the point, even Schott had to recognize what was behind  
the facial hair -- 50 home runs, 119 RBIs and a .272 average -- 
numbers that were impossible to ignore for a proud franchise mired 
in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the support of our fans, we have changed our facial hair  
policy,'' the owner said. ``The team will continue to respect the 
traditions of Cincinnati Reds baseball and adhere to our other 
uniform personnel rules, presenting a clean-cut image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this wasn't the silliest rule in sport, it was a close  
second, losing by a whisker to the NBA's regulations governing 
too-long shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Schott's constant companion on her tours of  
Cinergy Field, a St. Bernard named Schottzie, flaunted the rule for 
years. For another, while only two players ever used beards to 
force a trade -- Bobby Tolan in 1973 and Jim Kern nearly 10 years 
later -- nobody knows how many others wound up elsewhere for lack of 
a razor. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were plenty of stories.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've even talked to some who said that's the only reason they  
wouldn't want to play for the Reds,'' said right fielder Dmitri 
Young, who showed up at spring training with a mustache and beard. 
``Of course, I didn't think it was right for me to say anything. I 
don't exactly have the same pull as Greg Vaughn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how much that is remains to be seen. When Young popped  
into the team's Sarasota, Fla., clubhouse on Monday, he was 
accompanied by infielder Pokey Reese, whose goatee was set off by a 
pair of diamond earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Young, Reese wasn't ready to push the envelope himself.  
But, he added, ``who knows, if Greg wants to wear 'em...'' 
</P>
<P>
	As we said, this could turn out to be a slippery slope.  
</P>
<P>
	In years gone by, the no-facial hair edict was so strictly  
enforced that when a player arrived from another club for spring 
training with a mustache, the Reds got an old photograph of him, 
whited out the mustache, and used that picture in the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Players like Jeff Reardon, who shaved a beard shortly after  
arriving in Cincinnati in 1993, might want to get hold of the old 
team pictures and pencil the facial hair back in. And maybe the 
dynasty of the mid-1970s will henceforth want to be known as ``The 
Big Red Fuzzy Machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	Current Reds manager Jack McKeon has been in baseball long  
enough to see fads come and go. He ran the show in Oakland in 
1977-78, when the A's were the shaggiest team in baseball -- the 
anti-Reds, if you will -- and ruled with a bushy mustache. He's been 
clean-shaven since taking over in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only interested,'' he said, ``in how they play.''  
</P>
<P>
	And as Rodman has demonstrated the past couple of seasons, how  
an athlete plays doesn't always correlate with how he looks. Which 
is not to say that an athlete who thinks he looks good won't play 
that little bit better. 
</P>
<P>
	``He treats us like men,'' Torrin Polk a receiver at the  
University of Houston, once said in praise of his coach, John 
Jenkins. ``He lets us wear earrings.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nurse Claims He Was Fired Over AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A nurse who claims he was fired  
because he had AIDS filed a $1.4 million lawsuit Wednesday against 
his former employer. 
</P>
<P>
	John Casselberry didn't tell officials at North Broward  
Rehabilitation and Nursing Center that he had AIDS when he was 
first hired. By law, he didn't have to disclose it, and the 
hospital could not legally ask. 
</P>
<P>
	Casselberry said he was promoted to a supervisory post and  
granted three separate pay raises. When he applied for intermittent 
personal medical leave, he disclosed that he was HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, he said he was feeling ill, laid his head on his desk  
and was immediately fired for sleeping on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Casselberry is suing Ventas Inc., which owns the Fort Lauderdale  
facility. He contends the company violated the federal Family and 
Medical Leave and Rehabilitation acts and a state law prohibiting 
discrimination in public facilities and employment for people with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville, Ky.-based Vencor Inc., which operates the facility,  
refused to comment on the specific allegations in the lawsuit. In a 
written statement, it maintained Casselberry was fired for not 
being able to do his job.

<HEADLINE> Skip Away Wins Horse of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Along with winning nearly $10 million  
in his career, Skip Away has earned another distinction -- Horse of 
the Year for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, the ``horse pet'' of Carolyn and Sonny Hine, won the  
Eclipse Award on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Skippy, as he was called by owner Carolyn and her  
husband-trainer, Sonny, was a unanimous selection, getting the 
votes of the National Turf Writers Association, Daily Racing Form 
and racing secretaries of National Thoroughbred Racing Association 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been a real sadness in my heart (if he had  
lost),'' Carolyn Hine said. ``I guess I would have been numb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away finished second in Horse of the Year voting to  
2-year-old champion Favorite Trick in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gray horse, winner of his first seven starts, which  
stretched his victory streak to nine, beat Awesome Again, who won 
all six starts and beat Skip Away in the Breeders' Cup Classic on 
Nov. 7, in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were announced at the NTRA's Eclipse Awards dinner at  
Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, who was 5, also beat Awesome Again, who was 4, as  
best older horse or gelding. Frank Stronach, Awesome Again's owner, 
was voted the top owner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, 3-year-old champion in 1996 and best older horse and  
gelding in 1997, obviously won racing's top honor on the strength 
of his schedule. Of his seven straight wins, five of them were 
Grade I stakes, one of them was a Grade II and the other was a 
Grade III. He finished third in the Grade I Woodward, then sixth in 
Grade I BC Classic, finishing with $2.74 million for the year and 
$9,612,360 for his career, second only to Cigar ($9,999,815). 
</P>
<P>
	Awesome Again won two Grade I stakes -- the Whitney Handicap and  
the BC Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they couldn't give it to anyone else when his major  
competition won only two Grade ones,'' Sonny Hine said. ``He 
deserves all of his accolades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another big winner was Bob Baffert. He got an Eclipse Award as  
trainer of the year, and two of his charges won divisional 
championships -- Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness, was the top 3-year-old, and unbeaten Silverbulletday was 
the top 2-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram owns both Real Quiet and Silverbulletday, but the  
Eclipse Award for top owner went to Frank Stronach, owner of 
Awesome Again, whose stable had a big year. Pegram said the 
victories of Real Quiet, Baffert and Gary Stevens were honor enough 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, Real Quiet's rider, was voted the top jockey. It was  
the first Eclipse Award for the Hall of Fame jockey, who has won 
the Kentucky Derby three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled to finally win it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Every winner was a unanimous first-place selection of each of  
the three voting organizations. The outstanding breeder award, 
given to Mr. and Mrs. John C. Mabee, was selected by a special 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Other equine winners were Answer Lively, 2-year-old colt or  
gelding; Banshee Breeze, 3-year-old filly; Escena, older filly or 
mare; Reraise, sprinter; Buck's Boy, male turf horse; Fiji, female 
turf horse; Flat Top, steeplechaser. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Bridgmohan was honored as top apprentice jockey.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Nears FCC Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are poised to give AT&AMP;T  
Corp. permission to acquire cable giant TCI in a deal that could 
give consumers one-stop shopping -- from local calling to high-speed 
Internet access -- over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is expected this week to  
clear the deal, which was valued at nearly $32 billion when it was 
announced in June, said government and industry officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the merger holds the promise of providing a new  
choice for local phone service -- a prospect appealing to 
regulators, who want to crack open local phone monopolies to 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, however, is not expected to force AT&AMP;T and  
TeleCommunications Inc. to provide other companies with access to 
TCI's high-speed cable TV lines. Consumer groups, America Online 
and others had been pressing for the agency to require AT&AMP;T to give 
other companies access to those lines to offer competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of AT&AMP;T and TCI, in separate meetings today, are to  
vote on the planned merger. It must also be approved by many local 
cable franchising authorities. Some local authorities want to 
provide rivals access to TCI's high-speed lines, but it's unclear 
if they would have the authority to force any changes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company and  
biggest provider of mobile phone services. TCI is the nation's 
second-largest cable TV company, with lines reaching one-third of 
all U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those TCI lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet and access 
online data at speeds as much as 100 times faster than conventional 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. More cable 
agreements are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes  
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional 
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T also will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge consumers extra if they got 
their Internet service over the merged companies' lines but wanted 
another Internet service provider, such as AOL. But federal 
regulators are not expected to set any conditions on that part of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department approved the merger in December on the  
condition that TCI sell its interest in a rival mobile phone 
company, Sprint PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FCC declined to open a proceeding that would  
force all cable companies to share their high-speed lines with 
rivals. But the agency said it would monitor the situation to make 
sure cable companies don't freeze out their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and AOL have pressed for the same mandatory  
access requirements they sought in the merger to apply to all cable 
companies. AT&AMP;T and TCI support voluntary agreements for businesses 
offering competing services to gain access to their high-speed 
cable lines.

<HEADLINE>  Rivera Has Arbitration Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals beat left-hander Darren Oliver in salary  
arbitration Wednesday, and New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera 
went through with his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, 28, was awarded a $500,000 raise to $3.55 million by the  
three-man panel of Richard Bloch, Jerome Ross and William H. Holly 
rather than the $4.15 million he sought. 
</P>
<P>
	With the win, owners are 6-1 against players this year, losing  
only to New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who on Tuesday won 
a $5 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hearing in Tampa, Fla., Rivera asked arbitrator James  
Duff for a raise from $750,000 to $4.25 million, while the team 
argued the reliever should be paid $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old right-hander was 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA and 36  
saves in 41 chances last season but his strikeout total dropped to 
36 in 61 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected Thursday, when two of the final three  
cases are scheduled to be argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, a left-hander acquired from Texas on July 31 along with  
third baseman Fernando Tatis for pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and 
shortstop Royce Clayton, was a combined 10-11 with a 5.73 ERA in 
1998, including 4-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 10 starts with the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Oliver is 45-31 with a 4.64 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Biletnikoff's Daughter Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- A 23-year-old man was being held  
today on suspicion of murdering the daughter of NFL Hall of Famer 
Fred Biletnikoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Haroon Ali, 23, was arrested in San Diego on Tuesday as  
he tried to drive across the border into Mexico, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of his girlfriend, 20-year-old Tracey Biletnikoff,  
turned up on a hillside at quiet Canada College in San Mateo 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff had disappeared early Tuesday after a friend  
called San Mateo police to report that she and Ali were involved in 
a domestic disturbance. Police were unable to find the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance workers found her partially clothed body hours later  
near an empty parking lot while picking up garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a homicide,'' San Mateo County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Cody  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali was convicted in 1994 for kidnapping a former girlfriend  
after she broke up with him, Deputy District Attorney Steve 
Wagstaffe said today. A judge placed him on probation and ordered 
him to undergo drug and alcohol treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped Ali in Ms. Biletnikoff's car  
Tuesday night, Cody said. Deputies flew down to Southern California 
to bring him back to San Mateo County, a process that could take up 
to five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody would not give details of the killing or say whether Ms.  
Biletnikoff had been sexually assaulted. Authorities said only that 
she appeared to have been beaten. An autopsy was being performed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether she was a student at the community college,  
Cody said there was a connection but would not elaborate. She had 
been working as a drug counselor in San Mateo and had been dating 
Ali for some months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff's brother said she had been living with their  
father in the east San Francisco Bay area and was a student at the 
College of San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
	Biletnikoff and his former wife, who lives in Southern  
California, were notified of their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty devastated, as you would expect,'' Cody said.  
</P>
<P>
	Biletnikoff, 55, who has four other children, is in his ninth  
year as wide receivers coach with the Oakland Raiders. He played 
for the Raiders from 1965-78 and was named MVP of Super Bowl XI. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the team's all-time leading receiver with 589 catches  
until Tim Brown broke that record two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sympathy and prayers are with the Biletnikoff family,''  
Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said in a prepared statement.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jeffery Cohelan, a liberal Democrat who  
represented the Oakland, Calif., area in the House of 
Representatives for 12 years, died Monday at his home here. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohelan, 84, had Parkinson's disease and colon-rectal cancer.

	Elected in 1958 to a House seat representing parts of the city

<HEADLINE> CNN, WebMD Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- WebMD, a new, fast-growing Internet-based  
healthcare information business, is teaming up with the CNN News 
Group in a move that increase its profile while boosting the pool 
of health information on the group's online and on-air networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Tuesday, will include exchanges of online  
health information and joint development of interactive features, 
and on-air and online promotion of WebMD by CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is virtually no topic today that has more interest than  
health news. Personal health is the hot topic,'' said Tom Johnson, 
chief of the CNN News Group. ``You have just a proliferation of all 
types of providers in this field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the alliance will present an easily accessible,  
wide range of ``trusted information'' on health and wellness. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Arnold, founder and chief executive of Atlanta-based  
WebMD, said the CNN strategic alliance will ``add credibility to 
this effort to reach our goal of truly impacting this industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN is also obtaining an ownership stake in the company, which  
recently filed to make an initial public offering to sell stock, 
while WebMD is making a three-year advertising buy across CNN's 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold, 29, began a telemedicine business five years ago, but  
last year changed its name to WebMD and began offering physician 
and consumer health information on the World Wide Web. He raised 
more than $40 million and recently announced acquisitions of an 
online health information service and of a Web-based health 
information publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The entrepreneur has partnerships with about 30 other companies  
to provide subscribing medical professionals what he calls ``a 
one-stop solution site'' that can be used for everything from 
insurance eligibility checks to medical education to ordering 
medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're showing doctors that this is a tremendous  
timesaving tool,'' Arnold said, explaining that his WebMD Internet 
gateway is meant to allow medical professionals to avoid multiple 
searches. ``Doctors are pressed for time and they don't have time 
to go to each and every one of these sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer information link is free.  
</P>
<P>
	The association with CNN will help reach more consumers and  
professionals, Arnold said, adding that professional subscribers 
will be able to access CNN Headline News at WebMD's ``physicians' 
lounge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN News Group, owned by Time Warner unit TBS, includes Cable  
News Network and five other cable and satellite TV networks, plus 
an array of related news and information services, including CNN 
Interactive.

<HEADLINE>  New Manager, Outlook for Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Malone spent the offseason retooling  
the Los Angeles Dodgers with a couple of big trades and the 
commitment of millions of dollars to players -- mostly to Kevin 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the general manager says, the real fun begins.  
</P>
<P>
	``The organization was in a place where we needed to make a lot  
of changes,'' he said. ``The last five months, there's been a lot 
of hard work. Right now, the light at the end of the tunnel is 
growing larger and larger. We'll soon be involved in actual 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers and catchers report Thursday to Vero Beach, Fla., for  
perhaps the final spring training at Dodgertown, with the rest of 
the team due Feb. 24. The exhibition schedule opens March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sanctuary is the game itself,'' Malone said. ``I was one of  
those guys who always loved to practice because I loved the game. 
I'm getting excited, knowing that the beginning of the season and 
the coming together of what I believe is a championship club is 
getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've positioned ourself on paper to be a championship club.  
Now, we've got to work real hard and get it done on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new faces will be plentiful, headed by manager Davey  
Johnson, hired by Malone in October. No team of Johnson's has ever 
finished lower than second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there's Brown, a 33-year-old right-hander who  
signed a record $105 million, seven-year contract to anchor the 
starting rotation, a deal that caused many major league owners to 
lambaste Rupert Murdoch, head of the Dodgers' new owner, Fox 
Entertainment Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new faces include catcher Todd Hundley, center fielder  
Devon White, and relievers Alan Mills, Mel Rojas and Greg Cadaret. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are catchers Charles Johnson and Tom Prince,  
infielder-outfielder Bobby Bonilla, relievers Mark Guthrie and 
Scott Radinsky, and outfielder Roger Cedeno. 
</P>
<P>
	And that doesn't even count the in-season transformation last  
year, which included the departure of catcher Mike Piazza and the 
arrival of outfielder Gary Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, just 17 players remain from the 40 on the roster at the  
start of spring training a year ago. Malone thinks the offseason 
moves have made the Dodgers, who were 83-79 in 1998, World Series 
title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about this team, I'm excited,'' he said.  
``I'm energized by the potential. What we've got to do is make sure 
our focus is clear, come together and learn, get to know each 
other, get on the same page as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More deals could come. There are six legitimate contenders for  
five berths in the starting rotation: Brown, Chan Ho Park, Darren 
Dreifort, Ismael Valdes, Dave Mlicki and Carlos Perez -- the only 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are two seasoned shortstops: Mark Grudzielanek and  
Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe competition is healthy,'' Malone said. ``We have a  
surplus as far as starting pitchers and middle infielders is 
concerned. To me, that's a strength. We'll see how things progress 
in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your ears are always open. Every day you look for ways to  
improve your club. I don't anticipate any major deals. I don't feel 
right now there are a lot of question marks as far as this club is 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone also refuted a recent newspaper report that outfielder  
Raul Mondesi, listed in last year's media guide as weighing 215 
pounds, had ballooned to 275. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was erroneous; he left here the other day at 240,''  
Malone said. ``He's 15 or 20 pounds heavier than where he'll be on 
opening day.''

<HEADLINE> Netscape Co-Founder Moving to AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. confirmed Wednesday it  
will make Marc Andreessen, the 27-year-old co-founder of Netscape 
Communications Corp., chief technology officer when it completes 
its acquisition of Netscape this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, who was in charge of software development at  
Netscape, will report to AOL chairman and chief executive Steve 
Case. The move, first reported late last month, is expected to help 
convince other Netscape employees from leaving the company as AOL 
absorbs the pioneer maker of Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen helped create the Internet browser that made the  
World Wide Web so popular. He's expected to play a major role in 
keeping talent and bolstering morale at Netscape, which will 
continue working on Internet software as a division of AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape, based in Mountain View, Calif., agreed in November to  
be purchased by AOL for stock then valued at $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have said the deal should be completed early this  
spring. The U.S. Department of Justice is checking the deal 
closely, since it could have an impact on the antitrust trial of 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen co-founded Netscape in 1994 with James Clark and the  
company made popular an Internet browser developed by Andreessen 
and some classmates from the University of Illinois.

and three days after her first win. It actually came 18 years and 
three days later.

	Clinton Offers Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today hosted  
satellite-linked town hall meetings aimed at selling young people 
on the his plan to shore up the Social Security and Medicare. 
Joined by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, he spoke via satellite to 41 college campuses in 28 
states. ``There is fundamentally very simple choice,'' Clinton said 
at the White House. ``Will our first priority be spending the 
budget surplus that we have worked so hard to create on a 
terrifically appealing tax cut in the moment, or will our first 
priority be investing whatever the necessary amount of the surplus 
is for at least the next 15 years to strengthen Social Security and 
Medicare.''

	3 Kurds Shot Dead in Berlin  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Dozens of Kurdish protesters stormed the Israeli  
consulate in Berlin today, Israeli officials said, and three were 
shot dead. At least 16 people were injured in the melee a day after 
the arrest by Turkey of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan 
sparked demonstrations across Europe. A group of protesters had 
tried to take the four-story embassy in a residential area, German 
police said. Israel said its guards opened fire at protesters in 
self-defense. The Kurds appeared to be reacting to reports that 
Israel's Mossad intelligence agency helped Turkey track down 
Ocalan. Israel denied any role in Ocalan's arrest.

	Turkey Empties Prison for Ocalan  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey has emptied an island prison to  
make way for a single inmate -- Abdullah Ocalan. About 250 prisoners 
were cleared off Imrali Island to make way for the Kurdish 
guerrilla leader. Turkish special forces captured Ocalan in Kenya 
on Monday. He faces trial on charges of terrorism that carry the 
death penalty. Turkey accuses Ocalan of causing the deaths of 
37,000 people since 1984 while leading his Kurdistan Workers 
Party's fight for autonomy in the nation's southeast.

	Sen. Lautenberg Is Retiring  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) --New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg announced  
today he will not seek a fourth term in 2000, saying he didn't want 
to spend the next two years raising money for another campaign. 
Lautenberg, 75, becomes the second veteran Democrat not to seek 
re-election in 2000, joining New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
The departures create opportunities for the Republicans, who have a 
55-45 advantage in the Senate, to capture open seats. Lautenberg 
has been known for a liberal voting record.

	Dragging Death Testimony Given  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- An ex-girlfriend of accused racist killer  
John William King linked him today to a gray pickup truck and a 
pair of sandals. Prosecutors say the truck was used to drag James 
Byrd Jr., a black man, to his death and that King's sandals were 
marked with his blood. Keisha Adkins, 21, testified today that on 
the night of the killing last June she saw King and two companions 
drive away in the truck to which prosecutors say the victim was 
later chained.

	Ship May Have Spilled More Oil  
</P>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Salvage crews were getting ready to tow  
the broken bow of a grounded freighter far out to sea, the Coast 
Guard said. Some 70,000 gallons of the molasses-like fuel oil may 
have spilled -- far more than originally believed. A salvage tug was 
expected to drag the carcass of the New Carissa about 200 miles 
into the Pacific Ocean, possibly at high tide today.

	U.S. Rejects Currency Links  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration reiterated today  
its opposition to the idea of greater links between major world 
currencies. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said he believed 
proposals to link more closely the dollar with the Japanese yen and 
Europe's new euro would likely put U.S. domestic economic interests 
at odds with maintaining some type of fixed exchange rates.

	Judge Gives Pilots More Time  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today gave American Airlines'  
pilot union more time to defend itself against contempt charges. 
The charges stemmed from the union's failure to halt a sickout that 
at one point grounded more than half the flights of the nation's 
second-largest airline.

<HEADLINE> Orange Juice Down; Coffee Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Orange juice futures continued to slide Wednesday on the Board  
of Trade of the City of New York amid expectations of bumper citrus 
crops in Florida, the state that accounts for 90 percent of all 
U.S. orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the New York Board of Trade, coffee futures  
regained some of Tuesday's losses. Wheat futures also rallied on 
the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil futures lingered near their recent lows.  
</P>
<P>
	A mild winter in Florida, along with the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture's increase in the size of that state's crop, has been 
fueling a plummet in frozen, concentrated orange juice prices since 
fall -- a fall that continued Wednesday. Orange juice for March 
delivery dropped 3.20 cents to 84.25 cents a gallon, rallying a bit 
from a low of 83.50 cents earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most indicators are indicating that we could go lower yet,''  
said Ernie Thomas, a citrus specialist with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in 
Winter Park, Fla. He thinks orange juice futures could fall as low 
as 77 cents a gallon before leveling off. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Thomas said he is ``a little suspect'' of the dropping  
prices, particularly since cash prices for juice from Florida and 
Brazil are about $1.40 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these prices are considerably higher than what the market  
is,'' Thomas said. ``Overall, for the longer term, I think the 
market will go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William O'Neill, Merrill Lynch's director of commodity research,  
said he's also been a bit puzzled by what he called an ``anemic'' 
coffee market. He speculated that the devaluation of the Brazilian 
real was holding off any optimism over smaller than expected coffee 
crops in Colombia, Mexico and even Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, coffee futures did regain some of the previous  
day's sharp losses -- though mostly because fears about the U.S. 
Green Coffee Association's inventory report for Central America 
proved to be somewhat overblown, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants on Tuesday drove down prices to their lowest  
since October amid expectations the association would report that 
Central American inventories had increased as much as 400,000 bags 
in January. After trading ended Tuesday, the group reported that 
stocks jumped 343,000 bags to 1.751 million bags. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, March arabica coffee rose 1.60 cents to $1.0255 a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, after continuing to drop early in the day on worries  
over the lack of export demand, wheat for March delivery rallied on 
the Chicago Board of Trade on news that the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture may meet with Russian officials to discuss another 
food-aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	March soybeans also fell in response to reports of continued  
good weather in South America. The market has already been 
pressured by predictions of near-record crops in Brazil and plans 
to plant more soybean crops in Argentina -- all of which would 
compete with U.S. crops. 
</P>
<P>
	March corn finished slightly lower, though the drop in grain  
futures prices was softened a bit as the dollar finished lower 
against major currencies in European trading. A weaker dollar can 
mean increased export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, wheat for March delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to  
$2.54 3/4 a bushel; March corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.13 1/2 a bushel; March 
oats finished up 1/2 at $1.01 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 1 1/2 cent 
to $4.86 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	March heating oil revisited the all-time heating oil futures low  
of 29.20 cents, which was first hit Tuesday, and then rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	March crude oil was hovering around $11.50 a barrel, above the  
overnight low of $11.26.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Organizers May Roll the Dice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Slot machines may take the place of  
disillusioned sponsors to help Sydney Olympics organizers fill a 
multimillion-dollar budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Battling a fall in corporate faith because of the widespread  
bribery scandal, the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic 
Games has revived the idea of using gambling to reach its revenue 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers are more than $130 million short of their goal  
of $568 million in sponsorships, part of an overall budget of $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	And while SOCOG president Michael Knight said Tuesday that ``You  
can run a pretty fantastic Olympic Games'' on what his group has 
raised, he added: ``You can do even better if you can get another 
couple of hundred million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing we want to do is go out and look positively  
and aggressively for that money,'' Knight said. ``If we don't (find 
it) we'll make the necessary adjustments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, with the Olympics' leading sponsors calling for broad  
reforms to retain their financial commitment to the games, SOCOG is 
looking again at legal gambling to help plug the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
	John Moore, the marketing official in charge of finding the  
missing millions for SOCOG, has floated the idea of slot machines 
installed in clubs with a percentage of profits going to the 
Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said any such link between gambling and the games would  
have to carefully walk the line between tackiness and valid 
fundraising technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want Olympic rings on (the machines),'' Moore told  
The Australian newspaper Wednesday. ``The various products that fit 
into recreational gambling, we've had a look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Knight said there was a ``fine line here between how  
you raise revenue and how you also protect the integrity of the 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slot machines were raised as one possibility then and received  
guarded support from IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said gambling on the games was not allowed but that sports  
in many countries were funded by lotteries and that was valid. 
</P>
<P>
	The New South Wales state opposition, engaged in a pre-election  
battle against the government, seized on the rehashed idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm calling on them to announce whether or not this is a  
serious proposal or whether, as it seems, it's a suggestion from 
somebody who knows little about gaming,'' opposition gaming 
spokesman Richard Bull said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slot machines in clubs and bars earn about $22,100, according to  
government figures. It would take 6,000 machines sending all their 
profits to SOCOG to make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG is expected to name two new sponsors after its monthly  
board meeting Thursday -- some rare good news for an Olympic 
community overwhelmed in recent months by the scandal centered on 
Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight rejected criticism of SOCOG's budget structure by  
International Olympic Committee marketing director Michael Payne 
and said he had no plans to back off a $65 million profit-sharing 
deal with the Australian Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne was Tuesday that SOCOG should consider plowing the profit  
back into the budget, automatically filling half its revenue gap. . 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said the deal was done and Payne should accept that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would have thought that Michael Payne would have had enough  
on his plate with IOC problems without giving Sydney gratuitous 
advice,'' the SOCOG official said.

<HEADLINE> Five Imprisoned in Marine Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Five white men who broke a black Marine's neck  
and left him paralyzed during a drunken, racist attack at a party 
were sentenced Wednesday to prison terms ranging from one to nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the men pleaded guilty to assault in the beating last  
May of Lance Cpl. Carlos Colbert, 21. The fifth man, 20-year-old 
Jesse Lawson, pleaded guilty to assault and the commission of a 
hate crime and received the harshest sentence after acknowledging 
that race was his motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in his wheelchair, Colbert rejected an apology from his  
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame y'all for what you did because y'all were  
taught'' to hate, said Colbert, who has trouble speaking because of 
his injuries. ``But you're apologizing because you got caught. You 
don't care about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Frederic Link sentenced Lawson to nine years. Trenton  
Solis, 18, Robert Rio, 23, Jed Jones, 21, and Steven Newark III, 
18, received one year in prison and five years on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert was one of a few blacks who attended a Memorial Day  
party at the home of a fellow Marine from Camp Pendleton. At least 
100 people packed the small house at Santee, 20 miles from San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	A fight broke out in the front yard, and the attackers punched  
and kicked Colbert while shouting racial slurs and ``White power!'' 
prosecutor Craig Rooten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooten said Colbert wanted the case to go to trial, but there  
were no streetlights to illuminate the fight, ``there were a lot of 
people involved, and there was a lot of alcohol involved, making it 
a difficult case to sort out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert's memory of the attack was that a fellow Marine went  
outside to help a woman who was hit by a ``skinhead.'' He said he 
heard the commotion, went outside to see what was happening and got 
jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of some of the attackers recently went on a radio  
talk show, saying their sons were coerced into confessing that the 
crime was racially motivated. They said it really was just a 
drunken brawl.

<HEADLINE> Intel Unveils Controversial Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. is showcasing more than 200  
new games, business systems and Internet sites to promote its 
controversial new computer chip that has been drawing criticism for 
its ability to send the serial number of an individual computer 
through the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters and industry analysts gathered in San Jose Wednesday  
to preview software and other products designed for Intel Corp.'s 
Pentium III microprocessor, available in personal computers at the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was part of a $300 million marketing campaign for the  
Pentium III, which will supply the brainpower for personal 
computers initially costing about $2,000. The Santa Clara, Calif. 
chip giant is touting the chip's features to persuade consumers to 
buy pricier machines instead of sub-$1,000 PCs, which make Intel 
far less money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentium III also will help Intel compete against Advanced  
Micro Devices Inc., a smaller underdog that lately has been making 
inroads into Intel's turf by selling chips to makers of the less 
expensive computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't really a push to promote a processor. It's more a  
push to arrest the slide down the slippery slope toward less 
expensive personal computers,'' said Van Baker, director of market 
research at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif. high-tech research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel leaked samples of the chips, using a code name ``Katmai,''  
to several hundred software and hardware developers about a year 
ago so they could invent games and business programs that depend on 
the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	After trying the array of computer products out for about an  
hour, industry analyst Nathan Brookwood said he was neither 
overwhelmed nor underwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm whelmed,'' he said. ``With this chip, everything is nice  
and smooth and glitzy,'' said Brookwood, who runs Insight 64, a 
Saratoga, Calif.-based consulting firm. ``The hardware guys give us 
more computer power. The software guys come along and find ways to 
soak it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Programs developed with the Pentium III don't do anything  
entirely new. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the past, 3-D images appeared jumpy and stilted on  
computers. Downloading complex programs through the Internet was 
slow. And speech recognition programs took hours to ``train'' 
before responding to a computer user's voice. 
</P>
<P>
	But images, video and sound can be downloaded off the Internet  
onto a Pentium III computer in seconds. Three-dimensional pictures 
appear vivid and clear -- users can virtually explore outer space or 
a local neighborhood with dynamic, realistic effects, or make 
animated videos, programming digital puppets to move and speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Speech recognition programs are much simpler to use, allowing  
users to create, edit and format documents without using a 
keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this chip, fighter jets in our games fly like they really  
do in the air, they maneuver in 3-D enabling us to enhance our 
customer's experience,'' said Kristen McEntire, a publicist for 
Electronic Arts, a maker of computer games. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel managers and product designers at the event tried to  
downplay concerns raised by computer privacy advocates about the 
new processor serial number, or PSN. This feature allows the 
Pentium III chip to transmit a unique serial number to Web sites 
that request it to help verify a user's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates fear this feature will allow Internet  
companies to gather private information from computer users about 
what they've been looking at. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel officials said those serial numbers will be  
transmitted only with a user's permission, and that they're urging 
computer makers to turn the option off when they ship the computers 
to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, developers noted that some Internet businesses will  
be giving computer users the option of sending scrambled code. For 
example, somebody using an Internet banking site may send an 
encrypted version of their serial number in order to access their 
account. That computer user who goes on to buy a book through the 
Internet could send a differently scrambled version of their serial 
number to the online book store.

<HEADLINE> CNN, WebMD Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- WebMD, a new, fast-growing Internet-based  
healthcare information business, is teaming up with the CNN News 
Group in a move that increase its profile while boosting the pool 
of health information on the group's online and on-air networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Tuesday, will include exchanges of online  
health information and joint development of interactive features, 
and on-air and online promotion of WebMD by CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is virtually no topic today that has more interest than  
health news. Personal health is the hot topic,'' said Tom Johnson, 
chief of the CNN News Group. ``You have just a proliferation of all 
types of providers in this field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the alliance will present an easily accessible,  
wide range of ``trusted information'' on health and wellness. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Arnold, founder and chief executive of Atlanta-based  
WebMD, said the CNN strategic alliance will ``add credibility to 
this effort to reach our goal of truly impacting this industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN is also obtaining an ownership stake in the company, which  
recently filed to make an initial public offering to sell stock, 
while WebMD is making a three-year advertising buy across CNN's 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold, 29, began a telemedicine business five years ago, but  
last year changed its name to WebMD and began offering physician 
and consumer health information on the World Wide Web. He raised 
more than $40 million and recently announced acquisitions of an 
online health information service and of a Web-based health 
information publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The entrepreneur has partnerships with about 30 other companies  
to provide subscribing medical professionals what he calls ``a 
one-stop solution site'' that can be used for everything from 
insurance eligibility checks to medical education to ordering 
medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're showing doctors that this is a tremendous  
timesaving tool,'' Arnold said, explaining that his WebMD Internet 
gateway is meant to allow medical professionals to avoid multiple 
searches. ``Doctors are pressed for time and they don't have time 
to go to each and every one of these sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer information link is free.  
</P>
<P>
	The association with CNN will help reach more consumers and  
professionals, Arnold said, adding that professional subscribers 
will be able to access CNN Headline News at WebMD's ``physicians' 
lounge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN News Group, owned by Time Warner unit TBS, includes Cable  
News Network and five other cable and satellite TV networks, plus 
an array of related news and information services, including CNN 
Interactive.

<HEADLINE> Strollers, crib mattresses recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strollers that can collapse and mattresses  
that can trap children in crib frames are being recalled by Cosco 
Inc., the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 children have been injured in Cosco's Geoby Two  
Ways tandem strollers, which collapsed after locks on folding 
mechanisms failed. Children can be injured by the resulting fall, 
or suffer cuts to hands or fingers if they are touching the locking 
mechanism when the stroller collapses. 
</P>
<P>
	About 57,000 of the strollers, made over the last 12 months,  
have been sold. The recalled strollers are model numbers 01-644 and 
01-645 (with car seat). Cosco is offering a free repair kit with 
two extra locking pins to fix the folding mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said 12 children were trapped, including one who  
was killed, when mattresses on Cosco tubular metal cribs collapsed 
and children slipped through 5-inch slats in the platform. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety commission says about 62,000 of the mattresses were  
sold between 1994 and 1997. The company is giving consumers $25 
checks to purchase new mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPSC said consumers should stop using the cribs or place a  
flat board approximately 27 inches wide and 51 inches long between 
the mattress and crib platform until they can get a replacement 
mattress.

	John Lounsbury filed his breach-of-contract lawsuit last month  
against Camby, now with the New York Knicks, and his agents, 
ProServ of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Lounsbury says Camby demanded money and gifts, including rental  
cars and jewelry, between October 1994 and April 1996 in exchange 
for a promise that Lounsbury would be Camby's agent once he turned 
pro after leaving the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe too much emphasis has been placed on the wrongdoing  
of agents and not enough attention has been paid to the 
irresponsibility and greed of these professional athletes,'' 
Lounsbury's lawyer, John Williams, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Damages will be determined by a jury if the suit goes to trial.  
</P>
<P>
	Camby's agent, Alex Johnson, said Camby had never agreed to be  
represented by Lounsbury.. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done everything in terms of owning up to the things he's  
done with John and the things he's done in the past,'' Johnson 
said. ``This is just a rehashing of everything all over again. It's 
frivolous'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby was the No. 2 pick in the 1996 NBA draft. He was chosen by  
Toronto and traded to New York before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1996, UMass alerted the NCAA that Camby may have  
committed violations by accepting cash and expensive jewelry from 
agents, including Lounsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby said he accepted thousands of dollars from Lounsbury in  
1995 and two necklaces and a diamond pendant from Wesley Spears, a 
Hartford lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	UMass was stripped of its 1996 NCAA regional championship and  
was forced to return the money it earned by making it to the Final 
Four of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Lounsbury agreed not to act as a sports agent  
for five years. That agreement with the state Department of 
Consumer Protection stemmed from his purchase of airline tickets 
for two University of Connecticut players, Ricky Moore and Kirk 
King. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Connecticut star Ray Allen, now with the NBA's Milwaukee  
Bucks, also has admitted receiving gifts from Lounsbury.

<HEADLINE>  Biletnikoff's Daughter Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- The man arrested in the slaying of  
the daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff once was 
convicted of kidnapping a former girlfriend but served no prison 
time, prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Haroon Ali was arrested as he tried to return to  
California from Mexico on Tuesday, the same day the body of Tracey 
Biletnikoff, 20, was found on a hillside at Canada College. She is 
one of Biletnikoff's five children. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Ali, who was driving her car, was arrested by  
immigration agents at San Ysidro running a random check of the 
license number, said Immigration and Naturalization spokesman Bill 
Strassberger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why he went down to Mexico and then turned around to come  
back, I don't know,'' Strassberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali will be returned to Redwood City in the next few days, when  
a decision about charges will be made, said Chief Deputy District 
Attorney Steve Wagstaffe at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff, Ali's girlfriend, disappeared early Tuesday. A  
friend called San Mateo police to report that the couple was 
fighting, but they were gone when the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance workers found her partially clothed body hours later  
near an empty parking lot while picking up garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali was convicted in 1996 of kidnapping a former girlfriend  
after she broke up with him, Wagstaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our office sought a state prison sentence for his conviction,  
but the defense sought no prison time,'' he said. ``They didn't 
want any jail time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, a native of Fiji, plead guilty to felony kidnapping and  
threatening bodily injury with a deadly weapon. A nine-year prison 
sentence was suspended and he spent a year in county jail. He 
remains on probation in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagstaffe said San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Margaret  
Kemp decided ``to give this guy a chance.'' In addition to 
probation, the sentence included a drug treatment program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagstaffe called the judge's decision ``reasonable'' and said he  
did not think she was ``light on criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy began Wednesday and was expected to take several  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Biletnikoff, 55, who has four other children, is in his ninth  
year as wide receivers coach with the Oakland Raiders. He played 
for the Raiders from 1965-78 and was named MVP of the 1977 Super 
Bowl after pulling in four catches for 79 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the team's all-time leading receiver with 589 catches  
until Tim Brown broke that mark two years ago. He led the NFL in 
receiving with 61 catches in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Biletnikoff, who lived with her father in San Ramon, and Ali  
were seen arguing outside a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center 
in San Mateo where she worked as a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	Police declined to give details of the killing.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Facing Pressure To Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton's impeachment trial fades  
into history, House Speaker Dennis Hastert is entering a period of 
decision-making on Social Security, taxes and other issues that 
will dominate the rest of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first six weeks on the job, the 12-year House veteran has  
remained mostly out of sight, favoring private strategy meetings 
with colleagues over television interviews. That has played well 
with Republicans eager to avoid the negative attention frequently 
attracted by Hastert's predecessor, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have in Dennis Hastert is the kinder, gentler  
speaker,'' Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., an old friend, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the impeachment trial over, Congress returns Monday  
from a one-week breather. The focus will be back on the bills and 
political maneuvering that will set the stage for the 2000 
presidential and congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hastert, R-Ill., that means forging consensus on  
high-profile issues that have divided Republicans, but that they 
want to use to demonstrate they have other priorities besides 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week will be crunch time for him,'' said Marshall  
Wittman, director of congressional affairs for the conservative 
Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other leaders have decided that the House will vote  
initially on bills dealing with African trade, cellular phones, 
anti-missile defense and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost overnight, there will be a recognition that we're back  
to business,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	But behind the scenes, the speaker will be seeing where the  
Republican votes are on marquee issues. These include the size and 
type of the tax reduction the GOP will seek, whether to postpone 
tax cuts until reaching a deal with Clinton on overhauling Social 
Security and whether to exceed spending limits enacted just two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those issues will be addressed in the fiscal 2000 budget  
that House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, plans to 
push through his panel by March 17. With Hastert saying he wants 
Congress to complete its budget work quickly this year, that leaves 
roughly a month for resolving those questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get our act together first,'' Kasich said.  
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP edge over Democrats is slim -- just 222-211, plus  
one Democratic-leaning independent and one vacancy. With just six 
GOP defections able to sink a bill, no speaker -- not even the 
forceful Gingrich -- could dictate decisions to Republican 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	By his nature and history, Hastert, an amiable 57-year old  
former high school teacher and wrestling coach, is not one to 
dictate positions anyway. Hastert, who until this year had risen no 
higher in the House than deputy whip, prides himself on building 
consensus behind the scenes, and that's what he's been seeking the 
past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Hastert has held countless meetings with other GOP  
leaders, committee chairmen and lawmakers, trying to divine the 
direction they should take. GOP aides say the speaker believes 
Republicans should initially engage Clinton in trying to revamp the 
politically sensitive Social Security program before tackling the 
GOP's trademark cause: cutting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	To help begin that process, Hastert, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and congressional Democratic leaders plan to 
meet with Clinton at the White House next week to discuss the 
year's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert has rarely been in public view since becoming speaker  
Jan. 6, when the new Congress was sworn in. He has gone home to his 
rural-suburban district near Chicago almost every weekend and will 
appear on a network interview program next Sunday for only the 
fourth time as speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he is nowhere near the GOP fund-raising draw that  
Gingrich was. His only venture into that world came last month when 
he attended several money-raising events in Miami during Super Bowl 
weekend, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who has stressed the need for bipartisanship in the  
post-impeachment atmosphere, has already surpassed Gingrich in 
reaching out to House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had a half-hour meeting in early January, and Gephardt  
said recently that Hastert has been ``much more forthcoming'' than 
Gingrich, with whom Gephardt had a frigid relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, Hastert and Gephardt have not followed through on  
the Democrat's Jan. 6 suggestion that the two men and their wives 
visit each other's congressional districts.

legends during an all-star tribute to her philanthropic works. The 
tribute was held at the Bob Hope Cultural Center in Palm Desert, an 
exclusive California resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Greg Kinnear debuted as the new host of NBC's

speaking via satellite, held up a pair of shoes and wished Kinnear 
luck in filling them. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: ``Titanic'' became the biggest moneymaker in movie  
history. The disaster epic grossed more than $919.8 million, 
breaking the previous global box-office record of $913.1 million 
set by ``Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dylan won three Grammys, including album of the year. His

named funniest supporting female performer in a TV series at the 
12th annual American Comedy Awards. Joan Cusack won for funniest 
supporting actress in a movie for ``In &AMP; Out.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken 10 years ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth Taylor is one of the last in the genre known as a  
real star. There are few people today who are stars.'' -- Actor 
Mickey Rooney, Miss Taylor's co-star in the 1945 classic, 
``National Velvet.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``To be behind the wheel of a car doing over 100 mph is one of  
the most exhilarating things I know. Racing is a way of being a 
happy child again.'' -- Actor Paul Newman. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken one year ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my upbringing. I don't smoke. I drink occasionally. I  
don't do drugs. I'd never ever do anything to embarrass my 
parents.'' -- Actor David Schwimmer.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower this morning, as investors  
picked apart Dell Computer's earnings and continued to sell 
computer-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 64.51 at 9,232.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 4.35 at 1,237.52, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was down 21.44 at 2,292.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 76.6 million shares, 
down from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow ended 22 points higher at 9,297.03, but only  
after giving up a 112-point gain in the morning, amid nervousness 
that Dell's fourth-quarter earnings, which were released after the 
close of trading Tuesday, would be found wanting. The Nasdaq 
composite lost 8.02 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's earnings met analysts' expectations of 31 cents a share.  
But its revenues didn't grow as much as analysts had hoped. Dell's 
shares were down 6 3/8 at 82 3/8 in leading nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related shares were lower. Microsoft was down 3  
11/16 at 152 9/16. Dow component Hewlett-Packard was down 5/8 at 69 7/8, 
after the computer maker released its own earnings Tuesday evening. 
Hewlett-Packard beat analysts' per-share expectations, but its 1 
percent revenue growth was too low to satisfy investors. IBM, 
another Dow component, was down 1 1/2 at 171. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot in the computer sector was Applied Materials,  
which was up 2 5/8 at 70 1/2 in heavy Nasdaq volume. Applied Materials 
posted operating income of 11 cents a share, above analysts' 
consensus target of 6 cents, but well below last year's 52 cents. 
Revenue fell to $742 million from $1.31 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.32 percent.  
European stock markets were mixed. In afternoon trading, Germany's 
DAX index was down 2.15 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.06 
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.60 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials dipped lower in late  
afternoon after hovering around unchanged for most of the session, 
and the Nasdaq composite extended earlier losses tied to 
disappointment over Dell Computer's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 9.33 at 9,287.70, having bailed out of a 77-point loss in the 
morning and risen as much as 68 points before dropping a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 6.23 at 1,235.64, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was down 48.52 at 2,265.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the big board by a  
7-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 
563.06 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the market's got to churn around for a  
while,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential. 
``We are testing the mettle of investors, especially in the 
Internet stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's fourth-quarter earnings, released late Tuesday, met  
analysts' expectations of 31 cents a share. But its revenues didn't 
grow as much as analysts had hoped. Dell's shares were down 8 at 
80 3/4 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related shares were mostly lower. Dow component  
Hewlett-Packard was down 2 3/4 at 67 3/4. The computer maker's earnings, 
also released late Tuesday, beat analysts' per-share expectations, 
but its 1-percent revenue growth did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Applied Materials, which also reported earnings late Tuesday,  
was up 1 3/32 at 68 31/32 in Nasdaq trading. Applied Materials 
posted operating income of 11 cents a share, above analysts' 
consensus target of 6 cents, but well below last year's 52 cents. 
Revenue fell to $742 million from $1.31 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were supported by industrial issues after  
the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production was 
unchanged in January after a lackluster 1998. Economists said the 
data doused fears that the central bank might raise interest rates, 
despite the fact that the Commerce Department also reported today 
that housing starts jumped a very strong 3.8 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component General Motors was up 13/16 at 83 7/8. Financial  
stocks, which benefit from lower interest rates, were higher as 
well, with American Express up 2 3/4 at 104 15/16. United Technologies 
was up 1 1/2 at 122 5/8. The company's chief investment officer confirmed 
Tuesday that United Technologies' automotive unit is up for sale.
