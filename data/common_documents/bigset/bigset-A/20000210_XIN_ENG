<HEADLINE> Wahid Calls For Greater Cooperation Among China, India, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid ended his two-day state visit here Wednesday
with a call for greater cooperation between China, India and
Indonesia to create a powerful block in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"In order to enable us to stay strong, there should be greater
cooperation between China, India and Indonesia," Wahid said at a
luncheon meeting organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he would concentrate on three countries in Asia --
China, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
Stating that his country had a special relationship with India
on political, economic and social fields, the president said that
continued dialogue between the two countries was important to
further deepen the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Now is has become possible for us to communicate to each other
and it is the only way to understand each other," Wahid said,
adding Jakarta was keen to strengthen economic cooperation with
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
According to an official press release, India offered to set up
joint ventures in Indonesia with buy-back arrangement or exports
to South East Asian countries for machinery, equipment and animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the Indonesia president, Indian minister of
state for heavy industries Vallabhai Kantharia offered India's
assistance to establish joint ventures in Indonesian in areas
including industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Wahid held wide-ranging discussions with Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on regional and global
situation, and on issues of mutual concern with special focus on
further strengthening of economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shibab said later that Vajpayee
told Wahid that India was keen on enhancing cooperation in the gas
sector in Indonesia while Indonesia said it was interested in
collaborating with New Delhi on giving a boost to its small-scale
industries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding for
cooperation in tourism, under which the two countries decided to
initiate steps to increase visitors to various tourist
destinations and attractions in each country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to exchange information relating to
incentives for tourist agencies, holding of conventions and
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Wednesday evening, the
Indonesian president said the two countries had decided to
establish a joint commission to upgrade bilateral relations and
further consolidate cooperation in various areas as well as a
working group to facilitate the implementation of the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The commission would be headed by the foreign minister of the
two countries, who would meet shortly in Jakarta to chalk out the
future course of action, Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, accompanied by his wife Sinta Nuriyah and daughter, was
given a ceremonial welcome soon after his arrival on Tuesday by
his Indian counterpart Kocheril Raman Narayanan, Prime Minister
Vajpayee and External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said last week
that India attached great importance to this visit in the context
of recent changes in Indonesia including a peaceful democratic
election, the first in over 30 years, in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indian media said that Wahid, the fourth Indonesian president
to visit the South Asian country, was keen in getting to know more
about the way India had handled the macro-management of its
economy while, in turn, India could exploit this visit to add
substance to its "look east" policy.
</P>
<P>
Though trade between the two countries increased from about 280
million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 1.4 billion dollars in 1996, the
potential to increase it manifold is yet to be tapped, Indonesian
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's India Visit Not Linked to Any Specific Issue: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled visit to India
by U.S. President Bill Clinton next month is not linked to any
specific issue, but aims at establishing a framework for a
qualitatively new relationship between the two countries, an
Indian foreign office spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that there are differences between India
and the United States on issues like non-proliferation, the
spokesman said "that does not preclude the two sides from having
close, productive and warm relations."
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to link the Clinton visit to any specific
issue, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said earlier this
week in Washington that the Clinton administration continues to
have very serious concerns about dealings on Kashmir and issues of
non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian spokesman said there are common interests in a large
spectrum of areas for the two countries, pointing to the fact that
the two sides had set up a joint working group on counter-
terrorism, discussed prospects of enhanced cooperation in the
energy sector and underscored the desire for bolstering bilateral
economic ties.

<P>
DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A special session of
International Jute Council (IJC) ended here Wednesday with no
instant commitment of the European Union to go ahead for a fresh
agreement for continuity of the International Jute Organization (
IJO).
</P>
<P>
The session of the IJC, the governing body of the IJO, was
convened to finalize a draft agreement which could not be passed
due to EU's stiff opposition, conference sources said.
</P>
<P>
The EU would inform the IJO secretariat of its final decision
on the issue before a crucial meeting to be held in Geneva, the
group's delegate told the session.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the session that the draft agreement and
other related issues would be tackled at a conference to be held
under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development(UNCTAD) in Geneva from March 27 to 30.
</P>
<P>
EU has 15 members in the 24-nation IJO, which was set up in
Dhaka in 1984. The organization will cease to exist unless a
successor agreement is finalized before April 11.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Records Lower GDP Growth in 1999: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew by 4.4 percent in 1999, about one percent below the
projected 5.5 percent and below the previous year's 4.7 percent,
Ghanaian Finance Minister Kwame Peprah told Parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister attributed the lower GDP growth to the
declining prices of cocoa and gold, the country's major cash
earners.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the year 2000 budget to Parliament, Peprah said that
most of the macro-economic aggregates were on target during the
first half of the year but they experienced sharp reversals as the
impact of the external pressures mounted in the second half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Due to unanticipated fall in commodity prices, inflation
increased to 13. 8 percent in December 1999, the Ghana News Agency
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Peprah projected an average GDP growth rate of 5.4
percent for the 2000-2002 medium term and an end-of-period
inflation rate of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
For the year 2000, a real GDP growth is targeted at five
percent, with an end-of-period inflation of 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said the projected five percent growth of GDP for the
year 2000 is based on a projected growth of 4.2 percent in the
agricultural sector, 5. 1 percent in industry and a 5.9 percent
growth in services.

<P>
KHARTOUM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Humanitarian Relief
Commissioner Salaf-Eddin Saleh expressed optimism about solving the
crisis of the hijacked plane and rescuing the passengers soon.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Sudanese government and the factions that
hijacked the aircraft are going well, Saleh told reporters on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft of the U.N. Food Program was hijacked in southern
Sudan's Fangak district late last week.
</P>
<P>
The passengers aboard are in good conditions, Saleh said,
expecting the problem would be solved soon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official revealed the irregularities of the U.N.
regarding the control of the "Life-Line Operation" in southern
Sudan, adding that the international organization would end these
irregularities at a proper time.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Sudan signed an accord prohibiting the transport of
military personnel on board U.N. planes.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Force militia that perpetrated the hijacking held
hostage four people including a U.S. national, a Sudanese and two
Kenyan crew in retaliation for three missing leaders of the militia
who were taken to an unidentified place aboard a U.N. plane.
</P>
<P>
The militia demands the release of the leaders in return for the
release of the four hostages and the hijacked aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Ukraine to Close Chechen Information Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday urged
neighboring Ukraine to take all necessary steps to immediately
halt the operations of a pro-Chechen information center in
southern Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"The existence and activities of the said center run counter to
Ukraine's official declarations of supporting the policy of the
Russian leadership to stabilize the situation in Chechnya," the
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a note, referring to the center
in Ukraine's southern city of Odessa under RUKh, a right-wing
nationalist movement.
</P>
<P>
The request was handed over to Ukrainian embassy representative
Stanislav Lazebnik in Moscow Tuesday, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the information center released a bulletin
entitled "Truth about the War in Ichkeria (Chechnya)," but Russia
said the bulletin "has not a single word of truth on the situation
in Chechnya," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It contains only concoctions with slander about the anti-
terrorist actions of Russian troops in that subject of the Russian
Federation. Moreover, it contains inadmissible offensive
pronouncements lashed out at the Russian leadership," Tass quoted
the Foreign Ministry as saying.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Assaults on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is a meaningful event, in as much as this point
represents a foothold on the path to control of the mountainous
part of the republic," presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Another rebel stronghold, Serzhen-Yurt, is almost completely
surrounded by the Russian military, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops have also established control over the Argun
and Vedeno gorges, dealing serious losses to rebels treating
toward Khatumi. A mine-clearing operation at the mouth of the
Vedeno gorge is underway, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
A hospital under guard and housing seriously wounded rebels was
discovered when federal troops combed through the village of
Oktyabrskoye. The rebel "Kavkaz" TV center was also found in this
village and put out of operation.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen fighters are losing centralized control and
becoming increasingly disorganized as many of their commanders
have been killed, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, federal troops wiped out 86 rebels and captured
23, Interfax reported, quoting the headquarters of the federal
forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal warplanes continued their bomb raids against
the rebels, flying some 200 combat missions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, over 30 fortified areas and
strongholds, three communication centers, nine automobiles, two
arms and ammunition depots, four reinforced firing positions,
three large-caliber machine guns and one air defense installation
were destroyed, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the air force created five obstructions in the
mountains and mined 30 kilometers of mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign last September following
two waves of armed incursions by Chechen rebels in neighboring
Daghestan and a series of apartment blasts, also blamed on Chechen
militants, that left more than 300 people dead in Moscow and two
other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told the
press that about 10,000 Chechen rebels have been killed since the
start of the federal forces' anti-terrorist campaign.

<P>
HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has put to rest the debate on whether the government will
close the cash- strapped Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency (Ziana)
as demanded by some quarters.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the president told the national news agency that
it is an "essential national institution" that should not be
closed.

Ziana, which gathers and disseminates local news in and outside
the country, has been under-funded for years receiving a
government grant of only seven million Zimbabwean dollars
(184,000 U.S. dollars) when it needed more than 18 million
Zimbabwean dollars (474,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> COMESA Moves to Boost International Confidence in FTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has intensified efforts to boost
international confidence in its Free Trade Area (FTA) to be
implemented on October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Director for Trade, Customs and Monetary Harmonization,
Charles Chanthunya said here Thursday that according to the
elements of the FTA, goods from non-COMESA states will be dutiable
at full national tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
Chanthunya said that trade remedy measures such as anti-dumping
duties have been introduced to safeguard the member states from
being dumping grounds for unwanted goods.
</P>
<P>
A competition policy will be implemented to ensure fair
competition among the COMESA members, he said.
</P>
<P>
To make the member states to be stable in trade growth, a
remedy for revenue loss in the goods supplied and to be sold has
been established, the COMESA official noted.
</P>
<P>
Chanthunya also said when the zero tariff is fully implemented,
 economies of scale are expected to rise due to the expansion of
the market.
</P>
<P>
He said the stiff competition among member states will lead to
the improvement of production methods.
</P>
<P>
The director appealed to the 21 COMESA member states to take
advantage of the free trade area as it will accelerate economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urged to Contribute to Uganda's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged the African Development Bank (ADB) to
contribute more to the development of his country.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the appeal when meeting with an ADB delegation in
Kampala Thursday, according to a press release from the
President's Office.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Museveni told the 11-men delegation that
industrialization of the country, development of resources,
modernization of agriculture and improvement of infrastructures
are the four main goals his government is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has started fulfilling these objectives
especially by introducing the Universal Primary Education program
in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ADB officials expressed their satisfaction with Uganda's
economic recovery and development, assuring Museveni that the bank
is committed to supporting vital areas necessary for the
development of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The ADB delegation is on a fact-finding mission and will
inspect projects partly funded by the bank.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Introduce Radical Quake-Resistant Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A science committee has
suggested the demolition of multi-storeyed buildings and
construction of two-storey ones in quake-prone western Turkey, the
Anatolia News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, led by Adapazari Governor Cahit Kirac, was formed
in the wake of two major earthquakes which hit western Turkey last
year.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made on an advice by the Adapazari
provincial Chamber of Trade and Commerce that buildings should have
at most two storeys in the province, which was the epicenter of a
devastating quake last August.
</P>
<P>
The ground of Adapazari is not solid enough for buildings more
than two storeys, said Erol Ozturk, executive board chairman of the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Adapazari Province, which lies on the coasts of the Marmara Sea
and the Black Sea, was severely hit by a 7.4-magnitude earthquake
on August 17, 1999. The tremor and an ensuing aftershock of 7.2
degrees on Richter scale killed 18,000 people and injured 43,000
others.
</P>
<P>
"The high buildings in our region, which is on the fault line,
form a great danger," said Ozturk.
</P>
<P>
"We have considered this fact, and thus advised the Science
Committee to demolish the buildings which have storeys more than
two. They have accepted our view and started the re-structuring
project," he added.

<HEADLINE> Talks With Palestinians to Resume Soon: Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister
Yossi Beilin said Thursday that the current impasse in the talks
with the Palestinians was not a crisis and he believed the
negotiations would resume "very soon."
</P>
<P>
"It's in our mutual interest to get a permanent solution in the
year 2000. We don't have too much time. We can not play on time. We
have to exploit every minute," Beilin said in an interview with
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations ground to a halt both on
permanent and interim issues following an unsuccessful summit last
Thursday between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks got nowhere as the February 13 deadline
for a framework agreement on permanent peace is at hand. On a
parallel track, the third and last-stage delayed Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank land under a September interim deal was not in
sight.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiators have said no more talks with Israel
before the Jewish state gave clear explanations to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said, however, that the two sides were still in contact
on daily basis and he believed the talks would resume after "a
short recess."

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were
injured Thursday in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on some
civilian and service installations in northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:30 (0730 GMT), nine formations of
U.S. and British warplanes coming from the Turkish airspace made 18
armed sorties over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces.
</P>
<P>
These U.S. and British jets bombarded some civilian and service
facilities in the region, injuring two civilians and damaging
properties, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi rocket forces and anti-aircraft units fired
at the invading planes and forced them to flee back to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.S. and British warplanes have intensified
attacks on Iraqi targets in the two no-fly zones in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, three Iraqi civilians were killed and eight others
injured when U.S. and British jets bombarded civilian and service
facilities in southern Iraq's Wasit province.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made 18,557
sorties over the two no-fly zones in Iraq and have targeted
regularly their civilian and military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, arguing they
were unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain without explicit
authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Israel Agrees to Attend Monitoring Group Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Grapes of Wrath
Monitoring Committee will convene in Nakura, Lebanon on Friday to
discuss the current escalating fighting between Israel and Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring group, comprising Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, U.S.
and French representatives, has the opportunity to hold the meeting
only after Israel give its consent, according to a statement issued
Thursday by Israeli Government Press Office.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initiated by Syria and Lebanon after Israel Air
Force (IAF) bombed Lebanese three power stations Monday night.
</P>
<P>
IAF claimed that air campaign was a retaliation for Hezbollah's
deadly attacks on Israeli army's outposts in South Lebanon in the
past two weeks, which had led to the deaths of six Israeli soldiers
and a senior commander of Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Beirut argued that IAF reprisal raids were "
barbaric aggression against civilian targets" and violated a 1996
ceasefire understanding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered agreement to end the Israeli operation, called
Grapes of Wrath, in Lebanon, in which 200 Lebanese civilians were
killed, forbids attacks on civilian targets or launching attacks
from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak insisted during
Israel's security cabinet meeting that it was Hezbollah that first
violated the understanding by opening fire from villages.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli right-wing politicians even urged the government to
allow the IDF to act on the basis of operational imperatives, and
not in accord with the Grapes of Wrath understanding, which they
said have lost their relevance.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Opposes Selling Water from Southern Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said he opposes selling water from the Seyhan and Ceyhan
rivers in the south to the Middle East as Turkey is not a water-
rich country, Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made at a time when water of Turkey's Euphrates
River has once again come onto the agenda of the now-stalled
Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, a hydraulic engineer and expert on water issues,
stressed that Turkey has been facing a water shortage problem in
irrigating its Amik Plateau due to Syria's refusal to allow water
to flow from the Orantes River, near Hatay on the Syrian border,
into the region.
</P>
<P>
He said, therefore, that other alternatives must be used in
order to meet Turkey's irrigation requirements, including the
launching of various projects by the State Waterworks Authority
involving the Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers to irrigate the plateau.
</P>
<P>
"If we now say we can sell water from the Seyhan and Ceyhan
rivers to the Middle East, we may fail to fulfill that pledge in
the future due to our own requirements from those rivers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Last month Turkish acting Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet
Atacanli ruled out any bargaining on Turkey's Euphrates River water
as part of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, he named the Seyhan, Ceyhan and Manavgat rivers as
possessing water that Turkey can sell to other countries.
</P>
<P>
As there is internal confusion in Turkey on the issue of water
sales, Ankara has been extremely uneasy over U.S. and Israeli
policies that place water from Turkey's Euphrates River as a key
issue in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the policies, if Turkey, the upstream country of Euphrates
River, allows more water to flow from the river to Syria, Israel
will be in a better position for a solution to the Golan Heights
problem.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
war. The heights are the main source of water to the Jordan River
and border the Sea of Galilee, which provides Israel with one-third
of its drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and Syria have been ground to a halt last
month due to differences over the fate of the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Greater Mekong Subregion Welcomes Private Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Greater Mekong Subregion (
GMS)is entering a new era of cooperation that will provide
increased opportunities for both the public and private sectors, a
GMS Business Workshops said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said in his
keynote speech on the opening day of the workshops Thursday that
the private sector must play a more prominent role of investment
in the countries along the Mekong river.
</P>
<P>
"We must enlist the support of the private sector and business
communities. In many cases, infrastructure and other investments
will best be undertaken in partnership with the private sector,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshops are aimed at revitalizing interest in business
opportunities in the GMS as the region recovers from the economic
crisis and regains the economic dynamism of the early and mid
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that after some years of slow progress, a new
spirit had emerged among the GMS countries.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis has prompted increased attention of our
GMS countries to economic reforms, including ways to improve
competitiveness through more efficient use of capital, labor and
natural resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context," he added, "the door is now widely open for
further advances of business in GMS economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
According to Rodolfo Severino, Secretary-General of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the involvement of
private sector into GMS development is one of the challenges the
subregion will have to face.
</P>
<P>
He also listed other challenges faced by GMS including the
development of human resources, the building of institutions
compatible to free market and the adaptation to the rapid
transition into market economies.
</P>
<P>
The GMS groups the riparian economies of Yunnan Province of
China,Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam with the aim
of maximizing the comparative advantages of each country for the
benefit of all.

<HEADLINE> EU Looks Into Next 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Skills mismatch and knowledge
paradox turned out to be the key concerns as the European Union
looked into the next 10 years of its future.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has to cope well with the two concerns in
its advance into the 21st century, the Joint Research Center of
the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union,
and the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior researchers from the two institutions told an EU-wide
conference that accelerating technological change and an aging
workforce with skills that need updating can lead up to a
situation where a need for skilled personnel and unemployment are
coinciding and that technological skills will be needed in future
at a point where not enough young people are born to learn them
and where the contribution of the older generation is urgently
needed to cover the gap.
</P>
<P>
The two concerns were drawn from the result a research study
conducted by the two institutions that examine the key driving
forces of change that will affect the daily life and society of
the union.
</P>
<P>
The researchers called for, in accordance with their findings,
a reform of the current education system and described such a
reform as indispensable.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a new social pattern will emerge within the
next decade and they called it "mosaic society" which blurs the
boundaries between work and leisure and changes the family context
as most people know it at the time being.
</P>
<P>
At the conference which ends Friday, the researchers also
directed the European Union's attention to such issues as
information and communication technologies, life sciences, the
single currency, globalization, the aging population, the emerging
24-hour society, increased health cost, enlargement and
environmental changes.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Turkish Claims of Aircraft Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday rejected claims
in Turkish media that Greek warplanes had in the past two weeks
harassed Turkish jets on training missions over the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Denying the Turkish claims, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said at a press briefing that on the contrary, Turkish
fighter planes Wednesday violated Athens' flying information
region (FIR) and Greek national air space between Limnos and
Lesvos in the northeastern Aegean, and the Turkish jets were
intercepted by Greek fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government condemned Ankara's such absolutely
negative behavior, he said, adding that this practice showed that
there was still a long way before the commitments undertaken by
Turkey in the Helsinki European Union (EU) summit were met.
</P>
<P>
Noting the improvement in relations between the two countries
had been dramatic, Reppas said that Greece would continue the
efforts for the consolidation of peace in the region, but would
not negotiate on its sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their territorial dispute in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem, but the two neighbors have since last June begun
to improve their strained ties, with the holding of several rounds
of low-level dialogue, the exchange of visits by the two countries
' foreign ministers and the signing of nine bilateral cooperation
agreements.
</P>
<P>
To resolve their Aegean dispute, Turkey has recently made a
proposal regarding the creation of a joint military-diplomatic
committee between the two long-time rivals, but Greece has
indicated that they will cooperate militarily with Turkey only
within NATO and other international organizations, fearing that
any other deal could imply the questioning of Greek sovereignty in
the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and Foreign Minister George Papandreou will meet respectively with
their Turkish counterparts on the sidelines of a summit of
southeastern European countries that begins in Romania this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that the Bucharest meeting between
the two premiers will aim at maintaining the present state of
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes U.S., UK Shift of Attitude on Yugoslavia Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- France welcomed Thursday the
shift of attitude by the United States and Britain on a possible
lifting of air embargo on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Our American and British partners are approaching the French
stand. Better late than never. This is a belated but welcome
response to the proposals which were made by (French Foreign
Minister) Hubert Vedrine since last November," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook suggested Wednesday lifting the air embargo
on Yugoslavia while tightening other forms of sanctions aimed at
the Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the foreign ministers of the 14 other
European Union (EU) countries in November, Vedrine proposed that
sanctions which directly touch the Yugoslav people be alleviated
while those targeting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
his associates be tightened.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign minister then wrote to his 14 counterparts of the
European Union to tell them his approach in terms of the sanctions
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to meet the
demands of the Serb opposition," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers will discuss the issue during their
meeting next Monday in Brussels and a decision is expected to come
out of the meeting, she said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been imposing since the Kosovo crisis an air embargo
on Yugoslavia, which bans European air companies from flying to
the country.

</P>
<P>
Greece believes that the sanctions against Yugoslavia has
proved counter-productive while crime and smuggling are also on

<P>
In this year's "Economic Report of the President," the
administration praised itself for the country's good economic
times, with both unemployment and inflation turning in the best
performance in three decades.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the American economy is stronger than ever," President
Clinton said in the economic report. "More than 20 million new
jobs have been created since Vice President Gore and I took office
in January 1993," the president added.
</P>
<P>
The five-page economic report, prepared by the president's
three-member Council of Economic Advisers, contained details of
the administration's updated economic forecast, which formed the
basis of the budget surplus projections released Monday along with
the budget.
</P>
<P>
The administration projects the gross domestic product, the
economy's total output of goods and services, will slow this year
to a growth rate of 2.9 percent, when measured from the fourth
quarter of each year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the slowdown will occur because of an expected
decline in the rate of growth of consumer spending. Consumers,
bolstered by the low unemployment and a soaring stock market, have
been spending with purchases outstripping income growth for the
past seven years, a fact that pushed the personal savings rate to
a record low of 2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Martin Baily, chairman of the president's economic
council, said spending cannot continue to outpace incomes and for
this reason the economy should slow this year.
</P>
<P>
Part of the economic strength has come from a remarkable jump
in productivity growth. The surge in productivity is credited as a
major reason that workers' incomes have shown significant
improvements without triggering higher inflation. Employers have
been able to boost wages and pay for it with the increased output
rather than resorting to higher product prices.
</P>
<P>
But the president's economic report sounded a note of caution
about how long this nearly doubling in the rate of productivity
will last.
</P>
<P>
The president's economists said rather than predicting a 2.9
percent annual gain in productivity, they foresee annual gains
will slow to 2 percent, still better than the 1.4 percent average
for the two decades after 1973.
</P>
<P>
While growth will slow this year, the administration sees no
chance of a recession on the horizon even though the expansion is
now in its 107th month, breaking the record of 106 months set by
the long boom of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
There are no economic imbalances that threaten a downturn, such
as inflationary pressures or an overhang of unwanted business
inventories, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The most likely prognosis is therefore the same as last year's:
sustained job creation and continued non-inflationary growth," the
economic report concluded.

<HEADLINE> Trimble, Ahern Discuss N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First
Minister David Trimble and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
Thursday held talks in Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace
process, saying the peace deal could be saved.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work at the problems but I do have to
emphasize that they are just problems and that people would be
wrong to regard this as a terminal crisis in the agreement,"
Reuters quoted Trimble as saying after meeting Ahern in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"There are efforts continuing and we must obviously hope that
those efforts will produce a positive result," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were part of the last-ditch efforts by British and
Irish leaders and Northern Ireland politicians to find a way of
ending a row over Irish Republican Army (IRA) disarmament that
could wreck the new home-rule government in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain's House of Commons and House of Lords have passed
the emergency legislation allowing the suspension of the two-month-
old power-sharing Northern Irish Assembly the IRA agrees to start
disarming.
</P>
<P>
"I'm conscious of time but regardless we must work on and if we
can find resolutions now, great. If not, we'll just have to keep
at it," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who is also leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionists,
has vowed to resign as first minister if the IRA does not disarm.
If Britain does not intervene, that could come at a crucial
meeting of his 850-strong party council Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Political sources in Belfast did not rule out a fresh IRA
statement on the arms deadlock. But as the clock ticked closer to
the Friday deadline set by Britain, there was still no word.

<HEADLINE> Russia Repeats Opposition to NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian military
official Thursday reiterated Moscow's staunch opposition to the
eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
.
</P>
<P>
"We view the strengthening of the North Atlantic alliance as a
movement toward resuming the Cold War and confrontation," said
Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, who heads the Russian Defense
Ministry's Department of International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Russia is not afraid of the NATO expansion. "
We will find a way to ensure our security and the security of our
allies in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)," the
Interfax news agency quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently commenting on NATO Secretary General George
Robertson's recent statement that Moscow has nothing to fear from
the alliance's eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said he regrets NATO actions which are leading to "the
militarization of Europe, the expansion of attempts to interfere
in the domestic affairs of sovereign states, and manifest military
force."
</P>
<P>
"This trend has become more clear since NATO's aggression
against Yugoslavia," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow froze its ties with NATO when the alliance launched the
78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia, but limited contacts were
resumed on the peacekeeping operation in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia calls for "the joint construction of a model of European
security with the participation of all European nations," Ivashov
said. "Security should be ensured on an equal measure for all
participants in this process."
</P>
<P>
"The development of multilateral cooperation, rather than the
buildup of 'military muscle,' is the vehicle for the construction
of a new model of European security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, the NATO head, is expected to come to Moscow around
February 16 in an event that marks the resumption of ties between
Moscow and Brussels, and the two sides are trying to iron out
their differences over the contents of a document to be signed
during the visit, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Moscow wants the document to set out the current state of their
relations and the reasons behind the "freezing" in them, Interfax
said, citing military and diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that restoration of ties with NATO must be
predicated on two conditions: interaction within the framework of
the Kosovo peacekeeping must be intensified to fully implement U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1244 and joint decisions must be
reached on the most important aspects of European security.
</P>
<P>
NATO, however, insists that the document to be adopted in
Moscow must unambiguously announce the complete restoration of
relations between Russia and NATO without mentioning the reasons
why they were "frozen" in the first place.
</P>
<P>
If the differences over the document persist, Robertson's visit
to Moscow might be postponed, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges Namibia to Give Evidence of its Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Thursday
urged Namibia to share information it had on allegations of South
African help to the Angola anti-government forces.
</P>
<P>
The question of the alleged help was raised during South
African Deputy Defence Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge's
meeting with Namibian Deputy Home Affairs Minister Jeremiah
Nambinga and Permanent Secretary for Defence Erastus Negonga in
Windhoek, said Sam Mkhwanazi, South African Defense Ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Namibia was urged to share its information so that the claims
could be investigated, otherwise they might only be regarded as
perceptions, Mkhwanazi said.
</P>
<P>
There have been allegations that some South Africans were
helping Angolan rebels in their fight against the government. But
the South African government has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the north of Namibia, from where Angolan
government forces are launching some of their attacks on rebels,
was also discussed, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Several people, including civilians, have already been killed
there.
</P>
<P>
Madlala-Routledge would also meet Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week South African Defence Minister Mosiuoa
Lekota said the South African government was extremely concerned
about the instability in Angola and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would make a serious effort "to
persuade our neighbors and friends that we should settle to some
agreed patterns of resolving this problem", he said.

<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's first
consumer court will open and to award costs against unfair business practice,
according to Moeletsi.
</P>
<P>
"The power of the court is to give redress to the individual

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Appeals for Flood Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique Thursday launched an
emergency appeal for 2.7 million U.S. dollars required for rescue
operations and immediate relief for the victims of catastrophic
flood in the south and centre of the country.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the appeal at a meeting with donor representatives,
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said that the immediate
priority is to save the lives of people trapped by the floods.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is urgent to get 100 inflatable rubber dinghies
that can be used to navigate along the swollen rivers, rescuing
people at risk of drowning, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the appeal also includes 1,000 life-buoys and 2,000
life-jackets.
</P>
<P>
Other items include tents and tarpaulin to provide shelter for
the tens of thousands of people made homeless, and generators to
provide electricity for the accommodation centres.
</P>
<P>
Many homeless people in Maputo and other cities are
accommodated in schools, but they will have to be evacuated before
next Monday, a date set by the Ministry of Education for reopening
the schools.
</P>
<P>
Simao stressed that these are merely the most pressing needs.
They do not include relief food for the displaced (which the
government is obtaining through arrangements with the U.N. World
Food Program), or any work on restoring the roads, bridges and
other infrastructures damaged by the floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also requested those governments with access to satellite
images of central and southern Mozambique to make them available
so that the Mozambican authorities can make a full assessment of
the damage caused by the floods.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Luisa Diogo, the reconstruction
work wild the
capacity of the Mozambican state budget, she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the name of the donors present, the United Nations
Development Program resident representative Emmanuel Casterle
expressed " deepest sympathy" for the Mozambican government and
people, saying he is " very impressed by the way the population is
coping with the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
"We also greatly appreciate the government's efforts to respond
to the needs," he said. "I am sure that the international
community will help you meet these needs very quickly".
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains in the southern and central part of Mozambique
since last Saturday have killed dozens of people, with the traffic
and communication systems seriously destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about several hundreds of thousands of
people have been affected by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: UNITA Threatens to Take War to Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebel National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has threatened on
Thursday to take the war into the neighboring country Namibia,
according to local informed sources.
</P>
<P>
In telephone calls to some foreign institutions, the rebel
secretary- general Paulo Lukamba "Gato" said that the rebel
decision is a response to the Namibian military support for the
Angolan government troops.
</P>
<P>
"We regret the situation," said Lukamba, but adding that given
the alliance between Luanda and Windhoek, UNITA accepts the
challenge and ceases to recognize the common border, considering
the entire area as a zone of war.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, the Angolan government troops have
reportedly crossed the southern border with Namibia for pursuing
the rebels in flight, who have been hiding in northeast Namibia
after a general offensive in late 1999 launched by the government
troops in the central and south Angola.
</P>
<P>
Lukamba also refused to accept the government's plan of
realizing general elections in the next year, saying that the
possible elections would be a "farce".

<HEADLINE> One Quarter of Angolans Suffer Endemic Goitre: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two and a half million
Angolans, accounting for 25 percent of the total population, are
suffering from the endemic goitre mainly due to the insufficiency
of iodine in their dietary, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A major part of the patients are living in the central and east
 provinces controlled by the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola during the 25-year-long civil conflict,
said UNICEF in a document.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, although Angola approved a decree on
the iodation of all the salt for human and animal consumption in
March 1996, so far the distribution of iodized salt around the
country continues to be limited.

In order to address the situation, a three-day specialized
meeting, the first of its kind, is being held in Mombasa, Kenya
among the manufacturers and distributors of salt, African
government officials and agencies of the United Nations, with an
aim to look for a mechanism to eliminate the disease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Rise Sharply Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims
for jobless benefits in this country rose last week to their
highest level in a month, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 301,000 people filed new claims for
unemployment benefits for the week ending Feb. 5, up by 27,000
from the previous week. It was the highest level since Jan. 8,
when claims were at 311,000.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the department blamed a portion of the rise on
recent snows that buried the East and parts of the South,
resulting in the loss of some jobs, but they had no specific
information. However, some economists had been predicting claims
would rise as people dug out from the snow and made it into
unemployment offices to file claims.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out week-
to-week volatility, dropped sharply last week to 276,250, the
lowest level since Dec. 15, 1973, when claims were at 256,750.
</P>
<P>
Because of an extremely tight labor market, some high-tech
employers are turning to citizens of other countries to fill key
positions. Efforts are under way in the U.S. Congress to increase
the number of temporary visas granted to foreigners with college
degrees.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report also said that for the week ending Jan. 29,
31 states and territories reported increases in new jobless claims
applications, while 21 reported decreases. The state data lag a
week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest increase was New York, an area hit
hard by the snow, rising by 3,586 while the state with the biggest
decrease was Alabama, down 5,377.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Russia Agree to Continue Peace Treaty Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Russia agreed on
Thursday to continue negotiations on how to resolve their long-
standing territorial dispute and on the conclusion of a peace
treaty within this year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and visiting Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov reached the agreement during a 30-
minute meeting, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi stressed the need for the two countries to "sustain the
peace treaty negotiations under past agreements in a bid to
further develop bilateral ties," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov handed to Obuchi a letter from Russia's acting President
Vladimir Putin, who reaffirmed his commitment to concluding a
peace treaty by "inheriting the course" set forth by former
president Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and Ivanov, however, did not discuss the Russian foreign
minister's earlier controversial remarks to the media that the
peace treaty may not be concluded this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure for a three-nation Asian tour on Tuesday,
Ivanov told a Japanese news agency that concluding a treaty "
depends largely on the extent to which we are prepared to be
flexible, to consider reality objectively, not to create illusions
in respect of the possibilities of achieving decisions in a set
time frame detrimental to their content."
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia have hit a snag in negotiations between
foreign ministers and their deputies because of the differences
over how to resolve the territorial row.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's resignation at the end of last year dimmed the
prospects for progress as Japan had pinned its hopes on his
personal commitment to rejuvenating the negotiations through a
visit to Japan that had been planned for this spring.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Russian-held islands of Etorufu, Kunashiri and
Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets has prevented the two
countries from signing a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Britain Confirms 60 Hijack Hostages Seek Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain confirmed on Thursday
that 60 people from the hijacked Afghan jet and their 14
dependents are seeking political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Jack Straw told parliament
that no promises about asylum or any other matter were given
during the long negotiations for the hijackers' surrender.
</P>
<P>
"The surrender from the plane was unconditional," Straw said,
adding that he would personally rule on any application for asylum
made by those who were on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like all the passengers to leave Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Subject to compliance with all legal requirements I would
wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as
soon as reasonably practicable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has chartered a plane from the Bangkok-based Kumpuchea
Airlines to fly home those who wish to return to Afghanistan. The
plane will arrive at Stansted Airport north of London by early
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Officials said some of the hostages may fly back to other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 passengers were released from the hijacked Boeing 727
airliner before dawn Thursday, ending the five-day hijack drama
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The plane owned by Afghanistan's national carrier, Ariana, was
hijacked on Sunday during a domestic flight from the capital Kabul
to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
It arrived at Stansted Airport early Monday morning after two
stopovers in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and one in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada to Add More Flights Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada has decided to add
more flights abroad and cut domestic routes this summer in a bid
to save up to 400 million Canadian dollars (about 277 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Citing a new schedule by Air Canada, "The National Post"
newspaper of the country said Thursday that the United States is
the top priority country with additions of 30 routes, 11
destinations and 380 flights weekly.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-bound air additions will help boost 14 percent of its
capacity on international flights, including those from Edmonton
to Los Angeles, Montreal to Denver and Montreal to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 percent capacity will be added to flights between
Toronto and Hong Kong, Toronto and Munich, Vancouver and Mexico
City, Toronto and Honolulu as well as Toronto and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Domestic routes will be cut by 15 percent, including those
between Saskatoon and Winnipeg, Regina and Calgary, Saskatoon and
Toronto as well as Moncton and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The flight schedule rearrangements came after Air Canada took
control of Canadian Airlines in a deal of 92 million Canadian
dollars (64 million dollars).

<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- France on Thursday welcomed the
agreement reached between the Senegalese government and the
opposition and wished that the February 27 presidential election
in Senegal will be "incontestable".
</P>
<P>
"The agreement reached Wednesday in Dakar on the control of
electoral card index is good news," said Anne Gazeau-Secret,
spokeswoman of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement goes in the direction of serenity and
transparency which is necessary for a good carrying out of the
electoral process," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Senegalese Interior Minister General Lamine Cisse and the
coalition of opposition parties Wednesday reached an agreement on
the electorate's card index, a key dispute between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The opposition had previously accused the interior minister of
trying to manipulate the card index and issue false voter cards to
help outgoing President Abdou Diouf who has been in power since
1981 and running for another seven-year term.

<HEADLINE> Northern Israelis Permitted to Leave Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Israeli northern
border towns were permitted Thursday morning to leave their bomb
shelters following three nights underground, as fears of Katyusha
rocket attacks by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas seemed to be eased.
</P>
<P>
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers with loudspeakers told
residents that they could step outside and return to their normal
life, while Businesses and some schools in the area were also
permitted to reopen, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the alert-lift order made by IDF
commanders was linked to media reports that through secret
diplomatic channels, Hezbollah had promised not to fire rockets
into Israel in response to the Israel Air Force strikes against
Lebanese infrastructure targets.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Hamidi, a journalist for the international newspaper in
Arabic, Al-Hayat, Wednesday quoted a senior Syrian source as saying
that Damascus had contacts with Hezbollah during the last days and
urged the guerrillas to refrain from attacking Israeli civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
Some commentators in the Arab press also suggest that Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon, is acting to prevent further
escalation in south Lebanon, which shows that Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad had not given up hope of peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, some Israeli military sources maintained that it was
Israel's threats of massive retaliation for any rocket attacks on
the northern border that had deterred Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
warned Wednesday that "the soil of Lebanon will burn" if Hezbollah
fires Katyusha rockets on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason behind Hezbollah's self-restraint is, the
residents in the north are now under the blue skies again.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, they had been locked in their bomb shelters or
security rooms, complaining about shortages in basic supplies and
the difficult living conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of northern Israelis had already opted to leave and
stay with relatives in the south.
</P>
<P>
The forced shutdown of businesses in the area is also taking a
heavy economic toll, with the economic damage estimated at 10
million shekels (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) a day.
</P>
<P>
The current tense situation along the borders between Israel and
Lebanon was the result of escalating skirmishes in South Lebanon,
in which Israel set up a buffer zone in 1985 with a self-declared
aim of protecting its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim
militant group fighting against Israeli occupation, escalated its
activities in the region and killed five Israeli soldiers and a
senior commander of Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, on Monday and Tuesday night, Israeli troops struck
at suspected Hezbollah targets, power stations supplying
electricity to Beirut and other Lebanese cities, wounding at least
two dozen civilians and leading to a total damage cost at 200
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU to Give Further Aid to Venezuela Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it has made an extra two million euro (some two
million U.S. dollar) humanitarian aid available for the victims of
floods and mudslides that hit Venezuela at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the aid, non-governmental organizations will be able to
restore drinking water to those affected and provide psycho-social
support for children, said the executive body of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Providing clean drinking water is a top priority to prevent
epidemics from breaking out among those forced out of their homes,
said Poul Nielson, EU Commissioner for Development and
Humanitarian Aid.
</P>
<P>
"Children are among those most profoundly traumatized by this
disaster. That is why they need psycho-social support to help them
resume a normal life," he added.
</P>
<P>
The aid, which is expected to fund emergency projects for the
coming three to six months, brings the funding for the crisis-hit
Venezuela people to a total of 5.6 million euros so far.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50,000 people lost their lives when the worst-ever
flooding and mudslides hit the Latin American country last
December. Another 200,000 people were left homeless.

between India and Pakistan could improve only if Pakistan's chief
executive General Pervez Musharraf changes his attitude toward
India, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
"I pray to God that he has a change of heart," Panja was quoted
as saying at a press conference held in the southern coastal city
of Madras.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Musharraf regime was proving to be a "
stumbling block" in doing business, Panja replied: "Yes, unless he
changes his modus operandi".
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to
India, he said that India would present "clear, cogent evidence"
on "Pakistan's role" in the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC-
814 in December.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that Pakistan is a terrorist state, a rogue
state, possibly he (Clinton) will also be convinced," said Panja
in response to a question whether India would ask the United
States to declare Pakistan a "terrorist state" during Clinton's
visit.

<HEADLINE> Pest-Resistant Cotton Developed in India Through Genetic Engineering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists claimed on
Thursday that they have developed a new variety of cotton which is
resistant to the bollworm pest through genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
The new variety, dubbed LRK516, has been tested in greenhouses
and is now awaiting permission for field trials across the country
from the Review Committee for Genetic Manipulation under the
Department of Biotechnology, said the scientists.
</P>
<P>
The genetically engineered cotton contains a gene called CRY1AB
that codes for toxins against the cotton bollworm. This gene has
been isolated from Bacillus Thuringiensis, a common soil bacterium
in India which produces proteins that are toxic to major insect
pests, explained Dr. R.P. Sharma head of the Biotechnology
Research Center of the Delhi-based Indian Agriculture Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The field trials for the new cotton are scheduled for June,
while its developers are also applying for patents in Europe and
the United States, added Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in India cotton consumes half of the total
pesticides used to contain bollworm or other pests. Insect pests
have also become a major problem haunting the production of other
major Indian crops.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has recently
announced the launch of a major project to develop genetically
engineered cotton, rice and pigeon pea that are resistant to major
devastating pests.
</P>
<P>
The project is one of 19 such projects undertaken by the ICAR
under a 914-million-rupee (21.26 million U.S. dollars) World Bank-
aided National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP), ICAR
Director General Dr. R.S. Paroda told reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of these NATP projects is to use biotechnology to
develop crop varieties that are high-yielding as well as resistant
to major pests, which will minimize their pesticide requirement
and be environmentally safe, added the ICAR head.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 Kenyans flocked to
the international airport in the capital Nairobi Thursday morning
to receive the remains of their beloved ones killed in the Kenya
Airway plane crash off the coast in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire on
January 30.
</P>
<P>
Among the ten bodies arriving at the airport at 11:00 a.m.

</P>
<P>
Also arrived were two other bodies, one Zambian and one
Burundian.
</P>
<P>
A brief memorial ceremony was held at the airport.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Kenya Airways Chairman Omolo Okero, who
escorted the bodies of the victims back from Abidjan, assured the
victims' families, relatives and friends that his airline would
provide better service to customers.
</P>
<P>
So far only 96 bodies out of the 169 who perished in the plane
crash have been recovered and only 81 of them have been

<HEADLINE> 60 Afghans Hijack Hostages Seeking Asylum Amid Conspiracy Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua)-- At least 60 hostages released
from a hijacked Afghan plane are seeking political asylum in
Britain, raising suspicion that the hijacking drama might be a
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The plea was made shortly after the hijack ended peacefully
earlier Thursday with only minor injuries to some of the 150
people on board, a BBC report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted Home Office sources as saying that some 60 people
released from the plane are seeking asylum. But the report was not
confirmed by the Home Office.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot confirm or deny that report," a Home Office spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Jack Straw was
due to make a statement to parliament in Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
British media said that many of the passengers on board the
Boeing 727 jet were trying to get away from war-ravaged
Afghanistan to enjoy the benefits of Britain's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
It was fueled with comments by the head of Afghanistan's Ariana
airlines, which owns the hijacked aircraft, who said the hijackers
could be linked to some of the passengers in an asylum conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The asylum theory gained ground because the hijackers were
reported to have made no significant threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
During the past three days, the hijackers asked nothing more
than food and water from British police. No special political
demand was made at all and no hostage was treated violently.

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- British police said on Thursday
that 19 people had been arrested following a peaceful end to the
hijack of an Afghan airliner to Britain.
</P>
<P>
David Stevens, police Chief Constable in charge of the hijack
crisis, said his officers had recovered four handguns, five knives,
a knuckle-duster, two detonators and two grenades which did not
appear to have fuses in them.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that the hijackers had not made any
political demands until the final hour of negotiations, when they
had expressed "concern about the political situation in
Afghanistan".
</P>
<P>
There had been moments of extreme tension during the
negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The five-day hijack of an Afghan airliner ended peacefully just
before dawn on Thursday without casualties among about 150 people
on board.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked while flying on a domestic route in
Afghanistan last Sunday and landed at the Stansted airport in
north of London early Monday morning after stops at two Central
Asian airports and Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embrace Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A festive air has swept across
China during the week-long Spring Festival holiday which started
on February 5.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese lunar calendar, February 5 is also the
first day of Spring.
</P>
<P>
This year's festival celebrations have seen a revival of
tradition Chinese culture. In the northeastern city of Dalian, a
port city which has developed an international reputation for its
annual fashion show, residents enjoyed calligraphy, painting and
puppet shows. Many this year are sporting traditional Chinese
jackets, vests and "qipao" or cheongsam.
</P>
<P>
In the suburbs, folk ballads and regional operas are more
popular than ever. Some well-off farmers have raised funds to
invite folk art troupes.
</P>
<P>
Nanning, capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, has witnessed a booming book sale during the holiday
period. The region is densely populated by ethnic minority groups.
There were many young avid readers in the spacious four-story
Nanning Bookstore. All libraries and reading rooms were open
during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
People in southwestern Sichuan Province embraced the Year of
Dragon with dragon dances. Zhou Jian, a 30-year old famous dragon
parade craftsman said that "in the popular Chinese imagination,
the dragon is one of the oldest mythical creatures." Zhou's dragon
products sell extremely well in China and are also given to
foreign friends as valuable gifts.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been doing brisk business in China's southern and
eastern regions. The number of tourists to visit Fujian Province
during the holiday period more than tripled that of the same
period last year. Some 150,000 people in south China's Guangdong,
China's N0. 1 economic powerhouse, chose to spend the holiday
traveling. Hotels around China have been crowded with parties and
family reunion dinners.
</P>
<P>
In Qidong City in east China's Jiangsu Province, some 30 luxury
hotels and restaurants were booked out by farmers on new year's
eve. People in the famous scenic city of Hangzhou preferred
stylish countryside inns in bamboo groves or tea gardens to gather
and celebrate the new year.

<HEADLINE> World Longest Ancient City Wall Gets Facelift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
given a facelift to the world's longest ancient city wall, which
winds through Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province in east China.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months they have dug up wild plants, weeds and
small trees growing along the wall and repaired cracks according
to a detailed plan. They said moisture from the plants' roots
would erode the structure.
</P>
<P>
So far, 19.8 kilometers of the wall, a famous scenic spot in
the city, have been preserved intact.
</P>
<P>
The original city wall was built over 2,400 years ago. The
section that remains, with a total length of 33.67 kilometers, was
built over 600 years ago. It ranges in height from 14 - 20 meters
and in width from 4 -10 meters. It has undergone five restorations
in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing is one of the most well-known ancient cities in the
country, and was home to 10 dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing wall is 0.7 kilometers longer than Beijing's city
wall and 1.7 kilometers longer than the wall in Paris.
</P>
<P>
To better protect their wall, Nanjing City established the
world's only city wall history museum.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Israeli Raids on Lebanon's Civil Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has vehemently condemned
the Israeli air strikes on Lebanon's civil targets, calling them "
treacherous Zionist aggression," the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman for the Ministry of Information and
Culture said in a statement that "this malicious act proves anew
that the Zionist entity cannot change its racist aggressive essence
and cannot abandon the language of killing, destruction and
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"All allegations of peace settlement and slogans of
normalization which this entity concocted are but flimsy and feeble
covers to perpetuate its occupation of the Arab territories," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman slammed the United States for its bias toward
Israel's aggressive trend, saying Israel used the American bias as
a political cover to continue the usurpation of Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
He described the Israeli air strikes against Lebanon as a
flagrant violation of all international norms and values and the
international treaties including the understanding signed in April
1996 which prohibits targeting of civilians and civil institutions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes struck three power stations across Lebanon
early Tuesday in retaliation for recent attacks by the Lebanese
guerrilla group, Hezbollah, in which five Israeli soldiers were
killed. A six soldier died in a Hezbollah rockets attack Tuesday,
hours after the Israeli raids.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raids have reportedly led to a dozen civilian
injuries and extensive material loss.
</P>
<P>
"This terrorist Zionist aggression on Lebanon requires a unified
decisive Arab stand capable of confronting the imperialist Zionist
challenges with high national spirit of responsibility and serious
Arab solidarity," the spokesman concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- One Palestinian was killed
and another seriously burnt Thursday near the West Bank town of
Nablus when a explosive device they were assembling exploded,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Palestinian security sources as saying the two
were members of the militant Islamic group Hamas. The blast was
believed to have been a "work accident" of the militants preparing
a car bomb or other incendiary device, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups opposing the
Israeli-Arab peace making have launched a series of attacks, mostly
suicide bombings, against Israelis in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Israelis were injured in a latest pipe bombing on
January 17 in the northern coastal city of Hadera, for which
militant Palestinian groups were blamed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has stepped up its
cooperation with Israeli security facilities in an effort to
prevent major terror attacks from derailing the peace process.

<HEADLINE> IPU Meeting Opens to Offer UNCTAD Parliamentary  Dimension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- National parliaments are
crucial partners for the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) in dealing with the globalization, UNCTAD
Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the opening ceremony of the two-day
Parliamentary Meeting on the Occasion of UNCTAD X, co-organized by
the Thai National Assembly, UNCTAD and the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
The 10th Session of UNCTAD (UNCTAD X) will be held here between
February 12 and 19 and the meeting will focus on issues such as
globalization, trade liberalization, trade in service, electronic
commerce and competition policy.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said the IPU meeting was held in "a crowning moment"
for both IPU and UNCTAD to ensure that the global economic and
development issues are given greater attention by parliamentarians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the gap between parliamentarians and people
conducting international negotiations should be narrowed so that
the results of international negotiations can be translated into
national legislation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said he hoped concrete measures will be found during the
UNCTAD X and the Parliamentary Meeting in order to "better prepare
all countries for the challenges of globalization which, in the
past, has affected developed and developing countries unevenly,
helping some while hindering others."
</P>
<P>
"For this to happen, the benefit of globalization must be fully
harnessed, while its hazards minimized," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Meeting, which ends on Friday, will present
its views and proposals to the UNCTAD X.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia for No Trade Issues Linked with Politics at UNCTAD Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said Thursday the UNCTAD
meeting to be held in Bangkok beginning Saturday should not mix
trade issues with politics.
</P>
<P>
"The developing nations cannot accept it and the world cannot
afford to make a trade agenda into a political field," she told
reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
Any multilateral meetings should be prevented from being abused
by any party for political purpose, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said developing countries should continue to use
platforms like UNCTAD to voice their opinions and views on the
international issues.
</P>
<P>
"If we are discussing trade, we should take into account the
difficulties of the developing countries and their limitations in
terms of capacity and the problems faced by them in meeting
certain conditions and criteria and the suitable programs that can
be conducted for them to increase their capability," Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would outline its views on the globalization process
from all angles including its advantages and disadvantages as well
as the ways developing countries could properly deal with the
process, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the views of developing countries were very
important and if abandoned, its consequences will be felt.
</P>
<P>
To a question on Malaysia's formula for the UNCTAD meeting,
Rafidah said a formula was not required but it was important that
the meeting is well balanced and parties without any "standing" be
given the opportunity to include their agenda.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Special Envoy Arrives in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The new U.N. special envoy
on Afghanistan, Frances Vendrell, arrived in the Afghan capital of
Kabul Thursday for talks with senior Taliban officials, Afghan
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Vendrell, a Spanish diplomat appointed the U.N. secretary-
general's special envoy last month, said he would meet with the
number two man in the Taliban hierarchy, Mulla Mohammad Rabbani,
and Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his first visit to Afghanistan was to hold talks
with the Taliban authorities and hear their views, Vendrell said
at the Kabul airport.
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to form my own views about the situation in
Afghanistan and after I have formed my own views, I may be able to
develop some ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vendrell is on his first tour of the region which he began last
Thursday from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Tajikistan, he held talks Tuesday with former
Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was ousted by the
Taliban in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
He also met with former Afghan defense minister Ahmad Shah
Masood, whose opposition fighters have been fighting the Taliban
militia in northeastern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The last U.N. special envoy resigned late last year after
failing to secure any peace deal to end two decades of fighting in
the war-ravaged country.

<HEADLINE> Jurong Island Termed Symbol of S'pore Enterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong Wednesday praised the thriving chemical
base of Jurong Island as symbol of the country's national
enterprise and attributed its success to entrepreneurship instead
of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the official opening of Jurong Island Road Link
connecting to the mainland of Singapore, Lee said Jurong was
associated with Singapore's bold move to industrialize the economy
starting in 1960s and has become synonymous with national
entrepreneurship and a symbol of national enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Lee was referring to the fact that the island from merger of
seven small islands has been transformed from swamps into
industrial land and the Jurong Industrial Estate today.
</P>
<P>
Jurong Island is now a thriving chemical island with a cluster
of 55 companies and investments in fixed assets worth some 21
billion Singapore dollars (about 13 billion U.S. dollars). The
output for the whole industry on the island was a record 30
billion Singapore dollars (about 18 billion U.S. dollars) for 1999,
contributing over 22 percent to the country's total manufacturing
output.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the infrastructure put on the island
has helped bring this out, Lee emphasized that " The key to Jurong
Island's success was not infrastructure. It was entrepreneurship,
conceiving the project, translating the vision into reality and
taking the risks involved in such ambitious venture."
</P>
<P>
The Singapore cabinet approved the amalgamation of the seven
existing small islands off Jurong, southwest of Singapore's
mainland, with a vision to create a world class petroleum and
chemical facility on the island and this includes the development
of a road link and road network system that would further boost
and optimize the competitiveness of Jurong Island.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3-kilometer long Jurong Island Road Link was designed as
a dual, 4-lane carriageway to serve an anticipated peak traffic
volume of 5,000 passenger car units per hour and construction
works commenced on February 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The road link partially opened on March 31, 1999, and fully
completed by early 2000 at a cost of about 300 million Singapore
dollars (about 180 million U.S. dollars). The opening of the road
link will result in lower costs and higher productivity for
companies on the island.
</P>
<P>
Lee also announced that the Jurong Town Corporation plans to
develop a major chemical logistics hub on Jurong Island to provide
integrated logistics support to rapidly growing number of chemical
companies on the island.
</P>
<P>
"Operationally the chemical logistic hub will plug into the
global grid," he said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to be Summoned Again by Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting demands to
continue its probe into former president Soeharto on corruption
case,Indonesia's Attorney General Office Thursday said it will
summon Soehato next Monday for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Director for Corruption cases at the Attorney General Office,
Chairul Imam, has sent a letter to Soeharto to undergo
investigation as a suspect in corruption case, (the investigation
will take place)on Monday, February 14, 2000 at 10:00 (local time)
at the attorney general building," Antara news agency quoted
spokesman of the attorney general office, Soehandoyo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, investigation into Soeharto had been ceased by then
acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to 'lack of evidences'.
</P>
<P>
The move, however, triggered angry from many parties nationwide
who believed that the 78-old man was responsible for rampant
corruption in the country during his 32 years rule.
</P>
<P>
But, the incumbent attorney general Marzuki Darusman decided in
December last year to reopen the Soeharto case and said that his
office found new evidences.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki also said his office was revoking a letter issued by
Ismudjoko on October 11,1999 suspending the investigation into
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto as a president, who had the authority to issue
government and presidential decrees, is suspected of misusing his
authority as a means to collect money to finance the foundations
he chaired, and for the benefit of his family and cronies...which
directly and indirectly caused state losses," Darusman said weeks
after he was appointed by president Abdurrahman Wahid to be
attorney general in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
The probe into Soeharto was initiated in June 1998, one month
after he stepped down amid political and economic crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Monday's investigation will be the second time for Soeharto. On
December 9, 1998, Soeharto was questioned at the Jakarta's Higher
Prosecutors Office over alleged corruption, collusion and
nepotistic practices.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Soeharto and his family have amassed a 15
billion U.S. dollars fortune.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of opposition party
members campaigning for the introduction of multi-party system in
Uganda demanded Thursday that the referendum on whether to adopt
multi-party politics be postponed for six months.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Ocheger, Chairman of the Multi-party National Referendum
 Committee, said that the referendum should be held six months
after the scheduled June to let all sides have enough fund, Radio
Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Constitution provides for the referendum at the
expiry of the fourth year of current Parliament which has been in
place since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ocheger said that the Electoral Commission had not released any
money to his group and demanded that the commission give his group
an equal amount of money it had given to the ruling National
Resistance Movement (NRM).
</P>
<P>
Ocheger also called for the immediate passing of the Political
Organizations Bill, which he said was crucial for the holding of
the referendum and equal funding of all sides.

<HEADLINE> Thirty People Die of Famine and Lack of Water in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAOGADISHU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty people, mainly
children and elderly people, have died of famine and lack of water
in Bulo Hawo district in the border region of Gedo, Somalia since
the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is still increasing as the dry season has just
begun and the rainy season is still two months away, according to
a report released by Bulo Hawo district commissioner Nur Matan
Abdi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The people are dying of thirst and famine-related diseases
after most of the shallow water wells dried up and the
communication between the towns became difficult for insecurity,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the death toll has especially increased with the
beginning of the dry season in which even the domestic animals
have also begun dying for lack of pasture.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the region indicated that large food aid supplies
for Gedo region remains stuck across the border in Kenya in the
town of Mandera. The food aid has been there for several weeks
now, but could not move forward for the insecurity prevailing in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Abdi said the local authorities of Gedo region are
now pledging full collaboration with the international aid
agencies putting their differences aside for the common interest
of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration could now guarantee the security of
the aid workers and their properties during their humanitarian
activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Similar humanitarian difficulties are being reported in the
neighboring regions of Bay and Bakol, where the lack of water and
food shortages have also reached a critical level.
</P>
<P>
The intermittent clashes around Lower Shabelleh region and the
serious insecurity along the road leading to the central regions
are making it difficult or even impossible for the humanitarian
supplies to reach the two regions.
</P>
<P>
A large convoy of food aid donated by CARE-International
destined for Tieglow district of Bakol region were twice ambushed
in Hiran region late last month.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Prevention of Arms Race in Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The prevention of an arms race
in outer space (PAROS) has every reason to be one of the highest
priorities on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament (CD), a
Chinese official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hu Xiaodi told the CD plenary session that as a
unique multilateral disarmament negotiating body, the CD should
concentrate on the most pressing, most prominent issues that have
the greatest bearing on international peace and security in the 21
st century.
</P>
<P>
PAROS is just such an issue, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
A UN resolution has reiterated that the CD has the primary role
in negotiating multinational agreements on this issue and setting
up an ad hoc committee as early as possible during the 2000
session, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation believes that the CD should establish
the committee in line with the wording of a specific proposal
tabled by the Chinese delegation in March, 1999, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along maintained that the exploration and use of
outer space should only serve to promote the economic, scientific
and cultural development of all countries in the world and benefit
the whole mankind," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"China has always opposed arms race of any kind, including arms
race in outer space. This basic position remains unchanged," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the tentative ideas on new international legal
instruments on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms
race in outer space, Hu said that the Chinese delegation believes
that the new instruments should include the following basic
elements:
</P>
<P>
-- purposes, basic obligations, definitions, national
implementation measures;
</P>
<P>
-- international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space,
verification measures, appropriate mechanism for dispute
settlement, transparency measures;
</P>
<P>
-- other "procedural articles" commonly contained in
international legal instruments, such as articles on amendment,
signature, ratification, entry into force, etc.
</P>
<P>
"These are only preliminary ideas that may help inspire
thoughts, promote further discussion and consideration in this
regard and facilitate relevant negotiations," Hu said. "The
Chinese delegation will actively participate in such discussions
and negotiations with an open mind."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China is greatly concerned
about the worsening of the situation in South Lebanon, said
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China expresses its deep regret over the injuries
suffered by innocent civilians and the heavy losses of property
caused by the Israeli bombing of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks when asked to comment on the recent
escalation of the conflict between Lebanon and Israel, which led
to the Israeli bombing of Lebanon, resulting in the injuries of
dozens of people and extensive loss of property.
</P>
<P>
China has called on parties concerned to restrain themselves
and to take measures to end the situation as soon as possible, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Chinese Government has always maintained that
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon should be
respected. Israel should implement the No. 425 Resolution of the U.
N. Security Council and withdraw its troops from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has entered a crucial stage, Zhu
said, adding that all parties concerned in the Middle East should
stop any action which is not conducive to the Middle East peace
negotiations so that headway may be made in the Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Doctrines for Malaysian Military to Stay Out of  Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense
Minister Najib Tun Razak said Thursday that the military has to
embrace and uphold two doctrines to keep Malaysia constantly out
of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The first doctrine should lead to making the Malaysian armed
forces a deterrent force and the second would entail confidence-
building measures to ease regional tension and suspicion, Najib
said when opening a course for 40 senior military officers at the
Armed Forces Staff College here.
</P>
<P>
He said the second objective could be achieved through
bilateral and multilateral dialogues, joint military exercises and
exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said safeguarding national sovereignty and preserving
regional security depended much on adopting these doctrines in
tandem.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian military still lacks several strategic assets
like submarines and tanks although it has acquired advanced
fighter aircraft and frigates since the modernization of the armed
forces began in the 1990s, Najib told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
He said although Malaysia would avoid being seen as having an
offensive capability, acquiring these additional assets would be
crucial for safeguarding national strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the military would get larger
allocations for the Eighth Malaysia Plan period (2001-2005),
partly to realize the objectives of these doctrines.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Won't Be Silent Over Pressures:  Kostrad Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Army's Strategic Reserve
Command (Kostrad) will not be silent in facing pressures, rumors,
condemnations or opinions that tend to corner the Indonesian
Defense Force (TNI), Lt. Gen. Djadja Suparman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Kostrad, as an operational unit, can't be silent. It
should learn why these pressures, rumors and condemnations of the
TNI came about," Suparman said in a village in Kebumen district,
Central Java province.
</P>
<P>
Many quarters have recently been trying to corner the TNI by
giving it pressures, creating rumors, and making condemnations,
the Kostrad chief was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Suparman, who was appointed as the Kostrad chief at the end of
last year, is a close friend of Coordinating Minister for
Political and Security Affairs Gen. Wiranto who has been under
pressure to step down after a report issued by the National
Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) held the former TNI chief
responsible for what it said was a "crime against humanity" in
East Timor in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Kostrad, Suparman added, never involves itself in politics,
but it has to follow the latest political developments.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the Kostrad would react to moves which undermine the
credibility of the TNI, he said the Kostrad will make an "
introspection."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Pledges to Escort Govt Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
will ensure the implementation of all the government's policies,
and do its best to support the ongoing democratization process in
the country, TNI Chief Adm. Widodo A.S. said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"TNI supports very much the (new) government. TNI will ensure
the implementation of the government policies entirely," he told a
House of Representatives (DPR) commission on security and foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for TNI not to support the government which
has been elected through a democratic process," Widodo said,
reiterating that it is also impossible for TNI to launch a
military coup against President Abdurrahman Wahid, as feared by
some foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
"We will also support what the people said is a supremacy of
civil. Here actually, I hope there will be no longer doubt (from
any parties) that TNI will have a problem with a civil society.
TNI will always support a civil government like this (President
Wahid's administration), because it has been established based on
a constitutional way and full of legality," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the president's statement that about 10 percent
of TNI personnel were not loyal to Abdurrahman Wahid, Widodo said
such a statement had to be considered as a warning from the
president to TNI.
</P>
<P>
"And we will consider the statement as a warning. It (the
statement) will be taken (by TNI) as an input for further
correction acts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wahid said that some 10 percent of TNI officials were
not loyal to him, and they might launch a move to undermine his
leadership.

<HEADLINE> Thailand a Model of Conquering Financial Crisis:  U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's success in getting
out of the Asian financial crisis can serve as a model for other
nations involved in the turmoil, visiting United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand was among the first to feel the brunt of the Asian
financial crisis but is now showing the way out of it through
economic and political reforms that can serve as a model for other
nations experiencing the same difficulties," Annan said at a
luncheon hosted by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is here to attend the 10th session of the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), also praised
Thailand's cooperation with the organization, saying the country
made "a range of important contributions" to the U.N., including
hosting the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific and actively participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations
around the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand has done "a superb job" in helping UNCTAD to
stage the 10th session, which he called an "all-important
conference on trade, development and the future direction of the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan said at the luncheon that Thailand
attaches highest importance to the U.N. because he believes that
only through a partnership at the global level can the well-being
and prosperity of mankind as a whole be promoted.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that lasting peace and security
around the world can only be attained if all countries achieve
comparable levels of economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Wednesday to pay a four-day visit to
Thailand. During his stay, he will also attend the UNCTAD meeting,
which will be held from February 12 to 19 in Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Most French People Support Nuclear Deterrence Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the French people
support the maintenance of a nuclear deterrence policy by France
and participation by French troops in military operations abroad,
said a poll published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the SOFRES polling institute from
December 27 to 30 among 1,000 people above the age of 18, showed
that most French people support the establishment of a common
European defense force.
</P>
<P>
More than one third of the people polled don't rule out the
outbreak of another world war in the coming 10 years, although
most of them think the security situation in Europe has improved
since the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
As for the potential risks faced by France, 64 percent of the
people polled are concerned most about a rising of religious
extremism, 41 percent are worried about terrorist attacks in
France, 40 percent think nuclear proliferation poses a major
threat and 35 percent are concerned about the situation in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two percent of the French people think that France should
keep its defense budget at the same level as it is now, while 33
percent want it to be lowered and 8 percent want an increase, said
the poll.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of the French people support the
maintenance of nuclear deterrence policy, which was first
elaborated by General Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s, while 22
percent think that the evolution of international situation allows
France to drop the policy.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said recently that the
maintenance of a "sufficient and reliable" nuclear force is the
ultimate guarantee of the French nation's survival.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine percent of the French people prefer a common
European defense policy, while 29 percent said each of the 15
European Union countries should keep its own defense policy,
according to the poll.

<HEADLINE> Labor Cost Highest In Belgium, Report Says  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The most expensive place for
companies to hire workers in the industrialized world is Belgium
due to high pay and tax levels, according to a latest report
released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
In a survey of its 29 members by adding labor costs to employer
social-security contributions, the OECD said payrolls in Belgium
amounted to 40,995 U.S. dollars per worker in 1998, followed by
Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 countries with the highest overall payroll costs,
European nations occupied seven places. Belgium employment costs
were 4.75 times the level in Hungary, the cheapest among the 29
OECD members.
</P>
<P>
Now the unemployment rate in the 11-country euro zone is 9.6
percent, while the rate in Belgium is 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgium came in second in a separate OECD survey of
taxes paid by individuals on what they earn, with 42 percent of
wages going to the government in income tax and social-security
contributions. The top tax level is in Denmark, where 43 percent
of employees' salary go to the state in income taxes and social-
security charges.

<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday called for the
quick nomination of a new general director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to succeed Frenchman Michel Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finance Christian Sautter said

succeed Camdessus in the IMF post, traditionally reserved for a
European.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment on the possible nomination of German
Caio Koch-Weser to the post.
</P>
<P>
"I confirm to you that Europe could find a candidate who would
be perfectly suitable to fulfill its function," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sautter also said that the IMF should resume immediately talks
with Russia after the country holds its presidential election next
month.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Issues Guidelines to Protect Online Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Fair Trade
Commission Thursday issued guidelines to protect e-commerce users
amid increasing complaints from consumers buying goods online.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, shopping center and mall operators will
be fined up to five million won (some 4,440 U.S. dollars) if they
post commercial ads consumers do not want and they will also be
fined for failure to notify delays in delivery.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also allow buyers to cancel purchases within 20
days of delivery if the products are different from their
description on the sites and consumers can review contracts before
signing up for membership at cyber shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sellers are required to confirm receipts of orders
and accept requests for changes in orders or cancellations for a
certain period following the initial placement of orders.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines include clauses to protect consumers in the
event of cyber shopping malls unilaterally changing services or
ceasing operations.
</P>
<P>
For security, operators have to seek approval from consumers
before collecting personal information on them and take
responsibility for leakage of data.

<P>
CAIRO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday morning chaired a meeting
of the Ministerial committee for giant national projects.
</P>
<P>
The president discussed with ministers agricultural policy, East
Port Said project, and other giant projects, namely Toshka, East
Uwainat, Darb Al-Arbayeen and a number of other agricultural
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said priority should be given to construction of container
quay and to using biological fertilizers instead of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- President Mubarak said the situation in the Middle East
remains deadlocked even after Ehud Barak had assumed premiership in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Paris March magazine in its Thursday edition,
Mubarak said that Syria had proposed, as a basis for negotiations,
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south lebanon but that the
israelis initially wavered before they ultimately refused the
Syrian overture.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that the Syrian demand was just and
called on israel not to place preconditions for negotiating a
pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- President Mubarak received Wednesday a message from Japanese
prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on inviting Egypt to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The president was said to be full aware of the importance to
sign such a treaty but it is difficult that Egypt would endorse it
if Israel would not.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- President Mubarak will open later this month a major economic
conference of the Common Market of the Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Attending the February 28-29 gathering, to be held upon Egypt's
suggestion, are presidents of Kenya and Zambia and king of
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
"The conference is the first of its kind and is aimed at
enhancing the regional and international awareness of the COMESA
group," said Ibrahim Ali Hassan, the assistant foreign minister for
African affairs.

<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A self-made bomb exploded in
front of a department store in Cotabato, the southern Philippines
Thursday morning, killing a pregnant woman and seriously wounding
14, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The wounded included an army man and a one-year-old girl, PNA
said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which exploded around 10:35 a.m., was reportedly
placed inside a plastic bag and deposited at the customer's
baggage section of a superstore in the town of Kabacan, Cotabato
province.
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts said the explosive was made of a mechanism of an
81 mm mortar shell that was attached to a timing devise based on
scattered shrapnel recovered in the scene of bombing.
</P>
<P>
The blast reportedly had connections with Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels, who were exchanging gunfire with
the government troops starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabacan Mayor Wilfredo Bataga revealed having heard earlier
threats from local MILF commanders on the possible bombings of
Kabacan and other neighboring towns.
</P>
<P>
Two other MILF commanders had also threatened to take him
hostage because of his stand against the setting up of MILF camps
in his area, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cotabato Governor Emmanuel Piol condemned the "terrorist act,"
vowing that he would do everything in his power to bring to
justice those responsible for the incident.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong indication that this is a diversionary
tactic of the MILF because they are defeated in the ongoing battle
with government troops in Carmen and they want to avenge the
deaths of their fallen fellows," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting occurred after the government and the MILF
failed to reach agreement during their first round of peace talks
held in Maguindanao, another Mindanao province, late January.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has long been fighting for the establishment of an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, which the government
opposes.
</P>
<P>
A red alert has been raised around Cotabato following the
bombing in Kabacan.

<HEADLINE> Heads of State Involved in Congo Conflict to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A regional summit on the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is to be held later this
month to review the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement, Uganda's New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama
Mbabazi as saying that the exact date and venue are to be set very
soon.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi, who is also chairman of the Joint Political Committee
established under the Lusaka agreement, said that the summit would
be attended by heads of state involved in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports of fierce fighting on both sides in the
DRC since the Lusaka agreement was signed in July and August last
year.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders, who attended the United Nations Security
Council's special meeting on the DRC issue last month, failed to
persuade the world body to send peacekeeping force to the DRC
soon.
</P>
<P>
They must reaffirm their commitment to the implementation of
the peace accord, Mbabazi said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Premier Soccer League Averts Cash Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Premier
Soccer League (PSL) appears to have averted a cash crisis by
reaching final agreement with the South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC) to sign a three-year television deal worth 110
million rand (18.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The deal was finalized last week between our and the SABC's
lawyers," PSL finance committee convener George Scalcoyannis was
quoted by local newspaper The Citizen on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The board of governors will meet on February 15 and it will
just be a matter of rubber-stamping the deal. It has not been
signed as yet because people are out of the country at the African
Nations Cup tournament."
</P>
<P>
The 18 premier league teams stood to benefit from the TV deal
to the tune of two million rand (330,000 U.S. dollars) each.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A part of missing Israel Air Force (IAF) navigator Ron Arad's
body was secretly passed to Israel last month, Europe I radio and
the Voix Du Nord newspaper report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Journalist George Malbrunot, quoting sources in Beirut "close to
the transactions surrounding the search for Arad", said that the
transfer via German diplomats was linked to the release of five
Hezbollah prisoners by Israel on December 26.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Yonatan Yosef, grandson of Shas spirituel assisted by police
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Yosef, 21, is suspected of being the leader of an extremist
right-wing group and of collecting weapons for the organization.
</P>
<P>
Yosef's lawyer Naftali Werzberger said the arrest was
politically motivated because his grandfather has absolute
authority to decide the policies of Shas, the second largest party
in the ruling coalition, on the peace talks with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- With an expected Hezbollah Katyusha reprisal for the IAF
attacks on Lebanon over the last two days not forthcoming, some
analysts guessed that Syria, who still hopes to reach a peace
agreement with Israel, stopped the Hezbollah at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. came down strongly on Israel's side, saying the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was justified in its attacks on
Lebanon. President Bill Clinton said Wednesday that it is clear
that the bombing is a reaction to the deaths of two separate
instances of IDF soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the 1987 recommendations of the Landau commission,
Israel's General Security Service interrogators continued to use
excessive force during interrogations and lie about their methods
over the next five years, during which time the state comptroller
investigated their activities.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, conducted between 1988 and 1992 under former
state comptroller Miriam Ben-Porat, was completed in 1994 but
withheld from publication until a Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense subcommittee agreed to release a nine-page
condensed version Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Special Envoy for Cyprus to Arrive in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Alvaro de Soto, the United
Nations mediator for the proximity talks on Cyprus, will take up
residence on the island in June, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Peruvian Alvaro de Soto was appointed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy for Cyprus and Chief
of Mission of the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
The acting U.N. chief of mission on the island, James Holger,
said on Wednesday that de Soto will take over from him and become
the U.N. Secretary-General's special representative in Cyprus after
the third round of proximity talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
Holger said the next round of indirect talks between President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, set to
begin on May 23, "could be open-ended."
</P>
<P>
De Soto will arrive for his first visit on February 29, staying
for a week until March 7.
</P>
<P>
Holger called the visit a "familiarization" or "orientation"
visit, including only "courtesy calls" on Clerides and Denktash and
no actual negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controled north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the divided island, the two sides on Cyprus have held
two rounds of proximity talks under the U.N. auspice in New York
and Geneva respectively.
</P>
<P>
No concrete results have been announced, but both Clerides and
Denktash said they were satisfied with the progress made.

ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
received a letter from his Austrian counterpart Wolfgang Schussel,
in which the latter assured Ankara of safety of Turks residing in
Austria, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Ambassador to Turkey Ralph Scheibe delivered the letter

<P>
The ambassador disclosed to reporters that Chancellor Schussel
in the letter told Ecevit that there is no reason to be concerned

"Schussel assured Ecevit that there will be no change in the
Turks' current situation, and I think Prime Minister Ecevit
accepted the message optimistically," he added.

<P>
On Saturday, Ecevit said that Turkey, a European Union

Ecevit expressed his hope that the new government in Austria

<HEADLINE> Kenya Wants to Extradite Drug Baron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A drug baron suspected of
trafficking 4. 7 tons of hashish will be brought to Kenya from
wherever he hides, Kenya's Criminal Investigations Department
(CID) has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted director of CID
Francis Sang as saying that this would be done irrespective of
whether the country had an extradition treaty with Kenya or not.
</P>
<P>
"Extradition treaties cannot frustrate our efforts once a
suspect in such a case is located," said Sang.
</P>
<P>
Abdalla Ibrahim Akasha is wanted in Kenya over a 13 million
U.S. dollar hashish haul impounded from a house in Kenya's Indian
Ocean port city of Mombasa three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The interpol, in conjunction with Anti-narcotic detectives from
the United States, have found Akasha at a clinic in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands Police have not formally arrested him but
placed him under strict surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Kenyan CID officers confiscated seven
Mercedes Benz and luxurious yatch belonging to the runaway
suspect.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Mombasa has become a transit point for some
international drug-trafficking cartels to smuggle drugs from
Middle East to Europe and the United States, according to local
media.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Call Rate Raised Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Korea Thursday
announced raising the call rate by 0.25 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The raise is in line with the South Korean government policy to
narrow the wide gap of five percentage points between short-term
and long-term rates.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came when worries over financial instability
arising from the redemption of troubled Daewoo bonds has subsided.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, the central bank already felt
it necessary to raise interest rates against the inflationary
pressure, but it pegged the call rate at 4.7 percent in support of
the government's low-interest policy in consideration of the
expected liquidity crunch in the aftermath of Daewoo Group crisis.
</P>
<P>
The central bank and the Ministry of Finance and Economy have
already seen eye to eye on the call rate and believed a slight
hike will not cause a serious problem, said government officials.
</P>
<P>
As the redemption of Daewoo bonds has not led to any serious
liquidity crunch in the money market, a small rise of the
overnight call rate will not bring about financial trouble, they
said.
</P>
<P>
However, economists expressed concerns that a raise in the
short-term rates will affect the country's long-term rates.
</P>
<P>
They said an increase in short-term interest rates will
stimulate a jump in long-term interest rates. In case long-term
interest rates rise, the Bank of Korea will redeem public bonds to
increase liquidity at the financial market.

closed above 20,000 Wednesday for the first time in more than 30
months.
</P>
<P>

<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels exchanged gunfire
anew Wednesday in Cotabato, Central Mindanao, Philippine News
Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local military spokesman Lino Aso was quoted as saying that a
clash occurred after Moro guerrillas harassed soldiers on patrol
in Carmen, Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
Aso said the encounter, punctuated by air strikes and mortar
fires, lasted more than an hour. There were no reports of
casualties on the government side.
</P>
<P>
Aso said pockets of resistance were still ongoing in the area
and 1,425 families were reportedly displaced by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Zaida Rinsulat, a Cotabato provincial welfare and development
officer, said evacuees were temporarily sheltered in local schools
and churches.
</P>
<P>
Late January, the government and the MILF held in Maguindanao,
another Mindanao province, their first round of the two-day peace
talks, which ended without any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has long been fighting for the establishment of an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, which the government
opposes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Encourages Farm Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
adopted a resolution which defines the country's long-term
policies on farm economy, Vietnam news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The policies, which were published on February 2, cover land,
tax, investment and credit, labor, market, science-technology-
environment, investment protection and obligations of farm owners,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
There are 113,000 farms in Vietnam, each turning out an average
output value of 105 million Vietnamese dong (7,500 U.S. dollars) a
year, according to Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that about 58 percent of the 3,044 farms
polled are engaged in cultivation, 27 percent in livestock
breeding, 13.7 percent in aquaculture and 1.2 percent in forestry.
</P>
<P>
Apart from creating 40,000 jobs for farmers, farm economy with
an annual production value of 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (714.3
million U.S. dollars) contributes 10 percent to the total
production value of the agricultural sector of the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Natural Disasters Cost Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- An unusually high number of
catastrophes caused Australia's bill for natural disasters in 1998
and 1999 to blow out to 4.5 billion Australian dollars (2.97
billion U.S. dollars), Emergency Management Australia (EMA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyclones, flooding, severe storms and bush fires killed 57
people and injured 600 over the two years and affected almost 500,
000 people in some way, the EMA said.
</P>
<P>
EMA director-general Alan Hodges said about 8,500 people were
left homeless by natural disasters over the period.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these disasters in 1998 and 1999 was almost double
the yearly average of the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The mostly costly in financial terms was the flash hailstorm
which struck Sydney in April 1999, smashing the roofs of thousands
of homes.
</P>
<P>
It cost the community 2.2 billion Australian dollars (1.45
billion U.S. dollars), killed one person, injured 50 and left 500
people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Hodges said the monetary and physical impact of these disasters
could have been far greater if not for the work carried out by
local governments, community groups and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
"The cost would be even higher if it weren't for the very
extensive emergency management arrangements we have in Australia,"
Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
Costs involved with natural disasters were increasing in
Australia for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
The number of people moving north into cyclone-prone areas was
one cause, as was the growth of people living on the edge of urban
areas, Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
Hodges said the high cost of disasters over the past two years
should bring home the need for excellence in the areas of
prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Ethiopia to Cooperate in Security, Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Ethiopia have
pledged to take concrete steps to enhance security and strengthen
economic cooperation between the two countries, Kenyan newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi reached the agreement on Wednesday in Addis Ababa
during Moi's visit to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Zenawi, Moi said that the security of
Kenya and Ethiopia should be viewed within the context of the Horn
of Africa, adding that the insecurity within the region would also
affect both countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that a team of experts from the two countries would
make a plan for railway and road network linkage, enabling
Ethiopia to use the Kenyan port of Mombasa and allowing a free
flow of goods and services between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that he objected to foreign intervention in the
regional conflict, saying it was only fair and logical that Kenya
and Ethiopia should play a leading role in solving such conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed the hope that the border conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea should be solved amicably and as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Moi flew to Asmara from Addis Ababa and had
lengthy discussions with Eritrean President Issaias Afeworki on
peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa and the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, Moi told a news conference at State House in
Nairobi that he was very concerned about conflict in the Horn of
Africa and the region as a whole.

<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The hijacking of an Afghan
airliner at London's Stansted airport ended  peacefully  on
early Thursday with the safe release of all the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
Just before 6:00 am GMT, all the remaining passengers walked
off the plane in a calm, orderly manner, just like the first group
of 85 people who were allowed to leave the plane at around 3:17 am.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the plane is empty," a police spokesman told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure these people are in a good state of health,
get them to a place of safety, identify hostages and hostage
takers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, who hijacked the Ariana Boeing 727 plane shortly
after it took off from Kabul on Sunday morning on a domestic
flight to Mazar-i-Sharif, were thought to have been the last to
leave the jet before being arrested.
</P>
<P>
The plane made stops at Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, the
northern Kazakh town of Aktyubinsk and Moscow before landing at
Stansted shortly after 2 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan failed in launching an
astronomical observation satellite Thursday after the M-5 rocket
carrying the satellite failed to reach the expected orbit, a
Japanese space institute said.
</P>
<P>
The rocket failed to reach the designated orbit 550 kilometers
above the Earth after it lifted off at 10:30 a.m. (local time)
from the Kagoshima Space Center in Uchinoura, Kagoshima Prefecture,
the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said it is discussing what to do about the
satellite, which is orbiting at a lower altitude.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Astro E satellite was intended to observe X-
rays in outer space.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7-ton satellite is Japan's fifth X-ray observation
satellite. The last such satellite to be launched was the Advanced
Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), which was sent
into orbit in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Official: Yong Indonesian Badminton Players to Shine in Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Junior shuttlers Yuli Marfuah
and Niniek Masrikah will show their quality at the Uber Cup semi-
finals in New Delhi next week, the Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI)'s training director Christian Hadinata said here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Both Yuli and Niniek must prove their skills in their debut.
They may have less experience than their opponents, but they
should take advantage of this by surprising their opponents,"
Hadinata was quoted by local newspaper the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will send Lidya Djaelawidjaja, Ellen Angelina, Yuli
and Niniek to compete in the Uber Cup singles matches. Yuli is a
last-minute replacement for Cindana Hartono, who injured her left
calf during a training session on February 4.
</P>
<P>
PBSI sent a letter to the International Badminton Federation on
Tuesday informing them of the substitution.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will also be represented by the doubles teams of
Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban, Etty Tantri and Cynthia
Tuwankotta, and Indarti Issolina and Carmelita.
</P>
<P>
"This year we no longer have Susi Susanti, Mia Audina and
Cindana. But this fact must motivate the whole team to prove that
they are equal to the veteran players," said Christian, who is
also team manager for the February 13 to 20 event.
</P>
<P>
"Lidya and Ellen already have experience in the Uber Cup and
Grand Prix series. They have the skill. They only need to
motivate themselves and raise their self-confidence. Our three
doubles teams also have enough skill and experience in
international events. We can rely on them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the top seed in the semi-final round of the Uber Cup,
is in the same group as Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong and either
Australia, Singapore or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the top seed in the other group, which also includes
South Korea, Thailand and either India, Zambia or Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The three top teams from the Asian and European zones will
compete in the Uber Cup finals in Kuala Lumpur in May. The six
teams will be joined by defending champion China and host Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Christian expressed his optimism that Indonesia would reach the
finals.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a shame if we can't qualify as one of the top
three countries in the semifinal round," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Rejects Annan's Stance on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his letter to Hun Sen on
Tuesday, held a tough stance on Khmer Rouge trial and rejected
four key provisions of the government's plan.
</P>
<P>
Annan called for an independent international prosecutor and a
majority of U.N.-appointed judges which Cambodian government
rejected as infringing of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Annan also wanted Cambodia to guarantee the arrest of any
suspect indicated by the court and to clarify an amnesty clause in
its trial plan in order to exclude granting amnesty to several
senior Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to the government.
</P>
<P>
Making a quick response to Kofi Annan, Hun Sen said "we are
surprised by the gap between the position raised in your letter
and ours which has been already supported by a number of
distinguished U.N. member states."
</P>
<P>
"This gap cannot be welcomed as it is unfair to Cambodia and
does not reflect the achievements of our efforts made so far,"
said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The government's latest version of draft law calls for a
majority of Cambodian judges, but requires at least one
international judge to agree with all rulings. Indictments would
require the agreement of Cambodian and U.N.-appointed co-
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister expressed his hope that Kofi Annan
will positively review his position with other member states of
the United Nations that have contributed to the drafting of this
law. "I also welcome a visit of your officials to Cambodia for
further understanding, should Your Excellency consider it useful,"
added Hun Sen.

<HEADLINE> 85 Hostages Released From Afghan Plane, Police Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five people were freed
on Thursday from a hijacked Afghan airliner at Stansted airport,
north of London, British police said.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Joe Edwards told reporters early on Thursday
that about 85 people on board the hijacked Afghan airliner had
been freed from the Boeing 727 jet.
</P>
<P>
"They let women and children leave the aircraft first. All
those released will now be taken to a safe location," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also need to verify that all those who left are in fact
hostages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said negotiations were continuing with the hijackers
still aboard the plane and were at a "fairly critical stage."
</P>
<P>
"It is another step towards our prime objective which is to
secure the safe release of everybody on board the aircraft. Talks
are continuing to secure the release of the remaining passengers
and crew. Negotiations are at critical stage as you can imagine,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of released hostages were seen walking down the plane's
rear steps into the arms of police and officials.
</P>
<P>
After about 15 minutes of a constant stream of people coming
off the plane, the steps were raised and the exodus stopped.
</P>
<P>
The release occurred shortly after 0300 GMT on the fifth day
of the hijack which began in Kabul on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Ariana Airline Boeing 727 was hijacked on a domestic
flight from Kabul, the Afghan capital to a northern city.
</P>
<P>
It made stops at two Central Asian airports and Moscow before
landing at Stansted shortly after 0200 GMT on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are still in contact with the plane as British
media speculation mounted that the standoff masked an elaborate
asylum plot.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Punish Soccer Clubs For Hooliganism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
Indonesia (PSSI) has banned three clubs from hosting soccer
matches in the sixth Indonesian Soccer League (Ligina) due to
their violent supporters, local newspaper the Jakarta Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PSSI official in charge of disciplinary action Andi Darussalam
Tabusala said that Persipura Jayapura, Indocement Cirebon and
Persib Bandung must move their matches to stadiums that are at
least 100 kilometers away from their home bases. PSM Makassar was
given a strong warning for the behaviour of its supporters.
</P>
<P>
Former manager of Putra Samarinda (Pusam) of East Kalimantan
Tommy Irmanto was barred from joining the squad for one year after
he attacked the referee when Pusam was playing against PSIS
Semarang on February 6. The match ended in a scoreless draw.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other way to control the spectators who run amok
during the matches. We can ask the security officers to deploy
thousands of soldiers to secure the match but we are not sure
whether that's the best way. In our capacity as match supervisor,
we hope to reduce the number of violent incidents in every soccer
match," Andi said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the clubs could view their sanctions as PSSI
's effort to improve the quality of soccer competitions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
He said PSSI would decide later on the venues of the next
matches involving the sanctioned teams. He said that all matches
would be supervised directly by PSSI.
</P>
<P>
Persipura fans turned brutal and threw objects onto the field
when Fata Matanu Garcia of host Gelora Dewata equalized 2-2 in the
second half of the match at the Mandala Stadium in Jayapura,
capital of Irian Jaya, on February 3. The match had to be
suspended for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Persipura won 3-2 but it is not allowed to host the next match
against Persma Manado on February 23 and is under probation for
the next three matches.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in the Siliwangi stadium in Bandung, capital of
West Java, Persib fans ran amok and attacked PSMS Medan players,
injuring four players and one of its officials.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in the 89th minute after striker Sutiono
Lamso of Persib kicked the only goal for his club, making the
score 1-0 for the home team. According to Andi, Persib will not
be allowed to host two matches.
</P>
<P>
In Makassar, South Sulawesi, during the match pitting PSM
against Gelora Dewata in Mattoangin stadium on February 6, Andi
said that spectators lit firecrackers and disrupted the match.
PSM blanked its guest 5-0.
</P>
<P>
The same day in Bima stadium in Cirebon, West Java, Indocement'
s fans entered the field when its player Abdul Azis kicked the
last goal for his club in the 80th minute to outclass guest PSMS
Medan 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Final Version of Philippine Retail Trade Bill Drawn  UP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If enacted into law, the consolidated version of the two bills,
both seeking to liberalize the retail trade business in the
country, would amend RA 11880 or the Retail Trade Nationalization
Law, approved in 954, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
RA 1180 is one of the few remaining economic protectionist
mechanisms which severely limits healthy competition in the retail
trade sector, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"A liberalized Philippine retail industry will encourage
Filipino and foreign investors to forge an efficient and
competitive retail trade sector to empower the Filipino consumer
through lower prices, highly quality goods and better services,"
said Senator Sergio Osmena, who is also the major author and
sponsor of the retail trade bill.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed Retail Trade Liberalization Act 2000, no
foreign retailers shall be allowed to engage in retail trade in
the country unless they have a minimum of 200 million U.S. dollars
net worth in their parent corporations for Category B and C,
defined in the proposal, as enterprises with a minimum paid-up
capital of the equivalent in Philippine pesos of 2.5 million
dollars and 7.5 million dollars respectively, and 50 million
dollars net worth for Category D or enterprises specializing in
high-end or luxury products with a paid-up capital of 250,000
dollars.

YANGON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar
government official Wednesday stressed the importance of national
solidarity, saying that it is the main force for the progress of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with basic education teachers in Yangon division's
Hlegu township, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of
the ruling Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, noted that
Myanmar lagged behind in development as internal strife had
erupted for over 40 years after regaining independence, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In the course of global changes and developments, some of the
developed and big countries gave priority to the development and
protection of their interest, creating problems between developing
nations and causing regional wars during the Cold War period,"
said Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the Myanmar Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that today, the developing countries are
striving with utmost efforts to advance harmoniously through
global changes and developments and to prevent themselves against
facing disorder and disintegration.
</P>
<P>
He urged the teachers to strive for development of human
resources with greater momentum and to make efforts to promote and
propagate union spirit to ward off and crush the danger of neo-
colonialists.

<HEADLINE> Former Philippine Secretary Charged in Court for  Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine interior and
local government secretary Ronaldo Puno was charged for graft at
the Sandiganbayan (anti-graft court) Wednesday for approving an
allegedly anomalous drug testing deal between the Philippine
National Police (PNP) and a medical firm, Business World said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Former PNP chief Roberto Lastimoso and former PNP legal service
chief Rodolfo Vejano were also Charged in the case. The graft
charge was filed by the Office of Ombudsman, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In the charge sheet, Puno was accused of conspiring to give
unwarranted benefits to Mahogany Medical and Pharmaceutical
Supplies Inc. by forging an agreement between the company and the
PNP.
</P>
<P>
They were also accused of acting in "evident bad faith" and "
manifest partiality" when they signed the agreement with Mahogany.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty of violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act, Puno, Lastimoso and Vejano may be ordered jailed
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Puno was sacked on January 8 by President Joseph Estrada in the
first ever cabinet reshuffle since Estrada resumed as the
president on June 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Railroad Companies Raise Freight Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by the strong
economy and pressed by higher fuel and labor costs, freight
railroad companies in the United States are raising certain rates
more aggressively than in recent years, according to reports
reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. is
notifying shippers that it will raise rates for some customers as
much as 4 percent in the railroad's first broad price hike since
1995. Norfolk Southern Corp., based in Norfolk, Virginia, recently
announced an identical increase for customers shipping scrap metal,
paper, lumber and container freight.
</P>
<P>
Top officials of Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific Corp. and
Richmond, Virginia-based CSX Corp. have also signaled they intend
to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
The railroads blame higher labor costs and the rising price of
diesel fuel, which has doubled from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But industry sources say that fuel spikes are not hitting the
relatively fuel-efficient railroads as hard as other modes of
transportation, such as trucks or airlines.
</P>
<P>
Fuel equaled only 6.2 percent of railroad revenue in 1998, the
last year for which industry statistics are available, they
explained.
</P>
<P>
Wage and benefit costs, they believe, are also up about 5
percent this year across the industry because of labor pacts that
expire this year, and labor accounted for 35.3 percent of rail
revenue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, however, who have been looking for signs of
higher prices to boost profits, are overwhelmed by the
announcements.
</P>
<P>
Many industry observers and officials say that many customers
are objecting to price hikes as long as service problems remain.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the timing of this is difficult," said Doug Rockel,
analyst with ING Barings. "There's no doubt a price increase of
this magnitude would be justified by the costs. But it's not what
the shipping community is willing to hear right now."

<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Stories about the celebrations
marking the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year around China still
dominate the front pages of major Beijing-based newspapers as the
country entered the sixth day of the week-long holiday period
today:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- China Subway Construction Corp. reported 28 billion yuan of
output value in 1999 and 150 million yuan of after-tax profit,
which have been the company's best performances.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned subway construction giant attributed this to an
improved company management. By the end of last year, more than
380 talented people under the age of 45 have promoted to the
leading posts at various levels of the company. The youngest is 32
years old.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- China will cut the production scale of the traditional
filature reeling industry by one million spindles by the end of
this year. This will be materialized by eliminating outdated
production lines.
</P>
<P>
Filature plants that stop spinning for a year will be closed
down by the deadline, according to a regulation of the State
Administration of Textile Industry.
</P>
<P>
China Youth Daily
</P>
<P>
-- A whale weighing at least 30,000 kg has been released to the
sea with the help of local fishermen, border police and villagers
in the city of Qiongshan, Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers succeeded on Tuesday in tugging the huge animal
back into the ocean with nets and thick ropes and two powerful
fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers built a plastic tent to shelter the whale from the
scorching sun, but failed in their initial attempts to tug the
animal back to sea with a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists estimate that the rapid currents in the Qiongzhou
Strait might have affected the whale's judgment of direction.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The number of websites created by Chinese government
agencies has increased 20 times since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that 60 percent of State-level
departments have set up sites via China's main Internet service
provider, 163/169.com, under the project in 1999, which doubled
that of the previous year. This year, 80 percent of all government

HANGZHOU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Public Security Bureau in
Hangzhou, the provincial capital of east China's Zhejiang Province,
recently opened a website to enable overseas people to apply for a
Chinese visa through the Internet.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feasibility of AFTA-CER Free Trade Area Being  Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The feasibility of
establishing an AFTA (the ASEAN Free Trade Area)-CER (the
Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement) Free
Trade Area by 2010 was discussed by a task force here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The task force was composed of representatives of ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries plus Australia
and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The task force discussed the potential benefits and costs of
establishing an AFTA-CER Free Trade Area, according to a press
release published by the ASEAN Secretariat on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The task force also held initial discussions on the possible
scope and coverage of the proposed free trade area, agreeing that
some areas require further study and consideration which would
include the views of the business community and the experiences of
other regional groupings, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a study conducted by the Canberra-based Center for
International Economics concluded that the benefit for both
parties would be higher level of economic activity, exports and
real consumption.
</P>
<P>
These benefits would result in an expansion of trade as a
result of removing tariff and non-tariff barriers, improvement in
the productivity as a result of more competition and exploitation
of economies of scale, and fostering of closer business links
leading to greater levels of investment confidence.
</P>
<P>
The study estimated a net positive contribution to real
production for all participants in the order of 16 billion U.S.
dollars at 1997 prices. An AFTA-CER linkage would create a market
of 523 million and a combined GDP (gross domestic product) of 1.2
trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The task force was established by the economic ministers and
trade ministers from the countries of the ASEAN and the CER at
their fourth meeting held in Singapore on October 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister of the Philippines Cesar Virata chaired
the task force. The task force is expected to meet again in New
Zealand on April 27-28 this year, the press release added.

YANGON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Myanmar and
Malaysia amounted to 172 million U.S. dollars in the first 10
months of 1999, a drop of 27.42 percent over the same period of
1998 when it was 237 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, Myanmar's imports from Malaysia were valued at
129 million dollars, down 38.86 percent compared with the 211
million dollars registered in the corresponding period of 1998,
the official Economic Indicators said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar's exports to Malaysia stood at 43 million

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of 269,
013 tons of cement in the first 10 months of 1999, a drop of 14.56
percent compared with the same period of 1998 when it was 314,883
tons, according to the latest figures of the country's Central
Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Myanmar's cement output totaled 364,959 tons.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has sped up the pace of
infrastructural construction of roads, bridges and dams, resulting
in a shortage of cement day by day.
</P>
<P>
To meet the rising demand for cement, Myanmar imports cement
worth about 70 million U.S. dollars annually. To save the foreign
exchange, the government plans to build more cement plants.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Myanmar is trying to get a foreign loan of
150 million dollars to build a 4,000-ton daily-capacity large-
scale cement plant.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Jobless Rate Back down to 6.8 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment fell
back below the seven percent mark in January this year to 6.8
percent seasonally adjusted, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (
ABS) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said the fall in the jobless rate largely reversed the
big jump in December last year, when unemployment rose from 6.7
percent to 7.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of people in work dropped 27,600 in January,
the second fall in employment in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate improved because 48,000 people dropped out of
the labor market, cutting the participation rate from 63.6 percent
to 63.2 percent, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in January was led by the New South Wales state,
where the jobless rate fell to 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
There also were falls in the Victoria state to 6.7 percent,
Queensland 8.0 percent and South Australia 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However there was a big rise in unemployment in the Western
Australia state, from 6.1 percent to 6.8 percent, and a slight
rise in Tasmania to 8.9 percent, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Employment Minister Peter Reith said the figures
showed strong and sustainable growth in employment over the past
year of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The labor market remains well on track to meet the government'
s forecast unemployment rate of 6.75 percent by the June quarter
of 2000," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"There is scope, however, to reduce unemployment even further
by undertaking further economic and labor market reform," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Eyes Market Economy, EU Membership: Racan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's new Premier Ivica
Racan said Wednesday the establishment of a market economy and the
entrance to the European Union (EU) will be among his new
government's top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his administration's four-year programs at parliament,
Racan said economic problems to be tackled are the imbalance in
consumption and production, lack of investment in production and
employment, as well as reduced production and rising jobless rates
during the past 1.5 years.
</P>
<P>
Racan pledged economic reforms that include a cut in government
spending, a balanced national budget, lower taxes and increased
investment in education, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Gross Domestic Product will see an increase of
2 percent this year, and a further 3 percent growth in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Racan said his government will also enhance law enforcement,
amend Croatia's Constitution to restrict the power of the
president, cut redundant government structures and impose
nonpolitical guidelines to the armed forces and police.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign policy, Racan said his government would
improve bilateral relations with neighboring countries and carry
out Croatia's obligations to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Racan has set the entrance to EU and NATO as the prime targets
of his government, while stressing that his government will
respect the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Vice Minister of
Investments and Economic Cooperation Raul Taladrid and
representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
signed a cooperative project in Havana Wednesday to assist
countries in the control of classical pig plague (CPP).
</P>
<P>
The program will enable Cuba to develop diagnostic methods and
learn more about epizootiologic behavior, and allow Cuba to plan
scientific prevention, control and eradication strategies.
</P>
<P>
Some results include greater food security for Cuba because
pork is one of Cuba's most important sources of protein.
</P>
<P>
Three international consultants and two FAO officials,
together with Cuban experts, helped create a two-year plan to help
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cuba was struck with an outbreak of CPP in 1996, which caused
serious losses to pig breeders, but it was controlled by the
efforts of specialists.

<P>
After talks with his Belgian counterpart Guy Verhofstadt,
D'Alema said other EU members would watch the deeds of the new
Austrian government and be ready to act if it broke EU treaties.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's center-left coalition Wednesday put forward a motion
urging such actions in the case of "grave and persistent"
violations of the EU's founding charters by the Austrian
government which has five new members from Joerg Haider's far
right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
As for the EU's preemptive strike in demoting bilateral
contacts to a technical level and withdrawing support for any
Austrian candidates to international bodies, D'Alema said that
this was justified because the Freedom Party's platform contained
elements against the core values of the EU.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema noted that the Austrian foreign ministry had "
fortunately" immediately retracted Haider's threat to use the
Austrian veto to tangle EU business.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema and Verhofstadt also highlighted the need to reform key
defense and cooperation issues as well as introducing more
flexibility and joint efforts in decision-making.

China has been expecting the cyberspace business to link the

These websites usually feature information from official

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Seeks More Overseas Funding for Service Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The service trade will
become one of major overseas investment fields in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lin Shusen of Guangzhou said China's accession into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will spur Guangzhou's economic
development, and Guangzhou will take this chance to push its work
of attracting more overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the city will open more areas to
overseas investors to further open up the service trade and high-
and new technological industries.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are encouraged to fund social development
projects ranging from education and culture to public health, said
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that they would step up contacts with more
multinationals and major overseas consortia and launch three
investment promotion centers in the United States, Hong Kong and
Europe to attract major overseas investors to Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city will also review the previous list of
approved overseas-financed businesses to boost the volume of paid-
in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also pledged to upgrade the investment environment,
including improving the capabilities of serving the overseas-
backed enterprises in the city, and fine-tuning work efficiency by
shortening the approval procedures for businesses engaged in the
processing trade.

<P>
SHENYANG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Residents in this capital of
north China's Liaoning Province are happy to see an accumulation
of white snow here -- a place where flakes usually fall in dingy
shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
Known as the earliest heavy industrial base in China, the city
was once listed among the world's most polluted cities.
</P>
<P>
"When snow fell a dozen years ago, we had to wash our clothes.
It was muddy," said retired teacher Ma Zhenzhong, who had to wear
a mouth mask whenever he went out.
</P>
<P>
In addition to industrial waste, the city's main heating and
cooking fuel is coal, a heavy polluter, and snow can bring
suspended coal particles in the air back down to the ground.
</P>
<P>
There have been seven snows here this winter and the city is
enveloped in white. Skiing grounds and skating rinks have become
entertainment hotspots.

<HEADLINE> China's Traditional Liquor to Survive Fiery Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's liquor industry will
face more fiery competition with the country's expected accession
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), but the traditional
distilling recipes still have good prospects, said a company
official from one of the country's major distilleries.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhancheng, chairman of the board of the Jiannanchun Group,
said in a symposium here to rally the industry, that modern
science has disclosed new advantages to be found in the
traditional industry, which is known for distilling liquors from
fermenting fine rice and other crops.
</P>
<P>
Natural microbes that are good for health can be produced
during the process, said Xu, and China made the earliest use of
microbial fermenting in the process of distilling liquor. The
distilling recipes also have a unique scent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several world famous distilled drinks, such as brandy, whisky,
rum, and vodka, still dominate the world's liquor market, despite
an increasing demand for lighter alcoholic beverages, such as beer
and fruit wines.
</P>
<P>
Xu said there is now a tendency to make less fiery rice wines.
At present, brews with an alcohol content of less than 50 percent
account for 60-70 percent of China's total distilled liquor sales,
which have averaged sales volumes of 6-7 million tons for the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that distilled products will continue to
take the lead in the alcoholic beverage market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasants Turn to Lawyers To Settle Civil Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 10 (Xinhua)-- Rural people in Sichuan
Province in China's southwest are relying more and more on lawyers
to solve various problems in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Villagers in Qilong'ao, in the remote mountain areas of south
Sichuan, have moved past those troubled days when civil disputes,
which had little hope of legal resolution, turned their usually
peaceful lives inside out.
</P>
<P>
But criminal cases have become nearly non-existent since two
lawyers came to the village last year, and only three civil cases
are currently on file locally.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of lawyers, we now understand more about our
country's laws and regulations and have made a habit to abide by
the law in our daily lives," said villager Ni Xianke.
</P>
<P>
In the past, village leaders acted as arbitrators for the range
of civil disputes that cropped up among villagers, though their
decisions had little lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
Now local farmers are voluntarily enrolled in the monthly
courses on law and all disputes will be settled according to law.
</P>
<P>
Following the example of Qilong'ao, some heads of rural
committees from two neighboring villages also came to invite
lawyers from the township law office.

MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine President Joseph Estrada indicated Wednesday that
the 629-billion-peso (15.7-billion-U.S. dollar) proposed budget
for this year included fund allocations to lawmakers but refused
to call them "pork barrel."
</P>
<P>
Today
</P>
<P>
-- President Estrada announced Wednesday during the 65th
anniversary celebration of Constitution Day here that the
initiative to amend the constitution has been dropped and
deposited, not just in the back burner but in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
-- The Marcos heirs have come up with a new offer to split the
suspected Marcos funds in escrow at the Philippine National Bank
that has now ballooned to about 610 million dollars from the
original 540 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Technicians Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Boeing Co.
engineering and technical employees walked off the job Wednesday
despite attempts by federal mediators to prevent a strike at the
nation's largest aircraft maker and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Federal mediation efforts Monday and Tuesday failed to resolve
differences over pay and bonuses between the company and the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA),
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we are disappointed that we were unable to reach an
acceptable solution through the course of mediation in the past
two days," Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing is a company that strives to negotiate with unions in
good faith, and to be fair and reasonable in the offers it makes,"
Conte claimed, adding that no further talks have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The SPEEA represents about 22,500 employees in the states of
Washington, Kansas, California, Florida, Oregon, Texas and Utah.
Still, union leadership vowed the strike would be widely supported
by non-members as well as members. Boeing has about 197,000
employees overall.
</P>
<P>
The strike will disrupt more than just design of new aircraft.
The union members' duties include final approval of all aircraft
before delivery, a process required by Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations. Union officials say the FAA
assures them that only those with up-to-date certification will be
allowed to make inspections, forestalling any attempt by Boeing to
turn to retirees.
</P>
<P>
The only previous strike by the union was in 1993, and it
lasted only one day. A short strike of a week or less probably
won't hurt Boeing, said Chris Mecray, an analyst with Deutsche
Banc Alex Brown, but a long strike could hit the company's bottom
line more than the cost of a settlement. For that reason, Mecray
thinks Boeing will settle with the union rather than risk a long
strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike is spurred by more than just wages. SPEEA negotiator
Stan Sorscher said Boeing's drive to boost profitability by
cutting costs, and by slashing spending on research and
development, has also embittered many employees.

<P>
KUWAIT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli bombing of power
stations will not affect the Asian Cup finals, to be held in
October in Lebanon by "candlelight" if necessary, the president of
the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) was quoted by a Kuwaiti
newspaper on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The OCA chief, Sheik Ahmed Al Fahed Al Sabah, told Al-Rai Al-

Whatever happens, the Olympic Council of Asia "insists on

SHANGHAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
and commercial city of Shanghai, which aims to become an
international information center, has just formed an evaluation
and certification body as part of the city's effort to enhance
information security.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Information Security Evaluation and Certification
Center will provide services to neighboring Fujian, Zhejiang,
Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces as well as the
metropolis of Shanghai in east China.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the municipal government said that Shanghai is to
set aside 10 to 15 percent of its computer network development
funds for network security purposes in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to tighten quality control on products
that are used to protect the networks from hackers.
</P>
<P>
To date, 86 percent of Shanghai's information networks have had
security products mounted, but a recent survey showed a lack of
security knowledge among network professionals, with less than two
percent of them knowing how to protect their networks from
intruders.

<HEADLINE> West Ham to Fight Di Canio Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club West Ham striker Paolo di Canio has protested his innocence
to a Football Association charge of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The controversial Italian has been charged by the FA of England
for an alleged insulting gesture during the Premiership game with
Aston Villa on January 15. The FA have sent a still photograph of
the incident to the Premiership club.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, who scored a late equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Upton
Park, was caught on camera making a middle-finger salute, although
there was no indication to whom it was made.
</P>
<P>
But Villa fans had barracked the player after an incident in
the Worthington Cup tie between the teams just four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Villa supporters had been incensed when they believed di Canio
had dived to win a penalty in the cup clash, which the Italian
subsequently missed.
</P>
<P>
The Hammers have been informed of the charge and will be
consulting with the Professional Footballers Association, who have
intimated they will handle the case, within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
"We felt that it was unjust that a charge should be made, but
that is the way of the world and we have to get on with it," said
West Ham company secretary Graham Mackrell, whose club are likely
to ask for a personal hearing.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio was also involved in a skirmish with Villa goalkeeper
David James at the end of the game but that incident was not
mentioned in referee Graham Poll's report.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time di Canio has found himself in hot
water with the FA. Fifteen months ago he was banned for 11 games
for pushing over referee Paul Alcock while playing for Sheffield
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But West Ham manager Harry Redknapp defended his star after the
game against Villa. "I think it's a load of nonsense. The
picture of him with his hand up his back, he could be scratching
his back. Who knows what he was doing?" he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Successfully Tests First Ground-To-Ground Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey successfully tested on
Thursday its first short-range ground-to-ground missiles, reported
the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Toros 230-A with a range of 65 kilometers and the Toros 260-
A with a range of 100 kilometers were tested at a site on the Black
Sea coast near Istanbul, Turkey's largest city.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the State Scientific Research Council, Eyup
Serdar Gokpinar, said that 95 percent of the parts for the missiles
were made in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"With Toros, Turkey has for the first time developed a main
weapon system. We want to export these missiles and earn foreign
currency," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Anatolia, Turkey, in the center of an unstable
region, has often been at odds with its neighboring countries -
Syria, Iran, Iraq, Greece, Cyprus and Armenia. It has also
expressed concern over alleged reports that Iran and Syria are
developing missile systems.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Cyprus cancelled the delivery of Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles after Turkey threatened to destroy the
weapons it they were deployed on the divided island.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Militia Releases U.N. Humanitarian Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Kenyan pilots and a U.N.
official, held hostage in southern Sudan for a week, were released
on Thursday and flown to Kenya, U.N. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
However, a Sudanese aid worker representing a local humanitarian
group, stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
The four were held in Old Fangak, about 750 kilometers south of
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum since February 3 when their plane
was hijacked by the Peace Force militia.
</P>
<P>
The three captives had arrived at the northwestern Kenyan town
of Lokichokio on board a special U.N. plane, said a spokesman from
UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The four were working with the U.N.-sponsored Operation
Lifeline-Sudan, which includes UNICEF, the World Food Program as
well as no-governmental humanitarian groups. They were on a mission
to assess the possibility of conducting relief operation in the
region when their plane was hijacked.
</P>
<P>
The militia has demanded the release of three missing leaders
who were believed to be taken to an unidentified place aboard a U.
N. plane in exchange for the release of the four hostages and the
hijacked aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Sudan was torn by a 16-year-long civil war during which the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting for greater
autonomy for the mainly Christian and animist south.

ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Four small bombs exploded in
Turkey's largest city of Istanbul on Wednesday night, damaging
several buildings, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred at four separate locations - the state-
run Religious Affairs Directorate's office, the museum for modern
Turkey founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and two mobile telephone
shops, Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police said that militants of radical Islamic Great
Eastern Raiders Front (IBDA-C) had left "calling cards" at the
scenes. The underground Islamic group also claimed responsibility
for the attacks by leaving their banner st each site.
</P>
<P>
Glass lay strewn across the street outside the museum, once home
to Ataturk, on a main street on the European side of the city.
Police cordoned off the building while forensic teams searched for
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Religious Affairs Directorate have recently condemned
Islamic terrorism and the two targeted shops reportedly helped

An official spokesman for the Ministry of Information and

and cannot abandon the language of killing, destruction and
terrorism."

"All allegations of peace settlement and slogans of

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns All Violence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday voiced the condemnation of "all acts of violence"
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and demanded an immediate end
to the criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a statement to the press here by the
president of the 15-nation body, Arnoldo Listre of Argentina, at
the end of the closed-door meeting, during which the Security
Council was briefed by the U.N. Secretariat on the recent
outbreaks of violence in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed their profound concern at
the deterioration of the security situation there," the statement
said. "Council members condemned all acts of violence and demanded
their immediate cessation."
</P>
<P>
"Council members called upon all parties concerned to exercise
the utmost restraint and tolerance," the statement said, saying
that the Council reiterated its commitment to the "full
implementation" of the June 10 resolution, adopted last year,
which demands the full respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Though the statement made no specific reference to any
individual violence, it came after recent violence which, breaking
out at a Serbian bar in northern Mitrovica, killed eight people
and wounded more than 20.
</P>
<P>
The violent upsurge, one of the worst since the United Nations
Mission and international peace-keepers took responsibility for
the security and re-construction in the province last June, began
last Wednesday with a rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
More non-Albanians, including Serbs, are becoming targets of
attacks in Kosovo since June last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan's injury-dogged
Brazilian star Ronaldo's recovery from last November's knee
operation is on track and he could be back playing at the end of
next month, Inter sources said at the club's training ground
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The player known as The Phenomenon - at least until his
mysterious and miserable World Cup Final performance, and
subsequent woe-filled season-and-a-bit - is continuing
physiotherapy, fast walks, and exercise-bike work under the
watchful eye of his personal physio Milton Petrone.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that he has been spending his
afternoons building up his fragile knee tissue in the swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo is expected to start jogging next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision on when he will kick a ball again will come when
he visits his French surgeon Dr Saillant in Paris on March 1.
</P>
<P>
But Inter sources were confident that he could be available
alongside Italy star Christian Vieri by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime he will pop back to Rio de Janeiro to get
things ready for the birth of his first child, due early next
month.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Set up Peace-building Office in Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
Thursday announced the decision by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to set up a U.N. peace-building office in the Central
African Republic and asked the Central African Government to "work
closely together" with the new U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in a presidential statement adopted by
the Security Council at the end of the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new U.N. office, known as the United
Nations Peace-building Office in the Central African Republic (
BONUCA), has been accepted by the Central African Republic, the
statement said, adding that its mandate will last one year
beginning February 15.
</P>
<P>
The new Office will be headed by a representative of the U.N.
Secretary-General, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council notes with satisfaction that the Office's
principal mission will be to support the Government's efforts to
consolidate peace and national reconciliation, strengthen
democratic institutions and facilitate the mobilization at the
international level of political support and resources for
national reconstruction and economic recovery" in the African
country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Office is also tasked with monitoring developments and
promoting public awareness of human rights issues," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the decision after the U.N. Mission in the Central
African Republic, called MINURCA, has contributed to the
restoration of peace and security in the country and the holding
of free and fair legislative and presidential elections, the
restructuring of the security forces and the training of the
police force.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Urges Congress to Exempt Derivatives From Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan urged Congress on Thursday to act quickly
to exempt from regulation the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
markets, saying legal uncertainty is posing "unacceptable" risks
to the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Agriculture Committee, Greenspan
said "over-the-counter derivatives have come to play an
exceptionally important role in our financial system and in our
economy."
</P>
<P>
"A growing number of financial and nonfinancial institutions
have embraced derivatives as an integral part of their risk
capital allocation and profit maximization," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that government regulation has "impeded
initiatives to centralize the trading and clearing of OTC
contracts, developments that have the potential to increase
efficiency and reduce risks in OTC transactions."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan asked lawmakers to adopt the recommendations of a
White House task force, which included exempting over-the-counter
derivatives from government regulation and allowing the financial
institutions using them to police the market themselves.
</P>
<P>
Derivatives are complex financial instruments whose value
depends on the value or change in value of an underlying security,
commodity or asset. They are used by businesses to guard against
losses from unexpected market movements, but also by high-risk
investment funds to speculate.
</P>
<P>
Derivatives played a key role in the near-collapse in September
1998 of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, which sent shock
waves through world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter derivatives are traded privately between
investors, as opposed to those derivatives traded on futures
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Joining Greenspan in his request were Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers and William Rainer, chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. Like Greenspan, they are members of
the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which was
established after the October 1987 stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
"I see a real risk that, if we fail to rationalize our
regulation of centralized trading mechanisms for financial
instruments, these markets and the related profits and employment
opportunities will be lost to foreign jurisdictions that maintain
the confidence of global investors without imposing so many
regulatory constraints," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
The legal uncertainty hanging over the off-exchange derivatives
market could "move a very substantial part of this market overseas
" where regulations are looser or don't exist, Greenspan warned.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Direct Rule Gets Royal Assent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A bill to re-impose direct rule
on Northern Ireland has become law as efforts continued to save
the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which will lead to the suspension of the nine-
week old power-sharing Northern Ireland government, received Royal
Assent on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
It is now at the discretion of the Northern Ireland Secretary
of State, Peter Mandelson, when to implement the legislation. He
is expected to make an announcement sometime on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble met
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin for a briefing on the
Irish government's efforts to resolve the arms issue, which is
deadlocking the process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the 45-minute meeting, both men said they would
continue to work for the benefit of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ahern pledged to continue to the last hour to achieve a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am conscious of time but regardless, we must work
on. And if we can find resolutions now, great. If not we just have
to keep at it. We will keep on working together."
</P>
<P>
Trimble said people would be wrong to regard this as being a
terminal crisis in the agreement. "It is not that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are both very clearly committed to seeing the full, final
implementation of this agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Trimble briefed his assembly team after the Dublin meeting. A
spokesman said that the UUP assembly members believed suspension
would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The 800-strong Ulster Unionist ruling council is to meet in
Belfast on Saturday to debate progress on the decommissioning
issue.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came about after the first report from General de
Chastelain's decommissioning body did not show enough progress
towards IRA decommissioning to keep Ulster Unionists in the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
The move to suspend the assembly is an attempt to prevent
Trimble from resigning as first minister. Trimble told his party
in November that he would quit the assembly if the IRA had not
started decommissioning weapons by the end of January.

<HEADLINE> More Investments to Arrive L.America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The flow of capitals from
the world toward Latin America, as it has been in the last three
years, will continue in the short term, said Thursday the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNTAD).
</P>
<P>
This statement, quoted from a report sent from Paris and
received here, was made by the group that is drafting the UNTAD
report for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The specialists gave an advance of the report on world direct
investment presented in Geneva, Switzerland, saying that Latin
America surpasses Asia for the first time since 1986 in the
reception of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the fact that it received 97 billion
dollars in 1999, more than the 91 billion dollars received by Asia.
The complete document will be presented in July, they said.
</P>
<P>
Latin America received in 1999 a total of 32 percent more of
the flow of capitals from abroad than 1998's 73 billion dollars.
The increase of the investments was 25 percent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It increased 15 percent in the developing countries of Latin
America, Africa, and Asia, after their thawing the previous year,
said the UNTAD document.
</P>
<P>
The series of reforms to their economies and the privatization
of enterprises are the reasons for the document to put Latin
America in the first place as a zone receiving foreign investments,
while Asia has had serious economic problems since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAD report said that Brazil received 31 billion dollars
because of the devaluation of its currency, the real, while
Argentina increased its income four times last year when it
received 25 billion dollars for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
One of the drafters of the report said that the reason for
which Argentina increased four times its income was the sale of
several state enterprises. Chile, Ecuador and Peru also had income
in their treasuries because of the entrance of foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the arrival of capitals to Latin
America comes from the United States and Europe, and varies
according to the interests of the investors.

Hackers can hide these tools, known as daemons, on hundreds or
even thousands of third-party computers and then trigger them from
a remote location to launch simultaneous attacks on a single
target.

monthly meetings it held since being set up in 1997.
</P>
<P>
There have been growing concern about rising consumer
confidence and the steep climb in house prices. British Retail
Consortium figures show shop sales were 4 percent higher in
January than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's short-term lending rate sets the trend for interest
rates throughout the economy. So a rise to 6 percent will trigger
similar rises across the board in mortgage, credit-card and hire-
purchase rates.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect rates to continue rising over the next few
months, possibly to 6.5 percent - still well below the 7.5 percent
peak in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Business and union leaders have argued that rate increases
could derail the economic recovery. "This fourth rate rise in six
months will inflict severe pressure on UK business," said Ian
Peters of the British Chambers of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End in Mixed Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) - European stock markets ended in
mixed form Thursday after a fluctuated session marked by sharp
falls in high-flying media and telecom firms.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed down 36 points, or 0.56 percent,
at 6279.80, having fallen below 6200 at one point.
</P>
<P>
Markets shrugged off the widely expected quarter percentage
point rise in UK interest rates by the Bank of England and
recovered most of their losses as gains in
financial, drug and oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
The four-month battle for control of NatWest appeared closer to
resolution, with Royal Bank of Scotland moving ahead after rival
bidder Bank of Scotland appeared to concede defeat.
</P>
<P>
NatWest shares ended flat at 1152 pence, reversing an early
gain, BoS stock closed 1 percent ahead and RBOS lost 3.2 percent
to finish at 870 pence, having been 9 percent down at one point in
the session.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax moved back into the black, closing
up 1.05 percent at a record 7709.27, helped by speculation of a
tie-up in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris ended 1 percent lower at 6207.52 as
investors pulled back from its Net-related components after their
strong recent gains.

The missing, believed to be two men and two women, were thought

Wednesday.

A state trooper with two cadaver-sniffing dogs started

Part of the building's roof and outer walls collapsed as water
was pumped into open windows and firefighters battled the blaze
from the roofs of adjacent buildings.

Four firefighters had minor injuries. Two office workers also
were hurt, but officials said their injuries were not life-
threatening. The building had been undergoing roof and window
renovations.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Mini-Stroke Underestimated Among Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 1.2 million
Americans aged 45 and older have mostly likely suffered a mini-
stroke without realizing it, according to survey results released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the National Stroke Association (NSA),
polled more than 10,000 American adults. It is the first large-
scale, nationwide survey specifically designed to uncover the
prevalence of mini-stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 4.9 million Americans or 2.5 percent
of all adults age 18 and older have been diagnosed with a TIA. Of
those adults 65 years of age and older surveyed, 8.5 percent or 2.
6 million reported they had been diagnosed with a TIA.
</P>
<P>
Most physicians previously thought the prevalence rate of TIA
was much lower than what this survey uncovered, according to NSA.
Lack of awareness and knowledge of TIA may be a cause of
underreporting of this serious condition. Only 10 percent of all
adults surveyed know what TIA means.
</P>
<P>
TIAs or mini-strokes are brief episodes of stroke symptoms
resulting from temporary interruptions of blood flow to the brain.
TIA is often a precursor to stroke or brain attack. In the United
States, according to NSA, 750,000 people have stroke a year. The
third leading cause of death, stroke kills approximately 160,000
Americans annually. The symptoms of a TIA are the same as stroke,
but manifest for a shorter period of time and cause no permanent
damage.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls While Nasdaq Hitting New High on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Thursday with the blue chip stocks falling on worries about
higher interest rates while tech shares hitting the new record
high.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session today, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 55.53 at 10,643.63, extending its big loss of 258.44 points
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But boarder stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 5.13 at 1,416.83 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 122.39 at 4,485.63, topping the record
closing high of 4,427.50 points set Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as investors were worried about higher
interest rates which would cut corporate earnings. The Federal
Reserve has raised rates four times since last June in an effort
to word off inflation and analysts expected the central bank
officials to raise rates again this year.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index rose after MCI WorldCom reported that its
earnings nearly tripled in the final quarter of 1999 from the
fourth quarter of 1998 due to strong growth in its Internet and
data services businesses.
</P>
<P>
A big purchase of Dell Computer's shares also pushed the Nasdaq
higher. The company was expected to release its strong earnings
report after the close of trading today.
</P>
<P>
Internet stocks were mostly lower because of the hacker attacks
on several Web sites in the past few days but they did not affect
the Nasdaq index badly.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.55 at 614.43. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 12.71 at 892.99 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 6.20 at 542.21.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,788 down, 1,252 up and 481
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.05 billion shares from 1.04 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Multimillionaire Forbes Leaves Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Multimillionaire
publisher Steve Forbes announced his withdrawal from the
Republican presidential race Thursday, saying "we were nosed out
by a landslide."
</P>
<P>
"Today I am withdrawing from the presidential contest, but I'm
not withdrawing from the public square," Forbes said at a news
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said he left with no regrets, and offered no candidate
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
Forbes spent more than 30 million dollars of his publishing
fortune on the 2000 campaign, and more than 37 million dollars in
1996. His net worth has been estimated at about 500 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He decided to quit after running third, with 20 percent of the
vote, in the Delaware primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Republican front-runner and Texas Governor George W. Bush won
by a landslide, and Senator John McCain, who did not campaign in
the state, beat Forbes in the primary. Forbes won the Republican
primary in Delaware in 1996 with 33 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
His departure clears the way for a two-way race between Texas
Governor Bush and Senator McCain of Arizona for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Forbes' withdrawal was likely to benefit Bush because his
conservative supporters are unlikely to vote for McCain, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Former Ambassador Alan Keyes is the only other member of the
Republican Party field, but he is not considered a challenger for
the presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Congress Treasury Held Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Two armed men held up
Thursday morning Argentina's National Congress Treasury office,
taking away a big quantity of money.
</P>
<P>
Congress sources said that the holdup occurred around 11:00
local time, when two men entered the treasury and threatened the
employees in the office, located some 20 meters from the entrance
to the Congress from the street.
</P>
<P>
The criminals tied up the employees and national deputy Jose
Manuel Corchuelo Blasco, who was casually in that place, at the
moment of the holdup, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Then they took a big number of envelopes with the salaries and
fled, without the police guard located some meters from that
office being able to prevent the robbery, said the authorities.
