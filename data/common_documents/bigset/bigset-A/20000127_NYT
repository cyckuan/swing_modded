<P>
   For years Dominick Dunne went around saying that it was Tommy
Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy's, who had beaten Martha Moxley
to death. Last week, nearly 25 years after the unsolved killing of
the 15-year-old Greenwich, Conn., girl, Tommy's younger brother
Michael was indicted in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I guilt-ridden about Tommy?'' says the novelist and Vanity
Fair journalist, glaring, as he sits beside a crackling fireplace
in his jewel box of an apartment. ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   And what if Michael is not guilty, as he pleaded last week?
``No, there's no possibility,'' insists Dunne, who had given leaked
confidential documents about the killing to Mark Fuhrman, the
detective he met while covering the O.J. Simpson trial. The
re-examination of the case by Fuhrman and others may have been what
prompted the authorities to take a fresh look.
</P>
<P>
   There is a furious absolutism to Dunne, whose 1993 novel, ``A
Season in Purgatory,'' was based loosely on the Moxley case. ``I
hate defense lawyers,'' he says, chief among them the lawyer who
represented John Sweeney, the Ma Maison chef who strangled Dunne's
22-year-old daughter, Dominique. Convicted in 1984 of manslaughter,
Sweeney was released after serving two and a half years of a
six-and-a-half-year sentence. The death of Dunne's daughter and her
killer's trial left a permanent raw wound; much of Dunne's fiction
and journalism continues to be about rich, powerful people trying
to get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   But short of violent crime, Dunne has an unusual capacity for
forgiving spectacularly seamy behavior, as one who not only has
witnessed it intimately for much of his life, but who was a
wallowing participant for a long, ugly stretch.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Dunne was a cocaine-sniffing alcoholic who sold his West
Highland white terrier because he needed $300. Now 74, Dunne, who
has an Upper East Side pied-a-terre bought by ``The Two Mrs.
Grenvilles,'' a country home paid for by ``An Inconvenient Woman''
and a beloved Jaguar purchased by his articles on the Menendez
murder case, relishes his fame, fortune and party invitations with
bottomless gusto.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from money. The Irish Catholic clan headed by an
autocratic patriarch in ``A Season in Purgatory,'' widely assumed
to be a conflation of the Skakels and the Kennedys, was drawn from
Dunne's household. ``We were lower-case Kennedys,'' he says,
comparing his family to the dynasty he views with envy, admiration
and outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up Catholic, rich but disdained in Hartford, then a city
dominated by Protestant aristocrats, gave Dunne a piercing
insider-outsider perspective that has never left him, a relentless
desire to dance in inner circles. The second of six children,
Dunne, slight and unathletic, was the family's storyteller, shamed
into silence by his father, a surgeon, who beat him so severely
that he lost some hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, snow falls on his terrace; inside, Dunne recounts tale
after tale, dramatic, dishy, hilarious, jumping up to act out
parts, self-absorbed, yes, enamored of his own storytelling, yes,
but with the evident pleasure of a man exulting in a strong,
authoritative voice unleashed after decades of self-doubt. His
latest book, ``The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well-Known
Name Dropper,'' is an extended scrapbook detailing his years as a
B-list television and movie producer and A-list social butterfly
and climber in Hollywood, where he partied compulsively with the
glamorati about whom he writes so knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Why, given how assiduously he ploughs back hush-hush stories
into his work, do people with something to hide invite him to
parties?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a quiet listener,'' Dunne says. ``I keep in touch with a
great many people and have a great many friends, and I keep up with
everybody.'' Friends confide, then he publishes. A feud follows
and, often, reconciliation. Nick, as he is known, inspires a gruff
fondness.
</P>
<P>
   As his head hit the ceiling of his Hollywood career in the '60s,
Dunne began drinking heavily, outspending his income. In a druggy
haze, he set fire to his hotel room; a drug-sharing stranger beat
him up. Prostitutes, a drug arrest. Divorce. ``I had a secret
life,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't get that out of me,'' he replies stiffly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he became his own worst nightmare: a social pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a book-signing recently at a Connecticut bookstore, 25
years after his flight to an Oregon cabin, where he dried out,
started writing and decided to move to New York, living near his
son Griffin, the actor and producer. He would go on to resurrect
himself into a best-selling author, becoming nationally recognized,
thanks to the televised Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the bookstore, a state trooper somberly asks him to step
outside.
</P>
<P>
   He freezes, this man whose brother committed suicide and nephew
died in a plane crash, whose middle son once was missing for a week
while hiking, whose former wife died from multiple sclerosis, whose
daughter was strangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Dunne, someone hit your Jaguar,'' the trooper says.
</P>
<P>
   The sobbing offender stands by the smashed prize, terrified,
expecting Dominick Dunne to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he laughs loudly, looking heavenward. Then, wrapping
his arms around her, he gives the startled woman a bear hug. ``It
can be fixed!'' he shouts, between guffaws.  &QL;

BETTING ON THE BIG GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The overriding obsession among many people observing
Sunday's match between the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans is
not who will win, but, instead, who will cover the seven-point
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no other single sporting event in America that
inspires such wide-spread wagering interest as the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been estimated one out of every three adults in this
country has a stake in the game either in an office pool, a
friendly wager with a friend or a bet with a bookmaker or in one of
the legal sports books,'' says Las Vegas gambling figure Jimmy
Vaccaro. ``At least $75 million will be wagered on the game in the
Nevada sports books. Another $150 million will be bet in the
off-shore gambling outfits in the Caribbean. And six times that
amount will be bet with the illegal books around the country. I
wouldn't be surprised if more than a billion dollars winds up being
bet on this game.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many people risking so much money on the NFL's most
high-profile event, one idly wonders about the origin of the
seven-point line that favors the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   How did it come about? Who's responsible for it? From where did
it originate? What went into the process?
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the entire Super Bowl line process unfold Sunday and
it was pretty fascinating,'' says Peter Ruckland, general manager
of the Gambler's Book Club store in Las Vegas who's writing a book
on the history of sports betting in America.
</P>
<P>
   Ruckland was at the two-story Las Vegas headquarters of the
appropriately-named Las Vegas Sports Consultants, the Michael
Roxborough-founded company that has been supplying the official
sports odds to most betting entities in America for the past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got there early in the morning before the NFL conference
championship games even started,'' relates Ruckland. ``There are
basically eight people involved in the entire process, Their names
are Scott Kaminsky, Cesar Robaina, Peter Korner, Jason Been, (cq)
Karol (cq) Lucan, Tom Vanderhoof, Dan O'Brien and John Harper. And
there is also an outside oddsmakers they use as a consultant. They
post lines not only on football, but also on all the other sports
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watch games on TV sets that are all over the place, and
gab back and forth throughout the day. Even before the games
started, they had made up an imaginary line for four possible Super
Bowl matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the Rams 10 over Tennessee and 6 over Jacksonville.
They had Jacksonville 8 over Tampa Bay. And they had Tennessee 5
over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as the day went on and Tennessee looked impressive in
beating Jacksonville and the Rams struggled against Tampa Bay, they
came in with a lower point spread for the Ram-Titan matchup. At
about 4:45, perhaps the most important employee in the Las Vegas
Sports Consultant operation, Chris Chavez, the company's computer
administrator, punched in the opening spread 8 points to outlets
around the country. Why is Chavez so important? Can you imagine the
chaos Chavez could create if he sent out the wrong number?''
</P>
<P>
   While the Las Vegas Sports Consultants disseminates the numbers
they also opened the unders/overs line at 48 its clients use the
price more as a guideline and often go with their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while the Stardust's sports book manager, Joe
Lupo, opened the Super Bowl Sunday evening at 7, the Hilton's Art
Manteris' made it attractive for the chalkies gamblers inclined to
bet on favorites by opening it at a mere 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   But, almost immediately, after a flurry of back and forth
betting, the price steadied at 7, where it's remained the entire
week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wonders how the Rams wound up as a touchdown favorite
in the Super Bowl even though they had the same regular season
record as the Titans, 13-3, and even though they were beaten by the
Tennessee team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest question I'm asked is what actually goes into
deciding a point spread,'' says Scott Kaminsky, senior oddsmaker
for the Las Vegas Sports Consultants. ``I mean, it's not like we
have power ratings, or feed a bunch of data into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just more of a gut feeling among those making such
decisions. The Rams are the favorites in this game because they
have been a more dominating team than Tennessee this season. You
also try to come up with a number that will result in two-way
action. If we had opened the Rams as 10-point favorites after
Sunday's game, all the money would have come in on the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a line is really not as exciting or as mysterious as
most people think. It's pretty boring, humdrum stuff. Basically,
for the Super Bowl, there were four of us who ultimately came up
with the line me, Cesar Robaina, Jason Been and a guy we use from
the outside named Eugene Buanthony (also known as Gene Bennett).
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened it at 8, all the early tidbit money came in on
Tennessee, and that's why the spread dropped to seven. But it won't
surprise me if the public will come in strongly on the Rams this
weekend. The public has a long history of betting favorites in the
Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky has worked for Las Vegas Sports Consultants since
Roxborough, a legendary numbers whiz, put the company together in
1984. Roxborough recently sold it for an estimated $6 million to
the San Mateo-based Data Broadcasting Corporation, and is now
living in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Sports Consultants doesn't get involved in exotic
wagers like some of the goofy ones now up at the Imperial Palace in
Las Vegas (Will Kurt Warner's completion total exceed Kobe Bryant's
point total Sunday against Houston? Will Marshall Faulk's rushing
total exceed David Duval's final round score at the Phoenix Open?
Will Steve McNair's passing yardage exceed the Lakers-Rockets point
total?, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels put up those kind of bets to stir the interest of
customers who aren't necessarily football fans,'' says Kaminsky.
``There are some pretty funny ones. We don't have the time here to
mess with those kind of wagers. Remember, the Super Bowl is just
one game for us. We're busy this time of the year putting out daily
lines on college basketball games, hockey games, NBA games, tennis
matches, golf matches and car races.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel you've put out the right line when there is a lot of
betting on both sides. And that's been the case this week with this
Super Bowl. There's been a lot of two-way action.''

THE BURDENS OF BEING HILLARY CLINTON

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A test for voters, an old one, but it still works.
</P>
<P>
   PART I
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a candidate who is outspoken, opinionated and litigious,
who rewards loyalists, assails critics and berates reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this candidate as a man. See him in your mind's eye
(which in this case is not very difficult). What adjectives come to
mind? Be honest with yourself. Strong. Aggressive. Tough. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine this candidate as a woman. The adjectives change a
bit, don't they?
</P>
<P>
   PART II
</P>
<P>
   Consider a candidate (male or female) with opinions about
everything, who ducks rarely and knows the issues inside-out.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider a candidate who ducks and parries, who rehearses
spontaneity and seems frightened of candor.
</P>
<P>
   Which candidate do you prefer?
</P>
<P>
   A month into the Senate election year, and two of Hillary Rodham
Clinton's three big problems (see below for the third) are as
crystal clear as the ice on her Chappaqua driveway. She had it
half-right on Tuesday in Albany, when asked why some New Yorkers do
not seem to like her. She cited her positions, adding, ``and maybe
a little of it is because I'm a woman taking those positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Any woman who has ever been in a position of responsibility
knows that it is still more difficult for women to succeed than for
men. That's just how it is. Women in public life still have to be
on their guard. They cannot be as combative or, heaven forfend,
emotional. They have to be candid, but not aggressively so. Direct,
not cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they just can't win.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani can be angry in public and it seems to
help. Three years ago, when Vanity Fair ran a nasty, anonymously
sourced story claiming that his marriage was in trouble and that he
was having an ``intimate'' relationship with an aide, he angrily
denounced the story as ``scurrilous'' and ``untrue,'' did not
directly answer questions about the status of his marriage and said
he'd have no more to say. End of episode.
</P>
<P>
   When a radio reporter in Buffalo recently asked Mrs. Clinton if
she'd been faithful to her husband, even if she'd been unfaithful
with Vincent Foster Jr., the Clinton friend and adviser who
committed suicide, the protective wall came up. Mrs. Clinton chose
her words carefully. She kept her voice even, saying, ``Those kinds
of questions are really out of bounds, and everybody who knows me
knows the answer to those questions.'' When the reporter pressed
her _ ``Is the answer no?'' _ she answered, ``Well, yes, of course
it's no.''
</P>
<P>
   A pundit or two have argued that she should have lost her temper
and refused to answer. Sure. And then the tabloids would have gone
on and on asking why didn't she say no? What is she hiding? Critics
would have denounced her for unsenatorially losing her cool.
</P>
<P>
   In the artificial game of politics, women simply have to do even
heavier role-playing than men.
</P>
<P>
   But why does Mrs. Clinton appear equally careful and calculated
when the questions are not personal, when the political burdens of
sex are irrelevant? She said in Albany that she had probably
alienated some voters because of her positions. But polls show that
many voters agree with her. The problem is not her positions, but
how she shares them. Gingerly. That does not work with New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers like attitude. Hyperbole. Confrontation. Equanimity
is OK for Aspen. New York demands flair.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the word was that Mrs. Clinton was ready to mix
it up. But her ballyhooed appearance with David Letterman, while
beautifully performed, was orchestrated. She favors campaign
finance reform, but is about to set a record for spending. She
favors the ``concept'' of mayoral control of education, but not
with this mayor, and she won't even say whether Elian Gonzalez
should go home to Cuba, punting to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said weeks ago that the boy should stay here. Agree or
disagree, the mayor's got a position.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has given herself a tough job. Not only is she a
controversial woman who has to figure how to be guarded but not
artificial, she also has a lot of baggage (big problem No. 3):
she's got that husband, her health care debacle, the ``vast
right-wing conspiracy,'' Whitewater, her commodities deal and a
conflict: how can you be a convincing feminist while acting like a
female victim in a Jacqueline Susann novel?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, campaigning is harder for a woman. Mrs. Clinton can't
change that. Nor can she lose that baggage. But she can control the
core of her candidacy _ how she conducts herself and talks about
issues important to voters. One out of three ain't bad.

NO REST FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal is on pace for a career high in
minutes played, and based on coach Phil Jackson's clear
disenchantment with the Lakers' bench, O'Neal just might lead the
league. If he doesn't collapse first.
</P>
<P>
   After playing 55 minutes against the Utah Jazz on Monday,
O'Neal's per-game average is up to 40.1 -- tying him for fifth in
the league, and putting him on pace for 3,249 minutes this season.
The most he's ever played was 3,224 in 1993-94, his second NBA
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' only backup centers are Travis Knight and John
Salley, and Jackson offered a blunt assessment of that twosome:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not compelling,'' he said Wednesday. ``It doesn't feel
compelling to have to play anybody off the bench behind Shaq. As a
tired player, he's probably better than what we have to offer, and
that's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a barren free-agent market or a trade as the only
solutions . And nothing is imminent. Contrary to reports out of
Washington, team sources say the Lakers have little interest in
Wizards center Ike Austin, primarily because he's due $11 million
over the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson will continue to play O'Neal as much as necessary,
giving him quick, one- or two-minute breaks at the end of quarters.
He doesn't trust the Lakers to play extended periods without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him a rest at the end of the third quarter for two
minutes aga inst Utah, we fell what...six points down? (The Lakers
went from a one-point lead to a 66-61 deficit). We just can't
afford to do that,'' Jackson said. ``And that's the unfortunate
part about it, is that when we do take him out of the game...(we)
lost a lead to fall behind going into the fourth quarter. So
there's a certain sense about how to play it and how to do it
(without O'Neal), and we're not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad chemistry: The Lakers' early struggles against Utah produced
a rare sight: a five-man substitution by Jackson. After leading by
nine points in the second quarter, the Lakers watched the Jazz go
on a 14-2 run to take a 37-34 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called timeout with 3:17 to go in the half and sent in a
whole new unit -- A.C. Green, Devean George, Ron Harper, Derek
Fisher and O'Neal went in for Robert Horry, Glen Rice, Brian Shaw,
Kobe Bryant and Knight. It was a first for Jackson this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing really poorly, and we just needed to make an
overall substitution of people in there,'' he said. ``It was a
pretty pathetic offensive group of guys out there. We just had to
take people out and get a new mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   The move stemmed the bleeding, but the new group went into
halftime still trailing by a point.

   2 DEMOCRATS ADVISE McCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain on Wednesday listed two prominent Democrats
among his foreign policy advisers, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the
national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter, and R.
James Woolsey, President Clinton's former director of central
intelligence. Also on a list of advisers released Wednesday were
Republicans like Henry Kissinger, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Robert
McFarlane and Lawrence Eagleburger.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES ON HAWKS
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day of campaigning in New Hampshire, Steve
Forbes appeared at a defense contractor in Nashua and called for
increased military spending saying, ``A cheap hawk is a dead
hawk.'' He added: ``The U.S. is the only superpower. If our country
gets in trouble then the rest of the world gets in trouble.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GORE ON HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday praised the Clinton
administration's overhaul of the welfare system. Welfare, like the
economy, has improved over the past eight years, Gore said. ``OK,
it's been a success, what now?'' Gore said at a circuit-board
manufacturer in Manchester. ``We need to keep building on this
success.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS: CLOSE PLAY AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   Even in his home state, Sen. John McCain of Arizona is in a
tight race with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a recent poll found.
The Arizona State University poll, conducted Thursday through
Sunday, found that Republicans who voted in the past two
presidential primaries supported McCain over Bush, 37 percent to 30
percent, but the margin of sampling error was four percentage
points. Support for other candidates was in single digits.

UCLA DESPERATE FOR SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the Pac-10 title. Forget a top seed in the NCAA
Tournament. At 11-5 and sixth place in the conference, UCLA's
priority should be (ital)qualifying for(end ital) the Tournament.
The journey continues this week in Oregon, where the Bruins
desperately need a split.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, every Pac-10 team with at least 18 wins
and a .500 or-better league record has made the Tournament (14 of
14).
</P>
<P>
   To reach 18, the Bruins must win seven of their last 14 games.
They have four very difficult games left (Arizona, Syracuse and
Stanford twice). Four others will be tough: USC and Oregon at home;
Arizona State and Cal on the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins lose twice this weekend, starting tonight at
Oregon State tonight, they'd have to win their remaining home games
(including Stanford) or win six at home and one on the road.
Considering their recent play, they can't count on beating anyone,
day or night, home or road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win a game and then we get too satisfied,'' UCLA forward
Matt Barnes said. ``We don't stay hungry. Everyone's out to beat us
every game, and I don't think some people realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back: Oregon State received a boost last weekend when
center Jason Heide returned from a sprained ankle and broken thumb.
He is the Beavers' best low-post scorer and has averaged 10 points
in three games against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle injury was difficult, but it was a blessing in
disguise because it allowed the thumb to heal more than it might
have,'' Beavers coach Eddie Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on strong: Barnes practiced this week as well as he
played against Arizona State and might join the starting lineup
tonight. (Rico Hines is out with a sprained toe).
</P>
<P>
   If Barnes starts, Jason Kapono will slide from small forward to
wing guard, giving the Bruins four starters 6-7 or taller.
</P>
<P>
   After several subpar games, Barnes scored a career-high 17
points Saturday. He also played well defensively and committed just
one turnover in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing with greater intensity defensively, and that
allows us to extend his minutes, and as a result his offense comes
into play ,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.

TURNER HOPES TO REDSHIRT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC forward Jarvis Turner is currently on crutches with a
fractured left ankle that could sideline him the rest of the
season, but the senior says he would like to explore the
possibility of redshirting and returning for a fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to think that I've played my last game at USC,''
Turner said. ``If it's possible, I'd like to come back, but I still
have to look into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's chances for a redshirt year are not good. He has played
in seven games, which would be more than the 20 percent limit for
redshirt candidates. Turner also played in USC's 16th game, which
would place him past the halfway mark of the season, another litmus
test for redshirts. He could still try and petition the NCAA
claiming a medical hardship.
</P>
<P>
   No regrets: Even with the recent rash of injuries, USC coach
Henry Bibby said he doesn't have second thoughts about the
transfers of forwards Greg Lakey (Loyola Marymount) and Shannon
Swillis (Fresno State) following last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have any regrets? No. Not at all,'' Bibby said. ``The
guys that left, I'm glad they left. It shows no commitment on their
part. Every kid decided it was not in their best interest to stay
here. Do I play favorites? Yes, the guys that play best I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he's happier that he has less players available, if
they are happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at our basketball team right now and I can't find
anyone that's complaining,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scalabrine: Forward Brian Scalabrine said he believes
teammate and roommate Sam Clancy (broken foot) will be out the
minimum six weeks and return for the final two games of the
conference season. That goes against the medical opinions following
last week's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Sam has is amazing genes,'' Scalabrine said,
referring to his father, former NFL player Sam Clancy Sr. ``And
I've been telling him to drink milk. The only milk he got today is
cheese from a Wendy's cheeseburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Turner and Clancy made the trip to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Step it up: Bibby said he has been disappointed in the play of
junior guard Jeff Trepagnier the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything the last two games,'' Bibby said. `` I
didn't see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he forgot that Trepagnier made three critical plays
that sent the Arizona State game into overtime last week. But
Trepagnier agreed with Bibby's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's probably right,'' Trepagnier said. ``I'm one of
the main guys the team depends on, I can't let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice reception: The Trojans are noticing a different reaction
around campus this week, no doubt the result of their 5-0 Pac-10
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, when I went to class people said `Great game,' ''
Trepagnier said. ``Last year, when we were losing they didn't even
pay attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Added forward David Bluthenthal: ``Every day, one of my teachers
talks about how I'm in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul problems: Bibby said one of the main goals for tonight's
game against Oregon is to keep his starters from committing dumb
fouls. ``We talked about it as a team yesterday,'' Bibby said.
``Three players get two silly fouls every night -- Jeff Trepagnier,
Brandon Granville and Brian Scalabrine -- hopefully, we can
minimize that.''

BELICHICK DROPS SUIT AFTER NEGATIVE RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Belichick dropped the antitrust lawsuit he had filed
against the National Football League and the New York Jets on
Wednesday, one day after the judge in the case refused to grant a
temporary restraining order that would have allowed Belichick to
negotiate with other teams for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick filed the lawsuit Monday, hoping that the judge would
grant him the freedom that NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue did not
when he ruled last Friday that the Jets still own Belichick's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose of the case from Bill's perspective was to
seek emergency relief so he had the opportunity to coach now,''
said Jeffrey Kessler, Belichick's lawyer. ``Since it became
apparent the court wasn't going to give us that relief, we had to
decide what other options we could pursue. That option didn't work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler declined to discuss what other options are available to
Belichick, who resigned after one day as the Jets' head coach. U.S.
District Court Judge John Bissell, who presided over a hearing in
Newark, N.J., on Tuesday, said then that an early look at the
evidence did not bode well for Belichick's chances of proving a
violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had asked each side to contact him Wednesday about
whether another hearing Friday would be necessary to determine if a
preliminary injunction could be granted against the league or if
the ruling against the restraining order could simply be converted
to a ruling denying the injunction as well. The Jets' lawyer called
the judge to say the conversion would be fine with the team. If the
injunction were denied, Kessler would have had the right to appeal
that decision to a federal appeals court. Instead, he dropped the
case entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``'His goal is not to not be a coach and get damages,'' Kessler
said. ``He wants to be a coach. If necessary, if all else fails,
then he will pursue his claim for damages. Right now, what he wants
to do is be permitted to work again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had no comment on Wednesday's development.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's immediate future remains murky. A team that wants
his services may have them, but it will have to pay compensation to
the Jets. The New England Patriots, who on Jan. 3 asked for
permission to speak to Belichick, have had talks with the Jets to
try to reach a deal, but so far those talks have produced no
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Patriots have also had talks with candidates who
would fill the general manager and head-coaching posts separately,
the two jobs that Belichick would presumably fill by himself if he
had the freedom to make a deal with New England. Wednesday, the
Patriots met with Dom Capers, the defensive coordinator of the
Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are one of just two NFL teams that now need a head
coach, limiting Belichick's options. The New Orleans Saints are
also looking for a coach.

EDITORIAL: A DISAPPOINTING CHOICE ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 27: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council's compromise choice of Hans
Blix as the new chief weapons inspector for Iraq is a disturbing
sign that the international community lacks the determination to
rebuild an effective arms inspection system in Iraq. Blix is a man
of unquestioned integrity and tact. But he seems unlikely to
provide the forceful leadership needed to keep Saddam Hussein from
cheating on his arms control obligations and building fearsome
unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The further the world gets from the Gulf war, the more it seems
willing to let Saddam revive his deadly weapons projects. Now,
after approving a new inspection program that offers a minimally
acceptable level of monitoring, the security council is turning the
inspection work over to a man of uncertain resolve. Blix compiled a
mixed record in his previous job as head of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, including a decade-long failure to detect
Iraq's secret nuclear weapons program before the gulf war. That
embarrassing lapse was not entirely his fault, since IAEA
inspectors at the time had authority to inspect only installations
acknowledged by the Iraqi government. Blix later sought and won
strengthened investigative powers. But his tendency to credit
official assurances from rulers like Hussein is not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Blix suggested easing the standard for judging when Iraq
has met its obligations to eliminate all biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. He called for
winding up inspections once U.N. investigators feel they have
uncovered all the prohibited weapons they are likely to find, even
if highly dangerous materials remain unaccounted for. That
virtually invites Iraq, which has not yet agreed to admit new U.N.
inspectors, to continue concealing its illegal programs. We hope
Blix will reconsider his position now that he will lead the
inspection effort.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who previously ran the Iraq inspection program, Rolf
Ekeus and Richard Butler, rightly insisted that Baghdad would have
to provide complete answers to all significant questions about
missing weapons, ingredients and records before it could be
considered in compliance. Washington should apply a similar
standard before approving any move in the security council to end
international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration unwilling to fight for a
stronger nominee, even after the U.N. secretary general, Kofi
Annan, boldly proposed bringing back Ekeus, Blix may be an
unavoidable choice. But the problem of Iraqi weapons development is
not going to go away. The United States and its European allies may
later regret that they were not more energetic in enforcing Iraq's
disarmament obligations.

   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Battling from behind to stage a stirring
comeback on a strange, fickle day better suited for water-skiing
than for yacht racing, Paul Cayard's America One overtook Italy's
Prada Challenge on Thursday and won by 1 minute 33 seconds to even
the five-of-nine final round of the Louis Vuitton Cup at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Cayard cemented his reputation as a never-say-die
competitor who is never out of a boat race, no matter how deep the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's light-to-moderate wind contest, Cayard hoped
to see more substantial breezes in the 12-to-15 knot range on
Thursday. But the conditions proved far more challenging for this
second race of the challenger series to determine the opponent for
New Zealand's defense of the America's Cup next month.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the race committee postponed the start for nearly an
hour, waiting for a fluky swirling wind to fill and settle. But
from the very beginning, it was apparent that the patchwork breeze
would play a major role in the day's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a 7-to-9 knot zephyr eased in from the southeast, and
the committee sounded the gun to start the afternoon's proceedings.
Both skippers worked their helms gingerly throughout the prestart
sequence, fearful of committing a foul and knowing that quick,
tight maneuvers were out of the question in the light air.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage, the America One tactician, John Kostecki, firmly
stated, ``I want the left,'' a comment picked up by the onboard
television mike. But after a slow-motion tussle with about a minute
to go, it was Prada sailing to the course's left-hand side, while
America One peeled inside the committee boat and off to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's boat enjoyed an eight-second lead at the start as both
boats diverged on opposite tacks. When they tacked and closed for
the race's inaugural crossing, America One still held the
advantage. But after Cayard planted a tack directly in front of
Prada, the Italians again spun out to the left to escape the
disturbed wind flowing over America One's sails.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Americans, however, Kostecki's original
assessment was dead on. Working the left for all it was worth,
Prada soon took over the lead. Once there, the Italians found
better wind pressure and began to extend their lead, showing a
pronounced edge in boat speed in conditions generally thought to
favor America One.
</P>
<P>
   Prada found even more breeze at the top mark, and rounded with a
solid 1:49 lead. America One discovered a tad more pressure and,
aided by a botched Italian jibe, closed Prada's lead to 1:04 at the
bottom mark.
</P>
<P>
   But the breeze continued to shift and oscillate, and Cayard
summed up the conditions succinctly. ``Squirrelly day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Working to the left of the Italian boat, Cayard found good
pressure from a favorable direction and soon, remarkably, clawed
back into the lead. But Prada was still positioned to pull back in
front with a favorable wind shift.
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard was just getting going. And a torn gennaker, a
light-wind sail, sustained seconds after America One rounded the
mark and hoisted the sail did not deter him from sailing a
sensational downwind leg. America One's crew recovered quickly,
sending up a new sail to replace the ripped one and, for the second
time, overtaking Prada.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom mark, America One rounded 1:27 ahead of Prada. It
was the first time the Americans led around any mark in the
challenger finals. And, it was the first time the American team
relaxed all day.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was simply a matter of covering the Italians and
denying a passing lane. Cayard completed the exercise and squared
the series.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones won't have any shopping to do
when he gets to the Super Bowl. He found his next head coach right
at Valley Ranch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jones announced he was promoting defensive
coordinator Dave Campo to the spot vacated when Chan Gailey was
fired two days after the Cowboys lost their wild-card playoff game
at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are also expected to hire New England quarterbacks
coach Jack Reilly to be their offensive coordinator, a role that
was occupied by Gailey previously. Riley, who spent Wednesday at
Valley Ranch meeting with Jones, was a former Dallas quarterbacks
coach under Ernie Zampese.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary coach Mike Zimmer will likely be promoted to defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring Campo, Jones said he wanted to shorten the transition
period. The Cowboys went through one disruption two years ago when
Gailey was hired to replace Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come from within the staff, it reduces the transition that
would always come and has come any time a person from outside our
organization has come in,'' Jones said. ``We have a sense of
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo, 52, has been with the team for 11 years, since Jones
bought it in 1989. Among the group of assistant coaches Jimmy
Johnson brought with him from the University of Miami, Campo rose
to the position of defensive coordinator five years ago. He was
part of three Super Bowl championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a feeling of pride when we can look at our staff and
find the man with the qualities to coach the Dallas Cowboys,''
Jones said. ``There was no doubt in my mind that the best man was
right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo becomes only the fifth head coach in the Cowboys' history,
but he will be the fourth in eight seasons. Gailey, who served only
two seasons, was the only Cowboys coach not to earn a Super Bowl
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will give it everything I have to bring those expectations
and aspirations back where they should be,'' Campo said. ``In this
business, you work to try to be the best you can be. That's
something I've tried to do all my life _ not worry about what
obstacles were in front of me but try to get around those
obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo has been examining NFL head coaching vacancies with
interest and was frustrated that his name hadn't been included in
any previous speculation. He saved the stories mentioning the
``hot'' candidates, tacking up a list, with his name noticeably
absent, for motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me,'' Campo said in December before Gailey's
firing. ``I enjoy being here in Dallas. But I want to be a head
coach. You'd like to think things were on merit. Sometimes it's not
merit. But that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Campo's defenses have ranked among the league's top 10 in three
of the past four seasons. This season, the Cowboys started near the
bottom after a woeful season-opening performance in Washington.
They finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Campo was a three-year starter at defensive back at Central
Connecticut State before moving into the coaching ranks. He has had
stops at his alma mater as well as Albany State, Bridgeport,
Pittsburgh, Washington State, Boise State, Oregon State, Weber
State, Iowa State, Syracuse and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But he seems to have settled in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been part of this organization for 11 years,'' Campo
said. ``I feel like I'm part of family in this organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry and I have the same philosophy, and that's to win the
Super Bowl. We've been together, and we know how we each think. I
think that makes it a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo and kicking coordinator Steve Hoffman are the only coaches
remaining from Johnson's initial staff.

4 MALE GUARDS IN WESTCHESTER ARE ACCUSED OF JAIL RAPES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAWTHORNE, N.Y. _ Four of the roughly two dozen guards who
oversee the women's quarters in the Westchester County jail were
arrested Wednesday on sex-abuse charges, including raping and
sodomizing prisoners and forcing them to strip in exchange for
medication.
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Andrew J. Spano said that the sexual
mistreatment by the four male guards was such an abuse of power
that he would change the jail's work rules by requiring that only
women guard the female prisoners' residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an abuse of power by the corrections officers
involved,'' Spano said Wednesday at a news conference. ``We think
that a change of procedures is warranted. We don't want men any
longer to have access to the living quarters of female prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that although the investigation would
continue, no other sexual abuse or wrongdoing was suspected. They
also said that other corrections officers apparently had no
knowledge of what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   In the six-month investigation, the authorities interviewed 33
current and former female inmates, said the county district
attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pirro told of one woman with a toothache ``who was in
extreme pain, and who could not get medication until she took her
top off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And when she wanted more, she had to expose another body
part,'' Ms. Pirro said. ``Two days later, she had a tooth
extracted.''
</P>
<P>
   The men arrested were also suspended from their jobs. Under a
state law adopted in 1996, any sex between an inmate and a guard is
deemed third-degree rape, or statutory rape, because prisoners are
not free to give their consent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, at least three other guards at the Westchester
County jail have been convicted of sex-related crimes against
inmates, Ms. Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   Spano, the county executive, said only a few of the guards who
work in the women's housing unit are women; county officials said
the exact number was not available. Of the 750 guards at the jail,
135 are women.
</P>
<P>
   The jail can hold up to 200 women prisoners. They are kept there
while they are awaiting trial, or when their convictions call for
sentences of less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mishi Faruqee, director of the Women in Prison Project at the
New York Correctional Association, a nonprofit watchdog group, said
coerced sexual relations between female prisoners and guards was a
common problem, although statistics are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Women inmates feel they must surrender to advances to win or
retain privileges, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, officials praised the women who told their stories of
sexual abuse in the jail, which allegedly began in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very strong women,'' said Detective Glenna Lunn, who
interviewed the women. ``They should be proud of themselves for
coming forward.''

CAMPO LANDED TOP JOB OLD WAY: HE EARNED IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dave Campo's niche in franchise history will be
that he is the first Dallas Cowboys assistant ever elevated to the
role of head coach.
</P>
<P>
   And despite what you may not know about the man, despite what
you may think of the owner, there is something very righteous and
encouraging about that.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years, Campo paid his dues as a loyal staff soldier. He
arrived not long after owner Jerry Jones arrived. Like Jones, he
learned the league. He watched the Cowboys' family prosper _ and
now suffer.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a normal football organization, if this were a real
football team _ and not the NFL's most-watched soap opera _ Owner
Jones could have swallowed hard and imported a brand new head
coach. That new coach would have had full rein to gut the current
staff and surround himself with his own nest of assistants.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a normal NFL team, there would have been a bold new
look at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But as Owner Jones said Wednesday, ``I didn't give that much
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   A completely new coach would have meant a new philosophy, Jones
explained, and that could well have meant a new offense and
defense, with accompanying new opinions on personnel. The new coach
might not have been as enamored of Troy Aikman, of Emmitt Smith, or
of Darren Woodson. He might not even have liked Jerry's habit of
wandering onto the sideline in midgames.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, at the wise and experienced age of 52, Campo became the
franchise's fifth head coach Wednesday. He deserved it as much as
any assistant coach since Jimmy Johnson's staff began to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   As Campo himself said, ``I believe I've paid some dues.''
</P>
<P>
   His first coaching job came at Central Connecticut State 28
years ago. In his 11 seasons with the Cowboys, he toiled loyally
and achieved success in every area where he was assigned. Five
seasons ago, some thought that Jim Eddy would have been the better
choice as defensive coordinator. Campo has since disproved that.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need Jesse Jackson to get hired. He didn't need a
special task force of the NFL commissioner. He didn't need a letter
of recommendation from Jimmy Johnson or Don Shula or a phone call
from Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Campo got the job the old-fashioned way, by earning it.
</P>
<P>
   He is not large in stature _ Owner Jones is taller than his new
coach _ but he is Italian. And as one of the other Cowboys
assistants once said, Campo speaks ``a lot taller'' on the practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the background,'' Jones said, ``I see energy.
There's intelligence. This is one of the smartest people we have in
our organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I see toughness. You don't coach the players he's had and
have the success he's had without being tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some local thinking, therefore, ``Campo'' is not the
Italian word for doormat. If Jones steps on future toes, Campo will
say something. If players try to re-enact the owner's-office end
run that scuttled Chan Gailey, Campo will say something.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is too proud and feisty a man not to say something if he
feels he's being undermined. His resume is solid. He could walk
away from this organization and be hired as somebody else's
assistant coach in less than a month. And Campo might have, if Joe
Avezzano had been named head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Campo never said that publicly, but Owner Jones had to weigh the
possibility. Thus, Campo was not only the smarter choice, but the
more expedient one.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted the job and, within hours of Gailey's departure, Campo
gave the owner a list of reasons why he should get it. Some might
call it politicking, but Jones cited it as an example of how
organized Campo is.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Cowboys' occasional episodes of discombobulation
in recent seasons, a little organization couldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jones said he saw the pointlessness in continuing to make
phone calls, trawling the coaching waters, ``to try to find someone
to beat him out.'' At this stage, the owner implied, no one was
going to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I know the direction of this organization,'' Campo
said. ``I also know the direction of Jerry. I know the buttons that
need to be pushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in place some outstanding football players. I just
think we need to get refocused.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is hard to argue. As Campo outlined his coaching
philosophy, he mentioned things like enthusiasm, discipline and
motivation _ words that should perk ears among Cowboys fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that you can motivate athletes,'' Campo said.
``My No. 1 objective is to develop an attitude. We have got to get
that attitude back.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Campo, the longtime loyal soldier, do it? Owner Jones, it
says here, had to find out.
</P>
<P>
   There are buttons to be pushed. There's a fire to be rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, as well as anyone that Jones could have hired, knows
what's expected. Some of us will be surprised if he comes up short.

GORE AND BRADLEY FIRE BROADSIDES IN TESTY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs throughout to put the candidates' statements and positions in
better context, while tightening and/or eliminating some of the
less-important exchanges)

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Facing questions about the vigor of his
campaign and under frequent attack from Vice President Al Gore,
former Sen. Bill Bradley attacked Gore on Wednesday night over
abortion, welfare reform, health care plans that ``nibble around
the edges'' and for working ``hand in glove with special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In their seventh and most combative debate, held just six days
before the New Hampshire primary, Gore hammered Bradley on familiar
subjects, accusing him of voting with congressional supporters of
President Ronald Reagan against children and of offering a health
plan that did not do what it promised.
</P>
<P>
   The testy, one-hour debate was punctuated with contradictions
and quarrels. Each Democratic presidential candidate accused the
other of conducting a negative campaign, and Bradley even raised
the specter of President Richard M. Nixon. With Bradley hoping to
regain his political footing and avoid a second consecutive defeat
after Monday's drubbing in Iowa, his aggressiveness was
particularly notable while Gore's was more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as
president if you won't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked. ``Any politician can pick a fight, but only a leader can
move a country forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended his record against the special interest charge
when he said, ``I have fought for working people against every
lobby that exists in Washington.'' And he spoke up for President
Clinton, too, saying, ``People are tired of the whole discussion
about the president's personal mistake. They think that by and
large he has been a great president, in turning this economy
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion was the first issue joined. Even as the Republican
presidential candidates are competing to assert their credentials
as opponents of abortion, Gore and Bradley are arguing their
records as defenders of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates' positions are now identical, favoring
no change in the Roe vs. Wade decision and supporting a change in
the law, to require Medicaid to pay for abortions for poor women.
But Bradley pointed out that National Right to Life, an advocacy
group, had given Gore an 84 percent positive rating in his early
years in Congress, when he opposed Medicaid abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your campaign shouldn't go around saying that you've always
been for a woman's right to choose, because the record shows you
did not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended himself, saying ``It's true that early in my
career I wrestled with the question of what kinds of exceptions
should be allowed to the general rule that Medicaid should also pay
for this procedure. I have come to the strong view that all women,
regardless of their income, must have the right to choose, and
that's my position.'' He added ``If you want to manufacture a
distinction, OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's first salvo came on an issue Bradley has
tried to make his signature, a pledge to ``end child poverty in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``The '81 budget cuts that Ronald Reagan proposed
resulted in an increase of 1 million children losing health care
under Medicaid and one and a half million children living in
poverty. Why did you support those changes?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied, ``My job was to try to diminish the effect of
those budget cuts. We succeeded in doing that. Ultimately, I voted
for the Reagan budget,'' he said. ``But it was an act of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then asked his rival why he had voted against the welfare
overhaul, which Gore said ``moved 7 million people from welfare to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley fired back by asking ``why you think it's working so
well when because of welfare reform there are one million children
in this country who don't have health insurance.'' He said the
October 1996 vote to pass the bill ``was a gamble with kids for
re-election.'' He said ``I was not willing to take that gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have throughout the campaign, they quarreled about each
other's health care proposals. Gore said his plan would ``get to
universal health care for all Americans in a step-by-step way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied, ``You've said again tonight you're for
universal health care. The problem is you don't get anywhere close
to getting there. You nibble around the edges and indeed you have
nothing in your budget for the next ten years to get the universal
health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked the Bradley plan, as he often has before,
contending that it provided too little money to buy the insurance
plans it was supposed to furnish. ``People here in New Hampshire
would really be left out in the cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy arguments were sedate in comparison with the
personal exchanges, with Bradley comparing Gore to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused him of negative campaigning and said, ``If you're
going to talk about a higher standard, live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said, ``When Al accuses me of negative campaigning, that
reminds me of the story about Richard Nixon. They said Richard
Nixon is the kind of politician who would chop down a tree, then
stand on the stump and give a speech about conservation. It just
won't wash.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator then quoted a Boston Globe article saying
Gore was the favorite of Washington lobbyists. He asked, ``How can
you be fighting for the people when you're working hand in glove
with the special interests who are fighting against the people?''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president replied, ``If that's not negative, I don't
know what it is. You know, I have never been afraid to stand up to
the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fought for working people against every lobby that
exists in Washington for 23 years now,'' Gore added. ``I have
fought for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley answered that all Gore offered was ``politics as
usual.'' He said, ``And that's a thousand promises and a thousand
attacks. Promised to every little special interest group, attack,
attack, attack every day. That's been the nature of it. And quite
frankly, I think the people are fed up with it, but from your
standpoint, nothing is changed, the lobbyists are still in charge
in Washington.''

PERRY RATHBONE, MUSEUM DIRECTOR, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perry T. Rathbone, an internationally known art authority and
the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston from 1955 until
1972, died Jan. 22 at a nursing home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbone, who joined Christie's, the auction house, after
leaving the museum and worked there until 1993, had been ill for
the last few years, said his son, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career Rathbone was an enthusiastic art
evangelist and a pace-setting museum director who was twice
president of the Association of Art Museum Directors. He was
awarded many honorary degrees, and the French government made him a
chevalier of the Legion of Honor. But he was also linked with
scandal. In 1969, while he was director, the Boston museum
purchased a portrait attributed to Raphael that had been illegally
smuggled out of Italy. The U.S. Customs Service impounded the
painting and eventually returned it to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Rathbone, then 61, stepped down from his
post, prompting speculation that the scandal had precipitated his
early retirement. Museum trustees, however, said that no such
inference should be drawn and retained him as a consultant.
Rathbone, who had been a museum director for 32 years, simply said
that the job was meant for a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Curators at the museum paid tribute to Rathbone, who had always
been most proud of his acquisitions, by organizing an exhibition of
them in the unheard-of period of eight weeks. Called ``The Rathbone
Years,'' it showcased 170 acquisitions made during his 17-year
tenure as director and included a pair of portraits by Rembrandt, a
Greek youth on horseback (circa 500 B.C.), a German Gothic tapestry
titled ``Wild Men and Moors'' and ``La Japonaise'' by Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbone did not go long without a job: David Rockefeller asked
him to advise the Chase Manhattan Bank on its art purchases, and he
did so for about a year until he joined Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbone's love of art was clearly infectious. All three of his
children followed him into the art world: his son, Peter, of New
Canaan, Conn., is the director of American paintings at Sotheby's;
a daughter, Eliza Rathbone, of Washington, is chief curator at the
Phillips Collection, and another daughter, Belinda Rathbone, of
Cambridge, Mass., and Arbroath, Scotland, is a photography
historian.
</P>
<P>
   They survive him, as do his wife, Euretta, and seven
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Townsend Rathbone was born in Germantown, Pa., in 1911,
the son of a photographer and a nurse, and grew up in New Rochelle,
N.Y. After graduating from Harvard College in 1933, he did graduate
work at the Fogg Museum of Fine Arts at Harvard and then took a job
at the Detroit Institute of Arts, where the director, William
Valentiner, an expert in German Expressionism, exposed him to that
school of artists.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbone directed the ``Masterpieces of Art'' exhibit at the New
York World's Fair in 1939, and the next year he was appointed
director of the St. Louis Art Museum. While there he was
instrumental in arranging for Max Beckmann, the Expressionist
painter who was labeled a ``degenerate artist'' in his native
Germany, and his wife to move to St. Louis. As a thank you,
Beckmann made Rathbone's wife the subject of his first portrait in
the United States; in 1948 he also painted a portrait of Rathbone,
cigarette in hand, that Rathbone later gave to the Museum of Fine
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Rathbone organized and wrote the catalog for the 1948 Beckmann
retrospective. He also introduced Beckmann to Morton D. May, of the
May Department Stores, who became a collector of Beckmann,
eventually bequeathing many of the works to the St. Louis museum.
When Beckmann died in 1950, Rathbone gave the eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Rathbone moved to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston,
where he expanded the museum by 80,000 square feet, doubled its
staff and directed the renovation of 57 of its 189 galleries. He
staged exhibitions of Rembrandt, Matisse, Modigliani, Cezanne, van
Gogh and Courbet. He also started the departments of pre-Columbian
and Primitive art and contemporary art, which under him made the
museum's first acquisitions of works by Picasso, Calder, Brancusi,
Klee, Giacometti and many others. For much of his tenure, Rathbone
served as his own curator of paintings, and he wrote articles and
essays on many artists.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Christie's in 1973 as director of its New York office,
then a small outpost of the London-based auction house. When
Christie's opened its salesroom in New York in 1977, he became a
senior vice president and director of museum services. He reduced
his activities in 1987, becoming a consultant.

BETTY MACDONALD BATCHELLER, 92, A DANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betty Macdonald Batcheller, the last surviving member of Martha
Graham's first dance company, died on Jan. 15 at the Greenwich
Laurelton Nursing Home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Batcheller, who danced as Betty Macdonald, met Graham at the
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she studied with the
choreographer in the mid-1920s. In 1926 Graham selected her, Evelyn
Sabin and Thelma Biracree to perform with her at the 48th Street
Theater in Manhattan on April 18 in her first independent program
as a choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   All three were under 21 at the time. The atmosphere of
preparation for that first concert was heady with poverty and an
intense devotion to Graham and her ideals, with Ms. Batcheller and
Sabin saving the threads that unraveled from Graham's teaching
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the performance the three dancers gave Graham
a costly carnelian necklace inscribed ``To Miss Martha with Love.''
Graham wore the necklace under her costume in one of the 18 dances
on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The three performed in pieces that included the melting
``Arabesque No. 1,'' set to Debussy, and ``The Three Gopi
Maidens.'' Little critical attention was paid to the program, whose
dances Don McDonagh describes as ``impressionism but with muscles''
in his book ``Martha Graham, A Biography.'' But a large audience
attended, and a second program was given on May 27 in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Batcheller danced with Graham until 1930, when she left to
perform on her own in New York, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   She shifted to theater in the 1930s, studying at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse and in New York at the Neighborhood Playhouse before
joining Clare Tree Major's Children's Theater in 1934. She also
performed in summer stock in Putney, Vt., and with Bob Elwyn's
Maverick Theater in Woodstock, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Macdonald married C. Robin Batcheller, a fellow actor, in
1935. The two performed together for several years with the Major
and Elwyn companies. Her last performance was in 1939 on Broadway
in ``The American Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Batcheller died in 1983. Ms. Batcheller is survived by a
brother, Donald Macdonald, of Webster, N.Y., and a son, Michael, of
Greenwich.  &QL;

L. WEISGARD, 83, AN ILLUSTRATOR OF MARGARET WISE BROWN BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard Weisgard, a children's book illustrator who won the
Caldecott Medal in 1947 for ``The Little Island,'' written by his
friend Margaret Wise Brown under the pseudonym Golden MacDonald,
died on Jan. 14 at his home in Glumso, Denmark. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Weisgard was born in New Haven, attended Pratt Institute for two
years and studied dance with Martha Graham before becoming a window
dresser at Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   His successful and productive collaboration with Brown began
with the very popular ``Noisy Books'' series (1939), published by
W.R. Scott, which urged readers to imitate sounds: dogs, trucks,
jackhammers. They both worked quickly. At lunch one day they
discussed Weisgard's childhood memory of street sounds in London.
The next day she presented him with a draft of the text, and he
completed the illustrations four days later. They showed the book
to children attending the Bank Street School, where Brown was a
member of the Writers Laboratory, and it was published shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Weisgard was also a close friend of Clement Hurd, the other
illustrator most closely identified with Brown's books for young
children. Hurd's essay honoring Weisgard when he won the Caldecott
Medal describes the dinner party Weisgard gave to unveil the
paintings for ``The Little Island.'' His images of a rock
outcropping near Vinalhaven, Me., the island where Brown had a
cottage they all visited, perfectly captured what her biographer,
Leonard Marcus, called ``a poet's notations of seasonal change.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisgard and his wife, Phyllis, who were serious collectors of
American folk art, sold their collection and left Connecticut in
1969. They settled in a 17th-century Danish farmhouse in a rural
area not far from Copenhagen that looked remarkably like the
countryside they had left. Weisgard studied Danish and began a new
collection of modern Danish painting and folk art.
</P>
<P>
   Weisgard collaborated with other children's book writers and
wrote books he illustrated himself. In the 1950s he also designed
the stage sets and costumes for several productions of the San
Francisco Ballet, including ``The Dryad'' and ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisgard's wife died in 1991. He is survived by three children,
Abigail, Christina and Ethan, and two grandchildren.  &QL;

HSIEH PING-YING, 93, A CHINESE FEMINIST AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hsieh Ping-ying, a Chinese feminist author known for her
autobiographical work, died on Jan. 5 in San Francisco. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hsieh moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970s from Taiwan,
to which she had fled from mainland China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hsieh ``pioneered the literary construction of a soldier
image for women _ as imaginative as it may have been _ and thereby
influenced this kind of literature in China for decades,'' said
Charles A. Laughlin, professor of modern Chinese literature at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   Her first book was ``War Diary,'' published in 1928 in Shanghai.
Laughlin recalled that, in writing the book, Miss Hsieh accompanied
soldiers of the Chinese Nationalist army in 1926 and 1927, when it
was trying to bring warlords in the eastern half of China under
control and while she was a ``girl soldier'' with propaganda
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when Chinese women were trying to find new modes of
identity in the 20th century after having shed the shackles of
traditional Chinese feminine identity, there were many different,
alternative identities available to them,'' Laughlin said, ``and I
think she was the first to create this very military one.''
</P>
<P>
   A scholar's daughter, Miss Hsieh was born in a village in Hunan
province. Before she was 20, she enrolled in the Wuchang Central
Political and Military School. The academy trained young women to
be uniformed propagandists attached to the regular military.
</P>
<P>
   After her relatively brief military service Miss Hsieh returned
to her village and an arranged marriage. In 1940 her book ``Girl
Rebel: The Autobiography of Hsieh Pingying'' was published in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage ended, Ms. Hsieh was charged with being a
Communist and radical and was imprisoned. After her release she
studied Chinese literature and worked as a roving writer, editor
and teacher. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, she again became a
``girl soldier,'' accompanying Chinese combat troops to the front.
Diary entries about her experiences appeared in newspapers and in
another book. After World War II she escaped to Taiwan, where she
taught and wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Her second husband, Earl Chia, died in 1988. The couple became
American citizens after moving to San Francisco. She is survived by
a daughter, Lily Chia Brissman of Nacogdoches, Texas; two sons,
Luke, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Wen, of Ambler, Pa., and four
grandchildren.

   CINCINNATI _ It makes tremendous sense, when you think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, when Brian Goldberg was a student at the
University of Cincinnati, he found himself in a class with Ken
Griffey Sr., the Big Red Machine outfielder who decided to use the
off-season to take some college courses.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, now 39, sat in his office 43 floors above downtown
Cincinnati and recalled that fateful class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `Interpersonal Relationships,''' Goldberg said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   How perfect, when you consider the unique relationship that was
struck between the 20-something undergrad and the major league
ballplayer whose son and namesake, Ken Griffey Jr., would turn out
to be the most popular player of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg went on to law school. Griffey Sr. left the Reds and
went on to play for the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as the unlikely pair cultivated their
friendship, Griffey Jr. grew from a 9-year-old to the biggest thing
in baseball since Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron and Willie
Mays.
</P>
<P>
   One day along the way, after Goldberg had begun practicing law
in Cincinnati and representing a few minor league ballplayers, the
relationship between Goldberg and the Griffeys took a decidedly
interesting turn.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg had never asked Griffey Sr. for anything, not an
autograph or a free ticket to a game. It didn't take long for
Griffey Sr. to figure that this young aspiring attorney was someone
he could count on. A friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1987, when Ken Jr. was a senior at Moeller High
School and Senior had to report to spring training, the elder
Griffey turned to Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had me over for dinner and Senior said, `I'm getting
ready to leave. Birdie's here with the kids. The scouts are
starting to call and interview Junior. They're going to give some
aptitude tests and they're thinking about drafting him pretty high,
so we just want to be ready,' '' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to get too specific about why he didn't want
his existing agents to represent Junior, but he told me, `Kenny's
gotten to know you. I have my own reasons for not wanting to expose
him to them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was him asking if I wanted to work with Junior. I
can't reiterate enough what  &UR; rr &LR; I owe their family. That's the
thing sometimes I think fans who see players from a distance really
don't see what a lot of times these people are like as people.
Kenny as a husband, father and son _ it's the real deal. He's a
real close member of his family. I give him a lot of credit because
in professional sports, there are so many factors stacked against
you to not be a good father or husband. There are so many things
that can draw you away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Ken Griffey Jr. Central.
</P>
<P>
   Though not exactly a shrine to the Mariners' All-Star center
fielder, Goldberg's office high above a presently wintry Cincinnati
does have an acutely Junior-esque motif.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the photographs of Goldberg's wife, Robin, and their
two young daughters, Emily and Lauren, that occupy prime real
estate on Goldberg's desk, Griffey is the overwhelming theme.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on the wall between two windows is a monstrous poster of
Griffey. He is wearing a now outdated teal Mariners jersey. He is
jogging off the field, his famously impish face peering out from
under the bill of his Mariners cap. The caption reads: ``Junior.
The Finest In The Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in a corner, the bookshelves hold statues and figurines of
Griffey. There are also a half-dozen pair of Griffey's signature
Nike cleats.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Goldberg's desk, on a shelf, there is a thick stack of
Rawlings gloves bearing the gold imprint of Ken Griffey Jr.'s
autograph. Off to the right is a hat rack holding six caps Griffey
has worn during Mariners games, All-Star games, playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   And to the left, on another wall next to Goldberg's desk, hang
two framed baseball jerseys. One is a Reds shirt, No. 30. That's
Ken Griffey Sr. The other is No. 24 from the Mariners. That's
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The law degree from the University of Toledo that Goldberg
earned after meeting the Griffeys is framed and hanging in the
office, too. And though the attorney handled a few cases early in
his career, almost all of what Goldberg does and has done for the
past 12 years is handle Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   All Griffey, almost all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls come in bunches. The receptionist buzzes
Goldberg's office every few minutes _ about 40 calls a day on
average. There are the Nike people, the Upper Deck folks, General
Mills, Nintendo, Nabisco, Duracell and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   There are the Make-A-Wish Foundation calls, verifying Griffey's
availability and thoughts on visits with kids. At the moment,
Griffey is working on a deal to be the national spokesman for Child
Abuse Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never envisioned it would be like this,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first sign of it was this guy in Edmonds, Mike Kramer, who
owned a company called Pacific Trading Cards. He was the guy who
had the idea for this,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Goldberg stands and fishes for something. Soon,
he is handing over two Ken Griffey Jr. candy bars. One is wrapped
in blue, the other in gold, like the old Mariners uniform colors.
</P>
<P>
   They are history, relics, and they remind Goldberg of where this
all started.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little dusty now. I'd hate to see what it looks like
if I opened it up. But it was his (Kramer's) idea to make and sell
one million of these,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in April of '89, after Kenny made the team. He
started off hot but tailed off a little after two or three weeks.
But Mike felt he was going to stay up all year. That was the first
time I thought, `Wow, this is something different than just a good
player or even a great player.' And they did sell their million
bars.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   How long ago do those days seem now?
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years after Ken Griffey Jr. soared into the baseball
constellation, his star and his status with the Mariners has dimmed
this winter. Or, at least, the uncertainty about where and when he
will leave the one big-league team he has ever played for has made
for serious intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season began with a fateful November meeting in Orlando,
Fla., where Griffey, his wife, Melissa, and their two children
live. In that meeting, Griffey told the Mariners he wanted to be
traded to a team closer to his home in Orlando. The Mariners
contend that Griffey did not even want to return in 2000, for what
is supposed to be the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he (Griffey) said, `No way (I'm ever coming
back).' But at the time, he didn't think he'd be back long term,''
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are going to take this the wrong way. People are
going to think there's some sort of rivalry, and there's not. But
he could have gone the route of (Alex Rodriguez) and just said, `I
don't want to be traded. I just want to stay, but I'm not going to
sign an extension.' That's also a function of the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after that meeting, Mariners partner and CEO Howard
Lincoln, club president Chuck Armstrong and general manager Pat
Gillick headed back to Seattle, where they held a full-court,
spin-city news conference at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   They took the offensive, calling Griffey ``courageous'' for his
decision to want to be closer to home. They issued a ``joint
statement'' that outlined Griffey's trade request.
</P>
<P>
   All this did was set the Mariners, Griffey and Goldberg on a
course that, by now, is strained and unresolved. The Mariners are
unwavering in their resolve to stick to ``the statement,'' a tactic
that Goldberg says insults fans' intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement. That was probably the problem. Players and star
players are getting talked about and traded all the time. Juan
Gonzalez gets traded. Other guys I'm sure are being offered where
it's not talked about,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame myself for that statement. Not because it was untrue
or insincere at the time, but because it seems to lock in something
and not take into account that, through no one's fault, situations
can change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no statement, maybe there's a rumor about how the
Mariners are shopping Junior. But if a trade is not made, then
that's all it was was rumors and not some official word coming out.
People can speculate all they want. Maybe the team acknowledges
they talked about Junior to other teams, maybe they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who like Griffey puts a premium on relationships and
loyalty, has a word for what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sideways' is the way I talk about it,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own opinions and views about why things went the way
they did. Suffice it to say, the Mariners were looking for some
finality, which after the meeting brought about the statement.
Would I have done that again? Probably not. Not because it wasn't
true or it wasn't what Ken was feeling at the time, but because it
didn't take into account that factors and situations can change,''
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was to know that most of the teams on Kenny's list had
reasons for not being interested in the beginning and most of them
made it perfectly clear that the reason they weren't interested is
not because they weren't interested in Kenny. But what it had to do
with, they didn't think it made that much sense to trade for a guy,
give up a lot, not knowing if he was going to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why teams were saying, `Sure, we'd love to have him,
but it doesn't make sense for us to try and make a trade.' That's
when things got sideways, and it's not anybody's fault. That's
where the fans have a hard time. They expect us to be blaming the
Mariners for why this thing went sideways. Or the Mariners to be
blaming us for this thing going sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg acknowledged that Griffey's first choice was the
Atlanta Braves, whose spring training facility is near Griffey's
Orlando home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been the ideal situation, and I think it was,
in the beginning,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves immediately responded by saying the asking price
was too much for Griffey, and they would not enter discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Griffey had apparently clocked the distance between his
home and the Houston Astros spring training facility, believing
that a trade to the Astros would mean he could ride his bike to
work during the Grapefruit League. But the Astros would make no
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the New York Mets were contacted but told the Mariners
they were more interested in Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Reds and Mariners got into a squabble when
Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden shut down negotiations
because the Mariners insisted on too much, including second baseman
Pokey Reese.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the deal-making dragged on, and the more Gillick
floated proposals from teams other than the four on Griffey's list,
Goldberg and Griffey finally said they were done.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said Griffey believed the Mariners were not operating
in good faith by talking to other teams. Then, a deal with the Mets
was refused by Griffey, who was called at 11 p.m. one night with a
request from the Mariners to get back to them in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there could be only a trade to the Reds or a return
to Seattle for the 2000 season _ these are the only two options
Griffey still held open to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Mariners are worried about another ``Randy Johnson''
situation, Goldberg dismisses any concern about Griffey being
distracted or sub-par next season in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken not being happy doesn't mean you don't play through it.
They talk about him being a lame duck, but they don't get specific.
. . . This guy's got a lot of pride in how he plays the game and
how he conducts his life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said Griffey's feelings about Safeco Field have been
somewhat misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't understand is that he didn't say anything
positive about the field because people might assume he's going to
stay. If he said anything negative, people would assume he was
going to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then Goldberg clarified that it is ``not the dimensions''
that are an issue, but the ``elements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take Coors Field and push the fences back 10 feet, the
ball is still going to fly out of there. At Safeco, you could push
the fences 10 feet in and the ball still isn't going to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   And though neither side will discuss it, there is some truth to
the idea that as the player with the most clout, Griffey is more
likely than any other Mariner to initiate a request to close the
roof in order to enhance the ball's flight. Griffey may be saying
what several other Mariners hitters are also expressing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wider view of where things stand between the Mariners
and Griffey, Goldberg contends that Griffey is merely playing by
the rules set by Major League Baseball. As a 10-year veteran with
more than five years of service with the Mariners, he controls his
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so quick to find somebody to blame when things
don't go 100 percent correct. You have to step back and say what's
going on here is not anybody's fault. It's a function of the rules
and the way the rules are set,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Ken Jr. stay and play out and fulfill his contract,
which looks like the most likely scenario, the Mariners end up
drawing the short straw. But they're not getting screwed by
anybody. It's a function of the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not forget that Kenny spurned free agency twice.
I don't think there's anything wrong with Alex (who says he wants
to stay in 2000 and will keep an open mind about a long-term deal,)
doing once what Kenny's already done twice, which is sign an
extension,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, Alex would get the benefit of something we never did the
first two times Kenny re-signed, and that is ripping up the last
year of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Winter is in full swing in the Ohio Valley. From 43 floors up,
Cincinnati is dusted white against a heavy, gray sky.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out the windows of Goldberg's office, one can see how
the night's cover of snow has softened the concrete shell of the
new Bengals football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slated to open in time for the preseason,'' said
Goldberg, tapping the window pane.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good American city, this is a sports town. The city's
skyline and its heart are defined in large part by the teams, the
games and the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right over there is Cinergy Field, home of the Reds,'' he
said, pointing through the glass and across the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball lore, Cinergy Field will always be Riverfront
Stadium, because that's where the Big Red Machine churned out all
those National League pennants.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Pete Rose gave up the body; where Tony Perez earned
his place in Cooperstown; where Lou Piniella and the Nasty Boys
brought home another World Series despite the headache of working
for a dog-lover named Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   It is this history of good times that makes Cincinnati baseball
fans tingle with the idea that Ken Griffey Jr. might come play
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg shakes his head and smiles. Talk has been rampant about
Junior's homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Though some sports radio jocks in Seattle have chirped about
conspiracy theories and how Goldberg must be plotting with the
Reds, the truth is Goldberg is closer to the Mariners front office
than the Reds'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been a Reds fan since I was 10 years old,'' Goldberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in reality, it is tough to pin down whether Goldberg really
believes Griffey will be best suited for a stint in Cincinnati.
Griffey has always talked about playing for the Reds, where his
father is the bench coach and next in line (it is presumed) to be
the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Griffey's grandmother lives there, and Goldberg says
Griffey talks about wanting to play in a place she can come watch.
</P>
<P>
   But as for the urgency of a deal? The Reds refuse to part with
much in order to obtain Griffey for the 2000 season. And the fans
understand the big picture requires more logic and planning than
simply gutting a good, young team _ even for Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, they're excited about the possibility of Kenny
coming here. But, at the same time, they're realistic. Baseball
fans here are conservative. It's taken them a long time to come
back to the game after the '94 strike,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Kenny, they know it doesn't make a lot of sense to
give up all the young players who won so many games for the Reds
last season to get Kenny,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, for now, Goldberg maintains Griffey seems headed
back to Seattle, where baseball will be just baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice idea, especially for Griffey _ the kid who made a
name for himself chasing down fly balls no one else could dream of
catching, swinging that sweet swing, wearing that ballcap backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the season starts, no one can mess with him. He'll be
fine,'' Goldberg said about his friend and client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he's between those white lines, he's in his glory.''

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S BALLOT MACHINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain's uphill quest to run on ballots throughout New
York state in the March 7 Republican presidential primary received
a boost Wednesday from helpful Democrats. With encouragement from
their party's legislative leaders, the two Democrats on the
four-member state Board of Elections refused to supply the votes
needed to invalidate McCain's delegate petitions in eight upstate
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ a rare instance of the state's partisan election
machinery working in favor of democracy _ thwarted, at least for
the moment, the state Republican Party's effort to keep McCain off
the presidential primary ballot in much of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   This development was all the more heartening because it came
just one day after McCain's campaign suffered a reversal. On
Tuesday, New York City's Board of Elections, in response to a
challenge from the state Republican Party, knocked McCain off the
ballot in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District because of a truly
trivial mistake. A worker gathering names for a McCain petition
inadvertently wrote down the wrong house numbers in listing the
addresses of two signers. Invalidating those signatures left McCain
one signature shy of the minimum number the rules require.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settles, McCain could end up being knocked off the
ballot in about half of New York's 31 districts. But he is not the
only would-be president whose place on the ballot is at risk.
Petition challenges brought by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's camp
have succeeded in removing Steve Forbes from the ballot in several
Long Island districts for minor errors. The fact that Forbes could
throw $1 million into a petition drive and still be so vulnerable
speaks volumes about New York's ridiculous ballot requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The state party's drive to purge the ballot is not only an
embarrassment to New York but to both Gov. George Pataki, Bush's
patron, and Bush himself. These are two politicians with national
ambitions who are engaged in a systematic effort to deny the voters
a choice. It is a scheme that both should be ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, is mounting court challenges in some
districts against Bush's petitions. These challenges do not help
the voters any more than the Bush challenges do. The only good
thing that can be said about these ballot machinations is that they
have strengthened the case for federal court intervention to
establish once and for all free elections in New York state. The
issue is due to be joined Friday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S.
District Court Judge Edward Korman. Korman is familiar with New
York's ballot regime, having written the decision four years ago
that opened the state's presidential primary to some of Bob Dole's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that ruling, the state Legislature and the
Republican Party tinkered a bit with the petition requirements. But
the current outbreak of ballot warfare vividly demonstrates that
the ``undue burden'' on voting and democracy that led to Korman's
1996 ballot ruling still persists. The situation calls for an even
stronger decision this time _ one that mandates a full statewide
ballot March 7, and then requires the Legislature to do a wholesale
rewrite of the ballot rules to comport with common sense and the
Constitution.

</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Justice Joseph Teresi of New York State Supreme Court has struck
an important blow for constitutional rights and an open judicial
process by allowing cameras to televise the murder trial of the
four New York City police officers who shot Amadou Diallo. Justice
Teresi, who sits in Albany, ruled that the New York state law
imposing an absolute ban on television cameras in courtrooms was
unconstitutional. The public and press have a constitutionally
protected right to view criminal trials, and the use of television
cameras is a natural and reasonable extension of that right. The
justice found that given the great interest in this case, and the
limited seating available, the right of the public and press to
observe the trial would be curtailed if not denied without
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The officers are accused of second-degree murder in the killing
of Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot in a hail
of police bullets in the doorway of his apartment house in the
Bronx. An appeals court moved the trial to Albany on the grounds
that an unbiased jury could not be found in the Bronx. However, the
move will make it extremely difficult for interested members of the
Bronx community to attend the trial and has heightened suspicions
in minority communities about the integrity of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of only three states that do not allow some form
of audio-visual coverage of court proceedings. Some lawmakers worry
that cameras might compromise the rights of the litigants. But a
10-year experiment with courtroom cameras showed that televised
access enhanced public understanding of the judicial system without
harming the legal process. New York's backwardness on this issue
hurts public confidence in the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Legislature acts to allow cameras back into courts,
judges in New York should follow Teresi's cogent constitutional
analysis and allow the public _ not just those able to get in the
courthouse door _ to see and hear what happens in the courtroom.

EDITORIAL: THE FATE OF RENO'S MAPES HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 27:
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in December 1947, the Mapes Hotel in Reno was the
embodiment of a Nevadan idea of luxury _ a place to eat, dance,
drink, sleep and gamble, all within a 12-story Art Deco building.
There was a Sky Room on the 11th floor, a Turkish bath in the
basement, and all the amenities in between. In 1982 the hotel
closed, and 16 years later it was placed on the National Trust for
Historic Preservation's list of the 11 most endangered historic
buildings. But now, if the City of Reno has its way, the Mapes
Hotel will be imploded at 8 a.m. on Jan. 30, Super Bowl Sunday,
while Reno residents and film crews watch.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this turn of events lies a complicated story. Reno is
renovating its riverfront district, an area anchored by the hotel,
which overlooks the Truckee River. In 1996 the city purchased the
hotel for $4 million and began the search for a plan to redevelop
it. Several financially sound proposals, including one _favored by
the Historic Trust _ to convert the Mapes into upscale senior
apartments, were presented to the city's Redevelopment Agency Board
but were ultimately turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of this building will mean a significant loss of
architectural and community heritage in a city undergoing swift

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
While Dallas Mavericks rookie Leon Smith was with his team,
representatives of the National Basketball Players Association were
concerned the franchise did not surround the troubled teen-ager
with people who could provide proper guidance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the union has paired Smith, 19, with a man who spent time in
prison for forgery and has convictions for theft and solicitation
of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Delton Carter, known as D.C., is an employee at Westside Tennis
Club, where the Rockets practice. It is at the Rockets' practice
facility that Carter met Smith, who was in the care of players
union president Billy Hunter and Purvis Short, the NBPA's director
of player programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Carter was sentenced to five years for four counts of
felony forgery but served less than six months before being
paroled. He was also convicted of misdemeanor theft in 1994 and
convicted of solicitation of prostitution, a Class B misdemeanor,
in 1997 and was sentenced to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was unavailable for comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been supervising Smith's afternoon workouts in
Short's absence and escorting the 6-11 center to Rockets games,
where they have been guests of Linda and Jim McIngvale, who own
Westside Tennis Club and Gallery Furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Short said it was he who approached Carter about working with
Smith, and admits he did not run a background check on Carter and
was unaware of his history.
</P>
<P>
   But sources questioned the wisdom of pairing Smith, who has a
Feb. 3 court date in Chicago to face misdemeanor charges of
aggravated assault, damage to property and violation of a
protection order, with Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we run a background check? No,'' Short said Wednesday.
``Should we have done that? In retrospect, I guess I would have to
say yes. But in my opinion, and I am not speaking for the (players)
association, whatever he (Carter) has done, he has paid his debt to
society. Everybody has problems in their past. He's atoned for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my recommendation (that Carter work with Smith). A lot
of it was because he worked for Mac (Jim McIngvale) and Linda. I
felt there was no need for a background check.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Chicago high schooler who was attempting to jump to the
NBA, was suspended without pay by the Mavericks on Dec. 6 after a
series of incidents that included two arrests within a 24-hour
span. Smith then attempted suicide, swallowing 250 aspirin Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Smith spent the next month in a Dallas psychiatric facility
before coming to Houston, where he has been supervised by Short,
for workouts in anticipation of a release by the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The McIngvales said they felt responsible for the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad because they (the union) didn't do a background
check because D.C. had worked for us,'' Linda McIngvale said
Wednesday. ``They would have done the check, but since he worked
for us, they didn't feel it was necessary. Everyone wants what's
best for Leon, so I'm very concerned about the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it ended today. D.C. will not be allowed to work with Leon
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Short said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to abandon D.C. because of what he did in the
past,'' he said. ``I'm not going to jump ship. I've dealt with
people who have done far worse than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in life the best teacher is experience, so I don't
look at this as so much of a negative but a positive. I know that
Leon has benefited from his association with D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to look upon him (Carter) any differently. We've
all made mistakes. Everyone's worried about who we have with Leon.
Well, where were all these people when this kid was in his darkest
hour? I'll stand by my decision. I can live with the criticism.''

AFTER MANY YEARS, CAMPO GETS HIS SHOT AS COWBOYS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Contrary to popular thinking, Dallas Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones didn't stumble upon the idea that Dave Campo had the
stuff of a head coach because of a diminished pool of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Jones considered Campo for the job when he hired former Steelers
offensive coordinator Chan Gailey two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, wanting to bring in someone new following a 6-10 season
in 1997, said it wasn't the right time for Campo. But he always
believed that ``Campo's time will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The right time for Campo, 52, came Wednesday when Jones
introduced him as Gailey's successor and the fifth coach in Cowboys
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most exciting moment in my life,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, who has been with the Cowboys since 1989, including the
past five as defensive coordinator, has been the front-runner for
the position since Gailey was fired Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he made the decision to go with Campo partly because
of his stellar coaching credentials _ the Cowboys defense has
ranked among the league's top 10 units four times under Campo's
guidance, including a ninth-place finish in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And partly because Campo represents stability and continuity,
while also bringing back a taste of the glory days as a staff
member during the team's Super Bowl title runs in 1992, 1993 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   While Campo offers familiarity, it's also safe to say that his
Cowboys predecessors _ Tom Landry (stoic), Jimmy Johnson (fiery,
controlling), Barry Switzer (laid back) and Gailey (unemotional)
were nothing like Campo, who is equal parts intense, emotional and
a free-spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams coach Joe Avezzano might be more the famous of the
singing Cowboys coaches. And Carolina coach George Seifert and
former Jets coach Bill Parcells might be the first coaches to sing
on national television.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo, who cut a record during his high school years in
Connecticut and considered becoming a professional singer before
deciding to play college football at Central Connecticut State,
already holds a tune better than any coach in the league.
</P>
<P>
   However, though Campo said Wednesday that one of his major goals
as head coach is to be a good motivator, don't expect him to break
out in song at a team meeting for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Campo, who has been known to ``crank it up a bit'' at a
karaoke bar during training camp at Wichita Falls, intimated during
the season that if he became a head coach he would leave his
part-time crooning behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to present an image,'' Campo said. ``I think there is a
fine line between being able to get up in front of a team and get
respect. You have to be careful not to be to much one way or
another. No one will have to question whether he's a singer or
entertainer or a football coach. I'm a football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo has proved that consistently during a nomadic 32-year
coaching career that included 13 stops, including such football
locales like his alma mater Central Connecticut, Albany State and
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   An underdog as a player, the 5-foot-7 Campo's modest coaching
resume and slight stature caused people to underrate his coaching
abilities at times.
</P>
<P>
   Campo overcame the misperception and the bad rap because of an
intense work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Campo's size has never been an issue in the Cowboys
locker room. More importantly, his production has been large.
</P>
<P>
   Campo's defenses, which had to overcome the obstacles of mass
free-agent upheavals and Jones' penchant to spend more money on
offensive players, routinely took on the personality of their
feisty leader, as they were always better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   This past season was a prime example, as the Cowboys defense
opened training camp considered to be team's weak link and finished
the season as the team's strength _ all while negotiating a rash of
injuries that sidelined starting cornerbacks Deion Sanders and
Kevin Smith for several games and defensive end Greg Ellis for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also had to overcome an eight-game suspension for
defensive tackle Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that Campo has earned the respect of the
defenders who know him best.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Henning said believes the emotional Campo
will be able to light a fire under the entire team the way he has
done with the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't hide his emotions, which makes it great for
players,'' Hennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson, who came into the league when Campo was
the Cowboys' secondary coach, said his ascension to head-coach is
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have got the job two years ago,'' Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's Campo's time now.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's worth singing about. nn

PUPPET MASTER'S PICK WILL HAVE TO CUT STRINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jones introduced his new puppet Wednesday, which is not a
personal indictment of Mr. Dave Campo.
</P>
<P>
   But like it not, true or not, it's the perception Campo will now
have to live with, locally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Ranch is the only place in the history of the NFL where a
highly successful defensive coordinator can be promoted to head
coach and immediately lose respect.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the pox Jerry has placed on his own head-coaching house.
</P>
<P>
   Was Campo, having been a valuable, trusted and productive Dallas
Cowboys assistant for 11 years, the right hire in these most
troubling of football times?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not. But again, that is also not a personal
indictment of Campo. There could be no right hire, at least not in
the true definition of what the title of head coach should mean,
and has to mean if success is going to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has stripped the job down to dune buggy status _ four
tires and a roll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, whomever the choice, the new guy was going to be
slapped with an immediate image problem. It's that puppet thing
again. Which is that Jerry thing again. And now a nice man like
Dave Campo is branded, fair or not fair.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Campo, 52, on Wednesday as his third head coach
in three years, Jones proudly observed that after his homework and
research, he interviewed no candidate from outside the
organization. His logic was that the research and homework pointed
straight to Campo.
</P>
<P>
   But if we can deal with the truth for one second, absolutely no
qualified candidate from the outside even came close to surfacing.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry _ your reputation has spread like poison ivy.
Any real candidate with head coaching aspirations either realized
on his own, or was advised by others, that the Cowboys' job carries
the kiss of a cobra.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the very best thing to happen in all this was Jones
being forced to stay in-house.
</P>
<P>
   The job came down to only insiders _ Campo or special teams
coach Joe Avezzano.
</P>
<P>
   From personal observation only _ meaning I'm not privy to what
is said in the coaches' meetings _ Avezzano has the stronger and
more forceful personality of the two. In dealing with Jones, that
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo also fully understands the weird ground rules at
Valley Ranch. After 11 years, one would assume he has picked up a
few tricks that might be useful when Jones plunges off the roof on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry is the owner, the president, the general manager, the team
mouthpiece, the team power, and he darn sure wants to be first in
line when the glory is handed out. If there is ever going to be any
more glory for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But by Jones making the decision to stay in-house, he eliminated
an unnecessary time factor. As Chan Gailey soon learned, no matter
what you might think you know about dealing with Jones, many
surprises are coming, none of them pleasant, and all of them time
consuming to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   In a job where there was no right hire, at least Campo was a
choice that went in the right direction. That direction was
in-house. Because the new head coach would not have the benefit of
making his own staff selections _ another Jerry law _ it was
another reason to go the only way Jones could go. Although how much
input will Campo have in hires on the offensive side, since his
specialty is defense?
</P>
<P>
   It would, of course, have been nice Wednesday to hear Campo
finish his acceptance speech during the Valley Ranch media
conference. But Jerry, who had rambled too long before introducing
Campo, jumped in, interrupted Dave, and then told us again, that by
gosh, Campo was the head coach in charge of all areas of the team,
including offense.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. I suppose that meant Jones wasn't hiring just a defensive
coordinator, a reference to head coach Gailey really being just an
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But does Jerry already have the offensive staff in place for
Campo? Would that be Jack Reilly as offensive coordinator? Reilly
is the former quarterbacks coach here under offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese. Will Zampese be available to serve as a sounding
board for Reilly? Will Jason Garrett be convinced to retire as a
player and become quarterbacks coach, something Troy Aikman would
certainly favor?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think these are decisions Campo will make.
He is, after all, the new head coach. But until proved otherwise,
the perception will be this is simply another Jerry puppet. nn

REILLY SAID TO BE HIRED AS COWBOYS OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Reilly will be hired as the Cowboys' offensive coordinator,
possibly as early as Thursday a source said, which will put Troy
Aikman back into an offense that was used by the Cowboys to win
three Super Bowls during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 54, was the Cowboys' quarterbacks coach for one season
(1997) before serving the past two seasons in a similar capacity in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that Reilly will be hired as Dave Campo's
offensive coordinator and that Ernie Zampese, a Jerry Jones
confidant, will be brought aboard in some kind of advisory
capacity. Jones picked Zampese's brain for free on several
occasions at last week's Senior Bowl practices in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese, 63, earned Aikman's trust as the Cowboys' offensive
coordinator for four seasons (1994-97) before being fired by Jones
in the head-coaching switch from Barry Switzer to Chan Gailey after
the '97 season. Zampese spent the past two seasons as the Patriots'
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reilly nor Zampese is expected to be back in New
England. Since Pete Carroll was fired as head coach, Reilly and
Zampese have prepared themselves to be canned as soon as a
successor is named.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation around Valley Ranch is that backup quarterback Jason
Garrett, if he chooses to retire, will be the Cowboys' quarterbacks
coach, a situation reminiscent of Denver, where then-Broncos'
backup quarterback Gary Kubiak became John Elway's position coach
and later offensive coordinator. Garrett turns 34 in March.
</P>
<P>
   The future is unclear for Cowboys quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis,
who was hired along with wide receivers coach Dwaine Painter and
tight ends coach Les Miles by Gailey before the 1998 season. Gailey
was fired Jan. 11. Geis and Miles are under contract for next
season. Painter is not.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that with Campo being promoted, secondary coach
Mike Zimmer will become the new defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   If Zimmer, 43, succeeds Campo, then former Cowboys special-teams
star and now special teams/defensive assistant Bill Bates would be
a candidate to replace Zimmer as secondary coach.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Avezzano, special teams coach since 1990, was disappointed
that he lost to Campo for the head-coaching job, but took the high
road when Jones' announcement came down Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Campo and I go back 25 years. I know him well,'' Avezzano
said. ``And I'm looking for us to win a bunch of football games
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Avezzano, Hudson Houck and Clarence Shelmon _ special teams,
offensive line and running backs coaches, respectively _ are
believed to be safe in their present roles.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now is on the offense. What will the Cowboys run? Who
will run it?
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Zampese and Reilly were criticized for nearly
getting quarterback Drew Bledsoe killed in the second half of last
season. In the final eight games (2-6, including a victory against
the Cowboys), the Patriots scored nine offensive touchdowns, while
Bledsoe threw six TD passes, 17 interceptions and was sacked 33
times. nn

CAMPO STEPS UP, WITH AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys promoted longtime assistant Dave Campo from
defensive coordinator to head coach Wednesday and will hire former
Cowboys quarterbacks coach Jack Reilly as their offensive
coordinator, possibly as early as Thursday, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   By staying inside the organization with Campo, Jones is banking
on the path of least resistance to jump-start his Cowboys down the
road to another Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar face ... fewer delays.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Campo became Jones' choice to replace Chan Gailey, who was
fired Jan. 11 after two seasons as head coach and offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reduces the transition,'' Jones said during a news
conference at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the head-coaching search lasted 15 days, less than half
the time Jones took to hire Gailey to replace Barry Switzer. This
time, Jones didn't interview a candidate outside the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave will be overseer and ultimate decision maker,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones learned two years ago in interviewing defensive-minded
George Seifert, now head coach at Carolina, that a football man can
gain knowledge about offense from spending years devising schemes
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is banking on Campo becoming a 2000 version of Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, 52, apparently is on the same page as Jones on offensive
philosophy. Sources say the next offensive coordinator will be
Reilly, who was at Valley Ranch on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (separate head coach and offensive coordinator) is a
departure,'' Jones said. ``We don't want to be in the same
offensive system we were the last two years'' when the Cowboys
offensively ranked eighth and 16th in the NFL in 1998 and 1999,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, the New England Patriots' quarterbacks coach, is an
Ernie Zampese disciple. He works with the offense Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman is most comfortable running, the offense
the Cowboys used in winning three Super Bowls in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to run on throwing downs and throw on running downs,''
said Campo, who wouldn't tip his hand about Reilly. ``I want us to
attack and be aggressive. My No. 1 objective is to develop an
attitude on this team.'' Jones is hands-on, but he also wants a
coach who will show discipline with his players. Campo has that
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led the NFL in penalties and penalty yardage this
season. They were 1-8 on the road, including a first-round playoff
loss at Minnesota. The Cowboys, 8-9, blew fourth-quarter leads in
six of their nine losses.
</P>
<P>
   Jones wants these negative trends quickly reversed, adding that
there is ``a sense of urgency'' with every NFL team today and his
Cowboys in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is ``uniquely qualified to coach the Dallas Cowboys'' _
Jones' words _ which means that after 11 seasons with the team,
Campo can't possibly be surprised by anything that occurs inside an
organization in which Jones is hands-on owner and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a decision like this, you receive a great deal
of input,'' said Jones, who used the past two weeks to interview
countless coaches, scouts and front-office types around the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of input that I received had a very
common thread, and the theme was very simple: `You have a man on
your staff who is very smart, extremely talented and ready to be a
head coach in the NFL.' And that was from third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones passed over special-teams coach Joe Avezzano, who also
wanted the promotion, to go with Campo, who came into the league
the same year (1989) as Troy Aikman, Jimmy Johnson and Jones.
Avezzano arrived one year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weighing all the information, it resulted in my not
interviewing anyone outside our organization, either the NFL or the
college level,'' said Jones, who decided more than a week ago to
stay in-house. ``There became a point where there was no doubt in
my mind that the best man to be the head coach of the Dallas
Cowboys was right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo has the two most-important qualities Jones wanted from
becomes his fourth head coach in 12 seasons: passion and
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Campo also brings loyalty, familiarity and ``big-picture''
awareness to the table. Jones took into account times during staff
meetings when Campo put the success of the team overall ahead of
the needs at his specific areas of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Campo becomes one of only 10 NFL head coaches who
have been a part of a winning Super Bowl staff, and one of only
four NFL head coaches who have been a part of three winning Super
Bowl staffs.
</P>
<P>
   What sold Jones on Campo was his ability to adjust, both in the
course of a game and from week to week during the season.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen Campo get down. He also has seen Campo attack a
problem and enthusiastically come up with a positive resolution for
it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Campo's strengths are needed immediately. There are no shortages
of problems to solve around Valley Ranch. nn

   The Dallas Cowboys haven't had much to cheer about since their

hiring of defensive coordinator Dave Campo as head coach Wednesday.

He will gain the respect of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys ended an 8-9 season with a 27-10 loss to the
Minnesota Vikings in an NFC wild-card playoff game. Two days later,
Chan Gailey, who was 18-16 in two seasons, was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had guys going on different levels,'' Cowboys defensive
lineman Greg Ellis said. ``We didn't do enough, and we didn't jell
enough. Last year, we had a good football team, but we didn't get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's offensive philosophy never blended with the team's
personnel. This season, the Cowboys finished 16th in the NFL in
total offense, including 24th in passing, and they were 11th in
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Thursday, the Cowboys will announce New England
Patriots quarterbacks coach Jack Reilly as their offensive
coordinator, sources said. Reilly is an advocate of the offense Don
Coryell developed and used as coach of the San Diego Chargers in
the 1980s, an offense the St. Louis Rams used to lead the league in
yards gained and points scored this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams who have success score points,'' Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman said. ``They throw the football, and we haven't had
success at that the last few years. The objective is to score
points. The emphasis the last few years has been the running game,
and we have to be effective in the passing game. You have to be
able to make big plays to score points and that was something that
was lacking last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably a couple of players away from being a dominant
offensive football team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was what Campo did with the defense that won him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite big losses to free agency, Campo's defense was among the
top-rated in the league in his five seasons as defensive
coordinator. Last season the Cowboys ranked ninth in total offense
and fifth in points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Jones began his coaching search, the Cowboys
defenders were on the campaign trail. They got their man elected
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about coach Campo is he'll tell you like it is,''
Cowboys defensive lineman Ebenezer Ekuban said. ``He'll either say,
`Fellas, you're not doing well,' or `Fellas, you're doing good.' He
doesn't beat around the bush.''

<P>
   ORLANDO _ The coach looked like a ghost, and it wasn't from
watching his team try to play defense. Rick Pitino was under the
weather from the flu Wednesday night. His team played in his
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino managed to stick it out for the full 48, which could not
have been good for what was left of his state of mind. In between
sips of a hot beverage and holding his face in his hands, he
managed to witness his team complete a back-to-back Florida Flop by
getting pounded, 111-89, by the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Coming 24 hours after a 115-89 bludgeoning by the Heat, you
could make a case that this brief swing through the so-called
Sunshine State was a waste of time. It was. The weather was cold,
so cold that Wednesday night the radio heads were reminding people
to bring in their plants and pets for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic, on the other hand, were quite warm, shooting 60
percent as the Celtics once again unveiled their Camembert Defense.
Orlando made 13 of 17 shots in a game-turning, third-quarter blitz,
which turned a tie game into an 18-point Orlando lead. The Celtics,
playing again without Paul Pierce, who hopes to be back Friday,
never made a serious run in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Associate head coach Jim O'Brien got to face the music after the
game due to Pitino's condition. He cut right to the chase: ``Bottom
line, you need to play better defense on the road and we didn't do
it,'' he said. ``You play tough defense on the road, you have a
chance. You give up 60 percent (shooting), you have absolutely no
chance. None.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have lost three straight games, all on the road,
and, in each case, the opponent has shot 52 percent or better. The
Heat shot 55 percent on Tuesday night, the Hornets shot 52 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And since the midway point of the first quarter in Charlotte, or
a span of 138 minutes, the Celtics have led exactly once _ for a
stretch of 33.4 seconds Wednesday night near the end of the second
quarter. Yes, they actually were in this thing for a half. Antoine
Walker had 19 of his 26 points in the first half, looking dazzling
at times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic quickly tied it up before the half (a Darrell
Armstrong steal and dunk) and then blew the game open in the third,
outscoring Boston, 35-17. The immortal John Amaechi (16 points)
started a quick run that blew the lead out to 10.
</P>
<P>
   At 61-51, the ultra-energized Bo Outlaw accounted for 8 points
in an 11-0, turn-out-the-lights run that expanded the margin to a
hefty 21. Outlaw started with a 3-point play over the overmatched
Adrian Griffin, who returned to the lineup only because Pitino felt
the club had no chance to win without him.
</P>
<P>
   Outlaw added a free throw, Tariq Abdul-Wahad added a 3-point
play, and then Outlaw closed the run with two layups off two Boston
turnovers. (Orlando had 25 points off 17 Boston giveaways.) In both
cases, Walker, was slow getting back on defense, allowing the
opening for Outlaw to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just mentally broke down in the second half,'' said a
chagrined Kenny Anderson, who may be starting to feel the effects
of his hamstring injury. He was 1 for 9 against Miami. He was 3 for
8 in just 23 minutes Wednesday night. Asked about his injury, he
said, ``Nothing new. Same old, same old.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had no inside threat and resorted to the 3-pointer,
hoisting 24, to match their season high. Walter McCarty made 1 of
7. Walker made 2 of 6. It's hard to make a run taking threes,
especially when you do nothing at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando run pushed the lead to 81-63 after three quarters
and coach Doc Rivers kept running in fresh bodies as if he had a
Strat-O-Matic lineup. Maybe he does. Everyone plays here. The
patterns and minutes may vary, but everyone plays. No Orlando
player went more than 31 minutes Wednesday night. Only one player
(Armstrong) averages more than 28 minutes a game. Only two
(Armstrong and Abdul-Wahad) have played as many as 40 minutes in a
game this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics tried to make things interesting in the fourth. They
got to within 14 on two occasions, but the game then turned into a
foulathon. The teams attempted 47 free throws in the quarter, which
took 36 minutes to play.

RAMS' TUCKER FINALLY HAS A SHOT AT WINNING A TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At first glance, you would think that being on a
championship team was old hat for St. Louis offensive lineman Ryan
Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the four-year stint at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was brought up in the football-crazed environment of
Midland Lee High School, the current king of football in Texas,
considering its back-to-back state titles in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, he has to know what being a winner feels like, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, during Tucker's day, times were a little different.
Football in the state was dominated by a school less than 30 miles
away from Midland. It still pains Tucker to talk about bitter rival
Odessa Permian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odessa Permian was running things then,'' Tucker said. ``We
had a good team. We went to quarterfinals but ran back into
Permian. They went on to win state. They just kept beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of Midland Lee's recent dominance of Permian and
everybody else hasn't been lost on Tucker, who said he has kept up
with everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great coach now and a couple of back-to-back
titles,'' Tucker said. ``I've talked to them. They are doing a
great job.''
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that the folks back in Midland are keeping up
with Tucker, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the NFL and ultimately in the Super Bowl has long
been a dream of Tucker's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid dreams about this,'' he said. ``First you want to
play in the league. Once you get here, you want to play in the
Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't know what position he would play.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was recruited to TCU after a standout high school career
as a tight end.He knew those days wouldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I didn't have the speed to be a big-time tight
end,'' Tucker said. ``I was a guy that could catch the ball. As far
as after the catch, I wasn't known for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was moved to the interior offensive line his sophomore
year at TCU and became a standout center as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted by the Rams in the fourth round of the 1997
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Tucker, a reserve lineman, has had his biggest
impact on the Rams' improbable run to the Super Bowl at his old
position.
</P>
<P>
   Used as a jumbo tight end on goal-line situations, Tucker has
caught two touchdown passes _ one in the regular season against
Detroit and one in the playoffs against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually play backup linemen as tight ends in
short-yardage situations,'' Tucker said. ``They put me out there.
And they said they were thinking about throwing me a couple of
balls and wanted me to run a route. I said `Hey, I can catch the
ball. I used to play tight end.' And they put in the game plan.''

WEATHER COOLS OFF HOTTEST TEAM IN FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a seven-game winning streak, the Tennessee Titans
are the hottest team in football. But that will do little to warm
them during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a wind chill in the teens, the Titans are practicing
outdoors at Georgia Tech University this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be outside,'' Titans quarterback Steve McNair
said. ``But it's something we're just going to have to deal with. I
think that regardless of whether we're outside or inside, we still
have to go out there and stay focused on what's at hand here.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher said the Titans could move their practices
inside the Georgia Dome late this week if the predicted snowfall
hits tomorrow. But for now, Tennessee will brave the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just as soon stay out,'' Fisher said. ``Our guys are
used to situations like this. They'll go out and practice and
prepare.'' SCOUTING REPORT
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the Titans' defensive coaches did Monday
was to call the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs held the Rams, the
third-highest scoring offense in NFL history, to 11 points in the
NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tampa Bay did against St. Louis as well as anyone I've
seen in years is tackle extremely well,'' Titans defensive
coordinator Gregg Williams said. ``In the past four or five years,
I can't remember seeing a team tackle as well as they did on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to their staff, and one of the keys we came away
with was making sure to minimize the yards after the catch.'' TURF
TOE
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Titans quarterback Steve McNair needed was the
Super Bowl to be played on artificial turf. But McNair, who has
turf toe, has no choice. Sunday's game will be played inside the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were my choice, I wouldn't play on artificial turf due
to my circumstances,'' McNair said. ``But it \Rhis toe\S feels a
lot better at this time than it did last week. It's improving.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who, as a precaution, is walking around in a protective
boot, practiced Wednesday. He will start Sunday. LIONS FOREWARNED
</P>
<P>
   Titans rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse is hoping the Detroit
Lions are watching him in Super Bowl XXXIV. Kearse said of the 15
teams that passed on him, he was most upset with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   When Detroit's turn came at No. 9, Kearse was sure he was headed
there. Instead, the Lions drafted Southern California linebacker
Chris Claiborne. Claiborne started 15 games for the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had told me, if I was available, they were going to draft
me,'' Kearse said. ``That just motivates me to show them that
Detroit missed out on something special.'' THE SPACE SHUTTLES?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the former Houston Oilers still playing for the Titans
have been discussing possible nicknames for Houston's new
franchise. Texans, Roughnecks, Roughriders and Wranglers are among
the names that have been suggested for the expansion team that
kicks off in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't come up with any good ones, but we thought it
should have something to do with space, like the Rockets, Astros
and Comets,'' free safety Marcus Robertson said. ``I would love to
go back there one day and be part of the administration or coaching
staff.'' SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR
</P>
<P>
   For defensive tackle Jason Fisk, it is here today, gone last
year. He was with the Minnesota Vikings last season when they went
15-1 in the regular season and were heavy favorites to win the
Super Bowl until losing to Atlanta in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, he signed a free-agent contract with the
Titans. A trip to the Super Bowl was an added bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a turnaround for me,'' Fisk said. ``I thought
I'd be here last year. To be honest, I wasn't thinking the Titans
would go to the Super Bowl in my first year. I thought we'd be
good, but not this good yet.''

U.S. OFFICIALS SEE POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN BIN LADEN AND ALGERIAN
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 7th graf for clarification; subs 3rd to last grf to identify
Dahoumane) 
 (sw) 
 This article was reported by DAVID JOHNSTON, JUDITH MILLER and
WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and written by Johnston.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American investigators have uncovered what they believe are
links between a group of Algerians who have been charged with
plotting a terrorist attack in the United States and Osama bin
Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of bombing two U.S. embassies in
east Africa, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, authorities in Senegal arrested a man who the
American investigators believe directed an Algerian group in Canada
in its effort to enter the United States and carry off a bomb plot
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said the man being held in Senegal, Mohambedou
Ould Slahi, is a brother-in-law of one of bin Laden's key
lieutenants. Officials said that federal prosecutors in Manhattan
are preparing formal charges against Slahi, which could be used as
the basis for his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   In making the arrest, the Senegalese were acting on a request
from the United States. But he has not been charged with a crime in
either Senegal or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot was foiled on Dec. 14 when border agents in Port
Angeles, Wash., arrested a man who had been at the wheel of a car
loaded with explosives and four home-made detonators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they have no specific evidence that bin Laden set
the operation in motion. But investigators say they have found
several ties to what they believe to be bin Laden's worldwide
network.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disclosed, for example, that one of the men charged in
the case had a roommate who was associated with an Islamic charity
that, according to prosecutors, played a role in the embassy
bombings two years ago. Bin Laden has been charged with directing
those attacks, which left more than 200 dead.
</P>
<P>
   A host of questions remain about the bomb plot that appears to
have been centered in the Canadian cities of Montreal and
Vancouver. Federal prosecutors have to date charged four Algerians
with taking part but they remain uncertain what was targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials said this week that the case has
turned into the biggest counter-terrorism inquiry since the embassy
bombings. That earlier case has resulted so far in criminal charges
against 17 people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that federal agents were en route on Wednesday to
Senegal to question Slahi. They said the government in Senegal
appeared unwilling to hold him without specific charges, and was
preparing to expel him, possibly to his homeland, neighboring
Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities believe that if Slahi is charged, they would
then be able to extradite him under existing international law.
Officials said it was less clear whether they could extradite a
Mauritanian citizen from that country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the emergence of Slahi as a key suspect
reinforces American and Canadian suspicions about the origins of
the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   While several of those charged may have been members at one time
of a militant Algerian Islamic group known as the Armed Islamic
Group, the plot was most likely not inspired or ordered by that
group, which is not known to have attacked Americans or American
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi's connections to Mr. bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, they
said, suggest the possibility that bin Laden may be at the heart of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are pressing to find out more about the role of
Slahi, who one law enforcement official described as ``potentially
the most significant person'' discovered thus far in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about his background, but investigators say that
he had what one termed as ``constant communications'' with a
construction company in Khartoum, Sudan, that was owned by bin
Laden. The company, officials said, was used as a front for al
Qaeda. Bin Laden lived in Khartoum from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that Slahi is related by marriage to one
of bin Laden's key operatives, known as ``the Mauritanian.'' They
declined to name this person, but one official said he had been
tied to the Africa bombings.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, officials said, Slahi was living in Germany. Last
fall, he arrived in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While in Montreal, the officials said, Slahi worked closely with
Mokhtar Haouari, an Algerian man who has been charged with
arranging the logistics of the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest on Dec. 14 of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian driving the
carload of explosives, prompted others linked to the plot to try to
conceal their involvement, prosecutors have said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Slahi fled to a Montreal mosque, before
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lambert, spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence
Service, confirmed that his agency had been following Slahi, and
took issue with the idea that Canada had lost him. ``We were aware
that Mr. Slahi was traveling in advance of his departure,'' he
said, ``because the reason for his travel was the heat being placed
on him by the Canadian investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said there are several other emerging links
between the bomb plot and bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One involves Hamid Aich, an Algerian who lived for three years
in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby until last May. A law
enforcement official said that after leaving Canada, Aich moved to
Ireland and was associated with Mercy International Relief Agency,
an Islamic charity that American prosecutors have linked to the
embassy bombings and bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The charity's director, prosecutors said in court papers,
received calls on his mobile phone from bin Laden's satellite
telephone. An FBI search of the charity's files in the days after
the embassy bombings uncovered a receipt dated July 24, 1998, two
weeks before the bombings, that referred to plans to obtain weapons
from Somalia. Attempts to reach the charity for comment were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years in Canada, Aich shared an apartment with
Abdel Majid Dahoumane, one of the people charged in the planned
terrorist attack in the United States, according to the building's
superintendent, who declined to be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   Aich was briefly detained last month in Ireland and police there
seized his computer and personal papers. He was released before
authorities understood that the material tied him to bomb plot,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators are also looking into whether Khalil Said
al-Deek, a Palestinian who became an American in 1991 and is now
being held in Jordan, may also have links to al Qaeda. Jordanian
officials have told their American counterparts they believe that
Deek was a key figure in a plot to blow up tourist sites in Jordan
at the new year. Deek's lawyer, Fred Sayre, of Newport Beach,
Calif., said on Wednesday night that his client was innocent and
had not been in Jordan for about a year before officials there
ordered his arrest.

LAPD CORRUPTION PROBE EXPANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The toll from the LAPD corruption scandal mounted
Wednesday when hief Bernard C. Parks announced 99 defendants
involved in 57 cases were framed by a former Rampart Division
officer turned informant.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said investigation of the criminal misconduct of former
Los Angeles Police Department Officer Rafael Perez has reached the
point where the focus will shift to the actions of officers with
whom he worked at Rampart Division station.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said 52 of the people in the compromised cases were
interviewed, including three in prison. Their arrests and
prosecutions were found to be so tainted by fabricated evidence or
perjured testimony provided by Perez that the police chief wants
District Attorney Gil Garcetti to resolve them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department feels the criminal cases involving these 52
defendants have been severely tainted and cannot be salvaged,''
Parks said during a press conference at Parker Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe at this time it is in the best interest of the city
to dispose of these charges against the 52 in mass, vs. a piece by
piece, small-group process that can only prolong the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The department is particularly eager for the release of two
people incarcerated on the basis of what police now believe is
either tainted evidence or perjured statements, Parks said. The
third person, though involved in a compromised case, was
incarcerated on an unrelated matter.
</P>
<P>
   Parks added he has requested the recall of fugitive arrest
warrants against eight criminal defendants in tainted cases.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 47 individuals identified in the clouded cases
were not interviewed: Seven are expected to be interviewed soon,
one has died, nine refused to talk, 16 have been deported, two
could not be located, and a dozen have outstanding felony arrest
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin said the
cases identified by the LAPD would be reviewed before a decision is
made on whether they should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the district attorney has overturned 22 cases as part of
the corruption investigation, resulting in the release of six
people from jails and state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will expedite our review,'' Pipkin said, but she added that
the seven full-time prosecutors working the corruption probe will
need additional information before they decide on the new cases.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan said that while the
number of cases was startling and disappointing, the mayor supports
the aggressive manner in which Parks identified the corruption at
the outset and has worked to root it out of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside is that he is taking swift action to take care of a
number of cases and not have them dribble out,'' said Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez. ``The mayor supports the chief and believes he's
moving in the right direction. This shows he is on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the 57 cases linked to Perez after a two-month
debriefing of the former officer only a ``milestone'' in the
mushrooming LAPD corruption inquiry, Parks said investigators now
are poised to question officers named by Perez as possible
participants in illicit law enforcement activities. Parks would not
estimate the number of police officers who might be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture, all of our investigations have been
surrounding the issues that former Officer Perez has identified as
his actions,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition of this investigation will begin as it relates
to other officers Perez has identified as being involved in other
activities. Some of these officers work throughout the city, but it
appears as though their connection is that they did once work at
Rampart.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said his announcement was in keeping with his promise to
the city, at the outset of the investigation 18 months ago, that he
would provide regular updates on the corruption probe by the
department's Rampart Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have brought this investigation to this point. I think the
public confidence is there,`` Parks said.

tU.S. OFFICIALS SEE POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN BIN LADEN AND ALGERIAN (Eds: Subs 7th graf to delete reference to man charged for
assembling a bomb; subs 3rd to last grf to identify Dahoumane) 
 (sw) 
 This article was reported by DAVID JOHNSTON, JUDITH MILLER and
WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and written by Johnston.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American investigators have uncovered what they believe are
links between a group of Algerians who have been charged with
plotting a terrorist attack in the United States and Osama bin
Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of bombing two U.S. embassies in
east Africa, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, authorities in Senegal arrested a man who the
American investigators believe directed an Algerian group in Canada
in its effort to enter the United States and carry off a bomb plot
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said the man being held in Senegal, Mohambedou
Ould Slahi, is a brother-in-law of one of bin Laden's key
lieutenants. Officials said that federal prosecutors in Manhattan
are preparing formal charges against Slahi, which could be used as
the basis for his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   In making the arrest, the Senegalese were acting on a request
from the United States. But he has not been charged with a crime in
either Senegal or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot was foiled on Dec. 14 when border agents in Port
Angeles, Wash., arrested a man who had been at the wheel of a car
loaded with explosives and four home-made detonators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they have no specific evidence that bin Laden set
the operation in motion. But investigators say they have found
several ties to what they believe to be bin Laden's worldwide
network.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disclosed, for example, that one of the men charged in
the case had a roommate who was associated with an Islamic charity
that, according to prosecutors, played a role in the embassy
bombings two years ago. Bin Laden has been charged with directing
those attacks, which left more than 200 dead.
</P>
<P>
   A host of questions remain about the bomb plot that appears to
have been centered in the Canadian cities of Montreal and
Vancouver. Federal prosecutors have to date charged four Algerians
with taking part but they remain uncertain what was targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials said this week that the case has
turned into the biggest counter-terrorism inquiry since the embassy
bombings. That earlier case has resulted so far in criminal charges
against 17 people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that federal agents were en route on Wednesday to
Senegal to question Slahi. They said the government in Senegal
appeared unwilling to hold him without specific charges, and was
preparing to expel him, possibly to his homeland, neighboring
Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities believe that if Slahi is charged, they would
then be able to extradite him under existing international law.
Officials said it was less clear whether they could extradite a
Mauritanian citizen from that country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the emergence of Slahi as a key suspect
reinforces American and Canadian suspicions about the origins of
the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   While several of those charged may have been members at one time
of a militant Algerian Islamic group known as the Armed Islamic
Group, the plot was most likely not inspired or ordered by that
group, which is not known to have attacked Americans or American
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi's connections to Mr. bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, they
said, suggest the possibility that bin Laden may be at the heart of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are pressing to find out more about the role of
Slahi, who one law enforcement official described as ``potentially
the most significant person'' discovered thus far in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about his background, but investigators say that
he had what one termed as ``constant communications'' with a
construction company in Khartoum, Sudan, that was owned by bin
Laden. The company, officials said, was used as a front for al
Qaeda. Bin Laden lived in Khartoum from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that Slahi is related by marriage to one
of bin Laden's key operatives, known as ``the Mauritanian.'' They
declined to name this person, but one official said he had been
tied to the Africa bombings.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, officials said, Slahi was living in Germany. Last
fall, he arrived in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While in Montreal, the officials said, Slahi worked closely with
Mokhtar Haouari, an Algerian man who has been charged with
arranging the logistics of the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest on Dec. 14 of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian driving the
carload of explosives, prompted others linked to the plot to try to
conceal their involvement, prosecutors have said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Slahi fled to a Montreal mosque, before
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lambert, spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence
Service, confirmed that his agency had been following Slahi, and
took issue with the idea that Canada had lost him. ``We were aware
that Mr. Slahi was traveling in advance of his departure,'' he
said, ``because the reason for his travel was the heat being placed
on him by the Canadian investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said there are several other emerging links
between the bomb plot and bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One involves Hamid Aich, an Algerian who lived for three years
in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby until last May. A law
enforcement official said that after leaving Canada, Aich moved to
Ireland and was associated with Mercy International Relief Agency,
an Islamic charity that American prosecutors have linked to the
embassy bombings and bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The charity's director, prosecutors said in court papers,
received calls on his mobile phone from bin Laden's satellite
telephone. An FBI search of the charity's files in the days after
the embassy bombings uncovered a receipt dated July 24, 1998, two
weeks before the bombings, that referred to plans to obtain weapons
from Somalia. Attempts to reach the charity for comment were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years in Canada, Aich shared an apartment with
Abdel Majid Dahoumane, one of the people charged in the planned
terrorist attack in the United States, according to the building's
superintendent, who declined to be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   Aich was briefly detained last month in Ireland and police there
seized his computer and personal papers. He was released before
authorities understood that the material tied him to bomb plot,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators are also looking into whether Khalil Said
al-Deek, a Palestinian who became an American in 1991 and is now
being held in Jordan, may also have links to al Qaeda. Jordanian
officials have told their American counterparts they believe that
Deek was a key figure in a plot to blow up tourist sites in Jordan
at the new year. Deek's lawyer, Fred Sayre, of Newport Beach,
Calif., said on Wednesday night that his client was innocent and
had not been in Jordan for about a year before officials there
ordered his arrest.

GOP OFFICIAL COMPLAINS ABOUT FIRST LADY'S USE OF JET  
 (ATTN: N.C.)
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Republican congressman accused Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday of putting politics ahead of official U.S. business by
appropriating an Air Force jet that had been scheduled for use by a
congressional delegation to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cass Ballenger of North Carolina said that his delegation
was forced to take two six-seat Air Force jets on the trip to
Central and South America last week because a 14-seat jet that he
had reserved was taken by Mrs. Clinton's staff for a political trip
to New York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditure of government resources is a complicated matter
for both Mrs. Clinton and her likely opponent in next year's Senate
race in New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City. Both
Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have security and governmental staffing
needs even when they are traveling as political candidates to
campaign or raise money. Their aides have traded accusations in
recent months about the use of governmental resources for campaign
events.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the expenses must be shared by the appropriate
government agency and the candidates' campaign committees. The
expenses and reimbursements to the government by the campaigns are
supposed to be included in the semiannual expense filings required
by the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign and other New York Republicans, including
the state party chairman, issued statements criticizing Mrs.
Clinton about the airplane but offered no evidence of wrongdoing.
Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, referred questions about
Ballenger's complaint to the White House, but also accused Giuliani
of using his City Hall staff members for campaign work.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House, said: ``Any
suggestion that the first lady or the White House directed that
they be bumped to a smaller plane is absolutely false, and in fact,
if we had known that Congressman Ballenger and his wife were having
trouble getting a bigger plane, perhaps we could have helped. He
should have called.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint raised by Ballenger involves Air Force jets from
the 89th Air Wing that are used for top government officials,
generals and other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   But because the 89th Air Wing operates a large pool of aircraft,
White House officials said, it was impossible to know if the plane
Ballenger had reserved was the same one assigned to Mrs. Clinton
for her trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Higher level officials are typically given priority when it
comes to using the aircraft, Ballenger said. ``A senator can get a
plane immediately,'' Ballenger said. ``You have to have three
congressman before you can get a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballenger said that in late November, he requested the 14-seat
plane for a trip that involved touring areas of Venezuela that had
been devastated by mudslides and attending meetings about antidrug
efforts in Colombia, Mexico and Guatemala. Three other legislators,
two staff members, and Ballenger's wife, who has done charity work
in Latin America, also went on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Ballenger said a member of his staff called him in North
Carolina on Jan. 13, three days before the trip was scheduled to
depart, to say, ``The bad news is Mrs. Clinton took your plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really teed me off,'' Ballenger said. ``Why in the world
couldn't she have taken one of the little planes to New York?''

LAPD CORRUPTION PROBE EXPANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(NEW VERSION CORRECTING LEAD) 
BY BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The toll from the LAPD corruption scandal mounted
Wednesday when chief Bernard C. Parks announced 99 defendants
involved in 57 cases were framed by a former Rampart Division
officer turned informant.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said investigation of the criminal misconduct of former
Los Angeles Police Department Officer Rafael Perez has reached the
point where the focus will shift to the actions of officers with
whom he worked at Rampart Division station.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said 52 of the people in the compromised cases were
interviewed, including three in prison. Their arrests and
prosecutions were found to be so tainted by fabricated evidence or
perjured testimony provided by Perez that the police chief wants
District Attorney Gil Garcetti to resolve them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department feels the criminal cases involving these 52
defendants have been severely tainted and cannot be salvaged,''
Parks said during a press conference at Parker Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe at this time it is in the best interest of the city
to dispose of these charges against the 52 in mass, vs. a piece by
piece, small-group process that can only prolong the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The department is particularly eager for the release of two
people incarcerated on the basis of what police now believe is
either tainted evidence or perjured statements, Parks said. The
third person, though involved in a compromised case, was
incarcerated on an unrelated matter.
</P>
<P>
   Parks added he has requested the recall of fugitive arrest
warrants against eight criminal defendants in tainted cases.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 47 individuals identified in the clouded cases
were not interviewed: Seven are expected to be interviewed soon,
one has died, nine refused to talk, 16 have been deported, two
could not be located, and a dozen have outstanding felony arrest
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin said the
cases identified by the LAPD would be reviewed before a decision is
made on whether they should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the district attorney has overturned 22 cases as part of

</P>

   ``We will expedite our review,'' Pipkin said, but she added that

BUDGE BACKHAND: THE SHOT FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With OBIT-BUDGE, which moved in ``a'' category) 
(Eds.: Neil Amdur is sports editor of The New York Times) 
(sw) 
 By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before he discovered tennis and became the world's best
tennis player, Don Budge played baseball. And although he threw a
ball and wrote with his right hand, Budge batted left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Grasping the bat near the handle with his right hand, Budge
swung with an efficient motion, his wrist and arm held rigid. It
was the same swing that he would carry to the tennis court to
unleash his flawless one-handed backhand, the most defining ground
stroke ever hit by any tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   Once asked to assess the Budge Backhand, George Lott, a
serve-and-volley rival during the 1930s, said, ``When you came in
against Budge's backhand, he hit such a heavy ball, you'd swear you
were volleying a piano.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to Budge's game than one stroke, just as
there was more to Budge than his red hair, gentleman's demeanor and
unflappable court courage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the age of 19, Budge, who died on Wednesday at 84, used an
unconventional Western forehand grip, which gave him topspin and
power but left him vulnerable to low balls and slice, and inhibited
his volley. Taking the advice of friends, Budge switched to the
more traditional Eastern or shake-hand grip in the winter of 1935,
a move that hindered his short-term preparation but produced a more
fluent stroke that was still careful and calculated in its
execution. Two years later, he dominated the tour as no player ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   The intangibles that made Budge one of the sport's greats were
less visible to spectators. He was always physically fit, as strong
in the fifth set of a match as he was at the start. His timing was
impeccable, and he saw the ball as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to most professional advice,'' Julius Heldman wrote,
in assessing Budge's style, ``he did not `feel' the ball on his
racket for any length of time. Most players will flatten or lay
back their wrists as they hit in order to hold the ball as long as
possible. If they then mis-time the ball, they still have a very
good margin for error. There was no margin on Don's shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Budge's achievements assured him of immortality. In 1937,
he won the most significant Davis Cup match in history by rallying
from two sets down and 1-4 in the fifth set against the stylish
German Gottfried von Cramm, with the Interzone final series tied at
2-all. The match was played at a neutral site, Wimbledon, and was
the equivalent of the Joe Louis-Max Schmeling heavyweight title
fight after von Cramm received a prematch good-luck phone call from
Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances,'' recalled Ted Tinling, who was in
the office of the All England Club with von Cramm when Hitler
called, ``that match stands alone for what it represented at the
time. It was the ultimate test.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, Budge speculated on what Hitler had said
to von Cramm, his friend. ``Hitler was apparently telling Cramm
that they had had enough of the Americans winning everything in the
Olympics over there,'' Steve Flink quoted Budge as saying in his
book ``The Greatest Matches of the Twentieth Century'' (Rutledge,
1999). ``They were hoping _ and Hitler was hoping _ that Cramm
would beat me and bring the Cup back to Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the first player to win the four major singles
championships in a single calendar year in 1938 (Australian,
French, Wimbledon and United States), Budge achieved the sport's
first Grand Slam. In present usage, the words ``Grand Slam'' have
been woven into tournament terminology, as in Pete Sampras' number
of Grand Slam titles. But Sampras has yet to achieve the sweep that
Budge and Rod Laver did, and the Grand Slam stands by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Long after he had departed the amateur game for the pros and
then into retirement, Budge was a familiar sight in his blue blazer
with a regal presence that earned him the distinction as the
sport's Mr. Tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he would offer the weekend player, he said:
``Discipline is the importance of doing anything well, whether it's
tennis, basketball or whatever you are doing. But first of all, you
learn how to hit the ball correctly. If you have good strokes, then
work on your conditioning because your strokes are sound. If you
are in great shape physically, you can really write your own
ticket.''

ATLANTA _ A few minutes after the Tennessee Titans defeated
Jacksonville to reach the first Super Bowl in franchise history,
players and coaches celebrated on the makeshift stage at Alltel
Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As owner Bud Adams accepted the Lamar Hunt trophy for winning
the AFC Championship Game, defensive line coach Jim Washburn stayed
about 20 yards outside the roped-off area. Washburn stood alone for
a few minutes, and when he was offered congratulations, he had
tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about my family and how much I've been
blessed,'' Washburn said Wednesday. ``I was reflecting and thinking
that it was a miracle I was there. When I thought about where I'd
been and what I'd been through, well, it's so improbable it's
unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, people treated me like the plague.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Washburn couldn't even get a high school
coaching job. No one would touch him. He thought his coaching
career was over. Now, he will have a chance to win a Super Bowl
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to be associated with me for a long time,'' he
said. ``Now, I'm so happy to be here. I did wrong, and I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn went from being out of football, an object of scorn
within the profession, to reaching the pinnacle of coaching _ the
Super Bowl. Such coaches as Dick Vermeil, Fred Akers, Danny Ford,
Frank Broyles, Kim Helton and Jeff Fisher came to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how Washburn feels to be coaching in the Super
Bowl, you have to see where he has been.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1989, Washburn was indicted on charges that in the
mid-'80s he obtained steroids for players at the University of
South Carolina, where he was the defensive line coach under Joe
Morrison. There was a huge scandal that began with a first-person
story by former Gamecocks defensive lineman Tommy Chaikin in Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal investigation, Washburn pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor count of purchasing steroids and dispensing them to
players. He and two other former South Carolina coaches _ Tom
Kurucz and Keith Kephart _ were originally sentenced to three
months in jail, to be served in a halfway house in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a plea-bargain agreement, Washburn's sentence was
changed to three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone who gets a federal conviction gets off
scot-free,'' assistant U.S. attorney John Barton said at the time.
``These individuals paid a substantial penalty, not in the
traditional or classic format of going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge G. Ross Anderson eliminated the sentence
after listening to character witnesses testifying on the coaches'
behalf. Akers, the head coach at Purdue at that time, put in a good
word for Washburn, as did Cole Proctor, a Utah assistant coach in
1989 who is now a scout for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, 1990, Washburn pleaded guilty in Anderson's court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a sacred trust, but five years ago I violated that,''
Washburn told the judge. ``I'm very sorry. I've done all I can do
to rectify that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a table in the Titans interview room Wednesday,
Washburn's eyes turned red as he recounted his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up,'' he said. ``I did something wrong. I didn't mean
to. I was trying to keep a kid from getting steroids off the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so grateful to be where I am today. I didn't think I'd
ever get another coaching job for a long time, and here I am in the
Super Bowl. I'm a real insignificant part of this team, but I'm
awfully proud to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played our first preseason game in Kansas City, I
stood out there and about burst into tears. I looked at that sign
on the goal post. It said, `Feel the power.' I don't feel the power
of the NFL. I feel the power of the Lord, who put me in this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   His players don't care about his past. It's obvious from their
performance this season that they respect Washburn, who has done a
good job of developing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the leader of the army, the leader of the dog men,'' said
Titans defensive tackle Josh Evans, who is having his best season.
``I think he's the spice in the gumbo, the ingredient we needed. He
came in here and really believed in us from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks to us about what happened to him. He tells us to not
make the mistakes he made, to take care of ourselves and our
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn lost everything but his family. He lost his house and
went broke in the process. When he couldn't get a coaching job, he
mowed the grass at a golf course and drove a truck for a feed mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to eat,'' he said. ``I drove that feed truck for a long
time. I had to do whatever I could to put food on the table for my
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived on a dirt road where nobody knew where I was except
the State Bureau of Investigation, my lawyer, the federal
government, my father and my wife's family.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his indictment, Washburn was working for Akers at
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Akers gave me another chance when no one else would,''
Washburn said. ``He sort of rescued me by taking me in when all
that stuff (the investigation) was going on in South Carolina. When
the story broke that I was targeted by a federal grand jury, they
let me go. I was an embarrassment to the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only there for spring ball. We'd bought a house (in West
Lafayette, Ind.), and I lost it. Looking back, I was just fooling
myself. I knew I'd done something wrong. I guess I was hoping to
outrun it, but it caught up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn drove to the Indianapolis airport to return home to
Shelby, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low point of my career was at the Indianapolis airport,''
he said. ``When I got to the airport, I took all my football films,
tapes and cutups and threw them in a Dumpster. I thought my career
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans arrived in Indianapolis for their second-round
playoff game against the Colts two weeks ago, Washburn thought
about that April day in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the same airport, and I even saw that Dumpster,''
he said, softly. ``I was so thankful for getting a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After going broke, Washburn had to repay his debts. It has taken
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we beat Jacksonville, it brought me back even,'' he said
of the playoff check. ``I'm proud of that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said, `Hey, Wash, what are you going to do with your
playoff money?' I told him I was going to pay off my '93 truck and
then get a new set of tires.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how many of his friends stuck with him, Washburn
said, ``Besides my family? Well, my wife (Sandy) didn't leave me.
That was a real plus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washburns have three children _ Jeremiah, Brady and Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids learned something from my mistakes, so it's worked
out,'' he said. ``I didn't hear from many people, but I'll tell you
what, there were a lot of good things that came out of the whole
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forged the character of my two sons. There's no question my
sons wouldn't be the kind of men they are today if we hadn't gone
through that. My marriage is stronger. Shoot, I'd be afraid to go
back and change anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I was brought up in a Christian home. Going through
all that humbled me and brought me to my knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn thought about pleading innocent and going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told the truth,'' he said. ``My wife said, `You can lie
and get out of it, or you can be a man and tell the truth and mean
something to your children. You can face the music and be a real
example, no matter if you've got to serve time or not.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I had to go to prison I'd go, but I was going to
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   After being out of football for two years, Washburn made a
commitment to return to coaching, no matter the level. His first
job back was as the head coach of a minor-league football team, the
Charlotte Barons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that our offices were on Little Hope Road,''
he said. ``I think that's kind of ironic. We were in a drug
neighborhood, but hey, I was coaching again.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn won the championship and got a job as an assistant for
the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football, which
became NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Washburn was able to return to college coaching. Ford,
who coached against Washburn when he was head coach at Clemson,
hired him at Arkansas. Ford had to get the approval of athletic
director Frank Broyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year Danny got there, I was sort of on the fringe of
football,'' Washburn said. ``He offered me a job, but when they
(the administration) looked at my past, they said no. The next
year, Danny tried to get me involved again, and this time they were
kind enough to give me a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil, a college football analyst at the time, offered his
support by calling Broyles and recommending Washburn. On Sunday,
Washburn will be trying to keep Vermeil, the Rams' coach, from
winning his first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like coaches who like to work, who're talented and have a
passion for the game,'' Vermeil said Wednesday. ``I watched him
coach in the World League in an unbelievably negative environment
in regard to the facilities and the whole thing. He did a hell of a
job. I respected it. I'd hire him myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ford was fired at Arkansas, Helton hired Washburn at the
University of Houston. He thought he had a job at Michigan State
working for Nick Saban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a job with Nick, but somebody told him about that Sports
Illustrated article,'' Washburn said. ``He read it, called me back
and said he couldn't hire me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kim Helton just felt sorry for me. What a good guy he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   After coaching one season under Helton, Washburn was interviewed
by Fisher at the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a defensive line coach who would teach the players
how to walk before they could run,'' Fisher said. ``I wanted a
motivator, someone who lived and died football. When Jim was first
recommended to me (by Titans director of college scouting Glenn
Cumbee), I talked to a lot of people about him. I found out what
the circumstances were, and when I talked with him I looked beyond
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After visiting with him at the Senior Bowl for 30 minutes, I
knew Jim was the kind of coach I was looking for. He just wanted an
opportunity. I think everyone deserves a second chance. What
happened to Jim is behind him. It doesn't concern me. He's done a
fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Titans had 30 sacks, including 13{ by the defensive
line. This season, they set a franchise record with 54, including
37{ by the linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn benefited, of course, from getting to coach their No. 1
pick, defensive end Jevon Kearse, who set a rookie record with 14{
sacks, was voted NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and will start in
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take Don Shula to coach Jevon Kearse,'' Washburn
said. ``When I took that job, I knew I was in the catbird seat.
There was plenty of talent in that room. When I got there, I told
the players we were going to break the (team) sack record and go to
the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse knows how much Washburn has meant to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those coaches who has these sayings,'' Kearse
said. ``He's a great motivator. He'll say things to me that make me
get tears in my eyes and make me want to line up and play some
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fisher and his family moved out of their house and into a
new one they built, Washburn rented the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were leaving,'' Fisher said, ``I wrote with a power
washer in my driveway, `More Sacks.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was Fisher who encouraged Washburn to tell his story at the
Super Bowl. Players and coaches are fined by the NFL if they don't
show up for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he can be an inspiration, Washburn said, ``I'm just a
regular guy, but I'll tell you the best thing I did. I'm a
Methodist, and there's a publication the Methodists have that's
called The Upper Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote an article, and this guy read it and wrote me back.
He's a college coach who had cancer. He wrote me that he had my
article framed and put it on the bulletin board. He said it gave
him the hope to try to beat cancer. And he did beat cancer. Man,
that made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the Titans organization feels good this week and
appreciates the opportunity to play in Super Bowl XXXIV. But no one
feels better or appreciates it more than Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, everyone knows about the Music City Miracle,'' Washburn
said, referring to the kickoff return that beat Buffalo in the
first round of the playoffs. ``Well, it's a real miracle I'm
here.''

KINGS FALLING FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS -- If you think this winless streak against the Dallas St
ars is long, consider this summer if the Kings don't make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Kings are on the outside looking in at t
he postseason. And though Wednesday's 3-1 loss to the Stars in
front of 17,001 at Reunion Arena extended their slump to 22 games,
it might be worse that they have been caught by Calgary and
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers and the were the small market teams the Kings were
supposed to leave behind when they upgraded their roster last
summer and moved into the Staples Center. Instead, it is the Kings
in ninth place in an eight team race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what is going on,'' said veteran defenseman Garry
Galley. ``We wake up every morning and see what the standings are.
But it is not time to push the panic button. If we play the rest of
the way the way we played tonight, we get some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Kings' 11th consecutive loss to the Stars
was goaltender Ed Belfour, who stopped 38 of 39 shots including 18
in the third period. The only goal he allowed came in the final two
minutes of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Kings' other three losses to the Stars this season,
Dallas did not set the tone. In addition to the shots on goal, that
included eight by Rob Blake and six by Ziggy Palffy, the Kings took
27 shots that missed the net.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had just 18 shots on Kings goaltender Jamie Storr and
missed the net just eight other times. But it was the fourth time
Dallas be at them this season. Last year, it was six straight,
including five victories by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Kings beat Dallas was April 6, 1995. The two
teams, which have had three games in January, play again Feb. 11
and April 7, both at Staples Center. Wednesday's loss also set a
franchise record for both clubs. The Kings were winless (17-0-4) in
22 straight against Dallas' ancestors the Minnesota North from
March 31, 1970 to Dec. 11, 1973 . The NHL record is 34 by the
Montreal Canadiens against the Washington Capitals in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak is out there, there is nothing you can do about it,
but think the next time is going to be the one that stops it,''
Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``Most nights we have played with
great effort. We didn't win, but we played very well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings admitted the Stars, who have been decimated by
injuries after their Stanley Cup-winning season, looked flat. The
Kings had a chance to tie the game in the final seconds, but
against Belfour it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling their goalie, the Kings had a chance to tie the
game with 25 second left in regulation when Palffy fired a low shot
that Belfour kicked away for his 38th save of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven seconds later, Brett Hull added an empty netter after
a pass from Mike Modano, who had a goal and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   For Belfour, the victory raised his record to just 18-19-13, but
he is 4-0 since he was snubbed for the All-Star game in place of
New York's Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   As they have done all season, the Stars scored first and put the
Kings back on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Tuomainen had just come back on the ice midway through the
first period, when former King Darryl Sydor first a slap shot from
the point. Brett Hull got the rebound but was stopped by goaltender
Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings couldn't clear the puck and Modano poked in his
19th goal of the season to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like he has been doing that to us all season,'' Galley
said. ``But we held our own. We can't worry about what the other
teams are doing. We know everyone is close. We know we belong.''

DAVENPORT BEATS CAPRIATI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Ten years ago, 13-year-old Lindsay Davenport admired
Jennifer Capriati, the tennis player: ``We're the exact same age,
but Jennifer's out of my league.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Davenport feared Capriati, the image: ``I'm
gonna be careful. I don't want to go what she's the gone through.
I'm in no hurry. I'm gonna graduate from high school and go to the
senior prom.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said, ``It's really strange _ and great for her _ that
Jennifer and I wound up in the Australian Open semifinals. I'm so
glad for her, that she could come back after all her problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport, the 6-foot-3-inch Wimbledon champion, was
determined to be an added problem herself, and held together under
a fierce Capriati assault to power her way into Thursday's final,
6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   Davenport will go against Martina Hingis, a 6-3, 6-2 winner over
Conchita Martinez, for the title. Hingis, who is riding a 27-set
Aussie streak, is bidding to become the first player in the open
era to win the Australian four straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer kept me on my heels the way she was slugging,'' said
Davenport, who was toppled by Capriati's rugged forehand in the
10th game of the second set as she served for the victory at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, who has risen from No. 101 to No. 21 in two years, was
matching Davenport's firepower, shot for shot.
</P>
<P>
   But in the tiebreaker, it was Davenport's harmless-looking,
changeup kicker second serve that did Capriati in, making two vital
points. Capriati overhit them, the first a backhand that looked a
winner that would have given her a minibreak _ but it just missed
the sideline so that Davenport was at 3-3. The lone mini, to 5-4,
went to Davenport on Capriati's error, concluding a blistering
exchange of 21 strokes. Davenport fooled Capriati with another slow
66 miles per hour kicker to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Then Davenport, making her third major final, served it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't adjust with my feet. They were just too easy . . . I
didn't know what to do,'' said Capriati, who plunked a last
forehand into the net, ending her 82-minute challenge that roused a
late-morning gathering of 12,000 to constant shouts of ``Come on,
Jennifer!''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years had passed since the ill-starred Capriati last
ventured this far in a major championship, the US Open semifinal
that she barely lost to Monica Seles. A gloomy morning brought rain
and forced closure of the retractable roof of the Rod Laver
Stadium, transforming their struggle into a hot-house engagement
that Davenport seemed about to run away with.
</P>
<P>
   In 23 minutes, Davenport had pocketed the opening set, running
up a 5-1 lead and splintered Capriati's serve to start the second.
The depth of Davenport's weighty ground strokes and her dynamite
serve killed Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   But Capriati, ever a fighter, came roaring back to score her
first service break 2-1 at the half-hour mark, subsided 2-4, then
began to outhit her faltering foe to catch her at 4-4. ``Jennifer
had me going. But I hung in when it mattered,'' said Davenport. ``I
am so happy for her, and I know she is happy again. But I didn't
want to make her any happier.''

FAMILIAR FACES BRING GLITTER TO SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ah, finally. Star quality at the Super Bowl. And not a
moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway. Wayne Gretzky. And, a personal favorite, Michael
Jordan _ the only NBA owner with a fadeaway jumper worth a damn.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, just as the earnest, honorable Rams and Titans vowed
to get down to the serious work of preparing for the Big Game, the
AARP trinity of our sporting era showed up in not-so-hot 'Lanta.
(Temperature 28. Wind chill 14.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Elway, Gretzky and Jordan were all in one room. Buddies.
Business partners. The three amigos and, gosh, the mind just about
warped in the presence of such megawatt people wearing really
expensive suits.
</P>
<P>
   What must it be like to be one of those rich and famous and
wildly talented guys, hanging around those other two rich and
famous and wildly talented guys?
</P>
<P>
   This question suddenly seemed as important as who's going to win
Sunday, if anyone in the world is seriously contemplating that
question.
</P>
<P>
   As Super Bowl XXXIV begins to thaw, apologies are extended to
the likes of Kurt Warner, Steve McNair, Eddie George, Marshall
Faulk, Orlando Pace and Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   This is your Super Bowl, fellas. And your teams are deserving.
Your records valiant. Your play-making commendable.
</P>
<P>
   But, hate to say it, no one directly involved in this Super Bowl
is a big enough star to get past the bouncer at the Gold Club. Not
unless strip club patrons such as Patrick Ewing or Latrell Sprewell
take them for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive us for being temporarily blinded by the light of our
favorite retirees. We are, after all, talking Jordan, Elway and
Gretzky _ a veritable sports-god triumvirate who showed up
Wednesday to unveil their new virtual venture, MVP.com.
</P>
<P>
   If the holy rollers of hoops, hockey and hut hut want to get
together and hawk sporting goods on their new Web site, who are we
to stop them?
</P>
<P>
   And, more to the point, who are we to ignore them, especially
when we get to see so little of themnowadays?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's not just selling kayaks and pucks and sneakers and
pitching wedges that makes MVP.com so cool, the Big Three say. The
site is also about getting inside the minds of these
fourth-quarter, final period, last-minute saviors. There are all
sorts of tidbits and insights from the three Mr. Clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said his contribution, besides a serious cash
investment, will be tips on hockey stick blade curvature.
</P>
<P>
   Elway will give important advice on how much you should blow up
the protective lining inside your kid's football helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want it tight. But then again, you don't want it too
tight,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent point. Sales will no doubt be swift. Wall Street
a-flutter. When's the IPO?
</P>
<P>
   As for Jordan, well, he had the best suit and the biggest
diamond stud earring, which was good to see. These things helped
distract some attention away from the fact that Sir Air can't much
distinguish between a mouse and a motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting up to speed on the Internet situation,'' Jordan
said, as if he were a member of the Cabinet, addressing some
confounding overseas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did promise that as a director of this new Internet
company, he is a bona fide creative and business contributor. His
new job as king of the Washington Wizards won't stand in the way.
Nor will his work with Tweety Bird or the Hanes underwear people.
</P>
<P>
   And, most important, Jordan is answering almost all his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``John writes me every day and I'm getting good at getting right
back to him,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it takes awhile. Jordan is practicing the
hunt-and-peck method on his laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Guess Typing 101 was not required up there at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is encouraging to see Jordan stretching himself with
this new business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just lending my name to this enterprise. I'm willing
to roll up my sleeves and go to work,'' Sir Air confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   No telling if Jordan will be at the inventory warehouse come the
Christmas rush, like so many other e-commerce robber barons who
actually do pack boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jordan can pull a shift in gift-wrapping. Or, better
yet, he could hold inspirational meetings with customer service
people and warehouse workers, show them what it's like to raise
their game.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did that this week with his other new toy, the Wizards.
Sir Air apparently schooled his underachieving team, running the
floor and hitting jumpers and exhorting the players to be a little
more like Mike.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Wizards declared that Jordan would be the NBA's
leading scorer if he were playing this season.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the man also likes to pour his competitive heart into
whatever task is in front of him, as do Elway and Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be as successful after football as I was during my
career. And this is a good way to start now that our best playing
days are behind us,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   To which Jordan quickly responded, ``Mine aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the three amigos were gone, leaving behind some much
appreciated stardust and a personality vacuum that guys such as
Warner, Kearse, Faulk, McNair, Pace and George will, bless them,
attempt to fill.

   SEATTLE _ It might have been the most efficient two seconds of
basketball that Chuck Person ever played in his 14 years in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Inserted for his shooting ability with 1.8 seconds remaining in
the game, the reserve forward calmly hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer
as the Sonics narrowly escaped with a 95-92 win over the New Jersey
Nets Wednesday night before 13,340 fans in KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what I needed to do when I went in there,''
said Person, who is nicknamed ``The Rifleman'' for good reason. ``I
don't get all that excited anymore and it was just another shot,
but it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Road-weary and lethargic, the Sonics played most of the game as
if they had been snowed in after leaving the frigid East Coast for
the normally temperate and friendly confines of their home court.
</P>
<P>
   They came out cold and never seemed to warm to the occasion
until the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs are a little bit tired and my shot was a little bit
flat,'' guard Gary Payton admitted after a 6-for-22 night from the
field in which he managed just 17 points, six below his season
average.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Shammond Williams (18 points off the bench) still had
the hot hand from his last game against the New York Knicks on
Monday night, and Person had the one last-second miracle shot in
his arsenal as the Sonics staved off overtime and ended their
three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a beautiful thing. That's one of the reasons we have
Chuck on this team. He's a clutch shooter and he has range,''
Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   As a shooter, Person said, sometimes ``you get a feel for
whether it's going in or not. I shot it straight. ... So when I saw
the good rotation, I kind of felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had a chance to win the game with 7.5 seconds left in
regulation, but Johnny Newman's layin was blocked by Ruben
Patterson, setting up the final play to Person. It atoned for an
otherwise sub-par effort on both sides of the court.
</P>
<P>
   During one particularly odious stretch during the second
quarter, the Sonics and Nets exchanged four turnovers in a row,
followed by a shot-clock violation on both sides. For the game, the
Sonics had 20 turnovers, while the Nets had 22.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in the building assumed overtime was in order
when the Sonics first tried an inbound play for Payton, but the
ball was deflected out of bounds by Nets guard Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   The failed play, however, allowed the Sonics to get the ball
closer to the hoop for the final jumper from Person off a pass from
Emanual Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much time, but there was plenty,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   The way the play was designed, Person passed the ball to Davis
and was left wide open for the 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous guy on an inbound play is the guy that
takes it out if there is enough time,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Nets coach Don Casey took responsibility for setting up a
defense in the last seconds that double-teamed Payton while leaving
Person open down the side of the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle made two big-time plays. They made a defensive stop
and we made a bad tactical move,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were looking to put an end to a three-game skid after
road losses to the Knicks, Raptors and Celtics during their East
Coast swing. They also had a three-game home winning streak on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets forced the action early and the Sonic reserves
never seemed to get in tune with the rest of the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis was particularly cold in the first half, missing
all three of his field goal attempts and hitting only one basket
for the game. Davis, who was starting in place of the injured Brent
Barry, also struggled, hitting just 1-for-8 from the floor and
scoring five points in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Barry was out with a concussion suffered on Monday against the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Also sputtering in the first half was Payton, who had just six
points on 3-for-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who was ejected in the first quarter on Monday, played
like he was still smarting from the disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   During the road trip, Payton had admonished some of his
teammates to work harder on the boards and on the floor, but it was
Payton who had the most difficulty getting into the game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip took a lot out of me and we just have to get back to
where we were,'' Payton said. ``A lot of these guys were tired but
we sucked it up and a did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal also shook up the starting lineup in the second half,
inserting Williams and Jelani McCoy at center after Horace Grant
pulled out with a calf contusion.
</P>
<P>
   Williams immediately made an impact, hitting a layin and
collecting a put-back jumper off a Vin Baker miss to give the
Sonics their first lead, 55-54 with 6:30 left in the third quarter.
He then calmly canned a 3-pointer on the next possession to stretch
the lead to four points.
</P>
<P>
   The much-improved Nets had won 15 of their last 24 games heading
into KeyArena. They were led by Marbury's 24 points, followed by 18
points by former Sonic Kendall Gill and 14 points each for Newman
and Keith Van Horn, who missed most of the second half with a
bruised knee.
</P>
<P>
   Baker led the Sonics with 23 points and 13 rebounds, and
Patterson had 17 points and eight rebounds as the two forwards kept
the Sonics close throughout the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't sustain their run,'' Marbury said. ``They kept
the game close and then they got a lucky break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics now have two days off before they host former coach
George Karl and the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of these three-game losing streaks and then you win
three. We just have to be consistent a little more,'' Payton said.
``It was good that we could get this win tonight and now we're
going to get a couple of days when we can rest.''

</P>
<P>
   TERROR-U.S. (Undated) _ American investigators have uncovered
what they believe are links between a group of Algerians who have
been charged with plotting a terrorist attack in the United States
and Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of bombing two U.S.
embassies in east Africa, law enforcement officials said on
Wednesday. Exclusive. By David Johston, Judith Miller and William
K. Rashbaum.
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA-BUSINESS (Damascus, Syria) _ They have luxury cars,
marble-floored offices, satellite dishes, tailored suits and
high-end computers. But young Syrian entrepreneurs are feeling
distinctly bankrupt. On the horizon, they can see the outlines of a
new world, one in which Syria's inefficient and inward-looking
producers will have to compete in a newly energized Middle East
free of trade barriers. And while an end to the 52-year-old state
of war between Syria and Israel is also in sight, many businessmen
fear they will not be able to reap any of the economic dividends of
peace. By Susan Sachs.

   GORE-NY (New York) _ As Al Gore prepares to return to New York
for a second primary, on March 7, this time as the vice president
and the favorite to be his party's presidential nominee, he is a
very different candidate from the one whose campaign collapsed on
the steps of Mayor Edward Koch's City Hall in 1988. And there is
probably no better place to chart that evolution than in this same
state that provided Gore with a brutal lesson in presidential
politics. By Adam Nagourney.

   EUROPE-MULTIPLEXES (Dunkirk, France) _ Bruno Frydman had few
illusions when he set up shop in Paris in 1993 to build the kind of
multiplex theaters that helped revolutionize moviegoing in the
United States. It took him six years to get his latest and biggest
project built _ a 20-screen, 4,010-seat site in a harborside
shopping center in Dunkirk. His experience shows that he was right
not to underestimate French resistance to big multiplex developers.

possible for e-commerce sites to pipe live customer service
representatives to shoppers over the Internet, but icontact.com is
pushing the idea much further. Instead of waiting for a befuddled
online shopper to press a help button on the computer screen,
icontact.com's technology lets human helpers _ the company calls
them ``Netreps'' _ hover unseen in the background but able to
contact Web shoppers, many of whom believe they are browsing the
Net unobserved. If the technology becomes more widespread, online
consumers may soon experience an unprecedented level of service

   CIR-DIGITAL-DIVIDE (Undated) _ Universal access to the Net,
treating computers as the equivalent of telephones, has long been a
goal of many in the computer industry, who are concerned about the
so-called ``digital divide.'' The concern is also self-serving, as
is quickly acknowledged by Silicon Valley executives involved in a
new Clinton administration plan to develop universal computer
access with federal money. But the problem of access to information
is real, and the best solutions very unclear. A look at what this
``divide'' is and what will it take to close it. By Katie Hafner.

   SEED-CATALOG (Union, Conn.) _ By sunrise one day last week, it
was 6 below in this frozen burg. But the wind made it feel like 30
below as it knifed through the pine trees and banged on the metal
doors of a secondhand trailer across from Marilyn Barlow's old
farmhouse. By 8 a.m., this slumbering world was buzzing with the
dreams of spring. The first of hundreds of gardeners started
calling. When would the Select Seeds catalog arrive? Was it too
early to start kiss-me-over-the-garden-gate? (Yes.) What about
poppies? (Scatter them outside, over the snow.) Orders poured in,
by phone and fax, for America, a fragrant, cherry-red-and-white
sweet pea dating to 1896, and for a little fringed
raspberry-scented flower that Napoleon carried from Egypt to
Josephine. Three women hunched over computers, typing in orders,

   NY-DIVORCED-ROOMMATES (New York) _ Breaking up is hard to do,
especially in Manhattan's tight housing market. Faced with the most
expensive rents in the country, skyrocketing co-op prices and a
paltry vacancy rate estimated at less than 1 percent, an increasing
number of Manhattan couples are living together long after their
relationship dies. Call them room-exes; their existence recalls
Soviet-era Moscow, when the chronic housing shortage forced most
divorced couples either to live together or move back in with their
parents. By David Wallis.

Land.
</P>
<P>
   HUMANS-AS-PREY (Helena, Mont.) _ Dan Dodge's 12 year-old son,
Jake, was playing outside the family home in this mountain-ringed
town when his father heard him yell, ``There's a mountain lion!''
Dodge looked out the window to see a dun-colored cat crouched about
30 feet away from a picnic table, moving stealthily toward his son.
Dodge ran to his bedroom, and grabbed a .270-caliber rifle. Firing
from inside the house, he dropped the 115-pound female cat with
several shots. Dodge called to alert the Montana Department of
Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which approved his course of action. Pete
Johnson, the conservation officer who investigated the shooting,
said: ``Lions are unpredictable. If the kid had taken off running
it could have triggered the predatory response in the lion.'' By
Jim Roberts.

 FAINT SIGNAL SETS OFF NEW SEARCH FOR LOST MARS LANDER  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA mission controllers renewed their effort to contact the
lost Mars Polar Lander Wednesday after mysterious faint signals
raised hopes that the spacecraft might still be alive and signaling
from somewhere on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists described the chances of making contact as ``a
real long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of radio engineers from Stanford University and SRI
International, the Menlo Park research outfit, reported this week
that their 150-foot dish antenna overlooking Interstate 280 had
picked up faint signals from Mars on December 18 and January 4.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of renewing contact, NASA controllers at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena radioed three fresh sets of
messages Wednesday instructing the spacecraft to signal. And the
Stanford team spent the day fine-tuning the big dish to catch any
tiny response.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and Stanford officials said it would take a day or more of
analysis before they would know if they had succeeded in
communicating with the wayward spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic, but it's no more than that,'' Sam
Thurman, the Polar Lander's flight director, told reporters in a
telephone conference call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morale among the lander's team members has certainly taken an
upward swing from the gloom of last week, when NASA officials
announced that they had abandoned all hope and the search for the
lost lander was ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure blew our minds,'' Thurman said of the Stanford team's
tantalizing hints that their spacecraft, however badly wounded,
might still be alive. ``It's like going to the funeral of a friend
and suddenly learning that he may not be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The $165 million spacecraft had been on its final approach to
the planet, within minutes of landing near the Martian south pole
to search for water ice, when it vanished December 3.
</P>
<P>
   NASA immediately began an experimental effort to communicate
with the downed craft, and it selected the Stanford radio dish
because of its sensitivity and its ability to focus tightly in any
direction in space.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford dish is also capable of picking up radio signals in
the ultrahigh-frequency wavelengths that NASA mission controllers
use to communicate with the Mars Global Surveyor, which is now in
orbit around the planet. The lander was to have relayed some of its
collected data to Earth on the UHF band through the Surveyor above
it.
</P>
<P>
   The signals that the Stanford dish picked up _ and hoped to have
picked up again Wednesday _ were extremely faint but seemed to come
from the right direction, according to Mike Cousins, a radio
engineer from SRI who works on the dish.
</P>
<P>
   But Thurman cautioned that the faint sounds may well have come
from nearby UHF television stations, inadvertently ``leaking''
their signals into Stanford's big dish receiver.
</P>
<P>
   If the signals do come from the lander, ``at best we'll only get
a handful of bits,'' Thurman said. But even those few bits of data
could tell the scientists whether the lander is lying on its side,
or perhaps on the slope of a hill.
</P>
<P>
   And if signals are repeated again and again, it may be possible
to pinpoint just where within the lander's target area near the
south pole it came to grief.
</P>
<P>
   All that will take many weeks of data analysis if the signals do
come from the lander. And scientists say there is no possibility
that the spacecraft could ever pursue its mission of digging for
water and characterizing the frozen soil in the planet's
southernmost region.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman and his team at mission control will continue their
effort Friday, sending three more sets of signals up to the lost
lander _ in the hope that the ship's radio will reply _ with even
the briefest and feeblest of messages.

 A SCENE RIGHT OUT OF A THRILLER  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ T he police lieutenant puts aside the official
cop-to-media language and talks like a proud dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer (Danielle) Feccia, she just got engaged, she's a
lovely woman, she's on this guy like 50 wildcats. Then you've got
(Officer Michael) Glickman, the avenging angel.''
</P>
<P>
   (Why isn't Lt. Mark Swendsen of Park Station writing cop
novels?)
</P>
<P>
   ``The (suspect) is 5-11, 190,'' he explains, ``and Officer
Feccia took his ass  &UR; down. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it was jumpin' Tuesday evening up on Corbett Ave., just
off Market Street, where Market starts winding up the big hill.
Someone somehow got into a 51-year-old man's apartment and beat the
man unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, it would turn out, is on parole after doing time
for rape and has a decade-long record of very violent crime and
parole violation.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor heard a scuffle, then screaming and whimpering,
called 911, and soon the Feccia-Glickman tag team arrived. They
covered the second-floor apartment front and back, and the perp,
who wore shades and had bloody socks on his hands, jumped out a
front window.
</P>
<P>
   Feccia, who is 5-foot-4, hopped onto the suspect's back. He
fought to his feet and tried to throw her off, yelling, ``Just
shoot me! Just f_ shoot me!''
</P>
<P>
   She grabbed his hair and pulled him backward, but he broke free
and ran. She chased him down to Market, where he bolted through
heavy traffic, jumped into the passenger side of a van, got shoved
out by the van driver, and ran some more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Glickman arrived in the squad car and tried to head
the guy off. Feccia grabbed the suspect again from behind, but he
swatted her away. Glickman got out, joined the foot chase, caught
up with the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He duked it out with the guy, toe to toe, for four blocks,''
Swendsen says proudly. ``Running through traffic, chase and fight,
chase and fight, chase and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Glickman made a tackle, both men sliding into busy
Market Street, and the chase was over.
</P>
<P>
   So no more cracks about cops and doughnuts, OK?
</P>
<P>
   UP TO YOUR cubits in rainwater?
</P>
<P>
   If you're in San Jose, the Emergency Operations Center will
supply you with sandbags. Just call 1-888-HEY-NOAH.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRITY NEWS: George Hamilton, who has contributed to global
warming by soaking up so many solar rays, has moved to San
Francisco and is living with author Danielle Steele. Where does he
tan? ... Jane Fonda, Christian zealot. Gives new meaning to the
phrase, ``Feel the burn!'' ... Did you see Dick Clark on the Golden
Globe Awards? Dick's next power gig: Valet-parking the stars'
limos.
</P>
<P>
   HALLMARK, getting hip to the fact that people don't want to
spend more on the card than the gift, has come out with a line of
99-cent greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   And they're branching out into nontraditional areas. Like:
``Troubled Relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   I want to say ``sorry'' but not blow a whole buck.
</P>

   WHO WANTS to be a millionaire? Anyone who bet $5,000 on the Rams
to win the Super Bowl, early in the season when Vegas was giving
200-to-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   If I were the Rams, I'd have people hanging with QB Kurt Warner
this week, making sure he doesn't eat any shellfish or accept any
rides from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN'T CATCH a cab in the city, my expert says, because so
many of the cabbies are new hires, many from out of country, with
no knowledge of the city. So they keep it simple, hanging at the
airport, avoiding the confusing streets downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Gavin, how about a mandatory cabbie qualifying school _
Taxi Tech?
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE REASON why this century is far superior to the 20th:
Silicon Valley now has an online dry cleaner. They download your
cleaning request, come right to your desk and virtually take you to
the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   SEAL ROCK continues in the grand local tradition of misnamed
islands. Alcatraz, for instance, got its name when an English sea
captain goofed on his map and slapped the name of another island _
Isla de Alcatraces (pelicans) _ on the Rock. The former Pelican
Island became Yerba Buena Island, which became the retirement home
of Willie Brown's girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Seal Rock never had seals, it had sea lions, which split for
Pier 39 a decade ago, so one reader suggested calling it Birdpoop
Rock, or something close to that, since that's all you can see on
the island now.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Ryugo says you can't call Seal Rock Birdpoop Rock,
because there already is a Birds_ Rock. Actually it's Bird Rock,
just north of Point Bonita, and the pelicans, cormorants and gulls
have made the island look like a snow-capped mountain, so fishermen
know it as Birds_ Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should change Seal Rock to Sealfree Rock. And why not
give Alcatraz's name back to its rightful owner, Yerba Buena
Island, and call Alcatraz Jailhouse Rock?

vision he brought to office can be carried forward by the man
seated directly behind him, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always placed much weight on this annual address to
the joint session of Congress. For his first, seven years ago, he
was making changes up until the moment he arrived at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Clinton will seek to establish his legacy as the
steward of a booming economy and world peace, and to inform the
nation that he will remain an activist president until his final
moment in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked very hard on the speech, and I'm still working on
it,'' Clinton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last year comes for him much too soon. He recently
told reporters that he wished he ``could go without sleep for a
whole year'' so that he ``could milk every last second'' of his
final days as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known previous presidents to be quite as almost
maudlin about the prospects of leaving office,'' said Stephen Hess,
a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution. ``I can't
remember presidents ever spending quite so much time talking about
their legacy. It's kind of a narcissistic manner that defines
Clintonesque.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the Clinton administration has announced
a new initiative almost every day. The president has already
announced $150 billion in new spending for next year _ from
multibillion-dollar expansions of Medicare to a tiny $27 million
program to battle wage discrimination against women _ and several
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech is expected to include a number of new
proposals, notably ClickStart, a new program to provide up to $100
million to buy computers and Internet access for low-income
households.
</P>
<P>
   First suggested by Bay Area computer executives, ClickStart
melds the Internet Age with classic liberal social policy. Its name
derives from Head Start, the low-income preschool program begun by
President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s, and its model is President
Franklin Roosevelt's Rural Electrification Administration of the
1930s, which brought electricity to rural homes.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative will underscore Clinton's efforts to bridge the
``digital divide,'' a major plank in Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Just as President Ronald Reagan seemed to win a third term with
Vice President George Bush's election, a Gore presidency would
affirm Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   As the titular head of the Senate, Gore will sit just behind the
podium where Clinton speaks, creating a visual link between
candidate Gore and the president as Clinton describes a booming
economy, a world at peace, declining crime, shrinking welfare rolls
and a raft of proposals to improve education, clean the
environment, protect Social Security and expand health care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has emerged from his victory against Sen. Bill Bradley in
the Iowa caucuses with a newfound enthusiasm for aligning himself
with Clinton, telling audiences that he is ``deeply honored'' to be
Clinton's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Clinton's speech will be aimed at ``trying to get Al
Gore elected and help the Democrats win back the House,'' said GOP
strategist Bill Kristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really would be, more than anything else, his real
vindication, taking the House back from the Republicans who
impeached him and electing his vice president to succeed him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the policy initiatives that Clinton will propose,
and all the activism that he promises until his last hour in
office, there is scant chance that much will pass Congress this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are clinging to a five-vote margin in the House, and
Democrats see a majority within reach, making prospects dim for
bipartisan agreement on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Pacts could be reached on a handful of small, popular tax cuts,
such as reducing the so-called marriage penalty, along with some of
the high-tech industry's agenda, equally popular with both parties.
Clearing China's membership in the World Trade Organization is also
in play, although that is already getting bogged down in
election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has always made highly effective use of his State of
the Union speech, whether to reframe his presidency after
Republicans captured the House in 1994 or, as last year, to reclaim
it after his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington pundits discount his State of the Union speech,''
said Kristol, ``but they get huge audiences and have helped him a
lot in the past. I don't minimize the extent to which he might
begin framing the issues for the general election on Gore's behalf,
while Gore is still otherwise occupied.''

WORLD AFFAIRS TAKE BACK SEAT IN 2000 RACE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The Cold War is over. The nation is at peace.
The United States is indisputably the world's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   The big international issues _ whether the United States should
actively promote democracy, protect freedom and encourage trade
around the globe _ find the major candidates in broad agreement.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is not surprising that questions about foreign
policy are often raised as an afterthought in Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest foreign affairs controversy of the campaign did not
involve Russia, China or the World Trade Organization. Instead, it
was over the appropriateness of Boston TV reporter Andy Hiller
springing a world leaders ``pop-quiz'' on Texas Gov. George W.
Bush. (He failed.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, even as Americans thus far have had the luxury of
not paying close attention to world affairs during the 2000
campaign, the field presents some fundamental choices.
</P>
<P>
   A careful examination of the candidates' speeches, position
papers and voting records reveals different outlooks on how the
nation should interact with the rest of the world, as well as
vastly different levels of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the dove who voted
against the 1991 war in Iraq and stands alone against increases in
military spending. Vice President Al Gore is the experienced hand,
a pro-defense Democrat who has been active on arms control issues
for 15 years and played a more hands-on role with foreign policy
than any vice president in history.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the advocate of a more sharply defined U.S. mission _
what he calls a ``uniquely American internationalism'' _ who favors
a harder line on China and Russia and an investment in the military
of the future. Arizona Sen. John McCain is the hawk, a decorated
war hero who says the United States should never back down from its
role as the world's supreme power or hesitate to use covert and
overt operations to topple governments in rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Though the distinctions are real, the similarities in this field
are perhaps more striking. With the exception of longshots Gary
Bauer and Alan Keyes, the presidential candidates are staunch
internationalists and avid free-traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all centrists _ basic internationalists,'' said James
Goldgeier, a professor of International Studies at George
Washington University in Washington. ``The candidates who have
articulated anything wildly different _ being very tough on China
or withdrawing international commitments _ they don't exist. I
think the differences between the (leading candidates) is on the
margins.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a fact that has been duly noted in capitals around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fair amount of difference in rhetoric,'' said a
foreign diplomat who has been closely monitoring the campaign.
``But each of the leading candidates would be a fine president from
our point of view. We don't have a foreign policy stake in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, stark differences on foreign policy and trade
exist within each party. Democrats and Republicans have fought
among themselves in Congress. But the divide is not playing out in
the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Trade-weary Democrats such as House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., decided against entering the campaign. On the
Republican side, the most outspoken voice against trade and
international involvement _ Pat Buchanan _ left the party, while
others like Bauer and Keyes have failed to use the issue to
generate much support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key difference may be experience,'' said McCain foreign
policy adviser Randy Scheunemann.
</P>
<P>
   Scheunemann cited McCain's military record, which includes 51/2
years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, his leadership in the Senate
on Mideast and Eastern Europe issues in the 1980s and his strong
support for U.S. military missions in Iraq and Kosovo during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, no one speaks with more ease about
defense issues than McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. Though he is an advocate of a strong military, McCain
has also said that at least $20 billion a year is wasted on defense
pork projects and could be wisely redirected.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was instrumental in helping Clinton resume diplomatic
ties with Vietnam and stood behind the United States' operation in
Kosovo, though he is quick to criticize the administration for
``strategic incoherence and self-doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, McCain says, he would place priority on a ``rogue
state rollback,'' arguing that the nation's central defense concern
no longer comes from Russia but from hostile forces in countries
like Iraq, North Korea and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foreign policy credentials have been questioned since the
beginning of his candidacy. His reference to Greeks as ``Grecians''
and Kosovars as ``Kosovarians'' didn't help, nor did his failure on
Boston's WHDH-TV in November to come up with the names for the
leaders of India, Pakistan or Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, while Gore, Bradley and McCain were all attending
to foreign affairs in the Senate, Bush was handling the affairs of
the Texas Rangers as the baseball club's managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has countered the perception of weakness by dedicating more
campaign time to foreign policy than anyone else in the race. He
has delivered two major addresses on foreign policy in the past
four months and has surrounded himself with top-name advisers
including former Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice, former
Secretaries of State George Shultz and Don Rumsfeld and former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches have warned against the ``walls of protectionism,''
yet he has also been sharply critical of the Clinton
administration's attempts to forge friendly relations with Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a competitor, not a strategic partner,'' Bush said in
a major foreign policy address last fall at the Reagan Library in
Simi Valley. ``We must deal with China without ill will _ but
without illusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also championed the idea of revamping the military to
face the new challenges of the 21st century, warning that many
military models are outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have a competitor on the battlefield,'' Rice
said in an interview last week. ``You would ideally be using this
time to plan and research for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley moved quickly from NBA stardom to become a protege of
renowned Democratic Sen. Scoop Jackson of Washington, traveling
frequently to what was then the Soviet Union and becoming an expert
on Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley calls the U.S. relationship with Russia a ``missed
opportunity,'' saying his top priority would be to reduce the
number of nuclear warheads. He criticizes the Clinton
administration, and by extension Gore, for placing too much
emphasis on a relationship with former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight years he served in the Senate with Gore, the
two voted together nearly 4 out of 5 times. But many of the most
significant disagreements involved defense matters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradley voted against funds for the B2 bomber, the
Seawolf submarine, the MX missile, and anti-ballistic missile
research _ all systems Gore supported. In 1991, Bradley voted to
cut the defense budget by 2 percent and transfer the money to
domestic programs. Gore voted no. Bradley also voted in favor of
base closings, which Gore opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is much more reminiscent of the '70s and '80s
Democratic liberals who were very adverse to seeing America use
force,'' said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy
Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank.
</P>
<P>
   But not every split is so predictably right-left. In 1985,
Bradley voted to give $100 million in nonmilitary aid to the
Contras opposing Nicaragua's Sandinista regime. Gore voted no.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-profile difference came in 1991, when Bradley voted
against the U.S. attack on Iraq, while Gore broke with most
Democrats and voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces the inherently awkward problem of trying to stake out
his own foreign policy identity while serving as first in the line
of succession to the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   His top credential is his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's got an actual record of effectiveness in foreign
affairs that goes way back,'' said a senior aide when asked what
distinguishes Gore from the rest of the field. ``If you drew a
column that had Gore's foreign policy accomplishments on one side
and the competition elsewhere, their column would be empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been instrumental in developing U.S. foreign policy,
particularly in Russia. His relationship with former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin was considered crucial in the negotiations that
ended the conflict in Kosovo earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's supporters call him a visionary, scoping
out ground as a junior member of the House in the 1980s on matters
ranging from arms control to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in space. His
detractors say his emphasis on issues like global warming or
international strategies for ``reinventing government'' display a
disconnect to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Global issues could quickly emerge as a sleeping giant in the
campaign were an international crisis to arrive. Yet even if
foreign policy differences don't affect the election, the election
will clearly affect foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be hard pressed to say that any of these issues will
be decisive in the campaign,'' said Peter Feaver, a professor of
political science at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that the outcome won't have a serious impact
on our foreign policy,'' he said. ``The difference, say, between a
President Gore and a President Bush is more significant than meets
the eye.''

 DEMOS NASTY, REPUBLICANS A BIT MORE CIVIL IN LATEST DEBATES  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democratic presidential candidates clashed
bitterly over health care, voting records and campaign tactics
Wednesday night, while Republicans sparred over abortion, trade and
even the dignity of mosh pits.
</P>
<P>
   The final debates before next week's primary produced some of
the sharpest exchanges of the campaign, as Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush were accused by their chief rivals of
being beholden to special interests and conducting poll-driven
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I wonder whether, if you are running a campaign
that is saying untrue things, whether you'll be able to be a
president that people can trust,'' former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley said in an exchange that grew increasingly unfriendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Bill,'' Gore shot back, clearly annoyed by the intensity
of the attack, ``I haven't accused you of lying. If you feel that
you are defensive on the substance of an issue, then change your
plan. Don't shoot the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate among the leading Republican candidates lacked the
bitterness of the Gore-Bradley exchange. But Arizona Sen. John
McCain tried to make the same point as Bradley _ that the GOP
front-runner represents monied interests and politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Bush's assertion that McCain's budget plans sound
like Gore's, McCain shot back: ``If you're saying that I'm like Al
Gore, then you're spinning like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain have placed enormous emphasis on New
Hampshire. Most strategists agree that this state, with its fierce
contrarian streak and distaste for slick politics, gives the two
candidates their best, and perhaps their only, shot to slow the
front-runners' momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The debates, held 30 minutes apart in the same downtown
Manchester television studio, came six days before the nation's
first primary and just as Granite State voters are becoming fully
engaged in the close race.
</P>
<P>
   With as much of a quarter of the electorate still undecided, the
last week of campaigning will be crucial in each contest, which
polls suggest are too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back format also offered a rare glimpse into the
differences between the two parties, providing a preview of the
fall campaign, in which divisions on the issues will be more
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans repeatedly returned to social issues and
offered private-sector solutions on matters ranging from trips to
Mars to the distribution of computers to the poor, Democrats
offered government initiatives to address health care and education
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most surreal moment came when GOP candidate Gary
Bauer questioned rival Alan Keyes about his jumping into a mosh pit
earlier this week after a rally, as supporters passed him hand over
hand to the sound of blaring rock 'n' roll music.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding Keyes that he had previously criticized McCain for
joking about the senator's fondness for the band ``Nine Inch
Nails,'' Bauer, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan, asked
Keyes how he could be so blase as his supporters played the music
of the band Rage Against the Machine, which Bauer branded as
``anti-family (and mispronounced as Machine against the Rage.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think you owe an apology? Do you think that was
consistent with the dignity of the office of the presidency?''
Bauer demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a former State Department official who describes himself
as the only true conservative in the race, said, ``I'll leave that
to the judgment of the American people,'' though he added that one
reporter noted that Keyes was the only person the reporter had ever
seen emerge from a mosh pit with his tie still straight.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that exchange, which drew uproarious howls from the
adjoining press areas, Republicans battled on familiar turf: who
was most committed to abortion, who was hardest on China, and
whether Bush had been an effective governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood up to a pointed attack by Forbes about his record on
education and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many half-stories, so little time,'' he sighed, pointing
out that he was re-elected by the people of Texas with more than 70
percent of the vote. Exuding a combination of confidence and
caution throughout the debate, Bush also alluded to his
electability, mentioning that Texas carries a huge electoral punch.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes pressed McCain on his commitment to ban abortions, asking
McCain why he had said that if his daughter was raped, it would be
a family decision whether she got an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is opposed to legal abortion except in the case of rape,
incest or when a woman's health is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   McCain calmly said he was proud of his pro-life record, before
sternly adding that ``I will not draw my children into this
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly angered by the question, McCain returned to the point
more than an hour later, turning to Keyes and saying: ``I've seen
enough killing in my life. I know how precious human life is. And I
don't need a lecture from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes was repeatedly attacked for his pro-trade
stance by both Keyes and Bauer, who seemed intent on derailing
Forbes' momentum from his second-place finish in the Iowa caucus
and his assertion that he is the most viable social conservative in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the tightness of the Democratic race, the debate
between Gore and Bradley evolved into a meandering tit-for-tat, as
both candidates appeared rattled, off their game, and annoyed with
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Gore questioned Bradley about his votes against welfare reform,
and for the budget cuts proposed by Reagan in the early 1980s,
asking Bradley at one point: ``I just don't see how you can vote
for Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, and then campaign like Robert
Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley questioned Gore's liberal credentials, asking why he had
cast votes against federal funding of abortions as a member of the
House 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the most bitter exchange erupted over a longstanding debate
over health care plans. Bradley favors replacing Medicaid with a
government subsidy that would guarantee health insurance for 95
percent of all Americans. Gore favors retaining Medicaid and has
offered a more limited proposal to insure health care for all
children.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the debate, Gore charged that Bradley's plan would
leave New Hampshire residents ``out in the cold.'' He later accused
Bradley of using dirty campaign tactics in distributing a flyer in
November that accused Gore of dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about a higher standard, you need to abide
by it,'' Gore said. The barbs appeared to get under Bradley's skin.
Tensing up, Bradley said: ``In politics, people sometimes make
misleading statements because they don't know better. But you know
better. You know better.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, neither shook the other's hand. Gore shunned
the press area where the GOP candidates had appeared after their
debate. Bradley came out and made a terse statement, saying the
event was ``a debate of old politics versus new politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He left without taking any questions.

 &HT;    Tragedy hits home for St. Louis family, Rams LB
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Gutweiler slipped into bed early that night.
</P>
<P>
   He had to get up at 4 a.m. the next morning for his job
delivering magazines to stores in St. Louis. So the plan was for
his wife, Susan, to pick up Michael, their 16-year-old son, after
he got out of a concert.
</P>
<P>
   He kissed her good-night and told her the same thing he had been
saying for 31 years, ever since that night when he proposed at the
drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he casually added something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see you later.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the phone rang. It was Michael. His mother
hadn't shown up. Bill Gutweiler hopped in his car. He drove until
he saw the flashing lights. And the crumpled Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   That was Oct. 19, 1998. But sometimes it feels like it was
yesterday. Especially this week. Especially when he turns on the TV
and sees the face of the young man who killed his wife _ St. Louis
Rams linebacker Leonard Little.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know why you shouldn't drink and drive?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to a 54-year-old man in St. Louis. Listen to him describe
how for the past 15 months, he hasn't been able to slip back into
in that bed. Their bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried it two nights,'' he said. ``I made it through one
full night once. But usually I'm back on the couch, under the
afghan. I just can't stay in that bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to this man. But also talk to a 25-year-old football player
in Atlanta. People say he got off easy. And to some extent that's
certainly true. He is alive. He has many things to look forward to
_ including a place in Super Bowl XXXIV on Sunday at the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no such thing as easy in stories like this.
</P>
<P>
   There are only degrees of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Little trudged into the ballroom Wednesday morning and
took a seat at the table with a sign bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters were waiting, camped out at his table. It wasn't
because he is a star. He is primarily a special teams player. He
made six tackles this season.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons the crowd gathered was because Little was even here.
Plain and simple. Fifteen months after celebrating his 24th
birthday by taking part in a Celebrity Waiters Night at a bar in
the Adam's Mark Hotel, after getting in his sports utility vehicle,
after running a red light and killing a 47-year-old woman, he was
sitting in the lobby of an expensive hotel and preparing to play in
the most celebrated sports event in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Little eventually pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He
was sentenced to spend 90 nights in jail. And although that might
sound like preferential treatment for an athlete, it actually is
pretty standard in Missouri for this crime _ which is why in
November, Mothers Against Drunk Driving held a rally to coincide
with his return after an NFL eight-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is eight enough? St. Louis, it's time to get MADD,'' said one
banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard Little got too LITTLE and I'm MADD,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   The group gathered at the corner of Market Street and Memorial
Drive _ the place where Little plowed into Gutweiler's car _ and
marched to the Trans World Dome. Little said he supported them.
Said they were doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   He had just celebrated another birthday. Spent it at home. Cut
off the phones. Watched television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever do anything on my birthday again,'' he
said. ``Ever. Never. I can honestly say that.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that for two months, he didn't stop crying. He says he
stopped eating. He says he went from 245 pounds to 210. He says
that if there is one thing in his life he could change, it would be
getting in his truck that night.
</P>
<P>
   He says this again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it changes anything. Not for him. And certainly not for
Bill Gutweiler.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up in the same neighborhood in South St. Louis. She
lived two doors down on Indiana Street. He still remembers what
they ate on their first date.
</P>
<P>
   Imo's pizza. Thin crust. Sausage and hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked sausage; she liked hamburger,'' Gutweiler explained
Wednesday from their home in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   He raced motorcycles back in those days. But he eventually sold
his bike so he could buy something more important. An engagement
ring.
</P>
<P>
   When he popped the question and she said yes, they quickly
eloped. Her father wasn't thrilled. She was only 16. He was 21. So
everyone figured it was a mistake. Figured it wouldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they were together 31 years. Until Leonard Little separated
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gutweiler already had lost a brother, Tim, in a car accident.
And in 1980, he and Susan lost their daughter, Jill, then 7 years
old, when she ran out in front of a car driven by a 16-year old.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't go in Jill's bedroom after that. Sue had to handle
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always the strongest,'' he said. ``She was the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the one who made him stop smoking. She saved the butt
from the last cigarette that he smoked. He stumbled upon that not
too long ago. Just another thing to make him cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried so much at the beginning,'' he said. ``Now the sadness
just comes over me sometimes, like a sickness. I'll be sitting
there, thinking about something and I'll pick up one of our albums
and start going through it and I'll start crying all over again.''
There are so many things that can make him think of her. It can be
something as simple as a song by the Moody Blues. Or the sight of
their son walking out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep myself from getting mad at him,'' he said.
``Even when I am, I just keep thinking that he's all I have left. I
can't stop thinking about the chance that I could lose him.''
</P>
<P>
   He also can't stop thinking about what happened on Oct. 19,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   One night, he tried to retrace Little's path. The police report
said he was going 46 mph. So Gutweiler floored it until he reached
46 mph when he went through the green light at the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that he didn't even touch the brake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Little grew up in Asheville, N.C. His mother was a
Cowboys fan. He remembers her making him watch a Super Bowl. He
doesn't remember which one it was, just that the Cowboys were
involved _ and that one day he wanted to play in one.
</P>
<P>
   He went to University of Tennessee. Became an All-American. Was
drafted in the third round. Ended up in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every child's dream to play at the Super Bowl,'' he said.
``Growing up, you always want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this isn't how he envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, while his teammates answered questions about
stopping Tennessee's Steve McNair and Eddie George, he was being
asked: Do you think the Rams should trade you? Do you think you
should be able to play in this game? Have you talked to the family
of Susan Gutweiler? What would you say?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tough,'' he said, rubbing his eyes. ``That's a tough
question.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained he wants to say something to the family, that he
hopes to set up a meeting after the season. When asked if football
is an escape, he shook his head. He said that nothing is an escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there was an awkward silence at the table, allowing
everyone sitting there to hear what a reporter nearby was asking a
teammate: Do you think it's right that Leonard Little is even in
uniform?
</P>
<P>
   Little's eyes began to tear up. He started to stand up to leave.
A Rams public relations official, William Bryant, put an arm on his
shoulder. He sat back down, closed his eyes for a moment, then
answered some more questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always going to be there,'' he said. ``It's never going
to leave. It's something I'll deal with for the rest of my life.
Time heals a lot of things. Time has helped me out. But it's always
going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the interview session ended. His teammates left the
room in bunches, laughing and smiling. He left by himself.
</P>
<P>
   At first, on those rare occasions when he could sleep, Gutweiler
had these dreams. He was in a room with Little. He was pounding on
him with his fists. Beating him to death.
</P>
<P>
   Now his anger seems to have shifted. Some of it still is
directed at Little. He wonders why he didn't say anything at the
trial; why he hasn't met with the family yet. But more than
anything he seems to be mad at the legal system. Mad at the Rams
for not trading Little. And mad at Rams coach Dick Vermeil for
defending the player who killed his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell Dick Vermeil a little bit about crying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes what has happened in the last month even
harder. The rest of the city of St. Louis is giddy with excitement.
Everywhere you turn there are Rams jerseys, Rams signs, Rams
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Every one is a reminder of his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   So now there is this. A Super Bowl game. Gutweiler isn't sure if
he will try to watch. Isn't sure if he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole town is going crazy,'' he said. ``I really feel
kind of alone.''

HE PUT THE GRAND INTO SLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was John Donald Budge on the birth certificate but became
known across the globe as Mr. Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   A congenial, willowy 6-foot-1-inch son of a Scottish immigrant,
reared in a modest Oakland family, Don Budge would feel the
grateful rain of a 1937 ticker-tape parade in New York, saluting
him for rescuing the Davis Cup and bringing it home to America
after a decade abroad in French and English possession.
</P>
<P>
   Few champions at tennis or anything else were as lionized as he,
and the following year he set out to do the undone: winning the
four major championships, Australian, French, Wimbledon and US,
within a calendar year. He put together the quintessential
quadrilateral that would be entitled the Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Budge, who shook their hands to congratulate merely four others
successfully following his extraordinarily challenging route, died
Thursday of cardiac arrest in Scranton, Pa. He was 84. Budge was
seriously injured Dec. 14 in northeastern Pennsylvania when he
apparently lost control of the car he was driving and it went off
the road. He was hospitalized in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., until Jan. 8,
when he was transferred to a nursing home in Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Budge dined out a long time on his Grand Slam, later emulated by
Maureen Connolly in 1953, Rod Laver in 1962 and 1969, Margaret
Smith Court in 1970, and Steffi Graf in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Budge's oft-repeated line whenever he was honored: ``I'm glad to
be here today. I'm glad to be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He was everywhere during an amateur and pro career that spanned
20 years and left him remembered as a giant, listed on every
all-time top 10 list published. As a self-effacing righthander with
all the shots in his grasp, he was particularly fearsome with a
booming backhand that stands as an historic superweapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That damn backhand down the line broke my back,'' lauded
Ellsworth Vines, a fellow member of the International Tennis Hall
of Fame whom Budge supplanted as the pro boss in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Immaculate in flaming strokemaking and appearance, his bright
red hair crowning a limber form draped in tailored flannel
trousers, Budge made the US top 10 at No. 9 in 1934. He was 19, on
his way to world No. 1 three years later. He might have gotten
there in 1936 had he been able to cash either of his match points
against Fred Perry in the US final. But after that, as Perry joined
the pro tour, the globe was Don's tennis ball for five sensational
years. He ruled the amateurs in 1937-38, then the pro odyssey of
one-nighters for the next three years until World War II shut down
international tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A shoulder injury suffered on Air Force duty reduced his
effectiveness after the war. Though he narrowly relinquished his
pro crown to Bobby Riggs, 23-21, in a coast-to-coast head-to-head
series, Budge remained an attraction, winning the US Pro tournament
twice, losing the final four times, the last at age 38 to Pancho
Gonzalez in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the last six majors he entered, starting with Wimbledon
'37, Budge seemed left with no new worlds to conquer after the
brilliant 1937 campaign that included his most renowned victory.
Budge's stirring five-set revival against German Gottfried von
Cramm, 6-8, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 8-6, on Wimbledon's Centre Court assured
the US of prying loose the Davis Cup that the French seized in
America in 1927, and the British had held since 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Budge had beaten the stylish nobleman, Baron von Cramm, for the
Wimbledon title on the same lawn only two weeks before in straight
sets. But von Cramm, playing for the fatherland was renewed (even
though he detested the Nazi dictator, Hitler, and refused to join
the party).
</P>
<P>
   Budge liked to revisit that day. ``Henner Henkel beat Bitsy
Grant to make it 2-2, and as Gottfried and I were leaving the
dressing room, heading for the court for the deciding match, he was
called to the phone. All I could hear him saying was, `Jah, mein
fuhrer . . . jah, mein fuhrer . . .' He said it was Hitler.
Probably ordering him to win. Gottfried was pale, serious. He
played as if his life depended on it, and got a great start.''
</P>
<P>
   Don caught him at 2-sets-all, but von Cramm spurted ahead again,
4-1 in the fifth. Gene Mako, Budge's good friend and cannily
supportive doubles partner (they won US titles at Longwood in 1936
and 1938), remembers the afternoon well. ``A wonderful match. Of
course Don was in trouble at 1-4. But it was one break and I felt
he'd do it. Don was so stubborn in everything he did, and it
usually paid off in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Budge caught up again to 4-4, cracked von Cramm's serve to 7-6,
but couldn't serve it out through an electrifying passage. The
German erased five match points as the neutral crowd went bonkers.
On the sixth, Budge related, ``I never saw it. Gottfried hit a
sharply-angled crosscourt forehand, and I tore after it. I threw
myself at the ball and landed on my face. But I could tell from the
crowd that I'd hit a winner. That really meant the Cup because both
we and the Germans were favored over the holder, Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, back on Centre, Budge &AMP; Co. made it official,
4-1 over the home team. A Budge-von Cramm rematch at Forest Hills
resulted in Don's first US singles title. He was voted athlete of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   And another conquest formed in his mind. ``I was the best
player, but I needed a goal, an incentive for one more amateur
year. I decided to try to win the big four titles. Nobody had done
it in one year, although Jack Crawford came close in '33, losing
the US final after winning the Australian, French and Wimbledon.
The only person I told was Mako. I didn't want the pressure that
would come from announcing it ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1938 was relatively short since amateur tennis in those
pre-open times was primarily a summer diversion. Budge won six of
eight tournaments, 43 of 45 matches including those over Aussies
John Bromwich and Adrian Quist as the US kept the Cup. Only after
winning the US again did his two-year streak of 14 tournaments and
92 matches end at the hands of Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Mako says, ``I saw all his matches and nobody came close _
including me in the last one at Forest Hills, although I won one of
the four sets he lost. But it wasn't called a Grand Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That came later,'' Budge said. ``Allison Danzig, the New York
Times writer, picked up on a phrase used by their columnist John
Kieran, when Crawford was trying to make it. Kieran said it would
be like a grand slam in bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mako feels Budge's ``greatness stemmed from the fact that he
took the ball so early and hit it so hard. Opponents were always
back on their heels from his groundstrokes or potent serve. Don't
forget he's the only man to score three major triples _ singles,
doubles and mixed _ Wimbledon in '37-38, the US in '38.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically it was another car crash that Budge felt ``luckiest''
about. ``Just before departing for Australia in '38,'' he recalled,
``I fell asleep at the wheel, went into a culvert and totaled my
Packard. It rolled over several times. When they got me out I had
only slightly sprained my wrists. I was lucky not to be killed.
There was nearly no Grand Slam before it even started.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: JUST WHO IS AT THE U.N. HELM(S)?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 30
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imagine the fire storm that would occur if a
hard-line member of the Russian Duma, where the communists control
160 of 450 seats, were to come before the U.N. Security Council to
denounce the United States and extol the virtues of the former
Stalin era.
</P>
<P>
   No such great outcry was heard the other day after a hard-line
member of the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans control 55 of 100
seats, denounced the United Nations to its face and extolled the
virtues of the former Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Helms' highly confrontational debut before the Security
Council raised two issues.
</P>
<P>
   One: did the novel bid to the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee to play U.N. diplomat for a day muddle a
constitutional system that puts foreign policy burdens squarely in
presidential hands? Two: did what the North Carolina senator have
to say in that planetary chamber make any sense?
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke used his month-long leverage
as the council's rotating president to prepare the way for Helms'
unique diplomatic perch. While Holbrooke dreams of one day
succeeding Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he knows that, no
matter what, the Senate will probably remain in Republican hands
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by several key Democratic senators, Albright was obliged
to take the same chair as Helms had sat in a week earlier to
respond to his sweeping attack. ``So let me be clear,'' she said.
``Only the president and the executive branch can speak for the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that once again the Clinton administration has
been caught trying to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   In his unprecedented turn at bat, Helms scored brownie points
when he noted that the United States _ branded by many in that
chamber as a deadbeat bent on bankrupting the world body _ had
funneled $1.4 billion in 1999 to the U.N., plus another $8.8
billion in Pentagon funds ``to support various U.N. resolutions and
peacekeeping operations around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Helms went over the top when he raised his main beef:
Americans, as he put it, see ``the United Nations aspiring to
establish itself the central authority of a new international order
of global laws and global governance.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, judging by the talk show circuit, which Helms once
rode, the senator enjoys some company in harboring such beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   An unbeliever is Britain's Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who reminded
the crusty Helms that ``the United Nations is not a separate organ
to which we turn, like a fire service.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the ambassador added, ``it is the member states, and the
United States owns 25 percent of the power and the resources of the
United Nations. What it does well, the U.S. gets credit for. What
it does badly, the U.S. must bear some responsibility for.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke had done well in arranging for a picture-taking
session for Helms and his family with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan. But the extraordinary event that followed the snapshots
turned out badly as yet another ordinary embarrassment for the
Clinton White House and its befuddled diplomatic minions.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Iowa's religious right 53, Bush 41
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The religious right was declared politically dead last year but
_ the mummy walks!
</P>
<P>
   That was the news from the Iowa caucuses, not the fact that
Republican front-runner George W. Bush and Democratic front-runner
Al Gore ran in front.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Iowa plurality was solid, but even so he lost to his
party's cultural and religious right. Steve Forbes's 30 percent,
Alan Keyes's 14 and Gary Bauer's 9 added up to 53 percent to Bush's
41.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council, came to
the campaign straight from the family-values right.
Hellfire-and-brimstone Keyes is more preacher than politician.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes broke into presidential politics four years ago with a
bottomless checkbook and a faddish pitch for a flat income tax. But
where he pooh-poohed abortion as an issue last time, this time he
has worked the anti-abortion fence line hardest. His flat tax has
gone the way of other aging panaceas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is in no big numbers trouble from Iowa. His
immediate, and serious, challenge is from maverick John McCain in
New Hampshire. But Iowa gives Bush a potentially major political
headache for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a la Bob Dole in '96, the putative GOP nominee has
to prove himself to his party's rightward fringe before then
turning to general-election voters and trying to convince them he's
not a captive of the very forces he has just been kowtowing to.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to happen this way.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to outfit Bush with pre-emptive money, gather the
party's establishment to him early and persuade activist
conservatives that any conservative Republican president _ and Bush
would be one, despite occasional moderate gestures _ is preferable
to any archconservative Republican loser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then could skip the ideological issues that are fingernails
on a blackboard to middle-ground voters.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario was abetted by an organizational slump in the
religious right. The animating Christian Coalition lost its boy
wonder, Ralph Reed, to private political consulting. The outfit
lapsed to televangelist Pat Robertson, who promptly made a hash of
it and into the bargain has bought into Bush's go-with-a-winner
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But like his father before him, this Bush, too, has never been
quite trusted by the most adamant cultural and religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's outcome signals that that's especially so at the
grassroots, even though Bush first swore by Jesus and then, late in
Iowa, emphasized his anti-abortion militance, even to the point of
stopping just a rhetorical hair short of promising to appoint
Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural and religious right voters are generally accounted 20
percent of the national GOP electorate, as much as 40 percent of
the Iowa GOP. The outsized right-wing muster for the most
ideological candidates in Iowa's caucuses suggests Bush has not
fully convinced the religious and cultural right of his bona fides,
at least not yet.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Elian Gonzalez and the Cuban kaleidoscope
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While you were enthralled (or revolted) by the Elian
Gonzalez circus, a comparable news item drew scant attention. It
was out of Havana and happened on the very day that Elian's
grandmothers flew back to Miami for a meeting with the 6-year-old
pawn of a 41-year-old Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Havana ``detained'' four opposition figures for
several hours before releasing them with a warning against trying
to form a movement. About 18 persons were supposed to meet at a
Havana home with the intent of organizing. The arrests pre-empted
the meeting and were another indication of Fidel Castro's
unwillingness to tolerate any dissent. These were not militant
counter-revolutionaries; they represented, instead, feminists,
laborites and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the Florida Straits, one of the grandmothers
was caught trying to slip a cellular phone into the room where she
met with Elian, ostensibly to have the child talk with his father
out of hearing of the Miami relatives, an opportunity not afforded
by the INS mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's people apparently demand free speech in the U.S. but
not in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the Elian ordeal, the two grandmothers _ one dour and
stoic, the other an aggressive shoe pounder _ have become TV
celebrities, given time on the morning network shows and elsewhere
to plead their case. It is not an unjust thing they seek, the
reconciliation between father and son.
</P>
<P>
   But they have been orchestrated, as are the Miami people who
have Elian. The 21-year-old cousin who stays close to Elian and the
Cuban paternal grandmother have perfected the art of weeping on cue
not seen since the last June Allyson film.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is so much about Elian Gonzalez as it is about
politics. I do believe the Cubans involved _ both in the U.S. and
Cuba _ could wage a similar brawl over possession of a cocker
spaniel.
</P>
<P>
   What is real and what is imagined do not matter in this case.
The Miami Cubans, dead set against lifting the economic boycott of
Cuba while electing local, state and national officials solely on
the basis of their anti-Castroism, would have us believe that Cuba
is a place only to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thousands of them return to the island each year, bringing
with them goods and money that, whether they care to admit it or
not, enriches the treasury of the communist state. With a special
dispensation not given to others, our government allows them to
traffic with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When they go to the island, there is not any of the discord we
see in the Elian Gonzalez proceeding. They have reunions; they hug,
they kiss, they give money, they sit down to dinner together.
</P>
<P>
   This is what is so puzzling about the familial standoff of the
past few days, the negative passions between a family straddling
the straits.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of the American people strongly favor returning the child
to his father, based simply on a law that sets the rules for who
speaks for a minor.
</P>
<P>
   That is the central theme in this case. Strip away the drama,
the chicanery, the tragedy of the situation and what you have is an
ideological struggle: She won't do this, he won't do that,
anti-Castroites are in the house next door, there's a Cuban
Interest Section man hiding in the plane, the nun is anti-embargo,
the nun favors the exiles _ every bit of bilge and drivel possible.
</P>
<P>
   Little Elian could become a U.S. citizen or he could be shipped
back to Cuba. That really won't change anything. The icy
relationship between the U.S. and Cuba will continue because
there's always something to be ``icy'' about.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to get the feeling that Americans outside of South
Florida really don't care about it anymore. They just want all this
to end _ so we can get on to those charming presidential races.

 &HT;    To the rescue: Saving a mouse bound for my cat's mouth
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My cats have turned into killers, sparked
no doubt by the influence of La Nina, which has turned January here
behind the Pine Curtain into an early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Critters that normally would have hunkered down for the winter
are out in force, giving the cats ample opportunity to bring home
fresh kill nearly every night.
</P>
<P>
   Their fare consists mainly of big bugs and small field mice
caught in the woods next door, the eviscerated carcasses deposited
for our viewing pleasure on the door mat. Every once in a while,
Otto, the 15-pound tomcat, will catch a genuine rat, which causes
considerable consternation, this not being a household overly fond
of rats.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Christmas holidays, with a houseful of children (our
home serves as a central sleepover point for much of the city's
male teen population and a sizable number of the female pre-teens),
Otto slipped in the back door with a rat in his mouth. I was dozing
in the recliner and dreaming about getting the correct final answer
on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' when there arose such a
clatter, as the Christmas poem goes.
</P>
<P>
   Children were whooping, hollering, and standing on chairs as
Otto looked for a place to light and enjoy some rodent tartare.
Luckily I was able to herd him out of the house, rat still clamped
between his jaws. Since then, both cats get a thorough inspection
to make sure there isn't an animal between their whiskers before
being allowed back inside.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Otto deposited his kill on the mat in the garage,
and I stepped square on it in my stocking feet while leaving for a
dinner with some company colleagues. Talk about doing some fast
high-stepping. There is nothing like stepping on a dead rat to ruin
one's appetite. I don't leave my shoes in the garage anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The cats usually kill field mice, which don't harm anything and
don't deserve to die, but you can't stop a cat from trying to kill
a mouse or a bird, so I put up with it, grateful that odds are
great no pink-tailed little rodent will ever attempt to take up
residence inside the house with the killer cats on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's before I read ``The Green Mile'' by Stephen King last
week. The film version just came out, which means I'll get to see
it in a year or so when it goes to video. The book is about an
extraordinary man on Death Row, the guards who eventually come to
admire and respect him _ and a little mouse called Mr. Jingles. Mr.
Jingles becomes the pet of one of the condemned prisoners and
learns to fetch and do other dog-type tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Without revealing the plot for those who plan to see the movie
or read the book, Mr. Jingles is a pretty special mouse. I finished
reading the book while sitting on the back porch the other night.
Not long after, Kiki, the Siamese step-cat, showed up, playing
Great White Hunter, stalking something in the grass, batting it
around, letting it loose, then starting all over. You know, cat
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it was a tiny field mouse who managed to get free
from Kiki, a cat that is, shall we say, developmentally challenged
and bred a tad too fine somewhere down the line. The mouse
scampered onto the porch and hid in the corner while Kiki looked
unsuccessfully some 10 feet away in the rose bushes. Kiki would
starve if it wasn't for a bowl of Little Friskies each day.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about Mr. Jingles, rolling his spool with his nose
back to the prisoner, warming the hearts of men previously thought
to have no hearts. While the step-cat continued to flail around in
the roses, I grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to catch the mouse,
which was about the size of a hairball.
</P>
<P>
   Fast, though. Unaware of my intentions, the mouse darted this
way and that, until settling in under the barbecue pit where I
couldn't reach him. By this time, Otto had shown up, which means
the mouse's minutes were numbered. Otto is a big, fast cat, who
survived on the streets for several years until taking up with me.
This Mr. Jingles lookalike would be no more than an hors d'oeuvre
for Otto.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse kept squeaking, barely audible to me but music to
Otto's ears. Kiki, of course, was still searching in the rose
bushes. Finally, the mouse made a desperate dash for the back yard
and freedom, and I made a lucky snag, grabbing up the mouse in a
leather-enclosed hand. Otto sniffed and walked off, Kiki looked
confused, and I took the mouse back to the woods and set it free.
He squeaked as I tossed him into the brush as if to say, ``Thanks,
buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   That was my good deed for the day, saving a mouse. Let's hope he
doesn't tell his larger brethren about the kind-hearted fool in the
brick house next to the woods. I won't be so tolerant of rats.

 &HT;    A sight for sore eyes
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ There's a TV commercial that's asks the
question, ``What would the you of 20 years ago think of the you of
today?'' Although the commercial is designed to sell a sporty car,
I think the me of 1980 would have more pressing issues to discuss
than what kind of car I'm driving today.
</P>
<P>
   If the 25-year-old me ran into the 45-year-old me, it might go
something like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Lord, I didn't know we could put on so much weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has Grecian Formula been outlawed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least our eyes have held up, I see we're not wearing
bifocals yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While the extra pounds and a bit more salt among the pepper are
things I could do something about if I had the mind to, I've always
considered bifocals as the unavoidable sign of aging. But what the
younger me wouldn't know is that in the past 20 years, there have
been great strides in the field of vision. Today, instead of old
fashioned bifocals, I wear new fashioned multifocus lenses.
Invisible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   I've worn glasses since the seventh grade, but up until about
five years ago, my eyesight had changed little. Almost to the
minute I blew out the candles on my 40th birthday cake, my eyes _
blinded by the light _ have never been the same.
</P>
<P>
   I was visiting the other day with a friend I've known almost my
entire life, who also has made the leap to secret bifocals and we
were comparing notes on how we had adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of taking her glasses off to read, my friend merely
has to tilt her head back like a bird taking a drink to see
clearly. And walking has become a new experience what with the
ground now a fuzzy haze.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said it is not the prospect of death that we can't deal
with. We all know we're going to die. It's growing old that comes
as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen the future and it is blurry.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the 2000 model of me has some miles on the
odometer, the younger me would no doubt be impressed with the car
I'm driving. It's a sporty red convertible designed to draw
attention away from the heavy, gray, visually impaired driver.

 &HT;    Hutchison challenger faces tough road
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For Republican true believers, Kay Bailey
Hutchison's U.S. Senate re-election race this year could be called
Snow White and the Five Dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year incumbent Hutchison, a favorite of the oil-and-gas
crowd, started the year with $6 million in the bank and the ability
to bring in additional money gushers if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The five angling for the Democratic nomination are perennial but
never-successful candidate Gene Kelly _ not the movie dancer _ of
Universal City; H. Gerald Bintliff, a retired American Airlines
clerk from Leonard, northeast of Dallas; Don Clark, a business
manager from Mesquite; Bobby Wightman-Cervantes, a Dallas lawyer
who sought office unsuccessfully as a Republican; and former state
Rep. Charles Gandy of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Because the only one who has held office is Gandy _ who jokes
that he may call himself Charles ``Fred Astaire'' Gandy after
another movie dancer _ we asked why he'd sign up for what seems a
suicide mission against Hutchison and her cash.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, Gandy said. The money she's attracted from special
interests made him feel he couldn't just sit on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The influence of money on politics today has created a corrupt
system that I think needs to be changed, and I don't think Kay
Bailey Hutchison is going to do anything to change it,'' Gandy
said. ``I'm sure Mrs. Hutchison is a fine individual. But if she
spent every day last year raising money, she had to raise $16,000 a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's time not spent dealing with health care, urban gridlock
and other problems, Gandy said. If elected, he'd vote for the
McCain-Feingold bill to cut down on special-interest
money.Hutchison opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy, 41, who said he makes a passable middle-class income as a
``livable communities consultant,'' was elected to the Texas House
of Representatives in 1982 from Mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it didn't last long. In 1984, Gandy was un-elected _
defeated by Republican Bill Blackwood during the Ronald Reagan
re-election landslide that beset several Dallas County Democrats
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy's proudest legislative accomplishment was sponsoring
passage of child safety-seat legislation. But his former colleagues
remember him best as the guy who took the rap for arranging a
Strip-O-Gram just outside the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy, 22 at the time, and several other colleagues chipped in
to help observe the birthday of Rep. David Patronella (D-Houston).
Patronella was slammed into a chair set outside the chamber where
the lobbyists gather. Then the stripper appeared, turned on her
boombox and got to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley says she was just supposed to take off her gloves,''
said one former state representative, who would only discuss the
event if his name was withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't stop there at all. She took her dress off. She had
on thong underwear and a bra, and she took her bra off _ just as 60
senior citizens came down the staircase. The pictures went out on
the AP wire. I think our approval rating went to an all-time low.''
</P>
<P>
   Gandy admits it wasn't the finest beginning for a freshman
legislator _ and says if he had it to over again, he wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   So, Gandy got to start a new career. He consults with cities in
several states, helping to find ways to reduce gridlock, to create
communities ``that are healthy for raising kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cities, Gandy said, ``there are traffic jams around
every elementary school because parents are afraid'' to let their
children walk or bike to school.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy, who was director of advocacy programs for the Bicycle
Federation of America, helped push successful efforts to get a
percentage of federal and state transportation money earmarked for
bicycle and pedestrian paths, rail and other means of reducing
traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a very popular program around the state with
mayors and county officials and legislators,'' Gandy said.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy also had the idea years ago to hold a North vs. South
Austin tug-of-war, spanning Town Lake, to raise money for a youth
hostel. With the help of Austin American-Statesman columnist John
Kelso and others, it raised $20,000, Gandy said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to use the Internet and e-mail, plus travel the state
and meet real people _ ``a combination of high-tech and
high-touch,'' Gandy said. A few days after announcing Jan. 1, Gandy
said he'd already contacted 20,000 people through the Internet and
raised more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has vacuumed up the special-interest money,'' Gandy said
of Hutchison. ``The money I'm getting is from people who think the
system is corrupt and needs to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison doesn't seem worried.

 &HT;    One way to empathy is to see others at lower altitudes
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``You have the same profile today as when you were
tiny,'' my wife said the other day to our 17-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She's right, and was expressing something that occurs to most
parents as they realize their children have sprung skyward.
</P>
<P>
   He does have the same profile: That abrupt chin. That
beginner's-slope nose. That all-business brow. Truly, it is a face
unchanged, though everything else has changed. That once-squat
torso is long and rubberized. Those long legs _ from where did they
spring?
</P>
<P>
   The legs are what really distort. Take them away and he's still
a little boy. Any parent of a teen does this deconstruction on a
regular basis. We take away those legs to remind ourselves our
child is still a youngster, a kid in a mostly grown-up body.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally you tense up to see a stranger _ a fidgeting body
of maybe 6 feet in height. Then follow the bean pole to the top and
see a most childlike head. Take away the legs and you've got a
fourth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   When you do that _ when you subtract the long legs _ you
immediately are inclined to ease up, give the child a degree of
slack for being childish.
</P>
<P>
   We all get angry at little children. But it's hard to be angry
at them for long. I've been visiting grade-schoolers for many years
at a local school. I can honestly say that of those children, a
couple hundred of them at least, only three or four fried my bacon.
Only three or four would have me tensed-up to see on the street or
approaching them with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   That's because I viewed them all as they were _ children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons why we have loyalty to next-of-kin or
longtime friends, even when they do something stupid, yes even
illegal, is that we ``knew them when.'' We've known them from a
vantage point others don't possess.
</P>
<P>
   That element of human nature ought to help us perceive strangers
or potential combatants. The fact is, seeing people with empathy is
nothing more than a simple math exercise: Subtract legs.
</P>
<P>
   This in mind, returning back to work from a recent school visit,
I tried the equation on what could have been an annoyance. A truck
driver was walking across to his rig on the road I was traveling,
walking much more slowly than the prudent person would do as
vehicles came upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blasting him with the horn or ruffling his pate with
my chrome, I imagined him with grade-schooler legs, and saw a kid
crossing the street. It was easy. And it worked. I eased off.
</P>
<P>
   It would work in all sorts of situations.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that empathy of this sort doesn't always work.
Sometimes it can't work. That's particularly the case when people
in authority are acting like children _ like Rep. Bob Barr or Rep.
Tom DeLay when they are chasing the president with sticks and Silly
String, or like the president when he's caught chasing ...
</P>
<P>
   When one lowers one's self voluntarily, it's hard for a
bystander to lower that person any further for empathy's sake.
(``Not a leg to stand on.'') Taking the legs from that already
lowered authority figure reduces him to a head of hair scurrying
along the ground, an object of empathy, maybe, to a squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, though, the formula of seeing someone,
particularly a stranger or a teen, as the child he or she once was
is a great way to attain a sense of commonality. This particularly
ought to get one past prejudices against people of different colors
and different faiths. They were all children once. Like you.
</P>
<P>
   I'll forgive my boys for a lot not just because they're my own
but because I've watched them grow, because we've been through a
lot together, because we share so much. In essence that should hold
for all in the family of man

 &HT;    Traveling abroad or close to home key honeymoon choice
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For young couples these days, taking the plunge
can mean more than getting hitched. The trend of newlyweds
incorporating adventure and experience into their honeymoons could
even include taking a spin in a real-life submarine for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a submarine coming out that will let couples stay
under water for a couple of days at a time,'' said Lori Seto,
travel editor for The Knot, a New York-based wedding planning
company. ``I think it will be popular because it's such a unique
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   While a trip to the underwater world isn't for everyone, many
couples these days want to go on educational or experience-based
honeymoons, travel industry experts say. Some couples are choosing
to stay at five-star hotels that also offer culinary classes hosted
by the hotel's chefs. Others are taking yearlong backpacking trips
through Thailand or taking monthlong safari tours of the African
Serengeti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the picture of people sitting on the beach all week is
not what everyone wants,'' Seto said. ``With all these
opportunities out there people are going further and packing more
in.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, for those newlyweds who can afford the cost
of flying half-way around the world and who have the time. Those
restraints and the desire many couples have to keep things simple
have created a wide variety of honeymoon trips.
</P>
<P>
   And even for some who can afford more exotic trips, traveling to
a secluded place with few side attractions is still popular, travel
agents say. Quiet romance still takes top priority for many
newlyweds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who take shorter trips down to the
Gulf of Mexico to South Padre, Galveston, New Orleans or other
spots along the coast,'' said Kathy Babitzke of Waco-based The
Travel Planet. ``For most honeymooners, they aren't interested in
side trips. What they want is a nice place to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   10 DAYS AND $3,500
</P>
<P>
   The average honeymoon these days lasts about 10 days and costs
$3,500, but travel experts say you can cut back as needed and make
your post-wedding vacation enjoyable and economical. Popular
destinations include places like Las Vegas, Disney World in Florida
and Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   But the most popular trips, and many times the most economical,
are the all-inclusive getaways to places like Cancun and Cozumel,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on a budget, this is a great way to go because you
don't have to worry about how much food or beverages cost,'' said
Tracey Dean, owner of Welcome Aboard Travel in Prior, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   A four-night trip to Cozumel from Dallas is $776 per person. A
seven-night stay is $1,100 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Playa del Carman, a secluded area south of Cancun, has become
popular for couples who want to get away from crowds of people.
Another popular spot is Hawaii, which has breathtaking views of
mountainous landscapes and plenty of activities for those who want
to add some adventure to their honeymoons. A 7-day trip to Hawaii
for two, including airfare and hotel but no drinks or food, runs
about $2,500, travel agents said.
</P>
<P>
   All-inclusive trips can really mean all-inclusive, as many
cruise lines are finding out. In 1999, Carnival, one of the largest
cruise lines in the world, averaged almost six weddings a day
aboard its 14 ships. Royal Caribbean International performed close
to three weddings a day aboard its 11 ships.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ships also are catering to older couples who have
children from previous relationships. Seto said many ships and
resorts have honeymoon packages that let the newlyweds have private
time while the youngsters are entertained in sports activities and
day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of couples these days are on their second or third
marriage and already have children,'' she said. ``They want to
bring the kids along but there have to be things for them to do.
The industry has begun to accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents say the best way to have a good honeymoon is to
plan ahead. Once couples have decided when they're getting married,
then they can begin deciding what would be the best honeymoon
package. Soon-to-be newlyweds also should look at their finances,
how much time they have and what type of vacation would best suit
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a couple is having a huge wedding where they're stressed
out and dealing with all kinds of things they may want to go
somewhere laid-back,'' Seto said. ``They may not want to go to a
place where they don't know the language or have to meet a daily
sight-seeing schedule. You have to know yourself and pick somewhere
that's going to the most enjoyable for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgets many times are the biggest determining factors in where
newlyweds go and how long they stay. Wedding planners say
stretching honeymoon dollars often is about priorities. A thousand
dollars a person can get you out of the country to a nice resort
with little fanfare and added features, like horseback riding or
scuba diving. Or a couple can stay close to home and put most of
the money into staying at a five-star hotel, complete with fine
cuisine and bottles of exotic champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend it all on where you go,'' Seto said, ``or how
nice of place you stay. It's up to the couple.''
</P>
<P>
   And it does matter what time of year you're getting married. A
wedding in the fall is fine, but vacationing in the Bahamas or
other islands in the Atlantic can be risky that time of year,
because fall is hurricane season. Prices come down during this time
_ September, October, November and early December _ but travel
agents say it probably isn't worth the risk.

 &HT;    In new Vegas, gambling isn't everything
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In the new Las Vegas, showgirls and mobsters are
out. Artists and acrobats are in. Mom, dad and the kids on a budget
are out. Conventioneers on corporate expense accounts are in.
Streetwalkers are out. Escorts are in.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs and trendy restaurants are on hotel marquees, not big
names playing big rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Las Vegas, it's easier to find a coffee bar than a
liquor bar.
</P>
<P>
   Caesars Palace has a Zen meditation room and a replica of a
famous Buddhist landmark, Thailand's Brahma Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalk in front of the Bellagio resort's fake, eight-acre
Lake Como is packed for operatic water-fountain shows.
</P>
<P>
   If bloated Elvis were alive in the new Vegas, he'd be a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Vegas is now an adult theme park with long walks, long lines,
high prices and gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bellagio hotel, tourists line up, 12 bucks in hand, to
see 25 paintings by masters including Monet, Matisse and Miro.
</P>
<P>
   At the Venetian hotel, a gondola takes tourists through a mall
on a romantic ride past Brookstone and Banana Republic for $10.
</P>
<P>
   At the Paris Las Vegas hotel, a trip to the top of the fake,
50-story Eiffel Tower is $8.
</P>
<P>
   The Vegas Strip, this planet's most neon-drenched street, offers
moving sidewalks, escalators and trams connecting monster,
3,000-room hotel-cities _ four new ones in the past two years _
that re-invent Vegas' tradition of themed hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all oriented around money,'' says Larry Mullen, a
professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. ``The hotel
occupancy rates have to be 90 percent or above or they get nervous.
But they somehow manage to maintain that. It's one-upmanship. `I
can build a bigger and better and more interesting, more glitzy and
glamorous whatever to attract people and get them to stay at my
hotel.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They're already talking about the Mirage. It's been up about
10 years, and they need to reinvent that,'' says Mullen, who's
working on a project that chronicles history and changes in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Wynn is kinda the brains and economic brawn behind the
mega-resort, theme-park ideas here,'' concludes Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn started the monster hotel frenzy when he opened the
3,044-room Mirage in November 1989. The son of a bingo supplies
salesman spent $620 million to build the Mirage and its
fire-spewing volcano, lobby rain forest and 20,000-gallon aquarium
with sharks. Wynn again upped the stakes last year with his
Bellagio resort.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's lust to attract the gold-credit-card crowd is starting to
pay off. His Picasso at Bellagio and Renoir at the Mirage are the
first Vegas restaurants to win Mobil five-star restaurant ratings.
(The Four Seasons is the only top-rated hotel in Vegas, having
earned the American Automobile Association's five-diamond rating.
The Four Seasons' 424 rooms and suites, $200 to $3,900, occupy
floors 35-39 of Mandalay Bay.)
</P>
<P>
   Pick your theme and book a room: Italy (Bellagio, Venetian),
France (Paris Las Vegas), pirates (Treasure Island), ancient Egypt
(Luxor), medieval (Excalibur), wild animals (MGM Grand), Roman
Empire (Caesars), rock music (Hard Rock Hotel/Casino), tropical
islands (Mandalay Bay, the Mirage), Mardi Gras (Flamingo), NYC (New
York, New York). And this summer, add an Arabian theme at the new
$1.3 billion Aladdin.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Las Vegas, change comes down to this: Guys in shiny
suits with pinky rings and rap sheets who answered to families have
been replaced by corporate bottom-liners in Armani who answer to
stockholders. Vegas abandoned the early '90s marketing drive to
attract families. The amusement park MGM built behind its hotel is
closed and being downsized. At Bellagio, a guard stops anyone with
children and allows the kids through only if they're registered
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis now is going after the convention business,''
explains author Andres Martinez, whose new book, 24/7 chronicles a
monthlong gambling marathon in the new Vegas. ``Some of these
resorts now make more money on stuff other than their casino, which
would have been sort of heresy in the good ol' Vegas of the '50s
when they would give away everything to suck people into the casino
_ cheap buffets, cheap rooms, free drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now at new resorts like Bellagio and Venetian, you can
spend $200, $300 a night if you're there for a convention,'' says
the former Wall Street Journal reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've very wisely become what I like to call a
permanent World's Fair,'' says Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   While shows in Vegas have never been a bargain, today you pay
premium prices for big, bigger, biggest. Half-nude showgirls are
for nostalgia freaks.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest ticket _ $100 _ is for Cirque du Soleil's aquatic
acrobats in O. Siegfried, Roy and their tigers have a money-making
show and upscale zoo called Secret Garden at The Mirage. The MGM
Grand's big show, EFX, is advertised this way: ``250 special
effects, 70 singers, dancers, aerialists, 450 costumes, 6,000
lights, 85,000 watts of stereo sound and Tommy Tune.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rat Pack _ Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr.,
Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop _ that defined Sin City for decades is
now a lounge nostalgia act of impersonators produced by David
Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   People no longer go to Vegas just to gamble. They go to shop:
Vuitton, Gucci, Dior, Tiffany, Chanel. And eat: China Grill, Le
Cirque &AMP; Osteria del Circo, Picasso, Wolfgang Puck's and Emeril's.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 report by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
showed that for the first time, dining, shopping and entertainment
surpassed gambling as a lure for tourists. But that doesn't mean
gambling is being diminished as Vegas' No. 1 money-maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the big corporate players there, they like having
revenue streams that are more predictable than casinos,'' explains
Martinez. ``That's why there's a renewed emphasis on slot machines
_ because those are predictable. You're not ever going to have any
nasty surprises on your bottom line at the slots because those
things pay only a certain amount.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez details in his book, serious gamblers still get free
meals, rooms and even airfare. But it's more like collecting
frequent-flier miles than being a familiar face. Swipe cards
electronically keep track of how much gamblers wager, which earns
them comps.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just gambling that makes Vegas an over-21 town.
</P>
<P>
   You can't walk anywhere on the Strip day or night without being
offered a variety of sex magazines and cards selling escort
services that cops say are fronts for prostitution. And in the new
Vegas, even that business has changed. Besides the sidewalk
handouts, you can now use the Internet to do escort-service
business.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the new Vegas seems to upset civic and casino
pioneers, says Mullen at UNLV. ``The old-timers think it's just Las
Vegas, and there's no place like it. They'd have it no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In this city that delights in making spectacles of blowing up
old hotels to build bigger ones, there's at least Old Las Vegas
downtown on Fremont Street marked by the famous neon sign of cowboy
Vegas Vic. Downtown draws small-time, old-time gamblers and
tourists who don't mind cramped casinos where you can still get a
99-cent shrimp cocktail, $6.99 prime rib dinner or play penny slot
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Mullen has lived in Vegas six years. His report is due
out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what's really struck me is the huge opportunities and
the huge amount of money that flows through this place,'' he says.
``And how quickly it all changes. It's unbelievable, almost
frightening. But that's just Las Vegas.''

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ M&AMP;M's World is one of the most popular stops on the
Strip. And the most popular stop in the store is the Colorworks
wall made up of see-through tubes of M&AMP;Ms in 21 colors made only
for this store and one in New York City. Nearly everyone leaves
with an $8-a-pound bag. For fans of the candy that debuted in 1941,
the store sells 3,000 logo items with an entire section devoted to
No. 36 Ernie Irvan M&AMP;M Racing NASCAR souvenirs. The store reports
that half of all sales are to tourists from Japan. The $3 M&AMP;M's
Academy shows you how the candy is made and includes a 20-minute
3-D show starring Red and Yellow M&AMP;Ms.

 &HT;    Escort services paper the Strip with advertising
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ ``Prostitution is pretty blatant in town here,''
says Lt. Terry Davis of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police vice
squad. Last year, the 22-member vice unit made about 5,000 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitution is legal in some parts of Nevada _ the closest to
Las Vegas is about 50 miles west in the town of Pahrump.
Prostitution in Vegas is high-profile because the sidewalks
fronting billion-dollar hotels are crowded with
minimum-wage-earning Mexicans recruited to hand out papers, cards
and slick magazines advertising escort services.
</P>
<P>
   Three men run a majority of Vegas' 140 escort services, Davis
says. These ``escorts'' frequently are hookers, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is 90-some percent of them will proposition you
for sex because that's how they make their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark County passed an anti-handbill ordinance that was ruled
unconstitutional by Nevada's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The
county is trying to come up with another law. But eliminating the
sidewalk handouts won't solve the prostitution epidemic. Telephone
yellow pages list more than 100 escort service ads, and then
there's the Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for police is that customers who are ripped
off rarely report it, for obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people that have been robbed, stabbed and all kinds
of things that you can't imagine by engaging in this high-risk
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Summon an ``escort,'' says Davis, and this is frequently what
happens:
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl will come up to the room, and she'll say, 'You owe
$125 and that's just the service fee. That will allow me to dance
for you for up to an hour.' Up to an hour means maybe one minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get that money, then they say, 'Anything beyond
that, I work for tips.' 'What do you mean by that?' Then you play
the word game, and ultimately they solicit you for an act of sex
for a fee, which ends up being another $300, $400, $500, maybe
$1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But it can be a lot worse than just losing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times what they'll do, these girls will come up to
your room and drug you, put something in your drink,'' reports
Davis. ``Once you're knocked out, off they go with all your jewelry
and money. That happens on quite a few occasions. It's called a
drug-induced-trick-roll.''
</P>
<P>
   For most tourists, the closest they've come to a Las Vegas
hooker is seeing actress Elisabeth Shue play one in the film
Leaving Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any Vegas prostitutes that look like Shue?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very good-looking girls that are working for
the (escort) services, some that are freelancing,'' says Davis, who
saw the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Any like Elisabeth Shue?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen one,'' reports Davis.

 &HT;    Mackie's haute fashion tip: To thine own shape be true
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bob Mackie can work fashion miracles
with tulle, chiffon, bugle beads and pearls.
</P>
<P>
   And though pieces from his romantic spring collection won't
magically endow you with the outlandish style of Cher (whom he has
designed for extensively) or the bodacious bod of Barbie (for whom
he also creates out-of-this-world looks), they can make you feel
pretty darn close to princesslike.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old designer recently visited Saks Fifth Avenue here
to show off shapely Mackie gowns, shake hands with longtime
admirers and sign autographs for Barbie collectors. Before he
greeted fans, we grabbed him for a quick chat in a Saks fitting
room:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any advice on dressing up if you're used to dressing down?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Evening clothes are fantasy clothes. You can become someone
else for the night. But if you feel like the dress is wearing you,
instead of you wearing the dress, dress closer to the way you would
during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you typically wear jeans and would feel lost in
a ballgown, opt for a cashmere top and beaded pants. You wear suits
to work? Try an elegant pantsuit with a fitted jacket. The key is
to know thyself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women don't know what's best for them and so they try to
dress to please their husbands or their boyfriends, and that often
misfires,'' Mackie says.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget to have some fun: ``You can dress like
Pocohantas or Guinevere or Marie Antoinette!'' (Or Queen Elizabeth
I _ that was Mackie who transformed Whoopi Goldberg into the Virgin
Queen at last year's Academy Awards.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who have been your favorite women to dress?
</P>
<P>
   A. Different ones for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mitzi Gaynor because she was his first client and she loved
colorful, theatrical clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Burnett because he did such a variety of work on her
variety show, ``which is tricky _ dressing someone to get a
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Cher and Diana Ross ``because they're amazing. You can let your
fantasies go.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will you design Cher's Grammy get-up next month?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``I don't know. She could show up in torn jeans and a beaded
shirt _ you never know with her. She always waits till the last
possible minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is real, old-school Hollywood glamour gone for good?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The work I used to do doesn't happen anymore _ movie
musicals, variety shows ...'' (A seven-time Emmy winner, Mackie
received Oscar nominations for his costumes in ``Lady Sings the
Blues,'' ``Funny Lady'' and ``Pennies from Heaven.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Mackie has no trouble keeping busy. In addition to his
ready-to-wear collections and highly collectible Barbie work, his
signature is on eyewear and fragrances, and his home-furnishings
division will expand to include bed and bath products this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Mackie name on sofas, lamps and rugs? ``People are spending
more money on their homes than on their backs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were the most heinous fashion don'ts of the last
century?
</P>
<P>
   A. Stretch pants forced to stretch too much, leggings on overly
large legs, and micro-minis that left absolutely nothing to
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   As for today, Mackie doesn't care for the way so many women and
teen-age girls bare their often squishy stomachs with cropped tops
and low-slung pants. ``It's so unattractive.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what it boils down to: ``Anytime something is really
extreme and the wrong people are wearing it, it's a don't.... It's
like they say, `What's the best accessory a woman can have? A
three-way mirror.'''

 &HT;    Salons try to offer women one-stop shopping
 &HT;    (EDs: This story is not for use by NYTNS clients)
 &HT;    By Sheryll Poe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ No longer content with just cutting and styling
hair, salons are branching out _ trying to be everything to every
customer.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic and beauty industry racked up more than $40 billion
in U.S. sales in 1998. Salons are looking to expand their markets _
selling everything from pantyhose and shampoos to home furnishings
and coffee table fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of these stores as the Home Depots of the beauty
industry. Smooth, light wood counters, bright lighting, fresh
coffee and flowers are backed up by aisle after aisle of shampoos,
hair dryers and bath beads.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new entries into the Austin market is Ulta Salon, an
Illinois-based beauty store and salon. Last fall, Ulta opened three
locations in Austin that feature phone jacks for modems at each
styling station, CNN on a television above a coffee and juice bar,
and fax machines amid aisles of razors and shaving cream, Paul
Mitchell shampoos and Versace makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept is one-stop shopping for women,'' said Ulta
salon manager Lisa Castiglione. ``What we offer is a consistent,
nonintimidating environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Ulta. Other salons, including Bella and The Beauty
Store, Salon and Spa offer a variety of choices, services and
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are providing a level of service which department stores
are no longer doing and drugstores never did supply,'' said Marlene
Eskin, president of Market View, an Austin-based cosmetic industry
research firm. ``They bridge the gap between drugstores and
department stores.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be a formula for success, with about 100 customers a
day walking through the frosted green glass and brushed stainless
steel doors since Ulta opened. Ulta does not release sales figures,
but industry watchers believe the larger stores, such as the one in
Dallas, could do as much as $7.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bella, a popular salon and day spa where clients can indulge in
a ``Day of Beauty'' for $330, opened its Bella Home store six
months ago. The 5,000-square-foot contemporary home furnishings
store carries tables, lamps and couches starting at about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its massages, facials and cafe, Bella has
expanded its retail product sales, including $40 bottles of
shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want these services because in today's society, people
are stressed out,'' said Bella operations manager Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Beauty Store, which has four locations in Austin, offers
similar products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all benefit from the emergence of Ulta,'' said Darryl
Labens, its director of operations. ``Anything that increases
awareness of products will benefit specialty retailers in the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Long a bastion of beauty, the cosmetic counters at mall
department stores may not be able to offer the same variety of
products, but they do offer lines that sometimes cannot be found
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers are label-conscious,'' said Angie Chase,
a local Chanel counter manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bella, like the department stores, prides itself on the
exclusivity of its product lines. ``I find that customers like the
fact that they aren't going to find our stuff anywhere else,''
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ulta also gets endorsements from its shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' said 24-year-old Caren Stearns, pointing to
a lip liner and lipstick display. ``This place is always neat and
clean and you find what you need.''

 &HT;    Clothing line focuses on post-menopausal women
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Like many women over 50, Alice Boylan noticed the
mirror wasn't being as kind to her silhouette as it had been in the
past. Department store clothing punished her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Her crime? Biology.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all post-menopausal women experience changes in their
body shape, stature and distribution of weight, which can turn a
shopping spree into a frustrating, if not laborious, experience.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Boylan, her granddaughter, a New York-based
fashion designer, was able to make her specially tailored clothes
that fit her proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Hanley has since turned that labor of love into a new
business, Alice B. Inc., a line of clothing named for her
grandmother that uses a specially designed sizing chart to address
the shifts in an aging women's silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Threads magazine, some women's bodies change form
head-to-toe, from reduced height, to narrowing chests, to
protruding abdomens, to flattened seats.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Gibbs, vice president of marketing for Alice B., said most
women _ even those who have always been thin _ can expect to grow a
one-to-three-inch abdominal paunch and to shrink in height about
the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``No manufacturers have taken this into effect,'' she said. ``So
women are forced to wear elastic waistbands or (boxy dress styles)
and don't have anything stylish to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue that Linda Dizmon sees many women struggle with.
As women's fashions manager at a local Sears, where about 30
percent of women's clothing shoppers are seniors, Dizmon has
noticed that older women often can't fit into the sizes they once
bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's troubling, and most customers have a good sense
of humor about it or say they are aging gracefully,'' she said.
``But I think that the need is to come up with styles that are
flattering that fit that figure.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the national market research firm NPD Inc., women
over 65 spent $13.2 billion on clothes for themselves in 1998,
about 14 percent of the total dollars spent on women's apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike other specialty sizes _ petites and plus sizes, for
example _ designers have not yet pushed a ``silver size'' concept
into their mainstream lines. Dizmon said some designers, such as
Sag Harbor and Apostrophe, offer tops and bottoms as separates,
allowing women to mix and match different sizes. Others are making
dresses and skirts more midlength for women who don't like short or
long looks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Micki Wagner, assistant area sales manager for the women's
department at a local Dillard's, said some name-brand designers,
such as Liz Claiborne, carry their designs through misses, petites
and plus sizes. So women can match different sizes from different
departments if they need to. Many of the same designers offer
petite clothing in larger sizes to accommodate women's typical
weight gain and height loss as they age, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Alice B.'s ``silver size'' system takes fitting problems a
step further by including features just for aging women's
proportions and lifestyles. Skirts have built-up waistlines with
Velcro fasteners and flat fronts to make abdomens appear flatter,
Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackets usually hit just below the abdomen to give shorter women
a nicer line than longer jackets that cover more of the body, she
said. Blouses allow for aging women's spinal curvature with more
fabric across the back and less across the front. This design
avoids extra fabric from bunching up, which happens when women buy
blouses that are too big.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said Alice B. clothing also accounts for senior women's
lifestyles. For instance, they are machine-washable and buttons are
in the front to accommodate women who may live alone or cannot
reach around to the back.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Alice B.'s designs are only available by catalog or on
its Web site (www.alicebfitsu.com), but Gibbs said the company will
attempt to introduce them into specialty stores later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are different in three areas _ fit, function and
fashion _ because those are the most important aspects of aging
women's clothing, Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   One local retailer would add one more word to the list _ fun!
</P>
<P>
   Sally Odegaard, owner of Olga's specialty clothing shop in Waco,
said many clothes can transcend age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really carry `dowdy' things,'' she said. ``My
customers, no matter what their age, want to look pretty, current
and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she often has 35-year-old and 65-year-old customers who
buy the same outfit and wear it differently. One with a flat
stomach might tuck in a T-shirt, she said, while another wears it
out to hide a her tummy. An older woman may wear a black dress with
a jacket, while a younger one would wear it with a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Odegaard, herself a 57-year-old who enjoys twirling batons and
eating M&AMP;Ms, said seniors' active lifestyles have changed their
perceptions of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little old lady is no longer around,'' Odegaard said.
``She's going to Vegas, and she's wearing a lot of cute things.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau reports that senior citizens are the
fastest-growing population group in the country. Does the fashion
industry plan to keep up?
</P>
<P>
   If a recent event by the Fashion Association and Sporting Goods
Manufacturer's Association is any indication, the coming-of-age
baby boomers may be wearing clothing that better fits their bodies
and their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   TFA and SGMA collaborated last October to present ``Active and
Ageless: Generations of Style'' fashion show. The clothing
presented clothes for ``typical'' American seniors' lifestyles,
including ski outfits, workout wear and cruise attire. Until the
fashion industry weaves that attitude into the threads of its
clothing, Gibbs said, senior women should not feel forced to buy
clothes that don't fit them or their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them have a hard time with aging, but a majority are
proud of their age, proud of being mature. They know what they
want, and no department store will tell them they need it,'' she
said. ``Women need to go into stores and demand a better sizing
system and better quality garments.''

 &HT;    A future world with cybersleaze that feels real
 &HT;    By Lynn Kalber
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Gibson's greatest writing strength _ aside from his
clear, flowing prose _ is his native ability to welcome readers
into a world that mixes the familiar with the incredible, where the
story makes a believably strange kind of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Tomorrow's Parties'' is a sequel to the well-received
``Idoru.'' Lead characters Rydell, Chevette and Laney are back and
still involved in saving the world _ or worlds _ as they know
it/them.
</P>
<P>
   In a race through Gibson-land both physical and ephemeral, these
three are joined by Buell, a hard-drinking, country-song-singing
good ol' boy; Harwood, a Bill Gates/Donald Trump combo with an ego
to match; Silencio, a boy with a watch fixation; and Fontaine, a
bridge resident who guards the past.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan to San Francisco on land, and through all kinds of
cyberspace, time beats toward a grand finale, as people and things
become intertwined. Looming over all is the Golden Gate Bridge, now
home to hundreds and the place for a high-noon showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's killer also finds the bridge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Above him, beyond the tank traps, lift the ragged, swooping
terraces, the patchwork superstructure in which the bridge is
wrapped. Some aspect of his mood lifts: it is a famous sight, a
tourist's postcard, the very image of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge's residents have built cubbyhole homes all the way up
the famous girders, and formed a large high-rise community. Scraps
of metal, wood and cardboard with glass and plastic windows house
retailers who own shops on the bridge, residents who commute to
work in the city and, of course, drug dealers and other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   For the real world, there is a climax coming, like a bomb
ticking away the last seconds of what most know as reality. The bad
guy is being used by the cyber crowd to make sure the end of the
world happens. When that's done, only a cyber world will exist, and
that's just fine with them.
</P>
<P>
   Rydell's job is to stop the ticking. That can put a cramp in a
guy's social life.
</P>
<P>
   Life on Earth hasn't gotten easier. There are lots of nifty
technological gadgets but with an accompanying rise in the sleaze
factor. Just plain nice people are at a premium. The author's ideas
for dealing with society's ills are startling and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   For graffiti artists, he envisions ``a finish that ate graffiti.
The gang kids would come and tag it; twenty minutes later these
flat, dark, vaguely crab-like patches of dark blue would come
gliding around the corner. . . . They seemed to be embedded, a few
millimeters down into the surface, which was a sort of non-glossy
gel-coat affair, but able to move around under there. Smart
material, he'd heard that called.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ATM machines that don't tolerate loitering or
tampering: they either spritz such customers with pepper spray or
electrocute them _ ``. . . the thing would mist you and itself down
with water and then electrify itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And humans' fascination with creating life is explored in the
Another One dolls: ``These are in fact life-sized dolls,
manufactured in the closing years of the previous century for the
solace of distant grandparents, each one made to resemble
photographs of an actual infant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gadgets the characters can't live without: eyephones with
built-in display screens and built-in phones and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   For a high-tech world, ``All Tomorrow's Parties'' is
surprisingly tactile. That, too, is one of William Gibson's
strengths, and he uses it to good advantage here. It's a relief to
see that the writer who coined the word cyberspace is definitely
still at the head of his genre.

 &HT;    Grammy nods boost Macy Gray
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Macy Gray is the new R&AMP;B singer everybody seems to
have heard of _ but nobody's buying. At least not at the rate you
would expect, considering that for six months she's had the kind of
``hot new thing'' buzz that gets you covered in newsweeklies and
invited to perform at Talk magazine's Statue of Liberty launch
party.
</P>
<P>
   Her debut, ``On How Life Is,'' has dwelled in the basement of
Billboard's Top 200 charts for most of the 25 weeks it has been
around.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Slater, the manager she shares with pop's Fiona Apple,
concedes that Gray's hip-hop-inspired soul album has gotten little
radio airplay because ``Macy's made a sophisticated record in terms
of what's considered mass appeal, and what's selling these days.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the 30-year-old with the young Tina Turner voice
received two Grammy Award nominations earlier this month _ for best
new artist and female vocal R&AMP;B performance _ ``On How Life Is''
has jumped from No. 102 to No. 66 to No. 54, on this week's chart.
</P>
<P>
   We had three questions for a deservedly upbeat Gray:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does it seem like, finally, you're going to get the kind of
sales to match the attention you've received?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah, it's already happening. We're almost gold (500,000
in sales). And we've sold more than 2 million worldwide. So in my
mind, I'm doing well. Maybe if you compare what I've done with the
Backstreet Boys, moving a million every week, things could be
rough. But it's been a slow, good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've gone about this a bit differently than your peers.
Though you had a splashy video (for first single ``Do Something''),
you also hit the road early. Who made that decision?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was natural. I was playing before I had a deal. I love
playing. I was actually kind of proud when I read a magazine that
said I was an underground star. Most people have heard of me
through word of mouth, in the clubs, playing in stores or reading
an article. From the street level. Which is a real cool way to
start. But I'm definitely ready to move on now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The first time you performed here it seemed like you had a
lot of cheering family members up front. Do you have any ties to
Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have a lot of loud uncles and aunts (laughs). I used to
stay there when I was a kid during the summers, mostly in Decatur
or over by Greenbriar Mall. Then as I got older Freaknik was my
thing. I still go to the Underground and Fat Tuesday. My cousins
take me out clubbing and shopping. But I can't go to the Gap
anymore. That's how I know things have changed. I went to the Gap
the other day and a gang of kids just rushed me. It was cool
though.

 &HT;    Women moviemakers prove they've got the right stuff
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Mary Harron has some advice regarding the
abundance of women filmmakers at this year's Sundance Film
Festival: Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see there being any going back now,'' says Harron,
who's made one of the most talked-about films at the fest _ the
violent, sex-obsessed ``American Psycho,'' which is scheduled to
open in theaters in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a fair division now,'' she says, eating
yogurt while sitting in her condo dressed head to toe in black
knit, the preferred color of Sundance attire. ``Maybe next year
won't be so good for women, but I still think you're not going to
stop the process of women coming into film.''
</P>
<P>
   Women have indeed arrived in a big way here at Robert Redford's
annual 10-day celebration of independent movies, which ends Sunday.
Of the 32 independent films and documentaries competing for juried
prizes at this year's festival, 47 percent involve women sitting in
the director's chair. English-Indian director Gurinder Chadha's
Thanksgiving-themed ``What's Cooking?'' was the opening night
feature of the fest. And more movies made by women are playing here
this year than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that more and more women are being recognized
because of the quality of their work,'' says Tina Gee, vice
president of theatrical distribution for Seventh Art Releasing in
Los Angeles. ``That opens doors. It makes the Hollywood studio
heads think. They realize women can work as directors.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Today has already dubbed this year's Sundance Film Festival,
a celebration of 112 full-length movies, documentaries and shorts,
a sort of ``indie chick flick'' bonanza. But many of the women who
make films are slightly put off by a label that suggests their work
can be lumped into a category that Hollywood normally defines as
romantic weepers and light relationship comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you kind of ignore the words `chick flick,' it's OK,'' says
Anne Makepeace, director of ``Coming to Light: Edward S. Curtis and
the North American Indians,'' a documentary about the photographer
who spent three decades chronicling the vanishing culture of the
Hopi, Navajo, Blackfoot and other tribes at the beginning of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time it was a guy film world,'' Makepeace says.
``Women do have to work harder. I graduated in 1982 from film
school at Stanford with an award-winning drama, and if I had been a
guy, I would have had a lot of offers from Hollywood to direct. It
could have been the nature of the script, but guys with the same
credentials seemed to get development deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe the number of women included in the festival
is due, in part, to a dramatic rise in the quality of their works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversity in content is quite broad,'' says festival
co-director Geoffrey Gilmore. ``It certainly dispels this notion of
humorous, romantic chick flick. It's the substantive qualities that
seem to be increasing. There's far fewer of that twenty-something
angst film, the Quentin Tarantinos of years past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Psycho'' is certainly one of the leaders in
hard-edged content.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Bret Easton Ellis' take-no-prisoners tome of '80s
greed, Harron's often funny, decidedly violent film stars Christian
Bale as a monied psycho killer stalking Wall Street. It's been
slapped with an NC-17 rating not for its vicious bloodletting but
for its intensive display of soulless, threesome sex (Harron and
the movie's distributor, Lions Gate Releasing, are appealing the
rating).
</P>
<P>
   Other movies by women being screened at this year's festival
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Committed.'' Lisa Krueger's biting take on a woman (Heather
Graham) obsessed with tracking down the husband who has
inexplicably bolted their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Girlfight.'' Karyn Kusama's tale of a female teen's
stereotype shattering foray into pugilism.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Tao of Steve.'' Jenniphr Goodman's revealing portrait of
a guy who possesses a kind of Steve McQueen gene that effortlessly
attracts women.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``First Person Plural.'' Deann Borshay Liem's documentary of
her own adoption, in which she discovers the name she'd been given
is not hers but belongs to a sister she didn't know she had.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stranger With a Camera.'' Elizabeth Barret's frank
documentary about the slaying of a renowned Canadian documentarian
in her native Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   These follow on the heels of Kimberly Peirce's devastating
``Boys Don't Cry,'' the violent, true-life tale of a Midwestern
woman posing as a man. One of last year's Sundance Film Festival
success stories, ``Boys'' was screened as a 20-minute work in
progress to distributors and is considered a shoo-in for an Oscar
nomination this year for its star Hilary Swank.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Psycho's'' Harron has a theory about why it has taken
so long for women to play a stronger role in moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a rock journalist and I remember in the '70s
there were no women rock musicians,'' she says. ``There were
singers and songwriters. Then came Talking Heads with a woman
playing bass. It was the first time I had seen that and it was such
a shock. We'd never seen a woman just in the background playing an
instrument. Then for years there were loads and loads of women in
bands. We just needed someone to break the mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock music just moves faster in the culture,'' she continues.
``What took three years in rock music has taken 10, 15 years in
movies. It's a slower moving part of the culture. It's the
apparatus of it. Films take a longer time to be developed. It's a
much more cumbersome process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the result is changing not only how movies get made,
but what audiences see on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Cooking?'' star Alfre Woodard says there's a big
difference in how female directors run a set. ``It's calmer, more
humorous, less angst-driven,'' she says. ``A male-driven set
establishes a tone of `this is the most important thing going on in
the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Susan Todd, co-director with husband Andrew Young of the
prize-competing documentary ``Americanos: Latino Life in the United
States,'' believes her perspective allowed the film to place a
greater emphasis on strong Latino women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The segment that's devoted to a Midwestern low-rider festival
features a young woman interested in cars and she not only
competes, but judges,'' Todd says. ``Andrew might not have thought
of including her.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that the Sundance Film Festival is featuring
more works from women, Hollywood appears to be testing the waters,
though with an overall less risky comedic bent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, several major studios will release films helmed by
women. Among them: Diane Keaton's ``Hanging Up,'' Sally Field's
``Beautiful,'' Bonnie Hunt's ``Return to Me,'' Nora Ephron's
``Numbers,'' Betty Thomas' ``28 Days'' and Amy Heckerling's
``Loser.''
</P>
<P>
   For women, ``what remains to be seen is whether they can be
truly commercial, that their works start to find audiences,'' says
the film fest's Gilmore. ``The hardest thing to do is to see what
sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   And some female directors, like Chadha of ``What's Cooking?''
say that powerful Hollywood men aren't always a woman's stumbling
block.
</P>
<P>

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I have seen the future and
it is blurry. So even though the 2000 model of me has some miles on
the odometer, the younger me would no doubt be impressed with the
car I'm driving. It's a sporty red convertible designed to draw
attention away from the heavy, gray, visually impaired driver.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _The formula of seeing someone,
particularly a stranger or a teen, as the child he or she once was
is a great way to attain a sense of commonality. This particularly
ought to get one past prejudices against people of different colors
and different faiths. They were all children once. Like you. (John

   ROME-PICKPOCKETS _ Having your wallet pinched in a foreign land,
as mine was in Rome recently, is an infuriating, disorienting
experience. I felt so helpless, thousands of miles from home,
unable to even remember which credit cards I was carrying. Or how
much cash I had. Or whether my Social Security number was on
anything. Or whether I had the receipts for my travelers checks. It
all made me wish I had read those dull pages in the guidebook that
dealt with security precautions _ or had at least better heeded my
Aunt Sara's advice: ``Watch out for the pickpockets.'' (Auchmutey,

   STYLE-MAKEUPSALON _ Caren Stearns is a girly-girl and she's not
afraid to admit it. ``You could live in here,'' the 24-year old
office manager said on a recent make-up outing to new salon
superstore Ulta. ``It's more female oriented.'' With the cosmetic
and beauty industry racking up over $40 billion in U.S. sales in
1998, the new breed of salon is trying to be everything to every
woman. No longer content with cutting and styling hair, salons have
branched out _ with everything from pantyhose and condoms to home
furnishings and coffeetable fountains. (Poe, Austin

   FASHION-MACKIE _ Bob Mackie can work fashion miracles with
tulle, chiffon, bugle beads and pearls. And though pieces from his
romantic spring collection won't magically endow you with the
outlandish style of Cher (whom he has designed for extensively) or
the bodacious bod of Barbie (for whom he also creates
out-of-this-world looks), they can make you feel pretty darn close
to princess-like. The 60-year-old designer recently visited Saks
Fifth Avenue on Palm Beach to show off shapely Mackie gowns, shake
hands with longtime admirers and sign autographs for Barbie
collectors. Before he greeted fans, we grabbed him for a quick chat
in a Saks fitting room. (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). 17. MOVED

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Few people today have ever seen a lynching; few
people, at one time, had never seen it. To see it in photographic
retrospective is to look not so much at the dead as the living _
those who thrilled to see someone stripped bare, bull-whipped and
put to death in whatever macabre manner suited the audience. The
dead are only mutilated corpses that have to be disposed of. For
anyone who opens ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in
America,'' an extraordinarily impressive documentary of American
vengeance and bestiality, agonizing death induces a sucking in of
breath, only to be followed by somber contemplation of the pleasure
it brought spectators _ ``lingering in the woods, circling after
the kill,'' as James Allen writes. (Skube, Atlanta

 &HT;    Lust for (still) life
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the middle of the 17th century in the Dutch town of Delft.
A tilemaker has been blinded by an explosion, so his oldest
daughter goes to work to support the family.
</P>
<P>
   Griet is sent to the home of an artist, to do the laundry, to
watch the children, to do whatever her master wishes. His name is
Johannes Vermeer.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring is less a
conventional biographical novel _ famous man observed by a
fictional sidekick _ than it is a very canny, believable and
well-executed speculation about history and the uses of artists'
erotic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Griet becomes increasingly fascinated by Vermeer, an infatuation
that is, in his fashion, returned. Unlike the other servant girl,
Griet has a sensitivity to color and some vague sense of what
Vermeer is trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Griet is a wise girl and navigates instinctively through a
difficult household; the jealous, acquisitive and perennially
pregnant wife Catharina; Vermeer's mother-in-law; the children; the
other servant. Charged with cleaning his studio without moving
anything, she realizes how painstakingly he works.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seemed to be no changes to the painting, as hard as I
looked for them. At last one day I discovered that another pearl
had been added to the woman's necklace. Another day the shadow of
the yellow curtain had grown bigger. I thought too that some of the
fingers on her right hand had been moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Vermeer asks her to model for him, and the long hours
spent working together on Griet's portrait lead to a culmination
that is far from obvious but altogether satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer matters to us because of his solitude, his sense of
discretion. His pictures don't tell us everything, and his
contemplative portraits imply things happening just outside the
frame. He's Edward Hopper recast as a Dutch Master.
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier's first-rate novel honors that emotional imperative.
She doesn't characterize Vermeer heavily, thus leaving his
essential mystery intact:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a long, angular face, and his expression was steady, in
contrast to his wife's, which flickered like a candle. He had no
beard or mustache, and I was glad, for it gave him a clean
appearance. He wore a black cloak over his shoulder, a white shirt,
and a fine lace collar. His hat pressed into hair the red of brick
washed by rain.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all. Chevalier is helped by the fact that we really
don't know much about Vermeer. He had a lot of children, he painted
slowly, he died deeply in debt, and he rearranged reality to make
his compositions more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Girl With a Pearl Earring assiduously avoids making any great
imaginative leaps. It keeps to a quotidian reality, assembling its
considerable drama through the accumulation of a thousand small
details: the way a servant girl in the 17th century had no legal or
moral standing; courtship rituals among the working class; cleaning
regimens among the middle class; the way Dutch Catholics lived
apart from everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Chevalier's novel communicates indirectly, between the
lines. Other men of Delft make their desires bluntly known, but
Vermeer is repressed, contents himself by watching and thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Girl With a Pearl Earring is not a tease; it's not about
anything so crass as will-they-won't-they. Its most overt erotic
moment comes when Vermeer reaches out and strokes Griet's lips. The
effect is electric, akin to Hester Prynne's letting down her hair
in the woods in The Scarlet Letter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a deeply satisfying coda to this lovely novel, a final
confrontation in which Griet realizes that Vermeer was always much
more interested in his painting of her than he was in her.
</P>
<P>
   He was, she realizes, an artist.

 &HT;    For Sue Grafton and editor, `P' is now for Putnam
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sue Grafton is leaving Holt, where her character Kinsey Milhone
and alphabet-titled murder mysteries have been the primary mortgage
lifter for many years, to follow her editor Marian Wood to Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   This underscores the extent to which writing remains a trade
founded largely on relationships. Many writers trust editors in a
way they would never trust their spouses. A common feature of
contracts for successful writers is an editor clause, which states
that should a specific editor leave the house, the writer can go
with them with no penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Whodunit . . .
</P>
<P>
   Fort Lauderdale author Kristy Montee has had her first mystery
novel published in paperback by Pinnacle, following its hardcover
publication last year by Kensington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark of the Moon'' is about a biracial cop named Louis
Kincaid, who returns to a Mississippi town to take care of his
dying mother.
</P>
<P>
   Montee, writing with her sister Kelly under the name P.J.
Parrish, has already completed the second Parrish novel ``The Dead
of Winter,'' to be published this fall, also by Kensington.Body
slam!
</P>
<P>
   Add another name to the list of wrestlers writing
autobiographies. Bill Goldberg, who drops his first name
professionally, will be writing write a book for Crown, in concert
with his older brother Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ``My story is much too cool and bizarre to keep it to myself,''
he told Publisher's Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Next?'' will be published in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In other, more serious sporting news, Little, Brown will be
publishing the autobiography of Jim Morris, who became the big
league's oldest rookie last year. After losing a bet with the high
school team he was coaching, he tried out and won a spot pitching
in relief for Tampa Bay at the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming . . .
</P>
<P>
   Bliss Broyard, the daughter of the late, superb New York Times
book critic Anatole Broyard, had a volume of short stories
well-received last year and has just signed with Little, Brown for
two more books. One is a memoir of her father called Mixed Blood _
Broyard was black but passed as white to everyone, including his
family _ the other a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, comes this item from Publisher's Weekly, about a
novel that was rejected by 25 U.S. publishers before being bought
in England. The English publisher sold it to several other
countries, at which point the novel that had been unpublishable in
America was suddenly hot. Picador has bought ``Music for the Third
Ear'' _ about a Norwegian couple who take in Bosnian refugees _ and
will publish it next year.

<P>
   Quote Unquote . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of playing the game is knowing when you have lost. If you
have been flatly rejected by ten well-chosen editors then you will
almost certainly be turned down by the next hundred. It would be
far better to spend your time rethinking your idea, reworking your
proposal, or maybe even abandoning that particular idea and moving
on to something else.'' _ John Boswell

 &HT;    Best models for female ordination are
 &HT;    women who lived flawed lives, author says
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Saints are terrible role models,'' the Rev.
Joseph Goetz writes engagingly in his little book, ``Mirrors of
God'' ($6.95, Forward Movement Press). Saints are bigger than life;
how can we ever measure up?
</P>
<P>
   We can't, of course. That's why Goetz offers six, very flawed
female models. Two of them had children out of wedlock; one of them
may have starved herself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of them embody what Goetz calls ``classic Christian
themes.'' Mother Teresa's appearance in Goetz's devotional won't
surprise anyone, but the chapter on Simone Weil _ a Jew _ might.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz, 66, a retired pastor, put this book together after a
series of talks with the Episcopal Sisters of the Transfiguration
in Glendale, Ohio. It was first published in 1985, but a new
revised edition includes sketches of each woman by the author _ a
prolific artist _ and a note: ``... the underlying motive for this
book remains the same; sound theology not only allows for, but
urges, the inclusion of women in the ordained ministry.'' That
would include his own faith _ Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   The women in his book, he says, are the best argument for female
ordination, by the way they have lived their lives. They are:
Dorothy Day, pacifist, servant of the poor in this country and
co-founder of The Catholic Worker; Anne Morrow Lindbergh, writer
and wife of the famous aviator; Weil, a writer; Dorothy L. Sayers,
a writer best known for her character, Lord Peter Wimsey, but who
also wrote about theology; Evelyn Underhill, writer and mystical
seeker; and Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman, Goetz says, represents an aspect of Christianity
that is rooted in the New Testament: Day embodies conversion, ``the
daily turning toward the Lord''; Lindbergh is about ``building
community''; Weil allowed ``one's life to be an announcement of
God's love''; Sayers represents ``reasoning with all of one's
faculties about the faith''; Underhill is an illustration of
``worshiping the Lord in the gathered Body of Christ''; and Mother
Teresa is about ``reaching out to others in loving service.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetz thinks that Day and Mother Teresa both have a good chance
of being canonized, even though Day, who had a child while
unmarried, also is said to have had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He met both women briefly in Cincinnati on different occasions,
many years ago. Day, he recalls, was ``quite remarkable ... putting
her faith into action.'' Mother Teresa impressed him as being ``a
simple peasant woman, really,'' who spoke English quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Goetz ruminates on a brown scrap of paper
said to have been pinned to the pulpit of a 15th-century church in
Tuscany that was known for it priceless paintings. The paper simply
read, ``God loves you now!''
</P>
<P>
   A simple message, really, at the heart of it all. That's the
message that he thinks these six women understood. ``Some people
think they can save themselves by being nice. But it is God who
saves us.''

 &HT;    Between seasons, fashion gets down to basics
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's a slight chill in the air in the morning,
but by afternoon the sun can get a little too warm, and the evening
air can be downright chilly.
</P>
<P>
   With the weather doing wacky things this time of year, what's a
gal or guy to wear?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you can layer on in the morning and take off as the
day gets warmer,'' said Duke Nelson, a store manager of the Gap.
``That also makes it perfect for night (because you can put the
layers back on as it gets cooler).''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson suggests layering different pieces of clothing to help
get through this transitional time between holiday and spring
fashions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transitional times are really tough because it's hard to find
something that's not going to be too heavy or too light,'' Nelson
said. ``But it's a true test of your wardrobe, because if you have
a lot of the basics, you'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But what are a few of the basics?
</P>
<P>
   ``Khakis are perfect for spring,'' Nelson said. ``They have a
more freer style than jeans, and they're also lighter-weight.''
</P>
<P>
   For women, Nelson suggests basics such as khakis, twin sets and
matte jersey dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those basics, you can totally go through the transition
to spring without a problem,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   For men, Nelson suggests fine-gauge sweaters and plain front
khakis, which can be dressed up or down depending of the type of
shirt worn.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gilliland, manager of the Buckle store in Waco, Texas,
said she has also seen a lot of people wearing basic attire during
this transitional time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are wearing long-sleeved T-shirts under
short-sleeved T-shirts,'' Gilliland said. ``That's a lot of what we
are layering in the store. It's becoming a pretty big look.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland said many people are choosing to wear a colored
T-shirt with detailing on it with a plain white long-sleeved
T-shirt underneath or a plain, colored T-shirt paired with a
colored, long-sleeved T-shirt with detailing on the sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think short-sleeved woven shirts over long-sleeved
T-shirts look great,'' Gilliland said. ``It's casual, but it looks
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   With not quite cold but not quite hot weather, Gilliland said
people are still interested in lightweight sweatshirts and
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of people come in looking for them, and we've
almost sold out of the lightweight sweaters,'' Gilliland said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Gilliland's store is starting to sell shorts,
there haven't been many early buyers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People haven't started wearing shorts just yet, but I have
noticed girls wearing pedal pushers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the colors of this in-between time differ from
winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are tired of (winter) darks and (holiday)
brights, and they're looking for something lighter,'' Nelson said.
``Anything that's lighter and takes away the heaviness of their
clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   And since basic clothing in basic colors is probably your best
bet during these transitional weeks, now is the time to find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of stores are in 'sale' mode and now is a good time to
get those basic transitional pieces to carry you through to
spring,'' Gilliland said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few transition basics to hold you over until spring:
</P>
<P>
   _ Khakis
</P>
<P>
   _ Twin sets
</P>
<P>
   _ Tank tops
</P>
<P>
   _ Cardigans
</P>
<P>
   _ Long-sleeved T-shirts
</P>
<P>
   _ Short-sleeved T-shirts
</P>
<P>
   _ Shrugs
</P>
<P>
   _ Woven shirts
</P>
<P>
   _ Light-weight hooded sweatshirts
</P>
<P>
   _ Fine-gauge sweaters
</P>
<P>
   _ Shirts with 3/4-length sleeves
</P>
<P>
   _ Capri pants and pedal pushers
</P>
<P>
   _ Jersey-knit dresses and skirts
</P>
<P>
   _ Canvas tennis shoes

publicizing his movie with a crude cardboard sign that reads:
``Help. I need a distributor;'' and the film industry types who ski

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Few people today have ever seen a lynching; few
people, at one time, had never seen it. To see it in photographic
retrospective is to look not so much at the dead as the living _
those who thrilled to see someone stripped bare, bull-whipped and
put to death in whatever macabre manner suited the audience. The
dead are only mutilated corpses that have to be disposed of. For
anyone who opens ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in
America,'' an extraordinarily impressive documentary of American
vengeance and bestiality, agonizing death induces a sucking in of
breath, only to be followed by somber contemplation of the pleasure
it brought spectators _ ``lingering in the woods, circling after
the kill,'' as James Allen writes. (Skube, Atlanta

<P>
   HOUSTON _ They sat there, dressed in their white shirts and
ties, as still as several dozen middle school kids could possibly
sit.
</P>
<P>
   Then James Tennard III brought up a topic guaranteed to make
them squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Kissing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Tennard quickly broke this news: ``Kissing is not
important for your age. Don't even worry about it,'' he told the
students at Johnston Middle School. ``The time will surely come.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennard and his partners in the Three Gentlemen School of
Etiquette were dispensing advice about manners and manhood, part of
their quest to civilize the city.
</P>
<P>
   At school visits and lessons delivered at their southwest
Houston offices, they talk about the rules of fine dining, personal
grooming and all manner of social interaction, from dating to
business deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that people just don't know,'' said Robert
Hayes III. ``I've met older men, 35 and up, who don't know how to
tie a tie. They're afraid to put on a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Hayes, Tennard and the third gentleman, Donnell Cooper. They
are impeccably stylish suit-and-tie guys in a Dockers world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it wasn't always this way _ Hayes' mother, Kelso
Elementary School Principal Debra Hayes, says he occasionally was a
bit slow to open the door for her when he was a child _ but it's
been pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   Three well-mannered boys, grown into well-mannered men. Now they
want to pass on the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, 24, and Tennard, 25, grew up together in Houston; Hayes
and the 23-year-old Cooper met as students at Southern University
in Baton Rouge, La., where both earned degrees in sociology.
Cooper, who also grew up in Houston, later completed a master's
degree in public administration at Texas Southern University.
</P>
<P>
   They returned home to Houston in 1998 and began their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper is a parole officer for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice; Hayes is a resident adviser at Covenant House, an
organization for runaways and street kids. Tennard, a senior
criminal justice major at TSU, is a Harris County Juvenile
Institution officer.
</P>
<P>
   One day during a casual conversation, they realized they all
felt that manners mattered.
</P>
<P>
   They signed up for a class with local etiquette doyenne Ann
Miller, who was so proud of her young proteges that she arranged a
meeting and photo with Houston Mayor Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Thus inspired, they launched plans for their own school,
targeting boys and young men.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being dismayed at the competition, Miller says she is
happy to welcome them as colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann Miller cannot save the world,'' she said. ``They can reach
areas that I would never reach, the little boy. ... These three
guys can be role models.''
</P>
<P>
   She's even interested in sending her 14-year-old son through
their program, not because she hasn't taught him etiquette _ she
has, of course _ but because she thinks the lessons will be more
powerful coming from three polished young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not teaching anything new,'' Hayes said. ``We're
teaching something that gets passed down from generation to
generation, but it's getting lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Their curriculum is a mix of the rules they grew up with,
lessons from Miller's classes and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we teach how to make others feel comfortable in any
situation,'' Tennard said. ``That's how you make a boy into a man
and a man into a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   They started out holding classes at Westbury United Methodist
Church before moving to their tastefully furnished suite of
offices, equipped with an assortment of grooming aids _ toiletries,
shoe horns and the like _ and four place settings of china and
silverware.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Cooper said, they have spent several thousand dollars
setting up the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good etiquette is a universal language,'' said Westbury Pastor
J.D. Phillips. ``Good manners, kindness ... is craved by human
nature as much as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sees a deeper benefit to what Cooper, Hayes and Tennard
are trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it contributes to a good self-image,'' Phillips said.
``When people feel like they know how to respond in a situation,
they feel better about themselves. If you don't have the proper
social skills to comfortably interact with people, you're still
lost, and you're uneducated.''
</P>
<P>
   The session at Johnston Middle School was a chance to address
that.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 boys from the school's Gentlemen's Club, along with a
handful of girls from a corresponding club for young women,
listened attentively as Cooper, Hayes and Tennard talked about
grooming, dining and dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not use it today,'' Cooper told them as he explained
the importance of good grooming. ``But you're getting older. One
day you will.''
</P>
<P>
   The club started several years ago to teach some of life's finer
details, Assistant Principal Charles Cade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to teach our young men how to act in a nice
place,'' Cade said. ``It builds up self-esteem. They feel good
about themselves. They feel knowledgeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Club meetings also cover financial topics such as stocks, bonds
and mutual funds, even ``how to become CEO of a big company,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to expose students to loftier goals. ``A lot of our
kids, they come from a single-parent home,'' Cade said. ``They
don't have a dad. They come to me to tie their ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Cade's father died when he was a child, he said. ``If it hadn't
been for a high school coach, I don't know where I'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Three Gentlemen seek to fill the void, too, covering topics
of interest to kids.
</P>
<P>
   What, Tennard asked the students, should you do if you escort a
young lady to dinner and, upon opening the menu, discover you don't
have enough money to cover the bill?
</P>
<P>
   ``Order soup,'' one boy offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to an ATM machine,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennard suggested honesty. ``She'll appreciate that,'' he
said, and dinner at a less expensive restaurant will still be fun.
</P>
<P>
   He, Hayes and Cooper are flawlessly dressed for their school
visit, all in black _ black shirts and ties, black suits, spiffily
shined black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of their appeal, Phillips said. ``They're role
models. They dress nice. They're an alternative to the type of
images that are dangerous to young people: the drug dealer who
makes a lot of money. The violent person on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says to a person, `Hey, you can be cool in this way.' ...
Everybody can't play basketball. Everybody's not going to be a
great athlete or entertainer. But everybody can be a decent human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's young gentlemen said they were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're true gentlemen,'' 11-year-old Brandon Balque said. ``I
learned a lot about taking out a date.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he date yet?
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But these kids are thinking about the future. ``I really want to
learn about etiquette,'' 12-year-old Geronimo Ibanez said. ``My
mom, she says you need to be classy.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the etiquette session offered forward-thinking advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how you're supposed to take a lady out,''
Geronimo said, ``because I'm going to need that later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, the gentlemen say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youth today are scared to put on a tie, to wear nice clothes,
because of what their friends might say,'' Hayes said. ``They're
growing up not even knowing how to tie a simple tie, let alone a
bow tie or a Windsor knot.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hayes and his partners will teach that and try to inspire
their young charges to something more.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Cooper said, they want to restore some of manhood's
lost luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to rebuild as many men as we can.'' &QL;

HOUSEPLANTS LIKE A HIGH HUMIDITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Could you tell me whether misting helps my
houseplants?
</P>
<P>
   A: Misting once or twice a day helps, but this is a short-term
solution to a continued problem of low humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Most plants prefer a relative humidity of 50 percent to 60
percent. But our homes have a relative humidity of only 10 percent
to 15 percent during the winter, often causing leaf margins to
brown and flower buds to brown and drop.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is a humidifier to raise the relative humidity
throughout your home or in the area where the plants are located.
If a humidifier is out of the question, try growing the plants in
the kitchen or bathroom, where the air is usually more humid. Or
group the plants on a tray of moistened pebbles, which raises
humidity. Or at least group the plants so that water vapor given
off by each plant benefits the others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have to prune my wisteria several times a year to keep it
from overrunning its available area. I have always done this at
random times, as it seemed to become necessary, with the result
that in some years I get no blooms. Could you please tell me in
which months I should try to avoid pruning to avoid interfering
with bloom cycles?
</P>
<P>
   Could you tell me in which months I should avoid pruning
pyracantha so I won't interfere with berry production?
</P>
<P>
   A: Do not prune wisteria when dormant as you will remove most of
the flower buds and encourage rampant green growth in spring. Wait
until the vine has bloomed, and then, in July, remove straggly
growth but leave some branches so the vine can climb.
</P>
<P>
   Cut shoots back a third to a half their length, which includes
the short spurs upon which next season's flower clusters are borne.
</P>
<P>
   Your vine will flower best in sun and a well-draining soil.
Don't overwater, and don't apply a lot of nitrogen or you'll get
green growth at the expense of blooms.
</P>
<P>
   You can try fall applications of a phosphorus fertilizer to
encourage flowering, but don't overdo that either. Phosphorus
buildup can occur, and if phosphorus is tied up in the soil, the
plant can't use it. Epsom salts can help various plants flower, as
it provides magnesium and releases certain elements in the soil
that plants need to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   If you prune in summer, give the plant plenty of sun, and if it
still doesn't bloom, try root pruning. Come out about two feet from
the trunk of the vine and drive a sharp spade about a foot down.
Repeat this around the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Pyracanthas bloom in spring and produce green fruit that turns
red in fall. The plants often hold the berries in winter. I would
do major pruning in late winter, even if this means removing
lingering berries. If you prune just before spring, you'll diminish
blooms, which, of course, diminishes your berry count.

ROBERTS, GERE A GREAT MATCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE'
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a ``Notting Hill'' sequel for Julia Roberts and
Hugh Grant. Although some critics marveled at their chemistry, the
actors reportedly detested each other.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts and Richard Gere are another thing. They've been
pals and New York neighbors since their 1990 hit, ``Pretty Woman,''
and they'd often considered scripts for a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   None was good enough. Happily, the two found a suitable
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Runaway Bride,'' Gere and Roberts rekindle their
romantic-comedy sparks as different characters.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Ike, a columnist for USA Today. (In reality the paper
is in Washington, D.C., but for the film it shifts to New York.)
She plays Maggie, a hardware-store owner in a small Maryland town.
(Seems like nearby D.C. would have been a natural fit, but what do
we know?)
</P>
<P>
   When Ike learns Maggie has dumped three grooms at the altar, he
attacks her in print, followed by close encounters when he heads to
her town for a follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   As she grooms her fourth groom, will Maggie again get cold feet,
this time thanks to her secret attraction for the snide yet
disarming journalist? Duh.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's sheer wish-fulfilling fantasy. But it's also sheer
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Director Garry Marshall (who also helmed ``Pretty Woman'') keeps
a loose, light touch on the proceedings while giving this screwball
comedy moments of redeeming soulfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bride'' is packed with Marshall's trademark funny bits, often
improvised on the set. When Roberts makes a strange face or dangles
from a church-bell rope, that's Marshall saying, ``Julia, do the
thing with the thing, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Gere and Roberts also are as charming as ever, and Gere has
never been more self-effacing and funny.
</P>
<P>
   A solid supporting cast includes Joan Cusack in the obligatory
``friend'' role and Hector Elizondo (also of ``Pretty Woman'') as
Gere's supportive colleague.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem: The film shamelessly lets itself off the hook
when it comes to Maggie's left-behind beaus. While wildly divergent
in their lifestyles (one's a rocker/mechanic, another is a priest),
they are uniformly sweet and understanding about the bride they
lost. This lets Maggie check her guilt at the door _ not that she
shows a trace of it.
</P>
<P>
   The film's fantasies also extend to the impossibly idyllic town
and the stars' amazing wealth trappings.
</P>
<P>
   Gere has a jaw-dropping Manhattan apartment that Donald Trump
might envy, while Roberts' hardware-store gal wears simple yet chic
clothes that only could come from the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep telling yourself: It's only a movie.
</P>
<P>
   As such _ and as escapist entertainment _ ``Bride'' works. Don't
take it too seriously, and don't scrutinize it ... just enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG, Paramount, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.99
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MOONLIGHTING' ARRIVES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Moonlighting,'' newly syndicated on Bravo, is also on video
with a collector's edition from Anchor Bay. The 93-minute tape
($14.98) has the original pilot along with Bruce Willis' screen
test for the hit TV show that also starred Cybill Shepherd, with
Allyce Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD ($24.98) adds a recent audio commentary by Willis and
creator Glenn Gordon Caron, as well as a 12-page booklet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SEE THE WORLD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New on DVD from MPI is ``Baraka,'' a superb world tour of 24
countries offering such striking sights as Mount Everest and the
pyramids at Giza.
</P>
<P>
   Shot on 70mm film and melded with music, ``Baraka'' already was
on tape, where it's been reduced to $14.98. The DVD is $24.98.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GETTING A `HOOK' ON DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg is slowly dragging himself onto the DVD
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his only film on DVD has been his latest, ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' But on March 21 he'll have another: 1991's
``Hook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hook'' _ a mishandled spin on ``Peter Pan'' _ isn't exactly
what Spielberg fans are frothing to get on disc. ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Jurassic
Park,'' ``Jaws'' and ``E.T.'' still wait.
</P>
<P>
   Like his good pal George Lucas, Spielberg seems content to let
others lay the groundwork for DVD before he jumps in to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`ALLY' ON TAPE, DISC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' is on video with three tapes, each featuring two
episodes and costing a suggested $14.98. Or you can get all six
shows on a two-disc DVD set costing $39.98.
</P>
<P>
   The three tapes also are sold as a set for $39.98, but the two
discs aren't sold individually.
</P>
<P>
   The first volumes of both the DVDs and tapes have the pilot
show, as well as ``Cro-Magnon,'' the so-called ``Dancing Baby''
episode.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`PAYBACK' MARKED DOWN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson's ``Payback'' has been marked down to $14.95 on tape,
where it now includes interviews and behind-the-scenes material.
</P>
<P>
   The film's DVD remains the same, costing $29.99 and adding a
trailer and behind-the-scenes footage. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`SIMPSONS' GIFT SET &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating its 10th anniversary, ``The Simpsons'' has a new
Hollywood-theme gift set featuring three videos with two episodes
each for $24.98.
</P>
<P>
   Volume 1 also is sold separately for $9.98 and has a never-seen
montage of Bart's long-running crank calls to Moe's Bar.

COUNTRY REMAKE? WHEN IT COMES TO ALISON KRAUSS, FORGET ABOUT IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her 15 years of entertaining, country and bluegrass star
Alison Krauss has never had a more scintillating opportunity for
superstardom than right now.
</P>
<P>
   In between the glitz of teen-pop and the blitz of rap-rock, the
women of country music carried 1999. According to SoundScan, which
monitors album purchases, sales were up 5.5 percent last year. A
lot of that was on the backs of the Dixie Chicks, Shania Twain and
Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss claims to care less, but her turn may be coming whether
she wants it or not.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the girl with powder-blue eyeliner and big Grand Ole
Opry hair, Krauss, 28, has had a Celine Dion-style glamour
make-over. Her new album, ``Forget About It,'' is a collection of
lulling country ballads, jogging mandolins and a cover photo as
vogue as any Twain or Chicks pose.
</P>
<P>
   More important, ``Forget About It'' is the most accessible and
Krauss-centric album of her career. She recorded it with her
longtime band, Union Station, and recruited such guests as Lyle
Lovett and Dolly Parton. Still, it's Krauss' ethereal vocals that
clearly carry the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Discuss songcraft, and Krauss is more than willing to while away
the afternoon. But mention how her charming new image might attract
male groupies to her concerts, and she's oblivious, even a little
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just me for a day,'' Krauss laughed in her
helium-high nasal giggle. ``I told the photographer before he came
over that I had some zits on my face and he said, `No problem. No
problem.' I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   A bluegrass and country traditionalist from Champaign, Ill.,
even Krauss admits that in today's country, primping comes before
pickin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different world before video _ a completely different
story,'' Krauss said. ``I remember as a kid not knowing what an
artist looked like until I bought their record. Now, looks come
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Krauss is probably due some national attention even if she shows
up for photo shoots in her bathrobe and bunny slippers. Starting
with her 1990 album, ``Everytime You Say Goodbye,'' nearly all of
her releases have been nominated for or awarded Grammys, Country
Music Awards and International Bluegrass Music Association
accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget About It'' has followed suit, picking up three Grammy
nominations (best female country vocal, best country album and best
engineered album) earlier this month. CMA and the IBMA won't
convene again until the fall, but Krauss is a sure bet for some
nominations from both.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition by peers is flattering, but Krauss' ability to score
so well with Grammy is something of an enigma. The award's voting
body, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, is prone
to favor albums with swift sales and broad radio appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss hasn't had either, but she's not asking questions about
the Grammy process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get recognized it's awesome and humbling,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a modest pre-acceptance speech for a woman who has spent
most of her life preparing for a career in music. Krauss started
playing classical violin when she was 5, but she soon became
enamored of the playfulness of country bluegrass. The violin
quickly turned into a fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   At age 12 she won the Illinois State Fiddle Championship and was
named most promising fiddler in the Midwest by the Society for the
Preservation of Bluegrass in America. Two years later she set the
standard for Leann Rimes by recording her first album, ``Too Late
to Cry,'' before she could drive a car legally.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss' albums seem to alternate between mainstream country and
Bill Monroe-inspired bluegrass. By contract, her backing band,
Union Station, appears in the album title with her on alternating
recordings _ which always seem to be the bluegrass-tinged albums.
The band has always been her musical support network, much like an
extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Dobro player Jerry Douglas and mandolinist Sam Bush have been
playing with Krauss since the first album and are once again
featured on ``Forget About It.'' Veteran rock drummer Jim Keltner
is featured on drums while Lovett and Parton add backing vocals to
the closing song, ``Dreaming My Dreams With You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both had offered to sing on my records in the past, but I had
to work up the courage to ask them,'' Krauss said. ``They were so
generous and tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   More modesty from the cover girl.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any of her other albums, Krauss' feather-light
voice is pushed to the fore on ``Forget About It.'' There's a
reason Douglas' Hawaiian-hillbilly dobro is a constant in Krauss'
arrangement; its tinny notes are a contrast to her pliant delivery
in songs like the radio-ready ``Stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Krauss remakes Todd Rundgren's ``It Wouldn't Make a Difference''
into a ballad that the progressive rocker probably never
envisioned. And on ``It Don't Matter Now,'' one of three songs
contributed by former Doobie Brother Michael McDonald, she utters
pained questions like, ``Is that sorry on your breath?'' like she's
waiting for the listener to confess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always preferred to sing songs by other writers,'' Krauss
said. ``In the end I think I'm much better at choosing what songs
by other people that are best for me than composing my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing. At least she'll take credit for something.

<P>
   Given how so many Super Bowls are tedious blow-outs, you might
want to consider Cartoon Network's counter-programming offering:
``Roadrunner vs. Coyote: The Big Game,'' an ingeniously packaged
pile of old cartoons, which boasts another guaranteed lop-sided
score and play-by-play from Fox sportscasters John Madden and Pat
Summerall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Game'' parodies Super Bowl hoopla _ a belabored Slate
Rock &AMP; Quarry Co. Pre-game Show features the bickering ex-pro
football stars of HBO's ``Inside the NFL'' (only Jerry Glanville
feels poor old Wile E. Coyote has a chance of triumphing). In a
``bio'' of Roadrunner, the narrator intones, ```Beep-beep:' Words
that to this day ring out like two big, ringing-out things.'' (Even
the protracted nature of the pre- game show is part of the dadaist
joke it plays on Bowl hype.)
</P>
<P>
   It also pokes relentless fun at the grindingly obvious
conventions of the cartoons themselves. There's a special report on
Coyote's disastrously ill-advised endorsement deal with Acme, and
Madden and Summerall become weary with the Coyote's relentlessly
self-immolating attempts at capturing his prey (Madden explains
each in instant-replay on his telestrator with the same insight he
brings to NFL match-ups.) Here's the money quote: Self-flagellation
has never been so much fun! ``The Big Game'' airs on Cartoon
Network from 1-5 p.m. Sunday, but for those who insist on watching
Tennessee-St. Louis, it's also on Saturday night from 6-10 p.m. &QL;

&HT;     TITO GUIZAR A CROONING IDOL LONG BEFORE RICKY MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAMIRO BURR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Six decades before the Ricky Martin crossover
explosion, a young ranchero singer captured audiences in the United
States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Tito Guizar, and like the gun-slinging,
ballad-singing American cowboy Roy Rogers, Guizar embodied the
typical screen hero _ tall, handsome and dashing. His peers in film
and music were legends such as Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete and
Miguel Aceves Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   Guizar died last month in San Antonio at the age of 91.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his life, he recorded hundreds of songs and
appeared in dozens of movies.
</P>
<P>
   He is best known for his signature song, ``Alla en el Rancho
Grande,'' the title track from the 1936 movie. The song about
idyllic country life was comparable to Roy Rogers' ``Happy
Trails.''
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, ``Alla en el Rancho Grande'' is credited
with starting the singing charro genre in Mexican cinema, mirroring
the singing cowboy craze in American films.
</P>
<P>
   Born Federico Arturo Guizar Tolentino on April 8, 1908, in
Guadalajara, Guizar had an early interest in singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 12 or 13, I used to sing in the shower and then my
voice began changing,'' he said in a September interview in his San
Antonio home. ``My mom told me then that I sang nicely. Then I
began playing the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   But a stern conservative father wanted Guizar to study medicine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless other would-be artists, Guizar fudged in the late
1920s when he told his parents he was going to New York City to
enroll in the Columbia School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the place to be for entertainers then _ in the
early days of film and radio, it was a hotbed of activity. Several
of Guizar's compatriots soon arrived: ranchero singer Jorge Negrete
and Jesus ``Chucho'' Navarro Moreno and Alfredo ``El Guero''
Bojalil Gil, of the future Trio Los Panchos, were all hustling for
radio or recording work.
</P>
<P>
   Guizar stayed busy, singing in Prohibition-era nightclubs;
later, after an audition got him a spot on CBS, he dropped out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Los Angeles, he got his own radio show, ``Tito Guizar
y Su Guitarra,'' gaining audiences with his classical arrangements
of popular Mexican and Spanish melodies such as ``Cielito Lindo''
and ``La Cucaracha.''
</P>
<P>
   Guizar's first films for Warner Bros. were minor parts. But in
1936, director Fernando de Fuentes asked him to play the leading
role in ``Alla en el Rancho Grande.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando originally wanted `Rancho Grande' to be titled `Cruz'
after the leading lady, played by actress Esther Fernandez,''
recalled Guizar. Other future greats in the film were noted
composer Lorenzo Barcelata and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hanging out in the Cafe Tenampa when Fuentes
recognized me,'' Guizar said. ``He asked if I would be in one of
his movies that he was working on called `Cruz.' I told him I was
not an actor, I was a singer. But I suggested the name of a song,
`Alla en el Rancho Grande,' instead of `Cruz' for the movie title.
He accepted. The movie came out in '36.''
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable movie was the 1948 western ``The Gay
Ranchero,'' in which Roy Rogers plays the sheriff and Guizar his
sidekick, singing ``You Belong to My Heart (the English version of
``Solamente una Vez'') and ``Granada.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Guizar appeared in 40 Mexican films and eight American
movies, including ``The Big Broadcast of 1938'' with Bob Hope (who
sang ``Thanks for the Memories'' in it) and ``Tropic Holiday'' with
Dorothy Lamour and Ray Milland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, Guizar married former Mexican singer Carmen Noriega in
New York. Guizar recalled their marriage fondly, describing their
life together as an idyll that ended only with her death in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview, Guizar maintained an easy smile and
readily broke into song, an enthusiasm that came through in his
screen roles.
</P>
<P>
   He was also quick to share his motto: ``El pasado es polvo; el
futuro, no mas una brisa. Si quieres ser feliz, vive por ahorita.''
(The past is dust and the future a passing breeze. If you want to
be happy, live for the moment).
</P>
<P>
   Guizar will be remembered for his endless appreciation and
passion for life, love and music.

   ATLANTA _ The goatee was gone, Kurt Warner's face clean-shaven.
``It was getting too long,'' said Warner, answering his 188th
question of the morning at the St. Louis team hotel out here in
basic Georgia suburbia. ``It was starting to itch . . . but it'll
be back by Sunday, I promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only change. That'll be it.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity has come and Warner has not changed. He still praises
the Lord and passes the football. Money, millions and millions of
dollars, will come to this man who may be the Most Valuable Player
in the NFL but is paid the minimum salary of $254,000 _ although
the Rams did find room in their salary cap to throw an extra
$500,000 toward Warner. But Warner guarantees he will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants me to pay me for what I'm doing, fine,''
said the Rams' quarterback whose tale _ this remarkable tale that
defies reality and leaves even the most jaded sportswriter
awestruck at its improbability _ is being told and retold in this
Super Bowl week of media overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Cinderella merely had to live her fairy tale and never had to
tell her tale 100 times each and every day. But Warner does.
Sometimes reluctantly, sometimes gladly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though, as Warner put it, ``I've been asked the same
questions the last 20 weeks and I just answer 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to change. Money is coming, barrels of money, armored
trucks full of money, and Warner is asked _ basically _ if he is
human. Will the money change him?
</P>
<P>
   No, replies Warner. He is not materialistic. He is the same
Warner who was stocking shelves at the Hy-Vee supermarket in Cedar
Falls, Iowa, for $5.50 an hour at 3 a.m., maybe standing up once in
a while to throw a football from the meat rack at the end of Aisle
7 to a pal down by the detergent boxes in Aisle 8 ``so I could keep
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelists, Greek poets, and Shakespeare might have to be called
back to keep an eye on Warner, to see how life's lures entice _ or
don't entice _ a man who has found peace in God and _ finally _
action on an NFL football field. If the Tampa Bay Buccaneers might
have rattled his confidence a bit last Sunday, money won't shake
him. Warner guarantees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Lord wants us all to prosper and wants us all to
be successful,'' said Warner. ``And He has already given me so many
blessings this year that I can't even begin to talk about them all.
But I believe that the things I already have in my life are much
more important than any amount of money I will make, or any amount
of fame I can receive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't get the wrong impression. Kurt Warner is human, very
human. Clearly.
</P>
<P>
   As an Iowa boy, for instance, he dreamed ``every Iowa boy's
dream,'' to go to Iowa City and the University of Iowa ``and play
in Kinnick Stadium in front of all the Iowa fans . . . but it
didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It hurt. It hurt that he made only an ``unofficial visit,'' as
he put it, ``to Iowa and then I never heard from them after that.''
Iowa State was worse; the Cyclones were not interested in him at
all. Only one school in all of America showed any real interest and
that was Division 1-AA Northern Iowa, a notch below the big boys in
Division 1-A _ and the Panthers could offer him ``only
three-quarters of a scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   The football experience at Northern Iowa was not pleasant. Terry
Allen, now the coach at Kansas, chose to sit Warner until his fifth
year. And when Warner recalls those mostly-unhappy years, many of a
human's unhappy emotions pour forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a difficult situation for a while,'' said Warner, who
once was so unhappy at Northern Iowa that his mother had to
convince him not to quit the team. ``I love Coach Allen . . . I
think he's a great coach . . . I respected all the coaches there on
that staff . . . it was just a difficult time for me because there
were times when I just felt I should be playing. I felt I could
have played and been successful at that level. I just didn't get
the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Warner repeated how unhappy were those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most difficult times I've had as far as
football is concerned because I wasn't able to get out on the
field,'' he said. ``But I learned a lot at that time. I think that
was a situation that helped to strengthen me a lot. But . . .
really . . . it was probably the most difficult thing I've ever had
to go through in my football career. I realize now how it helped
get me to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Warner was very human over in Europe, playing for the
Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe. He doubted whether football in
Europe was right for him, because he was so far from his family in
the United States ``and I was in Amsterdam, which obviously is full
of temptations. The environment got difficult because I was away
from my family and it was hard being a family man for so long. That
was a difficult thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But money?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Warner. Money will not be a temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because that stuff is not important to me,'' he said.
``I believe in other things. I believe in things that are more
important to me than money and fame. People can believe that if
they want. But I know that's not going to be the case. I'm grounded
in what I believe in, and my faith and my morals are all going to
stay the same.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if it weren't for Rodney Harrison, none of this would ever
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Harrison plays for the San Diego Chargers. In the Rams'
third exhibition game, St. Louis QB Trent Green dropped back to
pass. Harrison rushed.
</P>
<P>
   So much had already been accomplished in St. Louis. The Rams had
shown their commitment to winning by spending millions to get Green
from the Redskins and more millions in signing running back
Marshall Faulk after a trade with the Colts. Coach Dick Vermeil had
listened to his assistants and had lightened up, no more of
training camp being a ``boot camp.'' All seemed in place,
especially since Green had played so well in the Rams' first two
exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrison changed all that. While on the turf, he reached out
and grabbed for Green's leg as the QB was throwing a pass. Green
went down and his knee was busted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players were in tears on the sidelines,'' recalled Vermeil.
``I remember (wide receiver) Isaac Bruce on his hands and knees
just pounding the turf in frustration.'' All that had seemed in
readiness now was gone. The St. Louis Rams were without a
quarterback. The Rams' season was over an exhibition game before it
started.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Vermeil announced in a team meeting Warner would
replace Green. Ram after Ram recalled the moment, players looking
at each other and thinking the same thoughts, that instead of Trent
Green as their quarterback, they now had this refugee from European
football; even worse, from the Arena Football League. Or, as
Vermeil put it, ``I could see players looking over at each other
and saying, `He was the scout team quarterback last year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Rams' coaches felt the same about Warner as did
the players. They had no idea what kind of quarterback he would be.
Mike Martz, the offensive coordinator, had ridden Warner
mercilessly to toughen him, to see if he could play in the NFL . .
. as a backup. Now, he was the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to figure if I was good enough to be the
backup and if I could hold that role,'' said Warner, recalling the
moment. ``So, in preseason, they were focusing in on getting me a
lot of (repititions), getting me a lot of time to really get a good
feel of what I was about as a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite literally, no one in America, least of all his coaches,
those who saw him the most, can say, ``I told you so,'' about what
happened to Kurt Warner. Except for one person.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I just had the chance, I could perform,'' he said.
``I thought I could thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `God has a plan for all of us,'' is Warner's explanation of what
so many call this fairy tale of a season. ``He does everything for
a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner is a born-again Christian and wears his faith proudly. It
is impossible to explain Warner without mentioning the prime role
of his beliefs, but the subject is sensitive. After all, this is a
football player who throws passes and he is the subject of
attention because of how well he throws those passes. Time and
again, though, he expresses his beliefs ``because I want to be the
best role model I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker expressed some of his social beliefs last month and
set off a national firestorm. Warner time and again expresses his
religious beliefs and, from time to time, some sportswriters' pens
droop and the red light of television cameras switch off. Warner
acknowledges the conundrum, that his beliefs are ``a touchy
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there on both sides of the spectrum who
believe in the Lord and He is the focus of their lives, and there
are people who don't,'' he said. ``And I realize if people start
throwing that in every article, they might lose readership. But a
lot of times, I bring it up to share the story. Some people try to
get the full story when they deal with me and guys like Isaac
(Bruce) and that's who we are and I think it needs to be in there.
Yet, there are other times when it doesn't need to be in there. But
there are other (media) people who are afraid to go into depth on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Az-Zahir Hakim is a Muslim, just as Warner acknowledges
there might be other non-Christians or atheists on his team. This
``doesn't tear the team apart,'' said Warner, ``because I think we
all believe in each other and we all know we come from different
backgrounds, and we accept that part of it even though we'd might
want everybody to come to where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, Warner has answered questions about his amazing
tale, and interspersed in his answers are strong beliefs about God.
And it is precisely this faith in God, he said, that guarantees his
belief that the millions of dollars coming his way will not change
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the person I am and the beliefs I have,'' said
Warner. ``Money is not going to change me or my beliefs. And I
don't have a problem with people trying to emulate me or be like
me. I live my life the way I think it should be lived and I don't
have a problem with people looking up to that.''

STEVE MCNAIR ARMS TITANS' ATTACK WITH HIS LEGS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Off the field, his left foot is imprisoned in a hard,
gray, plastic walking cast, a shield for an angry, relentless case
of turf toe and raging bone spurs that throb overnight like a
toothache screaming for Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop Steve McNair from running. Nothing does.
Not the pleas of his Tennessee Titans coaches to hit the ground
when that seems the prudent course of survival in general, and
protection for his surgically repaired back in particular. Not the
specter of voracious defensive linemen who seemingly have him just
about devoured, dictating a judicious dumping of the football to
spare himself a crunching reminder that he isn't shatterproof. Not
even the impression _ more lingering and nagging than any injury _
that while his feet keep moving, his right arm must have fallen
off.
</P>
<P>
   That's the unjust irony. Although nothing prevents McNair from
running, running may have prevented him from receiving his due as a
bona fide National Football League quarterback. Certainly in five
pro seasons, he has never approached the gargantuan numbers _
14,496 yards, 119 touchdowns _ he launched as a small-college
legend at Alcorn State in Lorman, Miss., where the ball was in the
air so much that it seemed like a miniature blimp hovering over the
gridiron.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, 26, acknowledges this dilemma. ``My running may have
overshadowed my passing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even running back Eddie George, while trying to pay tribute,
doesn't advance his teammate's cause when he observes, ``He's a
running back who can throw the ball very well.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Titans' offensive philosophy is as adventurous as a
slow-growth stock investment merely feeds the stigma that McNair's
job basically is not to get in the way while George carries the
load.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem a contrast that would cause consternation for a
quarterback whose college exploits inspired a dashing nickname _
``Air McNair'' _ and earned him a third-place finish in the 1994
Heisman Trophy balloting, matching the highest by a representative
of a Division 1-AA school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his growing reputation as ``Don't Err'' McNair doesn't
bother him in the slightest, at least not for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to make plays,'' he said. ``I like to do whatever it
takes. I think a quarterback has to do more than throw. I take
pride in my running.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he can take greater pride in something else. If he's an
underrated quarterback, so be it. All that matters is he's a Super
Bowl quarterback _ the second African-American to earn the
distinction, 12 years after Doug Williams was the MVP in the
Washington Redskins' 42-10 win over the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was going to put up the numbers I did in
college,'' McNair said. ``I knew things were going to change. Maybe
not as drastically as they have, but that's what happens in an
offense that emphasizes running the ball. You've got to accept it.
Quarterbacks who throw for 4,000 and 5,000 yards aren't here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McNair's passing totals are hardly breathtaking. In the
regular season, limited to 11 games by disk surgery, he threw for
2,179 yards, with 12 TDs and 8 interceptions. In the Titans' three
playoff victories, he passed for just 300 yards, with 1 TD and 2
interceptions. The emphasis is on his running: 337 yards (a 4.7
average) and 8 TDs during the season, 145 yards (6.6 average) and 3
TDs in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   His most impressive accomplishment is considered his 51-yard
bolt that set up his 1-yard TD, which put the Titans ahead for good
in their 33-14 win over the Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game.
And in three seasons as the starter, he has surpassed 3,000 yards
through the air, the benchmark for excellence, once _ and then just
barely, with 3,288 last season.
</P>
<P>
   McNair will concede that with a shrug of his 6-foot-2-inch,
225-pound frame and offer one irrefutable rebuttal: Look who's
here, waiting to take on the St. Louis Rams for the world title
Sunday in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people get caught up in statistics,'' he said. ``I
believe my job is to put us in a position to make plays, not make
mistakes. It's not about numbers, it's about winning. That's the
Titan way. When you have a great running back like Eddie George,
who is a complete back, you don't have to put up great numbers as a
quarterback. You don't have to take it all upon your shoulders. All
I try to do is put our team in the best possible position to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got the critics there. McNair was 9-2 as the starter as
Tennessee compiled a 13-3 regular-season record, and the Titans'
unlikely postseason run has brought the franchise its first Super
Bowl berth in its 40-year history, 37 of them as the Houston
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's not enough to satisfy some. There were cries to
reinsert journeyman Neil O'Donnell _ who went 4-1 as the caretaker
during McNair's convalescence _ when McNair endured a six-game
drought without a TD pass. In fact, two-thirds of his scoring
passes were condensed into two games: three in a 36-35 win over the
Bengals in the season opener, for which his reward was surgery when
his back gave out in practice the following Friday, and five in a
41-14 wipeout of the Jaguars Dec. 26. Otherwise, there was a dearth
of high-octane performances, which a host of other AFC quarterbacks
turned in routinely.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's riposte: ``Did they win or lose? There have been a lot
of 300-yard passers who didn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such attention to the bottom line is why McNair always has had
the imprimatur of the Oilers/Titans coaching staff, which made him
the No. 3 pick in the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the draft, we had a plan to get a veteran
quarterback, then draft Steve,'' said coach Jeff Fisher. ``We
wanted to bring him along slowly, watch a veteran be successful.
Never at any time did we say, `This is when he's going to be
ready.' He'd say when he was asked, `It's up to the coaches.' Then
when we asked if he was ready, he said, `OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The staff asked him after two years as an understudy to Chris
Chandler. McNair proceeded to guide the team to a pair of 8-8
finishes as the franchise endured the trauma of leaving Houston for
various Tennessee locales before its new home in Nashville
(Adelphia Stadium) and new nickname were ready this season.
</P>
<P>
   McNair recalls that after his bombs-away days at Alcorn State,
he had some misgivings about Fisher's approach. ``It was very
frustrating at first,'' he said, ``but Coach Fisher set me down and
filled me in on his style of play. It was a tremendous change from
throwing for 4,000 yards a year and throwing at least 40-50 times a
game. But now it's like playing in a more controlled offense. This
team is a team that wants to keep the chains moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Which McNair does, one way or another. And the modus operandi
doesn't bother Fisher in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a winner,'' said the coach. ``He's not a 400-yard-a-game
passer but he's an athlete. He gets things done. He'll run, pass,
make plays. If he needs to throw for 350 or 400 in a game, he'll do
that, given the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those shackles again. Opportunities are the major lack
in McNair's passing abilities. Offensive coordinator Les Steckel,
for whom an ultraconservative attack would be considered a gamble,
said, ``We believe in throwing the ball downfield. But our attitude
is low-risk because second and 10 isn't fun to look at. But there's
no doubt he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McNair once was actually ordered to do it. In a season
pocked by so much pain _ McNair says, ``I tell the trainers when I
retire, I'm going to be a head trainer at somebody's school because
I know all there is to know about the body with all the injuries
I've had'' _ he must have thought deafness had been added to the
list when he received his instructions before the opener. Hoping to
exploit Bengals mismatches he had detected, Fisher told Steckel to
aim for a 35-point output.

MONKEYING AROUND FOR A SEXY PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chevy Chase will have a leading role in my movie about the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm George W. Bush and you're not!''
</P>
<P>
   How about Kevin Spacey as Bill Bradley? Could he project that
enigmatic aura Bradley is so famous for?
</P>
<P>
   Even now, at an undisclosed location, an army of monkeys is
strumming away at computers, working to produce the screenplay. My
movie about the election will bear no resemblance to real events.
Who would buy a ticket to be bored senseless?
</P>
<P>
   My election movie will have plenty of sex and violence and
criminal behavior and all the other exciting elements we've come to
expect of politicians, once they're in office anyway. It will be a
two-thumbs-up, major, must-see, box office blockbuster. An instant
classic. The monkeys are sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when we expected politics to be serious, even
movies about politics to be serious. ``Advise &AMP; Consent.'' ``The
Best Man.'' ``All the Kings Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we expect real politics to entertain us.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the primaries have been a disappointment,
entertaiment-wise. Potential scandals haven't panned out. The
debates have yielded only the odd joke, the rare deviously clever
response, as when the born-again Bush was asked, ``Would you take
an expression like, `What would Jesus do?' into the White House?''
and he responded, ``I would take an expression into the Oval Office
of `Dear God, help me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys promise there will be no religious posturing in my
movie. What would Jesus do indeed. He wouldn't run in the first
place. If he drove the money-lenders out of the temple where would
he send some of these major campaign contributors?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, my movie will have plenty of lucrative
product placement. The candidates will wear jumpsuits, like race
car drivers, to display the names and logos of their big-money
supporters, the corporations, and special interest groups _ Disney,
Standard Oil, Sony, etc. _ who have an interest in their election.
It's just a movie. It would never work real life, would it?
</P>
<P>
   What does it say about our culture that millions of us are more
interested in what will happen on the next episode of ``The
Sopranos'' than who will prevail in the New Hampshire primary?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' has dramatic tension, plus sex, violence, waste
management, and assorted crime. Will Livia survive to plot and
scheme some more? Will Meadow get into Bates? Who squealed to the
Feds? And what about Uncle Junior's broken hip? Where's the
suspense in this election? We know who's going to win. They're just
dragging the thing out as long as possible to sell more
commercials, just like they do for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my movie. James Caan would be perfect as John
McCain. Tough, charming, potentially volatile. In another time,
when people expected politics to be serious, McCain would have
passed the foxhole test, as in, ``Which candidate would you want
next to you in a foxhole?''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question we ask about each candidate is, ``What is he
trying to hide?''
</P>
<P>
   And we ask the question hopefully. Because maybe he's trying to
hide something really interesting, something that will capture our
attention, entertain us.
</P>
<P>
   In my movie we'll find out what they're all trying to hide.
Although the monkeys insist on the following disclaimer: Any
resemblance to actual sins and felonies committed by any or all
candidates is purely coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Who will play Al Gore? A challenging casting decision. Gore has
the Tom Selleck problem, a big, good-looking guy with a girly-man
voice. Is Selleck available? Is he a bad enough actor? What do the
monkeys say?

   HONG KONG _ As a college classmate of Microsoft's Bill Gates and

   Yet, as a frustrated user of Microsoft products, I cannot help
but wish that Microsoft were broken up into two companies.

   One company would continue to be the guardian of Microsoft
Windows, which controls more than 90 percent of the market for the
operating-system program that is required on every computer.
</P>
<P>
   The other company would compete fairly and squarely in the
marketplace for software applications, by making better products
for word processing, e-mail and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   I use the computer for e-mail, word processing and browsing the
Internet. I do not do desktop publishing, spreadsheets, financial
or scientific analysis or anything else fancy. But I have three
computers at home, and I am now shopping for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   I used to have two computers, a desktop for my children and a
laptop for traveling. Then one day last year, my daughter came home
in tears over unfinished homework.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that her school had just switched to using
Microsoft's Word 97 word-processing program. We only had on our
home computers the older Word 6.0 program that I also used at my
office. The Word 6.0 program was incapable of deciphering documents
that had been typed in Word 97.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I took my daughter to the local store and discovered
that Microsoft's products were bundled in such a way that we had to
buy the entire Office 97 suite of programs, including Excel and
Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Office 97 required much more computer memory than was
on my computer, as well as more hard-disk space and a faster CPU.
We ended up buying a new computer, which, of course, meant a sale
of Windows for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, my office installed a new e-mail program, Microsoft
Outlook 98. With the Outlook program loaded, my laptop, which I
rely on during frequent business trips, began to crash regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The program required more computer memory than I had on my
laptop. I had to explain to my clients that my computer just wiped
out their e-mails. That is why I am now shopping for my fourth home
computer, which means another sale of Windows for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take a Harvard education to figure out that
Microsoft will make more money by selling bigger and more bloated
software that requires much more computer memory than is necessary.
This strategy forces its customers to buy new computers, thereby
selling more copies of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Microsoft announces more top-heavy versions of its
software that render obsolete its customers' existing computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft and the cheerleading PC magazines that depend
on it for advertising have trumpeted the fact that Microsoft's new
Office 2000 will be ``backward compatible'' with Office 97, many
features of Office 2000 will not be usable without the user also
getting the new Windows 2000 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Some early reports have concluded that Windows 2000 may need as
much as 156 megabytes of computer memory in order to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   If the programmers at Microsoft who write the applications
software were separated from the division that sells Microsoft's
cash cow, Windows, then perhaps they would be free to write better,
more innovative (and smaller) applications software.
</P>
<P>
   They might also improve on the Word word processing and Outlook
e-mail programs, which many will agree are among the most
bug-ridden, crash-prone and poorly thought-out software on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up Microsoft could also result in the shares of the
separated companies being worth more in the aggregate than the
original Microsoft shares. That would make the shareholdings of Mr.
Gates and Mr. Ballmer even more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would benefit: consumers, business customers,
Microsoft's shareholders and, not least of all, the class fund for
our upcoming 25th college reunion. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ As a college classmate of Microsoft's Bill Gates and
its new chief executive, Steven Ballmer, I have long harbored some
pride in our distant association and shamelessly name-dropped on
more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a frustrated user of Microsoft products, I cannot help
but wish that Microsoft were broken up into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   One company would continue to be the guardian of Microsoft
Windows, which controls more than 90 percent of the market for the
operating-system program that is required on every computer.

   HONG KONG _ Jeff Bezos, founder of Internet shopping giant
Amazon.com, was portrayed in Time magazine's Person of the Year
issue for 1999 as a sort of a giddy, giggly Santa. But in the legal
arena Mr. Bezos has been behaving a lot more like Scrooge.
</P>
<P>
   His company has tangled in lawsuits with the retailer Wal-Mart,
The New York Times, a feminist bookstore in Minneapolis, a Web site
in Greece and, most recently, its archenemy in the bookselling
business, Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon recently obtained a court injunction against Barnes &AMP;
Noble prohibiting it from offering on its Web site,
Barnesandnoble.com, a shopping feature called the ``Express Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   This feature allowed customers to buy an item on-line with one
click of the mouse, without having to re-enter shipping and billing
information every time they buy. If a customer had previously
entered credit card and address information, he or she would not
have to do it again with every new order.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was able to obtain a U.S. patent in September on this
``one-click'' shopping feature. So for the next 17 years any Web
site that allows its customers to order items in one step could be
infringing Amazon's patent, and might be sued for damages or
ordered to stop by the court.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the injunction, Federal Judge Marsha Pechman, whose
district encompasses Amazon's hometown, Seattle, said that Barnes &AMP;
Noble must devise an alternative system for its customers to order
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if Barnes &AMP; Noble had been allowed to offer the
one-click shopping feature during the 1999 holiday season, Amazon
``would likely lose market share and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   This case reveals fundamental flaws in the American patent
system that threaten to stunt the growth of the Internet and
e-commerce in their vulnerable infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's patent, entitled ``Method and System for Placing a
Purchase Order Via a Communications Network,'' is so overly broad
that it does not pass the laugh test.
</P>
<P>
   This is characteristic of numerous patents granted by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. Such patents are carving up huge
swathes of Internet, e-commerce and software development, by
staking these as private property that can be legally monopolized.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce lawsuits are starting to proliferate in the United
States. For example, Pitney-Bowes, a postage meter company,
recently sued Stamps.com and E-Stamp for infringing its patent for
printing stamps using printers connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, founded by a patent factory called Walker Digital
that has more than 200 patents pending, sued Microsoft's Expedia
for infringing its patent for on-line hotel pricing and booking
service.
</P>
<P>
   Such lawsuits will undoubtedly multiply in the future,
especially as more so-called ``submarine patents'' surface.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the patent systems in most countries, patent applications
in the United States are generally secret until the patent has been
granted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amazon applied for its patent in 1997 (an eon ago
in Internet time), but the patent was granted and its existence
made known only in September.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble accused Amazon of purposely delaying the
application process so that the patent was issued just before the
1999 holiday season. In the past there have been numerous patent
holders who surfaced years or even decades after their inventions
were commercialized. They can then literally conduct legal
blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, under the new Inventors Protection Act of 1999
passed by the U.S. Congress in November, patent applications that
have also been filed abroad will now be required to be published 18
months after application.
</P>
<P>
   The new law makes many much-needed reforms, but numerous defects
and loopholes remain in the 210-year old U.S. patent system that
will keep lawyers busy well into the next millennium. &QL;

   BY ROBERT FISK, The Independent of London &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S BACKGROUNDER: ``Independent'' correspondent Robert
Fisk has long denounced the use of depleted uranium (DU) shells in
both the Gulf War and NATO's conflict in Kosovo last year. After
repeatedly citing evidence of an alarming increase in cancer cases
linked to DU, particularly in the southern Iraqi city of Basra _ as
well as its possible link to the deadly ``Gulf War Syndrome'' in
Allied troops _ Fisk and several human-rights groups have now
pressured scientists from Britain's Royal Society to carry out an
independent investigation into the dangers of depleted uranium.) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In Iraq, there are doctors aplenty who would like to
meet the six scientists from Britain's Royal Society chosen Monday
to investigate the damage, human and environmental, wreaked by
Western use of depleted uranium (DU) shells in both the Gulf War
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the main Basra teaching hospital, the cancer sufferers who
live near the fields where depleted uranium shells (DU) were fired
by the hundreds in 1991 queue at the door of the tiny cancer clinic
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   But will the British scientists meet them? Will they go to Iraq
and study the documentation of Basra's leading cancer specialist,

   LONDON _ A team of scientists from Britain's Royal Society is to
carry out an independent investigation into the dangers of depleted
uranium (DU), amid growing evidence that use of the material in
shells and missiles is a cause of Gulf War Syndrome and has led to
an increase in cancers among those in close contact with the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The move will fuel accusations by veterans and human-rights
groups that inquiries so far undertaken by Britain's Ministry of
Defense (MoD) have been little short of a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were first used by British and American troops
during the Gulf War, and they have been the subject of controversy
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A recent series of tests on British veterans suffering from Gulf
War Syndrome found DU traces in 30 out of 48 cases. &QL;

   &UR; (EDITOR'S BACKGROUNDER: ``Independent'' correspondent Robert
Fisk has long denounced the use of depleted uranium (DU) shells in
both the Gulf War and NATO's conflict in Kosovo last year. After
repeatedly citing evidence of an alarming increase in cancer cases
linked to DU, particularly in the southern Iraqi city of Basra _ as
well as its possible link to the deadly ``Gulf War Syndrome'' in
Allied troops _ Fisk and several human-rights groups have now
pressured scientists from Britain's Royal Society to carry out an
independent investigation into the dangers of depleted uranium.) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In Iraq, there are doctors aplenty who would like to
meet the six scientists from Britain's Royal Society chosen Monday
to investigate the damage, human and environmental, wreaked by
Western use of depleted uranium (DU) shells in both the Gulf War
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the main Basra teaching hospital, the cancer sufferers who
live near the fields where depleted uranium shells (DU) were fired
by the hundreds in 1991 queue at the door of the tiny cancer clinic
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   But will the British scientists meet them? Will they go to Iraq
and study the documentation of Basra's leading cancer specialist,
Dr. Jawad al-Ali, who has maps showing the rate of leukemia growth
in the areas where Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's tanks were torn
apart by DU in the last days of the war?

TIME FOR ELIAN TO RETURN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of the maelstrom stands a 6-year-old boy. Just a
little kid.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what Elian Gonzalez really thinks _ though there
are plenty of people who seem willing to think for him.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, braving the Straits of Florida like thousands of
refugees before him, he landed near Fort Lauderdale aboard a raft.
Seven people died on the trip while only three survived it. Elian's
mother was among the casualties.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief hospitalization, Elian was released to relatives
in Miami, and ceased being a mere child. He became a celebrity,
then the unwitting pawn in a political chess match.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to end the game. It's time for Elian to be returned to
Cuba and reunited with his father and grandparents. Time to stop
chronicling his every move, showering him with gifts and trips to
Disney World. Time for the clock to strike midnight, and for him to
return to his real life.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment of his arrival, Elian has been used in the fight
against Fidel Castro's regime. Exile activists in Miami quickly
found allies to block his return to Cuba. One of the first to dash
into the spotlight was Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who
proclaimed to waiting television crews that he would sponsor
legislation to keep Elian in the United States. What this has to do
with the Granite State is anyone's guess _ but it is an election
year, and the GOP covets the Cuban-American vote.
</P>
<P>
   For years, America's shores were wide open to refugees from one
of the more repressive regimes in the hemisphere. That changed in
the mid-1990s, when a tide of refugees ran headlong into
anti-immigration sentiment in other parts of the country. The
standard practice of the past five years has been to return
refugees to Cuba, via the US military installation at Guantanamo
Bay. But not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, supporters of asylum for Elian are on thin ice, and
they know it. For all their claims that he must not be thrust back
into the arms of an evil nation, it is not enough simply to be a
refugee from a communist country. There must be a well-founded
claim that one would personally face persecution if returned, which
is not true in this case. Just the opposite, Elian would likely
return to Cuba as a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the basis of his claim _ that he comes from Cuba?''
asked Ira Kurzban, a renowned immigration lawyer in Miami. ``If
that were the standard, we'd have another 5 or 6 million Cubans in
the country, and probably a billion Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea that custody, which legally rests now with
Attorney General Janet Reno, should be granted to his distant
relatives in Miami, both state and federal law give heavy priority
to parents. No one has made a serious claim that his father is an
unfit parent, only that he lives in an unfit country. That isn't
the legal standard.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Elian's father has called for his return to
Cuba. Those pleas have counted for little in some quarters, shot
down by those who, to give them the benefit of every doubt, find it
immoral to ship a child from a free country to one under communist
rule. Elian's father, they insist, must have been coerced.
</P>
<P>
   Few political figures tap raw emotions like Castro. For two
generations of exiles, especially in Miami, he has been the
ultimate frustration, the immoveable force. Even after
assassination attempts and 40 years of protest and economic
embargo, he is still there. Nearly a decade after communism
collapsed in most other places, he remains in power, smoking cigars
and making very long speeches.
</P>
<P>
   One activist told the Miami Herald a couple of weeks ago, ``This
boy must not become a trophy for Fidel.'' But does it follow that
he must become a trophy for the other side?
</P>
<P>
   The law at every level encourages uniting families, yet in this
case that commitment evaporates. Reno, who could have settled this
with early decisive action, waffled instead. No state judge in
Miami, where judges are elected, is going to send Elian back to
Cuba. The White House seems happy to leave the case, and the
political fallout, to Congress. All sides are showing political
courage as we've come to know it.
</P>
<P>
   All but lost in this is a child. One who must have little sense
of what is happening around him, who probably thinks TV trucks
follow everyone in this strange new country. It's no way for a
child for grow up, as the prize in a war. It isn't just the law
that demands his return to his father. Common decency does as well.

DOUBLECLICK'S DOUBLE CROSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I &UR;  &LR; try to avoid repeating myself, but some topics rate a
double dose of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I wrote in a semijocular vein about an
Internet advertising firm called DoubleClick Inc. that planned to
deploy a new system for tracking the on-line activities of millions
of Web surfers. Now I learn that its system has been activated, and
I'm not smiling anymore.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, businesses have long tracked our Web activities with
the aid of cookies _ little identifiers that are stored on your
computer and read by the Web sites you visit. Cookies let you go
to, say, The New York Times Web site every day without having to
reenter your password. But the cookie doesn't tell The New York
Times computer who you are. It recognizes your browser, not the
individual sitting in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick distributes Internet advertisements and cookies on
about 1,500 popular Web sites, including those run by Wired Online
and the AltaVista search service. Millions of us have DoubleClick
cookies squirreled away on our browsers. No problem _ until
DoubleClick this month began linking their cookies to people's
names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   If you think Regis Philbin's questions are easy, check out
Netdeals.com. This site just asks for your name and address in its
million-dollar giveaway contest. Your chances of winning are
minimal, of course. But DoubleClick wins every time someone enters.
They've got a deal going with Netdeals and a number of other sites.
Netdeals provides your personal data to DoubleClick and links it to
a cookie on your machine. Whenever you visit any other DoubleClick
site, they'll know it's you. And they'll track the pages you read
and how long you stay there, in an effort to build a personality
profile they can use to sell you stuff.
</P>
<P>
   All this is buried in a mass of small-print legalese at the base
of the Netdeals Web site, which allows the DoubleClickers to say
that the information is all provided voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want DoubleClick looking over your shoulder, the
company lets you ``opt out.'' But the opt-out page is buried so
deep on the DoubleClick site that its Web address is a good six
inches long. Make it easy on yourself: Go to opt-out.cdt.org, where
you will find instructions on how to get off DoubleClick's list.
</P>
<P>
   When DoubleClick was founded, its privacy policy said the
company would not track individuals. Now, they promise that they'll
stop tracking you _ if you ask nicely. Somehow I don't think their
word is worth a whole lot. Better to put your faith in technology.
</P>
<P>
   I've long used Jason Catlett's Internet Junkbuster to filter out
smutty Web ads. The same free software can also be set up to block
all cookies, or just the ones coming from doubleclick.net. Get a
copy at www.junkbusters.com. But be prepared for a bit of
tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   For the average user with a few dollars to spend, there are
simpler choices:
</P>
<P>
   --At www.kburra.com, you'll find Cookie Pal, a $15 program that
you can try out for free for 30 days. It can notify you of incoming
cookies, and let you block them all, or you can easily list
individual cookies that are unwelcome _ from doubleclick.net, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   --You can pay $20 for InterMute (www.intermute.com), a more
sophisticated product made in Braintree, Mass. Intermute blocks
ads, animated images, and music, as well as the cookies of your
choice.Please be sure to block doubleclick.net.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am hammering these guys. I hate it when greedheads spoil
a good idea, just so they can park a couple more Porsches in the
garage. Cookies are a clever way for honest merchants to
personalize their Web pages without invading their customers'
privacy. If DoubleClick succeeds in perverting the concept,
consumers and merchants alike will suffer, as more people start
refusing all cookies for the sake of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm more selective. I'm just going to ban DoubleClick from every
computer I own, and urge other Web sites to stop hosting
DoubleClick's intolerably nosy cookies. If you value your privacy,
you'll do the same.

HALF OF MASS., N.H. ELDERLY WITHOUT DRUG COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Half of all elders in Massachusetts and New Hampshire
lack any insurance coverage for prescription drugs, a new survey
has found, magnifying the problem beyond earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely cited previous figure, used by the
pharmaceutical industry, is that one-third of Americans over age 65
lack drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey, made available to The Boston Globe Wednesday,
``indicates there is a higher proportion of elders than we thought
who have no drug coverage at all,'' said Nancy Turnbull, a Harvard
School of Public Health researcher involved in the survey. ``I
really think the crisis we have in prescription drug coverage is
getting dramatically worse in a very short amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The data come at a time when prescription drug coverage is
rising on the national political agenda, with proliferating
proposals from both parties in Congress and a surge in state
legislation on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   A working group of the US Conference of Mayors Wednesday passed
a strongly worded resolution calling on Congress to add
prescription drug coverage to Medicare, investigate price
regulation of pharmaceuticals, and consider a ``windfall profits''
tax on pharmacuetical companies to fund drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're raising the visibility of this issue among mayors,''
said Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who sponsored the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical industry representatives have met with top
Clinton administration officials twice this month to discuss adding
drug coverage to Medicare. An industry-connected group has abruptly
changed the tone of television ads on Medicare drug coverage, from
one warning of government interference to a more conciliatory
search for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of frustrated people throughout the country
and they're very active in expressing their frustration,'' said
Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America. ``We've got to be aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four out of five Massachusetts and New Hampshire residents 65
and older say prescription drug coverage and other health issues
will be important factors in the way they cast their election-year
ballots, the new survey found.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than half of the surveyed elders said the health
positions of presidential candidates will be an ``important
factor'' in their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers are very high,'' said Brad Bannon of Bannon
Communications Research, a Washington polling firm that conducted
the survey among 400 Massachusetts and New Hampshire elders. The
survey has a 5-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the surveyed elders said they often worried
about not being to afford prescription drugs or out-of-pocket
medical costs. This was more than those who said they worried about
not being able to choose their own doctors and hospitals or not
being able to get needed tests and other medical services.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was commissioned by the Massachusetts Health Policy
Forum, a group of academic institutions and consumer organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers not connected with the new survey said its
finding that half of all elders have no drug coverage may actually
understate the problem, since many elders who do have pharmacy
insurance often have inadequate or only intermittent coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to adjust for how lousy the coverage is in many
plans, a 50 percent coverage rate is really a gross underestimate
of the need,'' said Stephen Soumerai of Harvard Medical School and
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.

 ATLANTA: ... point output.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So we had to throw,'' said Steckel. ``You can't get 35 points
running the football. So we just came out and threw the ball all
over the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two times in all. McNair completed 21 of those passes for
341 yards in the 1-point squeaker. ``He liked that,'' said Steckel.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because it rekindled such fond memories. During his
glory days at Alcorn, 341 yards would have represented about three
quarters of production.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the collegiate level, that's what he did _ the vertical
passing game,'' said his Alcorn coach Cardell Jones. ``There wasn't
a pass he couldn't throw. He can throw that 20-yard out, the
toughest pass there is, and throw it on a line.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones should know. He was about the only college coach willing
to put the ball in McNair's hands.
</P>
<P>
   McNair came out of tiny, remote Mount Olive, Miss., where he and
four siblings were raised by their mother, Lucille, in a trailer
home. He had his pick of Division 1-A powers. Miami, Mississippi
State, Florida, and Notre Dame all wanted him. As a defensive back.
McNair didn't want that. Or them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision was based at what level does Steve McNair want to
play at in college,'' he said. ``I wanted to be a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   His problem was that in addition to his passing prowess, he had
led Mississippi defensive backs in interceptions. That was the
statistic that interested the big football schools. Which was
Jones's good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done a lot of work studying him,'' said Jones. ``I saw
he had a fluid motion, about 4.4 or 4.45 speed (in the 40-yard
dash), and he was as elusive as any tailback. I don't think (the
high-profile colleges) realized what an impact he could make on
offense. I've always felt you couldn't have a good offense without
a triggerman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones hadn't intended to give McNair the gun so quickly. He
had a junior installed as the starter and, like the Oilers, planned
to groom McNair gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman toppled that timetable in a hurry. In his first
scrimmage, he hit all eight of his passes, of every sort. In his
second scrimmage, he went 10 for 12. And in the season opener,
against one of Eddie Robinson's legendary Grambling powerhouses,
Alcorn struggled early, so Jones threw in McNair to see what he
could do. McNair proceeded to throw Grambling for a loop. He
accumulated 447 yards in total offense, accounted for 3 TDs, and
led Alcorn 87 yards for the winning score in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The aerial circus was on, only to be grounded by professional
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Jones finds that somewhat curious, but he understands the
context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a tremendous passer,'' said the coach. ``But I know
he's a great team player and I know he wants to fit in to the team
confines. He's totally unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   His Titans teammates fully appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the situation, and McNair knows that people
think he is not going to win,'' said fullback Lorenzo Neal. ``And
he just wins. He finds a way to win, whether they're scoring 14
points or 41 points. All he does is get the wins.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the carping continues that he's not a total
quarterback, that's the only quarterback total that matters to
McNair.

REVOLUTION INTEREST SEEMS ON THE SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution have compiled one of the best
attendance records in Major League Soccer. But after four
successive losing seasons, the buzz around the team appears to be
leveling off, judging by the lack of media at the Foxboro Stadium
bubble this week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the lack of attention is timing and the
inhospitable combination of cold weather and indoor training.
Interest should increase once the regular season draws near _ the
Revolution visit Miami March 18 _ but four years of on-field
underachieving have done less to stimulate than to stifle
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we achieve good things this year,''
midfielder Leonel Alvarez said Wednesday. ``We need to play well
and get results at the beginning of the season to recapture the
fans who have gone away because of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 410,000 spectators attended soccer matches at Foxboro
Stadium last year, but the most spectacular attendances were for
the MLS Cup and Women's World Cup matches. The average Revolution
crowd was 16,629, a decrease of about 2,000 per game from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the last two seasons, the Revolution won only 16 of 64
games in regulation time, and most of those victories could be
credited to the goalkeeping of Walter Zenga last year and his
coaching the year before.
</P>
<P>
   So, managing director Sunil Gulati and coach Fernando Clavijo
have started to make changes. They have yet to restore the defense,
but the points of reference in midfield and attack are being
established with Alvarez, Eduardo Hurtado, and Mauricio Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are clicking with each other and I am seeing some
very good soccer,'' Clavijo said. ``This team can only improve. And
I am not going to rest until we make improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pointed out that there is no guarantee that conditions
will improve with the Revolution, who have finished with the
ninth-, eighth-, 12th-, and 11th-best records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can get worse,'' Clavijo said. ``But not with me. Even
if I have to play with five rookies, we will have a good team. Even
if you have good players do not necessarily mean you will have a
good team. But I think we are two starting players, plus a good
bench, away from having a team which can challenge for the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution will have to galvanize quickly. They will
play five exhibition games in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., starting Feb.
8 and four in Guadalajara, Mexico, starting Feb. 29. The first four
MLS games are in Miami, Tampa Bay (March 25), Los Angeles (April
1), and Dallas (April 8).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get results wherever you are playing, and if you
are a good team you can do that,'' Alvarez said. ``The important
thing is to qualify for the playoffs and the way you accomplish
that is by working every day toward a goal. All of that starts now.
And we want to achieve more than just make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only been together for three days, so it is hard to
make any profound statements. But there is harmony and friendship
on this team and the coaching staff is not only serious and
responsible, but also part of this harmony.''

FRANCIS' ISOLATION SHOWS TYSON IN CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Who the story is was clear from the empty seats on the
bus to Aldershot Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime officials had arranged a two-hour bus trip for the
media to the British Army barracks where 35-year-old Julius Francis
was preparing, under military supervision, for his Saturday night
bit of hand-to-hand combat with Mike Tyson. The theory was a story
or two would come out of this visit to the tiny cubicle where
Francis has been bunking each day while Tyson luxuriated in a hotel
suite at the Grosvenor House when he wasn't across the way at the
posher Park Lane Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It was costing Tyson $750 a day for lodging (meals not included)
as he prepared to earn $12 million. It was costing Francis 28
pounds five (also known as about $50 a day) for three hots and a
cot at Aldershot. Obviously, this was an interesting story. It was
also a story only five people chose to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   That's because this week, as usual, Tyson is the story in the
United Kingdom, just as he is when he fights in the United States.
He is the one people are pursuing. He is the reason 21,000 tickets
were sold in less than two days at new MEN Arena in Manchester. He
is the reason arrangements were made by Showtime officials to air
the fight on tape delay at home. That way it could be shown live on
prime time pay-per-view in England, instead of in the wee hours of
the morning as is usually the case when a major American boxing
star comes to Europe to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Everything being said or done this week is about Tyson, which is
not only to be expected but was part of the plan formed by trainers
Tommy Brooks and Jay Bright, manager Shelly Finkel, and Showtime
executives from the start. The idea was to find some way to rebuild
the confidence Tyson once seemed to possess in abundance when he
was in the ring. Some way to remind him ``TYSON'' still exists,
even if Tyson doesn't quite believe it any more.
</P>
<P>
   Buster Douglas took some of that away from him. Evander
Holyfield erased the bulk of it when he gave Tyson a schoolyard
whipping, and then broke his mind down in their rematch and forced
him to disqualify himself for illegal ear tasting. Then life piled
on Tyson, to hear him tell it, and he became a professional victim.
Not an interview went by in which he didn't proclaim some form of
slight or unwarranted attack had been put upon him.
</P>
<P>
   In the States, the public grew weary of that. But it's all new
over here, so he has been lent a more sympathetic ear. And what has
grown from that, Tyson's people believe, is a renewed belief that,
as Jesse Jackson would put it, ``I am somebody!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's refreshed,'' said Bright, who has known Tyson since they
grew up in Cus D'Amato's legendary old farmhouse in Catskill, N.Y.
``He has a renewed interest in his performance in front of people.
The public reaction here has made him want to perform exquistely in
front of them on Saturday. He hasn't felt that way for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's people will tell you he hasn't felt that way because he
has been beaten up by guys like Holyfield and beaten down by the
press and the public in the States who, he says, have tormented and
exploited him.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, Tyson is right. But at the end of the day, it all
comes back to him. To the choices he has made, and the lifestyle he
has led, and continues to lead even here.
</P>
<P>
   For example, TYSON made headlines this week when Tyson spent
$1.6 million on an emerald bracelet and watch combination for TYSON
at a time when Tyson still has serious financial woes and unpaid
legal bills back home. Over here, it was a brilliant shopping
spree. In the United States, it would have been the actions of a
lunatic who can't count.
</P>
<P>
   And so you have it. Same guy, two perspectives, one attempt to
renew an aging fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be good for him,'' Finkel said. ``The reception
has been incredible. Even before the problem with his last fight
(when he was nearly disqualified for hitting Orlin Norris after the
bell and ended up with a one-round no-contest in Las Vegas), I told
Mike I wanted to go to someplace outside the U.S. I thought it
would be good for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mob scene everywhere he goes and that's renewed him a
little bit. He goes for a run in the park and it's like locust
following him. Here the people just want to see Mike. They don't
even care who the opponent is.''
</P>
<P>
   That was made obvious by the 30 empty seats on the bus to
Aldershot. Few people wanted to talk with Francis, a born-again
ex-con with a story of his own to tell. It's an interesting story
too and we'll get to it one day if we have enough time before he's
left unconscious on the floor . But for now the story is TYSON
reborn, not merely The Troubles of Tyson, which was the idea all
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different attitude over here,'' Finkel said.
``They see him differently.''
</P>
<P>
   They do indeed. He is still a star here not merely a freak show
or a train wreck waiting to happen. He is still ``Iron Mike'' as
they call him even now, long after the iron has begun to rust. In
the United Kingdom, he is ``MIKE TYSON'' and his handlers are
hoping he'll feel the same way by the time this trip is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm TYSON,'' Tyson said. ``At home I'm Mike. He's a
different person. He's a father and husband. But out here I'm
TYSON. I'm nobody. You understand what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really, but what he probably means is there is Mike Tyson
the man and then there is the phenomenon known as TYSON.
</P>
<P>
   So far Mike Tyson growls like TYSON and hits like TYSON and
inspires fear like TYSON and sells tickets like TYSON. Whether he
can fight like TYSON anymore is a different matter however, a fact
the former champion admitted no amount of hype can change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not all the way back yet,'' said Tyson, now 33. ``My
balance. My footwork. I'm working on the little things, because if
you don't remember the little things, you won't remember the big
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm doing some things better than when I was champion.
I know I punch harder. But I have a litle ways to go yet. I just
wish I was as good as everyone says I look.''
</P>
<P>
   So there it was, buried deep but not yet washed away in the
10-day explosion of hype and hysteria that has surrounded him in
England. Even amidst all that, the doubt remains.
</P>
<P>
   It lingers inside Tyson even as the public in England has
elevated him back to a sporting superstar, hanging behind iron
gates in front of his hotel all day in hopes of getting just a
glimpse of him.
</P>
<P>
   TYSON may have been reincarnated here but doubts do not
disappear as quickly as a star can be reborn. Doubts remain inside
about many things. Deep inside.
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 days of hype there was no doubt about who the story
is in England today.
</P>
<P>
   All those empty bus seats to Aldershot proved that.

CREATING OFFENSE HIGH ON BRUINS' CHECKLIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Firewagon hockey it is not, but the Bruins have been
noticeably more proactive, sometimes even risk-takers, on the ice
in the last week. They've abandoned the neutral-zone trap and gone
back, at least in tiny spurts, to a slightly uptempo forechecking
game that has two forwards pressuring the defense.
</P>
<P>
   New century. Old-time hockey. Not only are the results slightly
better, but it's a more interesting _ dare we say entertaining? _
product to watch.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, is it more fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it is,'' said veteran forward Steve Heinze. ``It's
more fun when you're forcing guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It was noticeable Thursday night in Tampa that the Bruins,
dropping like a rock in the Eastern Conference standings the last
two months, finally moved away from their mid-ice tug of war that
was quickly making them a non-contender. They exchanged a few
back-and-forth rushes with the Lightning and finished with a 4-2
victory. They weren't quite as bold two nights later against the
Panthers, a 4-3 loss in overtime, but again there were some flashes
of speed and some improved playmaking. Ditto Monday night in
another overtime loss, 4-3, to the Flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting there,'' said Heinze. ``It's so close, you can
almost taste it. You score a couple of goals, win a game, and it's
like, `OK, here it comes again.' It's like it's right there, just
out of your grasp. We're not quite there yet, but I think we're
getting closer.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they are skating, moving their legs, proof that they're
more involved. The trap worked well for two seasons, the Bruins
able to clog up the middle, typically with only one forward
forechecking, and win their share of games with defense and
goaltending and an offense initiated by opposition mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   For myriad reasons, that laid-back, wait-and-see,
cash-in-on-miscues approach failed miserably over the course of
40-plus games this season. They have 32 games remaining, including
Thursday's visit by the Canadiens. It appears the Bruins' only hope
to reach the playoffs is now pegged to their ability to get back to
pursuing the puck, create their chances, and turn on-ice
opportunities into on-the-scoreboard results. Mired in the trap,
they barely were getting a handful of legitimate scoring chances
each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to create more offense,'' said veteran
winger Rob DiMaio. ``It's a little different out there, that's all.
Your first thought is to react one way _ because you've been
playing a certain system for a long time _ and this game is all
reaction. Is it more fun? Well, it's not that much different,
really. The key is, get two men on their (defensemen), limit their
time and space. We were so trap-oriented before that maybe we were
backing off too much.''
</P>
<P>
   As the forwards attempt to keep the play up ice, and keep play
toward their offensive net, the Boston defensemen also must move up
a zone. Rather than being backed into their own zone, with play
headed their way, ideally they're in the neutral zone, taking the
puck away and springing the transition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more involved on defense,'' said Kyle McLaren. ``We're
standing guys up more in the neutral zone this way. But still, our
No. 1 issue is defense. We have to play solid defensively, because
we can't run and gun with teams. But if our forwards move up, we
have to move up, too, you've always got to be aware of keeping that
gap closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the new approach, there undoubtedly will be growing pains.
Case in point: the overtime goals by Florida and Calgary. But for a
club that was destined to be booted from the playoffs before the
calendar flipped to March, the forechecking game essentially
presents itself as a 20-man lifeboat in a sea of certain defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Somethin' was broke, and for now, the forecheck is a possible
fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pressure more, you'll give up chances,'' said coach
Pat Burns, who slowly has yielded to the inevitable. ``But, you'll
probably get more, too.''

COMMON COACHES GO WITH THE RAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The jury is in and the verdict goes to St. Louis.
Unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Super Bowl participants, St. Louis and Tennessee, had
four common opponents this season (San Francisco, Cleveland,
Cincinnati, and Baltimore).
</P>
<P>
   This week, the coaches from those teams _ Steve Mariucci, 49ers;
Chris Palmer, Browns; Bruce Coslet, Bengals; and offensive
coordinator Matt Cavanaugh of the Ravens (head coach Brian Billick
was in the Caribbean on a family vacation and could not be reached)
were asked to analyze the game, pick a winner, and a possible
score.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they had to say:
</P>
<P>
   --Mariucci: ``I would have felt a lot better about making this
pick before St. Louis played Tampa Bay. I didn't think Tampa could
play them that tough (11-6), and it's the first time I saw St.
Louis a little uncertain this year on offense. Plus, Tennessee is
coming into this game playing the best football of the season. They
seem to be hitting a peak. We beat Tennessee early in the year, but
they weren't playing the way they are now. (Quarterback Steve)
McNair was out of the lineup then. Neil O'Donnell played. McNair is
an unusual weapon. He showed that in Jacksonville. When you have a
passer who can run out of there and make four or five big plays in
a game in the running game like he did, then this will put added
pressure on the St. Louis defense. I think Tennessee will try to
contain (Marshall Faulk) and then come after (Rams quarterback)
Warner. I think it's going to be a very close game. Turnovers will
be the difference. Tennessee has been winning games getting
turnovers, and making the most out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important factor will be the Tennessee kickers against the
St. Louis returners. (Tony) Horne on kickoff and (Az-Zahir) Hakim
on punt returns, are explosive. (Titan punter Craig) Hentrich is
going to have to spot the ball well in places where the coverages
teams have a good shot at pinning those guys in on the sideline.
Same way on the kickoffs. I watched the film of the first game they
played each other. Tennessee got three turnovers in the first half
and went up 21-0, then St. Louis adjusted and dominated the second
half. They lost, but they were the better team at the end. I like
St. Louis in a close game, 28-27, but turnovers will make the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   --Cavanaugh: ``St. Louis is a big-play team, and you can get
some big plays on the Tennessee secondary. We played them late in
the year, and we had a lot of big plays on them, and we don't have
all of the weapons that St. Louis does. Tampa did a great job in
shutting down St. Louis by playing a tough zone defense, and making
it difficult for Warner to throw on time. He was out of rhythm.
Tennessee plays one style of defense, and one only. Most of the
time they are almost in an eight-man front when they move (Blaine)
Bishop up there, and their corners are in man-to-man. It's very
hard, I think, to play St. Louis man-to-man. Tennessee has to count
on Eddie George having a big day running the ball, and controlling
the clock. McNair is not a big threat in the passing game, so St.
Louis will concentrate on stopping George, and forcing Tennessee to
throw more, which they don't want to do. The game is on turf and
St. Louis is the faster team. I think it will be St. Louis,
27-17.''
</P>
<P>
   --Coslet: ``I love the St. Louis defense. Everyone talks about
their offense, but to me, their defense is as good as any team we
played against this year. This (defensive end) Kevin Carter is an
outstanding player. Don't sell their defense short. I'm not sold on
McNair. I don't think he is a great passer. He is a wonderful
playmaker, and a great runner. He had won a game late in the season
when he was unconscious and had a spectacular day against
Jacksonville, but outside of that he has been just average throwing
the ball. And it will hurt them that (Yancey) Thigpen is not
playing. He's their best wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched Warner all year and I think the kid is for real.
He can play. He is a very accurate passer and what he really does
well is get the ball to the receivers on the front half of their
body, so they can catch it in stride and keep going upfield with
it. This is why (St. Louis's) wide receivers are so good after the
catch. He hits them on the run. (Coach Jeff) Fisher does a great
job with the Tennessee defense. They are a physical bunch. They
always have seven or eight guys around the ball, playing hard,
looking to strip it and get turnovers. If (the Titans) play their
usual type of defense, then I think St. Louis will hurt them in the
passing game. The score for me would be St. Louis, 27-17.''
</P>
<P>
   --Palmer: ``Tennessee plays an automatic (defensive) front and
the same coverage all year. They work everything they do off of
that. A big part of what they did was (free safety) Marcus
Robertson. He's a very good player, and important to their scheme.
It's going to hurt them with him not playing. (Anthony) Dorsett is
an athletic kid, with good speed, but the way St. Louis plays
offense, is going to cause Dorsett a lot of problems. St. Louis is
shifting and moving players around on offense every play. Dorsett
has never played against something like this before. I think there
will be many times in the game he will be confused, and if he does
make some big mistakes, then St. Louis will take advantage of that
and make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``On turf, St. Louis will have the speed advantage. I said last
week before the Jacksonville game, and I'll say it again: You must
tackle McNair. If youdon't tackle him and get him on the ground, he
will kill you with his running. He is harder to tackle than Eddie
George. And if St. Louis doesn't get him on the ground, he'll make
big plays against them, just like he did in Jacksonville. To me a
big question for St. Louis is can (smallish linebacker London)
Fletcher tackle McNair? I think St. Louis will win something like
35-14. Tennessee will need a lot of turnovers to stay with them and
with Robertson and Thigpen out with injuries, I don't think they
will play as well as they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seemed to be that St. Louis has the edge because:
</P>
<P>
   1.) Tennessee has key players injured.
</P>
<P>
   2.) McNair cannot score a lot of points in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   3.) The Rams have the better chance to gain the field-position
advantage with their two exceptional return men.
</P>
<P>
   4.) Tennessee will not be able to run the ball consistently
against the Rams' league-leading run defense.

PUTTING OUTRAGE TO BETTER USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Linda,'' says a friend, ``you have a problem with outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me,'' I reply. ``I'm in the process of solving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you an example.
</P>
<P>
   I own some knee-high winter boots that look as if they're made
of an exotic golden fur. I saw an identical pair years ago in a
Denver airport on a beautiful, long-legged blonde rushing for a
plane, and immediately realized that the only thing she had that I
could ever possess was her boots. Finding a pair, I bought them and
have been wearing them every winter for the past 10 years. They
create quite a stir wherever I go, especially with youngsters. This
day I'm in a doctor's waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at those boots, Mommy!'' whispers a 4-year-old. As she
and her younger sister stare, I call them over and deliver my
standard speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are polar bear boots,'' I explain as they pet the
synthetic fur, ``but they're not real polar bear fur. They're fake
polar bear fur because I would never, never hurt a real bear just
so I could have a pair of boots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would,'' proclaims the mother loudly.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   One choice is to say, ``People are jerks.'' Shrug. Thumb through
a magazine. Go numb rather than crazy. This response unfortunately
is not available to a person whose idea of true happiness consists
of observing a family of deer for hours at the Grand Canyon,
watching beavers at dusk in Vermont, and looking forward to seeing
the pair of woodpeckers who visit her bird feeder every day.
Little, big, reptile, mammal, crawling, flying, swimming _ it's all
the same joy to me as long as the creatures with whom I'm sharing
life on this planet are wild and free. All it took for me to
encounter the depths of my own capacity for awe was to follow the
elaborately well-executed and well-traveled path created by
leaf-cutter ants for a quarter of a mile in the jungle in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of one of history's greatest period of mass
extinctions, my passion for all living things is a liability, not a
strength, but it does make it impossible for me to brush off a
mom's suggestion that a dead polar bear is a small price to pay for
a handsome pair of boots.
</P>
<P>
   I could have confronted her. I can imagine options, from
engaging in an earnest discussion to hitting her over the head with
my boot, but what would I have accomplished? I know a futile
undertaking when I see one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I decided to label this mom's words my Outrage of the
Day. It became that day's sign that civilization is definitely
doomed, that our undue influence on earth will end because of our
own fatal limitations, and that nature will then promote some
other, more promising creature into the limelight. Why I feel
compelled to reach this conclusion almost every day of my life, I
do not know. (``Mom, was it something you said?'' ``Dad, am I your
pessimism recycled?'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, being who I am, I can't avoid outrage entirely. I can't
imagine ever accepting insanity as normative _ whether it's as
seemingly insignificant as
``just-another-example-of-pop-culture-fun-and-games'' or something
as disheartening as 
``man's-all-too-usual-inhumanity-to-his-perceived-as-loathsome-enemy
-of-the-moment.'' But given my nature, I have figured out that a
single outrage works just as well as 50.
</P>
<P>
   Just think what can happen if I succeed at this.
</P>
<P>
   One really good Outrage per Day confirms that I am a person who
still cares about the degree to which love is absent from so many
aspects of life on this earth. Task accomplished. I can now move on
to the real business of my life: trying to make my own love felt by
the few people whose lives I actually influence in the small space
I actually inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, I suspect being outraged at others is one way of
avoiding disappointment in myself. It is my way of diminishing by
comparison my myriad failures to follow my own higher impulses. It
is also a way of dissipating energy I could put to far better use
by making reparations for acts and attitudes I don't want to take
responsibility for.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else will have to take over my portion of outrage about
Pinochet's callousness, about corporate greed, about demonizing the
tiny island of Cuba, about widespread indifference to the plight of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll work on being a little less callous, a little less
greedy, a little less demonizing, a little less indifferent myself.

COMING TOGETHER ON COMING APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Child psychologist Arnold Stolberg of Richmond, Va., had
counseled nearly 500 divorcing parents on how to talk to their
children when he found himself needing to follow his own advice.
But even years of professional experience didn't prepare him for
how his eldest son, then 9, would respond to the news of his
parents' impending divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh told a joke and walked away,'' says Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, his voice still registers surprise.
</P>
<P>
   How parents tell their children that they're breaking up and how
children react to that news is complicated stuff. For instance,
it's important to know a child's stage of development because it
affects how she'll cope, but stage of development isn't an
influence we need to consider in the telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is devastating news at any age. What you say isn't that
different for different-aged children,'' says Carlotta Miles, a
child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are some guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   --Be brief. Miles and Stolberg recommend 25 words or less:
``Your mother/father and I are getting a divorce. Your mom isn't
going to live here anymore; she's getting her own apartment.''
``Children are too overwhelmed to hear anything else right away,''
says Stolberg. A specialist in children's adjustment to divorce, he
is director of doctoral training in clinical child psychology at
Virginia Commonwealth University .
</P>
<P>
   --Tell them together. This is preferable if it's possible. It
eliminates the possibility of them thinking, ``Maybe Daddy doesn't
really want to,'' or ``I can talk Mom out of it.'' If you can't
tell them together, says Miles, be clear it's a joint decision:
``Mom and I both decided . . .''
</P>
<P>
   --Be timely. As soon as you reach a decision and you have a
plan, tell your children, says child psychologist and author Donald
Gordon. ``There's no such thing as delaying the agony, plus you
don't want to risk they'll hear from someone else,'' he says. A
professor at Ohio University, Gordon is co-author of ``What About
the Children: A Guide for Divorced and Divorcing Parents'' (Center
for Divorce Education).
</P>
<P>
   There are caveats, however. Breaking the news too far in
advance, a month for instance, produces more anxiety, not less.
``Children feel the stress of living in a toxic environment and
feel caught in the middle as mediator or therapist,'' says child
psychologist Anthony E. Wolf of Longmeadow. If they have too much
time, they also begin to doubt that it will really happen; when it
does, it's like a double whammy. Stolberg prefers that you tell
them two weeks in advance; Wolf and Gordon, two or three days. They
all advise having the first conversation early Friday evening, not
close to bedtime, so children have you with them over the weekend
to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   --Be honest. Say ``We're still trying to work things out'' only
if you really are. If the separation is a prelude to divorce, say
so. ``The less room for the imagination to flourish, the better,''
says Stolberg, although there will always be some of that no matter
what you say. If a spouse leaves abruptly and you are in shock, go
for honesty but stop short of blaming the other parent. Not ``I
can't believe your mother did this,'' but: ``This is hard for me,
too. As soon as I figure out what's happening, I'll tell you.''
Honesty also counts in how you paint the future. It's OK to say
``Just think: You won't have to listen to our fights anymore,'' but
not ``You're so lucky! You're going to have two homes now!''
``That's a crock and every kid knows it,'' says Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Once the news is out in the open, children of every age need
many follow-up conversations, preferably with each parent. Don't
expect them to come to you, though. Josh Stolberg, for instance,
kept to himself in those first few days. When his father would try
to get him to talk, he'd say, ``I don't want to. I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Letting it go at that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Stolberg knew that since Josh was 9, his reaction was at least
partly developmental: ``He thought that by not talking about it, it
wouldn't bother him.'' So Stolberg kept going back to his son, not
just to let him know he was available but also to send a message
that talking is important, even when it's uncomfortable. It helps a
child when you are concrete: ``If you don't express your feelings
about it, you'll spend your time in school or on the football field
thinking upsetting thoughts, and then you'll flunk a test or run
into a tree because you were distracted and not concentrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though children of all ages will ask why you're getting a
divorce, the question has different meaning depending on where they
are developmentally. Children 7 or under, for instance, are
egocentric so Miles translates their ``Why?'' as, ``What about me?
What will happen to me?''
</P>
<P>
   A good response is to talk about what will stay the same and
what will change: ``I'm going to live at Nana's and you and your
mom will still live here. You'll go to the same school, and sleep
in the same bedroom. We both still love you and we will both still
take care of you. What's different is that I'll talk to you every
day on the phone. I'll see you on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think your young child really does want to know why,
don't say, ``Because we stopped loving each other.'' That's
frightening. ``They'll think you could stop loving them, too,''
says Gordon. Answers he sanctions: ``We argued too much; we
disagreed too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Children as old as 12 typically think the divorce is their
fault: ``I didn't eat my vegetables; I didn't clean my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf advises addressing this thought early on, even if a child
doesn't voice it: ``Tell her, `This has nothing to do with anything
you did. It's not your fault.' '' Repeat it often, he says, even if
she tells you with great annoyance, ``I know that!'' Wolf is author
of ``Why Did You Have to Get a Divorce? And When Can I Get a
Hamster?'' (Noonday Press).
</P>
<P>
   When teens ask why, parents tend to think we can be truthful,
especially if they verbalize our thoughts: ``This wouldn't happen
if Dad weren't so selfish.'' This is a developmental response,
however, not a cognitive one. ``They feel betrayed. They're looking
for someone to blame: `Dad is breaking up our family! How could he
do this to me?' '' says Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   He tells parents to resist the urge to agree with the assessment
or to assign blame ourselves. That's information and a level of
intimacy that's too much for even a mature teen, says Miles. Not
only will she feel responsible for you, but it could also put her
in emotional jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you critize the other parent, children take it
personally,'' says Gordon. ``They know they have learned from that
parent or that they have that parent's genes so their thought is,
`If Dad is thoughtless, I must be, too.' '' Indeed, he says teens'
self-esteem often drops during divorce because they take to heart
any negatives they hear about a parent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first month after parents separate, children of all ages
show upset through behavior. Preschoolers may regress or have big
reactions to little things, crying easily, hitting or biting,
overreacting to a sibling's teasing. School-age children's grades
often dip due to loss of concentration. You may also notice a loss
of interest in friends and activities, or a change in eating and
sleeping patterns. Older children may flip-flop from anger to
nonchalance. None of this is abnormal. In fact, says Stolberg,
``the child I worry most about is the one who looks unchanged.
She's trying too hard to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick for parents is not to over- or underreact. Gordon says
the starting point is empathy: ``I know this is hard for you,
probably harder than I realize.''
</P>
<P>
   When children don't talk to you, it's likely because they are
afraid of making you more upset. ``They need explicit permission,''
says Gordon: `` `I want you to know that it's OK to talk to me,
even if it upsets me sometimes. I can handle it.' '' You can ease
the way by making guesses about their distress: ``I bet you feel
really alone, 'cause none of your good friends has ever gone
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents typically let uncharacteristic behavior pass because
they feel a combination of shock, guilt, sadness, and sympathy. But
the message children take from that is that we don't care anymore
or we're too upset to be a good parent.
</P>
<P>
   That's scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to change your limit-setting, but you also want
to get to the heart of the matter,'' says Stolberg.Point out what
you see _ ``You look sad; I wonder if you're feeling upset about
the divorce'' _ but reinforce limits: ``Even though we're all
upset, there are still rules in our family. You can't hit your
sister/you still have to do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   As tough as the first month is, Stolberg says, what happens now
sets the stage for later. Knowing that helped him with Josh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a kid who tends to hold things in, so I knew I needed to
keep trying,'' he says. It paid off. Now 15, Josh is doing very
well. ``More than anything, that influences my belief that we need
to help kids not repress feelings,'' he says.

   Geek chic is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fashion friends, while some of us were pressing the pleats
in our khakis, designers were embroidering daisies on capri pants.
Sewing feathers on jeans. And even strips of velvet on khaki
clamdiggers.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty craze caught us by the seat of our pants last summer
with a band or two of ribbon sewn around the edge of jeans that
brought attention to ankle bracelets and strappy sandals. By
December we were knee-deep in velvet and sari silk trims. Even
paisley and pailettes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ankle action isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the stores as we speak are spandex pants, bleached and
torn denim jeans and wool trousers sprouting flowers, glistening
with silvery studs and glittering with strips of sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Embellished pants, once the anti-fashion uniform of the hippie
era, have been interpreted by European designers like Gucci, Dolce
&AMP; Gabbana and Roberto Cavalli, elevated to high fashion and paired
with even higher heels.
</P>
<P>
   Here in L.A., local designers such as William B have put their
own spin on it with beaded fringe, feathers and flowers for
mainstream stores such as Nordstrom, while fashion-forward
boutiques including Bebe are offering jeans adorned with everything
from faux zebra fur to giant leather flowers.
</P>
<P>
   More conservative stores such as Ames, also have given
decorative pants validation. Ames' fashion consultant Toby Couser
offers her casually chic clientele dressy pants for disco divas.
Hanging next to career suits are pants with denim in front, spandex
in the back and a row of silver studs that run down the leg like a
tuxedo stripe ... which happens to be more flattering than the
ankle trim, she confides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teen destinations such as Wet Seal are selling jeans
with ribbons around the ankle and butterfly and rose appliques on
the pockets, as well as designs with peacock feather ties at the
waist.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Gap are wool pants embroidered with roses, and at
Miller's Outpost are nylon pants with embroidered dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Dragons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget flowers. Dragons are the next big trend because it's
the year of the dragon,'' says Thousand Oaks store manager Ackley
Padilla. &QL;

   Overwhelmed? Can't find pants that fit your personality or match
your shoes and purse?
</P>
<P>
   Be a purist and design your own. Women who don't know a bobbin
from a bobby pin are flocking to fabric stores for ribbons and
other decorative trims, reports Rosanne Sterr, manager of Joann's
Fabric and Craft store in Woodland Hills. The most-often-asked
question: How much ribbon do I need for the bottom of my pants?
</P>
<P>
   You'll need 1 1/8 yards of ribbon or trim to circle both legs,
and it can be ironed in place with a product called Stitch
Witchery. The product, which is sold like tape and placed between
the pants and the ribbon, also works for pre-embroidered appliques.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using strips of fabric to decorate your pant legs,
you'll need 1/8 of a yard (for both legs). Adding sequins? Sterr
recommends buying them by the yard and then glueing them in place
with a product called Jewel-It. &QL;

PAINT THINNER WILL REMOVE FILM FROM HARDWOOD FLOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Some special stuff for floors was put on my hardwood floors,
and left a film. I would like to remove this film and revarnish,
but how?
</P>
<P>
   D.I., Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It would be nice to know what this ``stuff'' is, because
without knowing, the handyman can only guess. It may be a wax or
polish; there are so many kinds out there that one runs the risk of
ruining a perfectly good varnished floor by choosing one or
another. If the ``stuff'' was buffed by a power buffer, it is wax.
Otherwise it is a self-polishing wax or polish, or even an oil
soap.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what this film is, I think generous use of paint
thinner will remove it. Apply the paint thinner liberally in a
small area, let it sit for two to five minutes without evaporating
(add more if it starts to evaporate), scrub with a soft scrub brush
or sponge, then wipe with a dry cloth. Repeat as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This will clean the surface and dull the finish, which can be
restored by buffing with a clean cloth. If the floor shines up
again, you may not need another coat of varnish. But if you like,
you can do it anyway by sanding lightly but thoroughly, and
applying one or more coats of high-gloss polyurethane varnish. If
the original varnish is water-based, use that for the finish. If
the original varnish is oil-based, use that.
</P>
<P>
   If the film does not come off, the heck with it; sand the floors
and revarnish. And use an oil-based polyurethane varnish; two coats
are good, three coats better.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, put nothing on a varnished floor. Varnish is its
own protection; any wax, polish, oil, or ``stuff'' is a waste of
money and effort, since it does no good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am refinishing a small floor of wide pine boards. My wife
thinks we can strip it; some of the varnish has worn off, and
something needs to be done. It is only 4 feet square, with another
small area of fir boards that also needs refinishing. Should I use
paint remover or any other stripping material? Or what?
</P>
<P>
   TOM PONTICELLI, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint stripper will do a quick job on the varnish, but will
not do much for the worn area. If you like the idea of paint
stripper, that is fine; you can give it a final sanding to lighten
up the worn area.
</P>
<P>
   But since both areas are quite small, I suggest that you rent a
belt sander, and sand the floor with coarse, medium, and fine
sandpaper, just as you would sand a larger floor. The handyman did
this years ago but in two larger rooms, from which he removed the
boards so that the work could be done in a neighbor's garage. He
will never do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Belt sanding is not for entire rooms, but for your small areas
it will be ideal. Then apply three coats of a high-gloss, oil-based
polyurethane varnish. Area rugs will prolong the life of the new
finish, virtually indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I got myself into a mess through my own fault, so can you
help? 1. I cracked a curved plexiglass windowpane. Where can I get
a replacement to match? 2. My glassed-in sunroom is basically
useless; too hot in summer, too cold in winter. I do not have
natural gas. What kind of heat can I use? 3. My terra-cotta tiles
are all white, and no amount of cleaning helps. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   D.S., Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. 1. Try a regular glass store; it might carry what you need or
can bend a piece of acrylic or plexiglass to match. Or, try a
window specialist.
</P>
<P>
   2. There is not much you can do about the heat in the summer
except to open the windows and get some air circulating. In winter,
I would not suggest an electric heater, but what about extending
your present heating system? It is possible with a hot-air or
hot-water system. If your heating system is big enough, it can be
extended to the porch. Or, install a gas fireplace stove _ one in
which you can see the dancing flames _ that is power vented, not
needing a chimney. Since you have no natural gas, you can use
propane, which is expensive, but you will be heating a small area.
Or, install a pellet stove, which is also power vented and really
quite easy to operate. All these stoves are sold by energy and
stove stores such as Energy Unlimited of Wayland.
</P>
<P>
   3. The terra-cotta tiles, also called quarry tiles, are unglazed
and a big pain to keep clean. Water probably caused your tiles to
turn white. To clean, scrub with steel wool dipped in paint
thinner. They will clean up nicely but won't stay clean. To protect
them after cleaning, apply a thin coat of Future, an acrylic finish
that will provide a shine and make the tiles water resistant and
more easily cleaned. Try the Future in an obscure area to make sure
it does not change the color of the tiles.

INDUSTRY TRENDS AND PHO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sunday afternoon rolls around and that means
soup's on.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the tables crammed together in the back of the
Vietnamese dive are packed with music industry executives, Internet
entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and recent college graduates.
Elbow to elbow, they slurp steaming bowls of noodle soup and swap
ideas, their opinions given equal credence during the weekly
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Pho (pronounced ``fuh'' and named after the soup served
at the Pho 87 restaurant in Los Angeles's Chinatown), the group is
open to anyone with an interest in the intersection of music and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In those circles, over the scores of Sundays since it started in
May 1998, Pho has become a buzzword for innovation and free advice.
Even the food was free until recently, when brunch attendance began
topping 100 on occasion and Jim Griffin's hat was passed around.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, Griffin, the group's founder, picked up the check
himself, even on the Sunday it reached $700. Griffin, who created
and ran the technology department at Geffen Records before
launching a consulting firm called Cherry Lane Digital-One House,
said he simply wanted to share his good fortune. He also wanted a
place where colleagues whose phone calls he couldn't return could
find him every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in this business think about the cost of
everything and the value of nothing,'' said Griffin, who was an
early convert to the power of the computer and is considered one of
the most forward thinkers in the music industry. ``But this is the
soup I love. It was a way for people to find me. That's how it
evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also expanding. A handful of people shared that first
meal; a typical Sunday now draws at least 50 to Pho. The largest
crowd so far was 162, when a major Internet music conference was
held in Los Angeles last year. More recently, swarms of Harvard MBA
candidates dropped by for soup.
</P>
<P>
   Pho offshoots have sprung up in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago,
New York and Minneapolis, although not every group meets on Sunday
and not always at a pho restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry where Wednesday is yesteryore, Pho
aficionados crave contact more than once a week. For them, there is
the invitation-only Pho e-mail list, which sometimes gets so out of
control with postings that one participant recently issued a
desperate plea to ``remove, remove, remove'' his name from the list
sponsored by OneHouse.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every branch of the music industry is represented on
the Pho list, which numbers about 200, from CEOs to producers to
managers to attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   What they share is concern over changes in the entertainment
industry in general and the music business in particular now that
people can download videos and songs from their computers.
Griffin's aim is to help them harness and direct that change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful resource, an opportunity for folks in the
business to bash out an idea, just grab it by both ears until
something makes sense,'' said Kevin Doran, a Manhattan-based music
and Internet consultant who posts at least one e-mail a day to the
Pho list. ``It's a lifeline to thinking people in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent discussions include the Time Warner/AOL merger,
intellectual property rights, the ethics of not paying artists for
their music when it is downloaded via computer, and almost every
announcement coming from the fast-growing world of digital music.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of creating a Pho Web site set off friendly but
heated debate over the security inherent in a relatively exclusive
mailing list versus opinions offered for consumption by the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   In between, one participant invited everyone to a party at a Las
Vegas computer show, another to visit her company's booth at
Cannes, and another to attend her course on career advancement in
the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pho has become a place where people can come together and find
one another,'' said Griffin, who now helps young Internet companies
develop through his incubator Evolab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contacts are being made. Deals are being made. That's good,
because some people have great ideas and some people have the money
to fund them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, much of the most important networking takes
place at the Sunday gatherings, where people can put a name to a
face and talk more freely than an electronic format allows. When
the crowds swell, the waiters know with a glance to bring more
chairs. With no other way to reach the far side of the L-shaped
table _ actually many tables shoved together _ the waiters carry
the chairs out the front door and hand them through a side
door.Then everyone scoots over to make room.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gets up to speak, no one calls anything to order,''
said Mike Griffin, Jim Griffin's younger brother, who moved to Los
Angeles in September to join Evolab. ``You see people who might be
CEOs of companies in T-shirts and shorts. It's nonconformist.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Omega Medina was among the newcomers, invited by a
friend who had been turned on to Pho by another friend, as often
happens. Medina, who is a senior awards coordinator for the
National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, said she was there
to ``pick brains,'' and get in on the discussion that will help
determine how music is delivered to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where there's no turning back,'' Medina
said. ``It's a Web world, a Web lifestyle. The question is: What's
the right way to go?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rafael Quezada never misses a meeting ``unless
something absolutely pulls me away.'' An attendee since April, the
former general contractor turned Internet security specialist said
he knows that the ideas hashed out over soup will be the ideas that
guide music on the Web for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music needs structure more than anything in this new world
that's cyberspace,'' Quezada said. ``The business models haven't
yet been defined and when they are, the people in the room will be
in the best position possible. This room is a seething hotbed of
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The room also happens to be rather dumpy, Griffin noted, which
makes it the perfect place for a free exchange of ideas. No suits,
no pomp, just the circumstance of a shared meal in an otherwise
quiet restaurant with no music playing in the background.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ Julie Basque is a nurse who carries
communion wafers, not catheters.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse who does more ministering than medicating.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse who works for a church, not a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a new phenomenon driven by intersecting changes
taking place in the health care industry and the religious
community, Basque, who works for St. Luke the Evangelist Church
here, is a kind of cross between a visiting nurse and a eucharistic
minister, a new kind of RN called a parish nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Together with an estimated 150 other parish nurses in the
metropolitan Boston area, and perhaps 6,000 such nurses nationwide,
Basque is helping to usher in a new _ and, for some, unsettling _
era for churches, nursing, and the health care system, as each
adjusts its role in changing times.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, seeking to keep costs down, are limiting hospital
stays, so more people are returning home requiring follow-up care _
the kind of care parish nurses provide.
</P>
<P>
   Churches, facing declining numbers of priests and nuns, are hard
pressed to find enough clergy to minister to the sick, but also are
seeking to strengthen their connection to communities.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses, their roles at acute-care hospitals reduced as hospital
stays are shortened, are following patients from hospitals into the
community, even as some express doubts whether it is wise for
parishes to pick up the slack left by insurers worried about their
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many people _ sick and well, clergy and laity
_ are expressing an interest in the intersection between physical
and spiritual, or psychological, health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches are philosophically coming to accept more ministry by
the laity, state practice laws now permit nurses to function more
independently, and people are looking for alternative ideas about
care,'' said Rosemarie Matheus, director of the Parish Nurse
Preparation Institute at Marquette Univeristy, a Jesuit school in
Milwaukee. ``This started in the late '70s and early '80s, but we
have just come to a point where we have our identity, and the next
step is to validate that we make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Short, director of parish-based health for Caritas
Christi, the Boston Catholic Archdiocese's medical arm, said the
rise of parish nurses is driven by changes in health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in acute-care hospitals for such a short period of
time now, when they return home somebody else needs to tend to
their heart, mind, and soul,'' he said. ``People face loneliness,
isolation, stress, and a need for spirituality, and by and large a
church is the only community left in our society where people
gather together.''
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries are people like Paul Mitchell, a 70-year-old
retired state trooper in Westborough. When doctors said they wanted
to remove his cancerous right lung, Mitchell told his pastor he was
prepared for death. But he lived, and it was living for which he
was unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   A big man at 6 feet 3 inches, Mitchell stopped eating and
dropped 40 pounds. A protruding hip bone caused him pain. Cold
weather made it hard for him even to exercise. A daily communicant
before the surgery, Mitchell is no longer strong enough to get to
church.
</P>
<P>
   So Basque visits Mitchell several times a week. Sitting in a
small living room still decorated with a creche, a doll-sized
procession of the three kings and a Christmas tree adorned with
angels, Basque counsels Mitchell about his health, chats with him
about their shared church community, and then leads him in prayer
and gives him communion from a gold container called a pyx that she
wears around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Their interaction provides medical and spiritual benefits for
Mitchell. Basque helps him interpret his doctors' instructions,
advocates for him when he needs new medication, and keeps him
connected to the ritual and community of his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was new to me,'' Mitchell said of parish nursing. ``But
she's been very helpful in her visits to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish nursing, which began at a Lutheran hospital in Chicago
two decades ago, is finally spreading to New England, years after
it has taken hold in much of the country. The practice got a
national stamp of approval in 1998, when the American Nurses
Association declared it a new form of practice and laid out a set
of standards for practitioners to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, parish nursing crossed an important threshold last
week, when Boston College inaugurated a joint master's degree in
nursing and pastoral ministry and began offering a new course on
nursing in faith communities.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of parish nursing involves, as its name suggests,
nurses hired by parishes to provide spiritual and medical
assistance to parishioners who are sick, homebound, or in need of
advice. The nurses offer a mix of services: visits, support groups,
counseling, education, advocacy and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why parishes? Because they're the one place in our community
that we all come together,'' said Susan Chase of Boston College's
School of Nursing. ``Why nurses? Nurses understand a lot about the
human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the country, parish nurses are employed by
health care providers. In New England, most parish nurses are
employed by churches or work as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of Boston has taken the lead in supporting and
coordinating the work of parish nurses working for a variety of
Christian churches throughout the metropolitan area; in central
Massachusetts, the Worcester County Ecumenical Council plays a
similar role.
</P>
<P>
   Most parish nurses work in the suburbs; parish nursing groups
are working to promote their practice in inner-city churches.
</P>
<P>
   In Westborough, a fast-growing commuter suburb on Interstate
495, there are now four parish nurses, two Catholics and two
Methodists. The two Catholic nurses, Basque and Michelle Parsons,
split a salary only recently paid to a nun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I thought this was useless, that it would be
stupid for the church to do things other people do,'' said the Rev.
George Lange, pastor of the 1,900-family St. Luke the Evangelist,
who said he worried the nurses would simply duplicate tasks done by
health care or social workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lange gave it a try. He agreed to pay Basque and Parsons,
who share a position, for a total of 16 hours a week. Pleased with
the results, he now pays them for 50 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people fall through the cracks,'' he said. ``The
parish has all these people who are alone, who are sick and they
(the nurses) see them, and bring them not only spiritual help . . .
but talk about their health.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lange's initial concerns are echoed by others, who believe
it is great to mix health and spirituality, and useful for parishes
to find new ways to connect with parishioners, but who don't want
to make it easier for the health care system to reduce direct
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to fill in cracks that shouldn't be there,''
said Mary Rose Leach, parish nurse coordinator in Worcester. ``The
parish nurse optimally is working with the health care system to
get the best possible health care for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish nurses are barred from conducting invasive medical
procedures. The most elaborate medical tasks they do is taking
blood pressure. But they often act as advocates or interpreters for
patients confused by their medical situation and unable or
unwilling to push for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly what she does is she guides people through medical
mazes,'' said the Rev. Mark Beckwith, pastor of All Saints
Episcopal Church in Worcester, describing the medical services
offered by his parish nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, for example, works with a new mother, 28-year-old Jenn
McGrath, who developed high blood pressure while pregnant. McGrath
meets regularly with Parsons, who takes McGrath's blood pressure
and talks about hypertension. In the process, Parsons has persuaded
McGrath to join a support group for new mothers, building community
and her connection to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been doing visiting nursing and hospice nursing, but I
knew the shakeups in health care were making for a more unstable
job market,'' said Parsons. ``At the same time, I wanted to do
something for my parish with nursing. I wanted permission to
express my spiritual side.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons describes parish nursing as ``bringing the church back
to its roots,'' saying that Jesus was a healer. And, she says,
parish nurses supply a spiritual companionship the health care
system just can't offer: ``The heart of our ministry is the one
with people who are shut in and profoundly lonely.''

COMPUTER GAME PIONEER FONG SEES A LUCRATIVE FUTURE AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene is Monte Carlo, where hundreds of high-tech honchos
are gathered to impress each other with their wisdom, widgets, and
wealth. Two speakers remain on the agenda: some kid nobody has ever
heard of and Bill Gates, master of this particular universe. The
unassuming young man introduces himself quietly and then proceeds
to steal the show with talk of an ``untapped global market'' that
will ``revolutionize the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The power players listen. The community college dropout gets a
standing ovation, upstaging Chairman Gates. A prominent venture
capitalist offers him $11 million, right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, man, this is so cool,'' recalls Dennis Fong, 22,
as he tells this story with characteristic nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   So what is his revolutionary concept? What's his great untapped
market? In a word, games. That's right, games. Board games. Card
games. Mind games. But most importantly, computer games. The way
Fong sees it, electronic games are the final frontier of
cyberspace, the future of the entertainment business. ``We're on
the verge of a boom,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   At 22, Fong is the first (and perhaps only) professional gamer
who earns a living through his skills at electronic games. To the
uninitiated, he seems like the kind of fellow you can bring home
toyour mother _ soft-spoken yet ambitious, confident yet
exceedingly polite. But to thousands of youngsters in the post-Pong
generation, he's simply Thresh, the legendary champion of the
popular shoot-'em-up computer game Quake. He has racked up $250,000
in competition prizes and product endorsements and has been
immortalized with his own trading card. And now he's just launched
an online venture called Gamers.com, an Internet portal for gaming
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The way Fong sees it, the gaming phenomenon has moved out of the
basement and into the mainstream. ``It's becoming less of a geek
and nerd thing and more of a hip and cool thing,'' says Fong, who
lives and works in Berkeley, Calif. ``It's shed the image of the
pasty white kids in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, of course, is a self-appointed evangelist for the gaming
industry, but he has numbers to back up his missionary zeal. In
1998, sales of video games hit $6.3 billion, not far behind the
box-office take of the $6.7 billion film industry; this year, the
fast-growing gaming industry rivals Hollywood. According to
Forrester Research Inc., some 14 million users play computer games
on the Internet, a figure that is expected to grow to 32 million by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   As the online gaming industry grows, it is spawning its own
mythology, its own subset of superheroes. Fong is famous for his
swift wrist and his uncanny mental dexterity (known as ``Thresh
ESP''), and competitors still marvel about the time he won the red
Ferrari, the grand prize in a 1997 competition. He's frequently
referred to as the Michael Jordan of gaming, but the soft-spoken
young man seems determined not to bask in his own hype. ``He is the
epitome of the serious player, but he is not an egotistical,
arrogant jerk who goes around saying how great he is,'' says John
Carmack, the co-founder of id Software, who has idol status himself
as the developer of Quake. ``You hear a lot of bragging _ that's
the style of the game _ but Dennis is humble, even though he's the
best player around.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong certainly doesn't flaunt his status as a subculture
celebrity, but he does use his position to defend computer games
like Quake and Doom, contests in which players blast each other to
oblivion in post-apocalyptic virtual environments. Some critics
contend that virtual violence can lead to real rage, particularly
after last year's murderous rampage in Littleton, Colo. ``I have
never seen a single fight break out in this community,'' says Fong,
who points out that other cultural influences were blamed for the
tragedy, including films, heavy metal music, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry's role model, he's on a personal mission to
dispel negative stereotypes. ``People expect me to be some
whacked-out dude with long hair and tattoos, but I'm just a normal
looking, peaceful guy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And in an age in which regular folks can become instant Internet
cult figures, Fong is just another normal American entrepreneur. Of
course, this regular fellow could have retired at 21 _ if he had
taken the buyout offers he received for GX Media, the parent
company of gamers.com. ``It's not about money; I really want to
build something,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fong admits he's always been competitive by nature. Born in Hong
Kong and raised in Los Altos, Calif., he first discovered online
multiplayer computer games when he was about 15 or 16. His brothers
initially whooped him at the keyboard, but eventually, Fong
developed the quickest wrist in the West. He briefly attended a
local community college but dropped out to pursue professional
gaming. His parents initially objected _ until he won the Ferrari,
that is. At that point, they realized he just might have a future
in this thing called gaming.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not alone. A San Francisco-based organization called
the Professional Gaming League is trying to create a professional
arena computer games: Fong is the nascent league's brightest star.
He likens himself to Babe Ruth in the early days of baseball and
predicts that the league will some day be a new national pasttime.
The ``sport'' does have a unique appeal: Players can participate
from any computer anywhere in the world, making competitions truly
global. But it also has its problems; the games may be exciting to
play, but they're not exactly thrilling for spectators.
``Professional gaming does have its challenges, and I guess the
jury is still out,'' says Garth Chouteau, press secretary for the
league. ``It will evolve and get bigger, but it's a question of how
much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that amateur gaming is booming. Since
Fong made his speech in Monaco in October, major Internet companies
have embraced gaming in a big way. Lycos bought the Watertown-based
Gamesville.com for $207 million, and America Online signed a deal
to run an online game channel. Meanwhile, Fong introduced
gamers.com, which he describes as the ``first portal for the gaming
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And that ``community'' takes itself very seriously. Within a few
days of the launch, one user complained on the site's message board
that ``Thresh and his merry band of Web site portal wannabes'' had
not, in fact, created the first games portal. Some came to praise
and others came to talk trash about the site's features. No one was
ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way this game is played. Fong works 18 hours a
day on the venture, working toward the day that electronic games
will be as popular a leisure activity as, say, television. The
company has grown to employ more than 100 people; Fong considers
himself acting president, but really prefers the title of Chief
Gamer. He's currently looking for a management team to run the
day-to-day operations. ``People come in and say, `Geez, you guys
are going to make so much money,' and I'm like, `No thank you,' ''
he says. ``They have to believe in our industry. They have to be
excited. They have to have passion.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Fong, he doesn't have much time to practice his passion
these days; he's too busy building the company. In his rare moments
of spare time, he's actually taken up golf. What? Golf? As in plaid
pants and polo shirts? As in totally uncool? ``There's a good
analogy in that,'' explains the entrepreneur. ``Golf has the
stereotype that your parents do it, like `God, you play golf? What
is wrong with you?' But Tiger Woods changed that, and now it is a
cool thing. That's what I see happening with the gaming industry.
It all comes down to the hip and cool thing. Once people see the
professional gaming industry as being cool, it's going to
explode.''

TWO LETTERS WORTH SHARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We get letters. Not a lot, but a few, so I try to answer them.
Here are two worth sharing, both about trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an elm tree in my front yard, but I don't know if it's
a Camperdown. Enclosed are the leaves,'' wrote Lucille Wallace of
Lynnfield, Mass. Nice elm leaves they are, too, neatly taped flat.
She was responding to a column on the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society's search for someone to donate a mature Camperdown elm for
an Italianate garden being restored at the society's Elm Bank
center in Dover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lucille, truth be told, I wouldn't know a Camperdown elm
if it fell on me. I'd know the one at Elm Bank that the society
wants to match, because I've seen it, and I could tell if yours was
a possible Camperdown if I saw it in leaf and had some reference
books with me, but I could not identify one from individual leaves.
</P>
<P>
   I use two reference books for trees. One is the Peterson ``Field
Guide Eastern Trees,'' which lists native and other trees in the
wild. It has pictures and detailed descriptions. It uses charts to
compare the details (size and shape of leaves and buds, coloration,
etc.) that help one discern one kind of elm from another.
</P>
<P>
   This book is of absolutely no help to me in identifying a
Camperdown elm. For one thing, I keep it at our cottage in Canada,
where I have occasion to tramp around looking at trees and such in
the wild. For another, since a Camperdown elm is a cultivar of a
Scotch elm (Ulmus glabra) usually grafted onto another, Ulmus
americana, it isn't in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   So I turned to one of the great reference books, Michael Dirr's
``Manual of Woody Landscape Plants.'' Here's what I learned: A
Camperdown elm is ``a round-headed, pendulous-branched type that is
usually grafted about 6' to 7' high on the understock.'' Its leaves
would be typical of Scotch elms: alternate (not paired opposite
each other), simple, oblong-ovate to elliptic or obovate leaves,
3-7 inches long, 1 1/2-4 inches wide, sharply serrated leaves. Your
leaves fit that bill, Lucille, but so do those of a few other kinds
of elms.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's all moot. John Peterson, president of the
Massachusetts Horticultural Society, tells me a donor tree never
was found, though he was deluged with calls from people offering
everything but. So the society acquired one, an eight-inch-caliper
tree, from the trade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Baudanza of Woburn, Mass. has two apple trees. ``I spray
them with fruit spray and also spray them with oil, but they get
rotten inside, no worm holes,'' he wrote. ``Maybe you could tell me
what to do.'' He also has a similar problem with two peach trees.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to horse around with this problem, I went right to
an expert, Dominic Marini, retired University of Massachusetts
Extension agent in Plymouth County.
</P>
<P>
   Apple maggot is the most likely culprit, he told me. The fly
lays eggs under the skin of an apple, and the maggot tunnels in.
You will find brown streaks through the fruit, and it eventually
can rot. He suggested that some people stop spraying too early.
``Maggots don't come on until July and August, so you have to
continue right through August about every two weeks,'' he said. An
organic method of control is to hang plastic red apples coated with
sticky Tangletrap. The flies land and don't leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another possibility is a boron deficiency, and with boron
deficiency you get brown spots right around the core of the
apple,'' Marini said. To counter that, spread about a quarter-pound
of borax (more would be bad) on the ground under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   While boron deficiency produces brown corky spots right around
the core, calcium deficiency, called bitter pit, gives brown spots
right under the skin, and the apples taste bitter. To counter that,
add calcium under the tree. Baldwin and Northern Spy apples are
notorious for this, while ``maggot is very fond of Delicious
apples,'' Marini said.
</P>
<P>
   The peach problems, he suggested, may be caused by plum curculio
or by oriental fruit moth. Start spraying with combination fruit
spray early in the season and spray every week to 10 days; after
June, spray every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   John, I hope that solves your fruit problems. I know it's been a
help to me. Thanks Dominic. I'll be hanging that red sphere to trap
the apple maggot flies and spraying more this year.

UTILITY MEETS FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't normally do my computer shopping at those big warehouse
superstores: I mostly shop on line. But the other day I needed a
new keyboard and mouse on short notice, so I stopped by CompUSA
store.
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, my mission to pick up a cheap accessory had
been transformed. The bright lights and slick packaging from a
hundred different companies changed my purpose. No longer was I a
utilitarian drudge; now I was after a fashion experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to catch my eye was a set of Cyber Acoustics
MacAudio amplified speakers. Although these $80 speakers can work
with any computer, the speakers are designed to complement Apple's
fashionable iMac computer.
</P>
<P>
   Each speaker looks like a tiny iMac, and the set even comes with
six translucent hoods so you can change their colors to match or
clash with the iMac's case. There's also a big white subwoofer that
looks rather out of place, but sounds terrific. Find out more at
http://www.cyber-acoustics.com/.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to understand why the iMac made such a big impact
on the consumer computer market. Computers, after all, had long
since become a boring commodity for most of us. Apple's genius was
realizing that the only way it could attract consumers to its
nonstandard operating system was by recruiting those who were
willing to ``think different.'' Not surprisingly, one of the
easiest ways of appealing to people who think differently from the
rest is by offering computers in a variety of different colors. It
was the ultimate refutation of today's Henry Fords who inhabit the
hallways of Compaq and Dell _ companies that are willing to sell
you a desktop computer in any color you want, so long as it's
beige.
</P>
<P>
   In building the iMac, Apple simply could have used spray paint
or colored plastics. Fortunately for us, the company decided to
innovate and build its cases from polycarbonate _ the same
substance, interestingly enough, that's used to manufacture both
compact discs and bullet-proof windows.
</P>
<P>
   Polycarbonate, sometimes known as Lexan and Merlon, is extremely
strong, optically transparent, and lightweight. And in the years
since the iMac's debut, polycarbonate has become all the rage in
the computer industry _ especially for building anything having to
do with USB.
</P>
<P>
   USB, for the uninitiated, is the Universal Serial Bus. USB is a
high-speed system for putting keyboards, mice, printers, floppy
disk drives, hard drives, and even CD-ROMs onto a computer. It's
architecturally neutral, which means that you can put it on a PC
running Windows, a PC running Unix, or a Mac. Although PCs have had
USB ports for years, and Microsoft added support for the system in
1997, it wasn't until Apple shipped the iMac with a USB keyboard
and mouse that the bus started to really gain popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this close affiliation with the iMac, many USB
products to this day have a kind of iMac styling. My D-Link
four-port USB hub, for instance, has a translucent green
polycarbonate case. The long cable that connects the hub to my
desktop has a translucent plastic armor and a braided inner
shielding _ this, despite the fact that it is plugged into a PC
clone running Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally pulled myself away from the polycarbonate
paraphernalia, I made my way to the back of the computer store,
where perhaps four dozen mice and keyboards from different
manufacturers were laid out for my inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The big new thing in mice is apparently Microsoft's new
Intellimouse Explorer
(http://www.microsoft.com/Mouse/explorer.htm). It's an oversized
device with a gray steel top, a red base, and no moving parts.
Instead of a rolling bar, the mouse has an optical sensor that
watches as you move it across your mouse pad, or your desk, or your
notebook, or even your pants. Alas, the $75 device is designed for
right-handed folk like me, so I passed it by, since I don't believe
in having a mouse that makes my left-handed wife uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of buying another product from Redmond, I decided to
get a Logitech cordless wheel mouse. The box contains two items: a
small, battery-powered mouse, and a square box that plugs into the
back of your computer. The mouse is symmetrical, so it fits in
either hand. And with no cord, or tail, it's easier to move across
my desk than any other mouse I've ever used. I love it.
</P>
<P>
   To complement my cordless mouse I bought a Logitech cordless
keyboard. The keyboard comes in two versions _ a conventional
keyboard, which costs $59.95, and an ergonomic one with split
halves for each hand. The ergonomic keyboard costs $79.95. I
decided to go with the cheaper keyboard since it takes up less desk
space.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Logitech accessories use radio frequencies to
transmit information to your PC. Logitech claims that the batteries
last six months to a year. They also use a special signaling system
that doesn't cause interference, even if you have several keyboards
and mice in the same room, all connected to different computers. I
know this system works because I was so thrilled with the wireless
devices that I went back to the store the next day and bought a set
for my wife, and we use the two setups side-by-side without any
problems. There were also a number of keyboards that relied upon
infrared communications, like a television remote. I don't like
these systems as much: if you drop a book or something on your desk
between the keyboard and the infrared receiver, you suddenly lose
the ability to type!
</P>
<P>
   Besides being wireless, my Logitech keyboard has a bunch of
extra buttons designed for controlling sound, compact discs, and
surfing the Web _ a total of 12 extra buttons in all. The most
useful buttons, I think, are those that control the volume and mute
the computer's sound _ very handy features when the telephone
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I think that it's a sign of health and vibrancy that
there are so many choices available today for such PC accessories
as mice, keyboards and speakers. My only regret is that it took so
long for utility to become fashion.

REAL BOYS SHOULD CRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your 12-year-old son comes home from school complaining, whiny,
and teary-eyed because his best friend picked a fight with him.
You:
</P>
<P>
   A. Shrug and tell him: ``That's life. You have to learn to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   B. Tell him to put a lid on it and stop his crying _ he's too
big for that nonsense now.
</P>
<P>
   C. Pass the tissue box and encourage him to share his vulnerable
feelings. After all, boys today can never get enough nurturing and
you don't want him to hide his true inner thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or two ago, a parent might have picked A or B and not
given the matter a second thought. A boy crying at 12 _ and over a
fight? What if other kids saw him? They'd make his life miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the old psychology. The art of parenting boys seems to
have taken on new weight in these times, and the politically
correct answer to the question is definitively C _ at least
according to a new crop of books by local authors on raising boys.
Although each book approaches the matter differently, all share the
same point of view, a view that would have been unimaginable a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today's boys, the books agree, have dangerously fragile
self-esteem due in large part to outdated rules and stereotypes _
the ``Boy Code'' as one of the authors calls it _ that make boys
ashamed of vulnerable feelings, fearful of being sensitive, and
prone to stoicism, frustration, and anger.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the authors, psychologist William Pollack, somberly
concludes in his book ``Real Boys'': ``Boys today are in serious
trouble, including many who seem `normal' and to be doing just
fine. Confused by society's mixed messages about what's expected of
them as boys, and later as men, many feel a sadness and
disconnection they cannot even name.''
</P>
<P>
   How worried should the average parent be?
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, that the rocky terrain of family dynamics
is always being mined for new truths and plumbed for new problems.
Just a few years ago, the problems of adolescent girls _ in the
context of their environment _ were being analyzed microscopically
by authors such as Mary Pipher, who wrote ``Reviving Ophelia,'' and
psychologist Carol Gilligan at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the authors _ from Pollack to psychologists Dan
Kindlon and Michael Thompson (``Raising Cain'') to pediatrician Eli
Newburger (``The Men They Will Become'') _ seem to be advocating
nothing less than what Pollack describes as a whole new ``male
model'' of connecting with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a national crisis of boyhood in America. I
think it is serious, it is real, it is not hyped up,'' Pollack, a
Harvard psychologist and director of the Center for Men at McLean
Hospital in Belmont, Mass., says in an interview. ``Do a majority
of boys suffer from this pain? Absolutely. Their pain is palpable,
close to the surface, and they spend every day of their lives
trying to suppress it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's message is probably the most pessimistic of the three
books. He contends that even boys whom adults would deem
``high-functioning'' are in serious trouble, thanks to a
society-sanctioned ``boy code'' that dictates they should cover up
the more vulnerable sides of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many feel a sadness and disconnection they cannot even name,''
Pollack writes, citing new research that shows in school boys are
performing worse academically than in the past and in comparison
with girls, and that the rates of depression and suicide for boys
are rising.
</P>
<P>
   He says society places boys in a ``gender straitjacket,''
judging their behavior against outmoded ideas about masculine
autonomy and strength _ even as we tell them to share their
vulnerable feelings. And society pushes boys to separate from their
mother prematurely, as early as age 5 or 6, and also in early
adolescence, with too little preparation and emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that boys, feeling ashamed of their vulnerability,
mask their emotions and ultimately their true selves,'' Pollack
concludes. They are full of anger, and unless parents rethink the
way they raise them, their boys will become emotionally limited
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising Cain'' _ written by Kindlon, a Harvard psychologist
and therapist specializing in boys, and Thompson, staff
psychologist at Belmont Hill School in Belmont _ reflects similar
themes, although the authors use examples drawn from their clinical
practices and seem less willing to apply them to boys in general.
Nevertheless, they emphasize that boys need to become more
``emotionally literate'' and lament the ``stereotypic images of
masculinity'' that are still with us, despite lip service paid to
the new age of the ``sensitive male.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most discouragingly, they describe an emotional gulf
separating most sons from their fathers, which ``remains a lifelong
source of sadness, anger, bitterness, or shame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys describe their fathers . . . as men who don't listen,
don't understand, and demand respect without offering it,'' they
write. ``Many women are angry with their husbands for not being
more involved in their sons' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Men They Will Become,'' Newberger of Harvard Medical
School and Children's Hospital offers a guide to understanding and
influencing boys' character so they will turn out to be what he
calls ``admirable males.'' The assumption, of course, is that the
task isn't intuitive to everyone and a lot of parents aren't on top
of the game of parenting boys.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, he says, that ``in the main, boys are reasonably
well off and can make their way in the world. I think most boys
grow up happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``most parents are curious about and desiring of
improving their acts,'' he says in an interview. And even though he
believes common sense is important in raising children these days,
``things are more complicated than they used to be. There are drugs
and violence _ a lot of family violence. And we know a lot more
about temperament now, and self-control, and learning disorders and
hyperactivity. The point is, our knowledge has improved and there
are specific things parents should know about. We do have a crisis
of character at the end of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pollack, these include: giving boys undivided
attention at least once a day, encouraging the expression of a full
range of emotions, avoiding ``shaming'' language, expressing love
and empathy openly and generously, and letting boys know they don't
need to ``act like a man'' and that it's OK to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Even, presumably, when they're 12 years old and just had a bad
day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But are things really this bad? Are we raising a generation of
detached and insensitive males? At least one expert on boys is
leery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the picture that is being painted is an
oversimplification and in some ways erroneous,'' says psychologist
Mark Kiselica of the College of New Jersey in an interview.
Kiselica is also president of the Society for the Psychological
Study of Men and Masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture is of boys as emotional mummies, and that tends to
be viewed as the primary factor involved in a host of problems that
boys experience. Well, I'm a soccer coach and the parent of two
boys, and I spend a lot of time in schools. I can tell you that
boys are not emotional mummies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get guys who know each other well, they do talk about
their feelings, they know each other inside and out. But they are
selective about to whom and when they express it. I was in a locker
room last night and the guys next to me in their jockstraps were
talking about their wives. They weren't looking face to face, but
let me tell you, there was a lot of personal stuff coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I do want to acknowledge the important message that
Bill (Pollack) and the others have stated. They have very clearly
raised our nation's consciousness about some of the expectations
about masculinity we place on boys _ like it is unacceptable to
cry, and that it's better to fight than walk away. But on the
whole, we are raising fairly well-adjusted kids, and our nation
needs to remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the hands-on experts _ the parents raising these
boys?
</P>
<P>
   Megan Adley, who has four boys ages 4 through 8 and a baby
daughter, says she can't relate to the premise that boys are
emotionally disconnected. ``If my boys are hurting, I say, let them
cry. If they hurt, then they need a big hug. I'd say to them that I
don't want them to whine, but I'd say that to my daughter, too. My
husband has the same philosophy (about boys being emotional). He
gets tears in his eyes, sometimes, like when he thinks about his
father who died. And that is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Powers, who has an 8-year-old son and a 12-year-old
daughter, has read Pollack's ``Real Boys'' and found it both
``helpful'' and ``reassuring,'' though some of the conclusions were
``surprising.'' Powers has also read ``Raising Ophelia,'' about the
crisis facing adolescent girls. ``Maybe it's because I was a girl,
but I could really identify with that,'' she says. ``I thought it
was very clear that girls are not getting things that they need,
like self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the boys' side, I always thought boys had everything. I
thought `Real Boys' made it all seem a bit too drastic. I think
most kids, boys and girls, are just doing fine, in the same way
most people I grew up did just fine. I don't believe most boys in
America are in that much pain. How could they get out of bed in the
morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there is her car-pool partner, Pam Russell, mother
of 9-year-old Matthew. Russell describes him with pride as a
``sensitive, compassionate'' boy who recycles trash because he
cares about the environment and cries when he sees road kill on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Russell, a single mother, gets pressure from
relatives to be careful not to let him turn into a ``sissy,'' and
pressure from other adults to get him off his coed soccer team and
transfer him to an all-boys' team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am swimming upstream against society,'' says
Russell, who keeps the book ``Real Boys'' on her bedside table.
``It is really hard to raise a boy with the traits that I, as a
mother, consider worthy of having, like sensitivity and love of
nature and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Matthew has already observed that there is a
special way that boys have to act around others. For example, even
though he likes the girls in his car pool and talks to them in the
car, he is careful not to talk to them at school because some of
the boys might tease him.
</P>
<P>
   When doing a presentation in school, ``boys have to act cool,''
he says, demonstrating by putting his hands on his hips. ``And
girls do just regular.''
</P>
<P>
   When they're angry, boys act differently, too, he says. ``They
flip out totally. One time there was a boy who was mad and he
slammed his desk. Boys go, ``I hate you, even to the teacher. Girls
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the classroom crayfish swallowed his favorite goldfish,
he felt terribly sad but ``could not say I was sad out loud,''
Matthew says. ``The other kids would have said, `Crybaby, crybaby.'
''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with having a bad day, Matthew concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Most boys, he says, ``can't let anyone know that.''

SAAB'S 9-5 WAGON HAS A SLOW, STEADY ANSWER TO WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally we get some snow, and a chance to test the latest in
``winter'' drive modes that are increasingly common on
non-four-wheel-drive autos.
</P>
<P>
   Saab does not let us down.
</P>
<P>
   We're in a 9-5 wagon as it crawls on narrow roads that lead to
empty summer houses that dot a lake. The roads are hard-packed snow
and ice with a fresh dusting of snow atop that. They wind so much
that getting up speed to approach any of the steep hills is
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab is stopped halfway up one of these hills. It is set in
winter mode. Then the gas pedal is pushed.
</P>
<P>
   My Uncle Harold used to say that driving in snow meant you had
to (curious expletive) drive like you've got an egg between your
foot and the gas pedal. Indeed, it was a tricky, touchy thing to
walk the fine line between just enough power for progress and
spinning wheels that ended in a backslide.
</P>
<P>
   Saab handles the egg part for you. Push the gas. The engine
roars _ roars so loudly you assume the wheels must be spinning out
there. They are not. Instead, the engine is straining because it's
producing enough power to start the car barely creeping in what
feels like third gear from a dead start. It works wonderfully, and
that helps make this front-wheel-drive wagon a perfect New England
car. All that, and sportiness, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is no box of a wagon being built as wagons are in the midst
of a minicomeback. It's low and sleek up front, rises in a wedge
over windshield and roofline, and ends above the rear lid with a
subtle, aerodynamic curl toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab wagon was launched last spring, and offered a
4-cylinder, 2.3 liter, 170 horsepower, low-pressure turbo engine as
its base model. For 2000, you can get a 3.0 liter V-6 that cranks
out 200 horses, but I stuck with the smaller engine base model in
this test and it got about 22 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   It's an admirable engine, moving the car effortlessly at highway
speed, climbing hills with a comforting, powerful surge when extra
power is needed. Its low- and mid-range torque is remarkable, but
you should expect that from a company that has been featuring
turbochargers for 20 years now.
</P>
<P>
   I've always liked Saabs, though their standard transmissions
were not my favorite _ long throws, a bit sloppy _ but the 4-speed
automatic on the test car was superb. Shifts up and down were
seamless, with no jolts, no lags.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, the dash setup is wonderfully simple. The leather
front seats (part of an optional package) were broad and supported
thighs, back, and head very well. Take them out and put them on a
swivel base and they'd make fine furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats were comfortable _ for two, not three _ but
legroom back there is limited. Since a wagon is often a family car
used for long trips, it is good that storage space is spread
throughout the car. There are bins in the lower front door panels,
pockets on the front edges of the front seats, pockets on the
seatbacks, a bin in the console, nets on the B pillars, more bins
in the rear cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo area has an industrial look _ and utility _ to it,
with sliding tie-downs and straps that let you safely store luggage
and heavy loads.
</P>
<P>
   There's a standard sliding sunroof, and even the glove
compartment is unique: Hooked to air-conditioning ducts, it can
keep drinks cooled to 42 degrees in hot weather. And the 9-5's got
the neatest cup holder I've ever seen: A vertical slit in the dash
pops out at touch and a circle, a la gyroscope, rotates to
horizontal to hold your drink.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of what makes Saab such a fine niche car with a
loyal following. Plus, it's a safe car. There are crash ``load
paths'' designed to distribute the energy of a collision out and
around passengers. And those passengers are sitting in a steel cage
of high tensile steel.
</P>
<P>
   Front airbags are supplemented by head and torso dual airbags
that deploy from the outside edges of the front seat backs,
cradling passengers in soft protection.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was smooth and stable on highways, with minimal lateral
forces felt during lane changes at speed, and on rough backroads
you could feel the suspension absorbing all the road could hand
out.
</P>
<P>
   That suspension is springs, antiroll bars and shocks all around,
with struts up front and multilink independent in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   There was some hint of understeer when powering through a
corner, but that's not uncommon in front-wheel-drive and you soon
get used to it. Stopping was quick and crisp with discs fore and
aft using diagonally split hydraulics, assisted by ABS.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car meant to compete with other high-end wagons such
as the Audi A6, BMW 528i, Mercedes-Benz E320, and Volvo's V70. If
you're ready to hand over $35,000-$50,000 for a wagon, I'd suggest
you try them all because all are good and the choice becomes
personal. If you're looking for a comparison with a cheaper wagon,
try the new Volvo V40 at around $25,000; it's a bit smaller, but
still a fine car.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to do a lot of upcountry driving in the winter,
make sure you get winter mode. If Uncle Harold were still alive,
he'd be asking, ``Which came first, the Saab or the egg?''
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches
</P>
<P>
   --The rubber ``toggle switches'' that control air flow from the
dash vents.
</P>
<P>
   --The doubled-up visors. Great to be able to block out that low
winter sun both from the side and the front without moving a single
visor back and forth as you change directions.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --A subtle rasping sound that seemed to emanate from the dash
whenever the defroster was turned on.
</P>
<P>
   --Small interior door handles. Hard to get more than a couple of
fingers behind them and, on quick cold runs to fetch the morning
paper, impossible in gloved hands.

KINGMAKERS AND MUCKRAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ, PATTI HARTIGAN, AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hordes of reporters crammed into neighboring New Hampshire
for Tuesday's primary are there for two contests. One will anoint
the winning presidential hopefuls. The other could determine which
news outlets end up playing a key role in the battle for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign 2000 is unfolding in a brave new media world. The
``boys on the bus'' are yielding to the index finger on the
computer mouse, the Beltway pundits making way for the unmediated
gaze of the C-Span camera. A porn king like Larry Flynt is as
likely to dredge up a major political scandal as a senior
Washington reporter. And thus far, the most memorable journalism
moment in the race was a pop quiz sprung on George W. Bush by
WHDH-TV's bad boy Andy Hiller.
</P>
<P>
   In this volatile environment, it's hard to predict which
personalities, journalists, and information sources will make their
mark in the campaign. But here's a roster _ from Web sites to
tabloids, from TV talk hosts to journalistic sleuths _ of media
players to watch out for. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Tim Russert: Host of NBC's ``Meet the Press With Tim
Russert''; NBC Washington bureau chief
</P>
<P>
   During one debate, GOP hopeful Alan Keyes testily inquired
whether moderator Russert ``would declare his candidacy.'' That
might actually dilute his clout. His ``Meet the Press'' show is a
major newsmaker, and the best debate so far took place between Gore
and Bradley under Russert's expert prodding. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Gwen Ifill: Host of PBS's ``Washington Week in Review''
</P>
<P>
   Look for the first black host of a major political talk show to
seek out unconventional wisdom among the reporters who spend each
week along the campaign trail. And look for her to get beyond the
Beltway; this week she's bringing ``Washington Week'' to New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Matthews: Host of MSNBC's ``Hardball With Chris
Matthews''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews is hard to pigeonhole, and even harder to shut up. But
behind his pugnacity is a penetrating analytical mind bent on
delivering cant-free TV. He's audacious enough to believe that
politics should be fun, which makes his show must-see television
for political junkies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --www.salon.com
</P>
<P>
   This aggressive on-line zine could drop the bomb about the next
Whitewater (or white powder) scandal. During Monicagate, it dug up
Republican senator Henry Hyde's 30-year-old affair, noting, ``Ugly
times call for ugly tactics.'' And two weeks ago, it had a major
scoop about collusion between television networks and the nation's
antidrug czar.
</P>
<P>
   --Zack Exley, webmaster of www.gwbush.com
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old computer geek from Somerville didn't expect to
become a cause celebre when he set up gwbush.com, which parodies
the Republican front-runner. But George W. fought back, calling
Exley a ``garbage man.'' In fact, he's one of hundreds of amateur
cyber-sleuths sniffing for dirt on the presidential trail.
</P>
<P>
   --www.freedomchannel.com
</P>
<P>
   They call it video on demand _which means that you can hear the
talking heads 24-7. This nonpartisan Web site is one of several
that post streaming videos of the candidates' television ads, as
well as short videos of their stands on the issues. For the
campaign aficionado, this is the cyber C-Span. &QL; 
 &QL;

   Remember, it was Isikoff, not cyber snoop Matt Drudge, whose

if he sees this as a race between squishy moderates, the

&HT;     SECRET TO FIGHTING THE FLU IS IN WHAT YOU EAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LISA STEVENS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it chicken soup for the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Your nose is stuffy, your head is throbbing, it hurts when you
cough and you wish that 2-ton elephant would go find someone else's
chest to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to bring out the flu fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sipping chicken soup spiced with chili powder, garlic and
onion is the best cold remedy there is,'' says Dr. Irwin Ziment,
professor of medicine at the University of California at Los
Angeles. Those foods' phytochemicals, which are natural chemical
compounds that act as antioxidants, help relieve cold and flu
symptoms. For example, the capsaicin in chili peppers breaks up
nasal congestion and turmeric, an ingredient in curry powder,
contains curcumin, which helps relieve chest congestion. Other
phytochemically-rich foods include horseradish, gingerroot, curry,
citrus fruits, coffee and teas.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead, feed your cold and starve the elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN SOUP
</P>
<P>
   What is does: Relieves stuffy nose.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: The aromatic moisture helps break up congestion
and helps expectorate mucus. Hot liquids also help the body replace
fluids and soothe sore throats. Chicken soup also contains
cysteine, an amino acid that is chemically similar to a drug
prescribed for bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Depending on the ingredients you use,
the soup likely will be full of vitamins and minerals. Adding
garlic, cayenne pepper or curry powder will also act as
decongestants.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CHILI PEPPERS
</P>
<P>
   What they do: Help relieve bronchial and sinus congestion.
</P>
<P>
   How they work: Capsaicin, a phytochemical that gives peppers
their zip, stimulates the mucus glands in the lungs and nose,
breaking up phlegm. The hotter the pepper, the better its
decongestant powers.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: A bowl of chili loaded with chilies,
green and red bell peppers will help drain the sinuses, which in
turn will help you be able to taste again. Not up to a bowl of
chili? Chinese, Thai or Indian hot-and-sour soup will help clear
your nasal passages and soothe your throat.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CIRTUS FRUITS
</P>
<P>
   What they do: Pump back in lost fluids depleted from fever and
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   How they work: Rich in vitamin C, citrus fruits help reduce the
severity of colds. A 1979 study in the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition found volunteers who drank one glass of orange juice
containing 80 milligrams of vitamin C a day had 14 to 21 percent
fewer cold symptoms than those who did not drink the OJ.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Drink at least 8 ounces of orange juice,
grapefruit juice or tangerine juice once a day during the cold and
flu season. More is better with vitamin C. Since it is a water
soluble vitamin, the body quickly uses it up, so feel free to
replenish with more juice, or better yet, a fresh piece of citrus
fruit that will also add fiber to your diet. A note on grapefruit,
however. It contains a phytochemical that can alter the effect of
some medications, including cold medicine. Make sure to talk to the
pharmacist or doctor about the possible ramifications of grapefruit
if you're on medication.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   TEA
</P>
<P>
   What it does: Replenishes fluids, relieves nasal congestion,
breathing difficulties and may help fight viruses and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: The hot vapors help break up nasal decongestion
and mucus. It also helps ease the pain of sore throats. Tea
contains phytochemicals and caffeine, which help open up airways.
Researchers world wide have reported that black tea, and especially
green tea, help ward off the bacteria responsible for staph and
gastrointestinal infections.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Too boost the benefits of tea add some
honey, great for relieving a sore throat, add lemon for an extra
bit of vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CURRY POWDER
</P>
<P>
   What it does: Relieves bronchial and sinus congestion. It may
also help kill cold and flu viruses.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: Curry powder is a mixture of several spices,
including chiles, mustard seed, cumin, ginger and turmeric, which
all have powerful effects on cold and flu symptoms. Turmeric
contains curcumin, an antioxidant phytochemical that kills viruses
and bacteria. The capsaicin in the chiles stimulate the mucus
membranes to help clear congestion, and cumin's aldehydes help
settle the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Indian and Thai cuisine are a good way
to add curry to your diet. Cold and flu got you down? It's a good
excuse to order takeout. Or, open up a can of chicken soup and add
some curry powder.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC
</P>
<P>
   What it does: Dracula's scourge is ready to attack your chest
congestion, stuffy nose and sore throat.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: The sulfur compounds that give garlic its very
distinctive odor and taste stimulate the mucus membranes in your
respiratory system, breaking up congestion and bringing up mucus.
Raw garlic is also loaded with phytochemicals that kill bacteria
and viruses. Researchers at Brigham Young University in 1992
reported that crushed garlic in oil killed rhinovirus type 2 (a
common cause of the common cold), two forms of herpes and several
other common viruses. Researchers worldwide have reported similar
results using garlic extract against fungi and making garlic one of
the best, if not the smelliest, studied natural remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: The more garlic, the better. Just feel
like tea and toast? Make it garlic toast. Just feel like having
some soup? Make it garlic soup. Feeling better and thinking about
having pizza? Crushed garlic will help your cold and add some
pizzaz to your pie.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   GINGERROOT
</P>
<P>
   What it does: Calms your cough, soothes your sore throat and
helps fight viruses.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: Gingerroot has long been a tradition in Chinese
and Indian medicine for fighting coughs and colds. The chemical
compounds in gingerroot, called sesquiterpenes, are active against
rhinoviruses that cause most colds. Clinical studies in the United
States, Britain and Denmark have proven gingerroot to be effective
against nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Brew a cup of ginger tea, available in
bag form in grocery stores and specialty shops. Or add gingerroot
to Asian and Thai food. For a quick hit, snack on crystallized
ginger, available at natural food stores.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   HORSERADISH
</P>
<P>
   What it does: Relieves bronchial and sinus congestion.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: Horseradish is loaded with isothiocyanates,
pytochemicals which stimulate the lung membranes and nasal passages
to break up congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Fresh horseradish will spice up your
sinuses. Another sure bet: Wasabi, a Japanese horseradish, which is
used as a condiment for sushi. In a pinch, jarred pickled
horseradish will provide some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   What they do: Relieve bronchial and sinus congestion.
</P>
<P>
   How they work: The sulfur compounds in onions, called
thiosulfinates, help reduce inflammation of the airways. There is
also some evidence that onions may help fight off secondary
bacterial infections. Researchers at Assiut University in Egypt
reported in 1995 that onion oil was found to be highly effective
against the same bacteria that causes pneumonia and strep throat.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the benefits: Raw onions, which contain vitamin C,
will be most beneficial, although sauted onions will also help ease
your congestion. Pair fresh red onions in a salad with citrus
fruits such as oranges and grapefruit for an added dose of vitamin
C.

WEB SITES CALL ATTENTION TO ALL RELIGIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking old-time religion (or New Age spirituality) on line can
be a hellish business of sifting through myriad sites as diverse as
the homepage of a Minnesota-based sect that practices ``spiritual
dreaming'' and the official Web site of the Holy See. With Yahoo
listing almost 7,500 Christian sites alone, cyberspace promises as
much daunting journey as heaven-sent opportunity for believers and
searchers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Now, striding boldly into this on-line chaos comes
Beliefnet.com, thought to be the first Web site to attempt to
encompass all of the world's principal religions and belief
systems. Launched this month by two journalists with strong roots
in traditional print media, Beliefnet targets a multifaith audience
with a slickly packaged magazine-style mix of news and advice and
inspirational writing from a panoply of religious perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that Beliefnet will be a place where adults and
children alike can find answers to some of life's stickiest
questions,'' says co-founder Steven Waldman, former editor of US
News &AMP; World Report, ``or at least find other people similiarly
baffled, curious, or in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Beliefnet has attracted more than $5 million of start-up capital
and a Who's Who of regular writers, ranging from liberal Catholic
sociologist and novelist Rev. Andrew Greeley to Harvard theologian
Harvey Cox, from conservative Catholic Tom Bethell of American
Spectator magazine to rabbinical writer Joseph Telushkin, from
American Buddhist lama Surya Das of Cambridge to National Public
Radio correspondent and Wicca priestess Margot Adler.
</P>
<P>
   Based in New York, it's the brainchild of Waldman, 37, and
Robert Nylen, 55, founding publisher of the former New England
Monthly, who shuttles between a Manhattan apartment and his home in
Ashfield.
</P>
<P>
   While providing a site for all those ``sticky'' questions, they
also devoutly hope to make money in the process. In an on-line
world where most religion sites are ``dot.org,'' not ``dot.com,''
Beliefnet is a for-profit venture. An estimated 25 million
Americans regularly peruse the Internet for religious information,
and Waldman and Nylen want to tap that potential market with an
e-commerce component scheduled to go on line in the spring. They
expect to sell and advertise inspirational books, tapes, videos,
and CDs as well as holistic health products and trips with a
religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate doing tens of millions dollars in business
within five years,'' says Nylen.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's sound prediction or fervent prayer, of course,
remains to be seen. There are several large Christian commercial
Web sites such as iChristian and Crosswalk but none that targets as
broad an interfaith market as Beliefnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very well-designed site and they seem to have
leap-frogged over what else is out there. I've never heard of
another aggregator who cuts across all these differrent sectors and
is a portal for all religions,'' says Jill Frankle, director of
retail research at Gomez Advisors of Lincoln, Mass., an e-commerce
analysis firm. ``Getting visitors is the key and having leading
religion writers and columnists should attract strong participation
from religious communities. Then, e-commerce can be layered on top
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beliefnet's menu offers a virtual smorgasbord of spiritual
concepts and religious practices whose strength _ and weakness _ is
its one-stop shopping approach to matters of the soul. It's an
equal-opportunity portal where major and minor religions get equal
access.
</P>
<P>
   It offers everything from tips on the best way to say grace in a
restaurant (bowed head and silent prayer) and weekly Torah
commentaries to advice about what to give a newlywed pagan couple
(matching goblets, hanging crystals, and a broom made of birch or
cinnamon to put over the door). It aims to be both intellectual and
interactive, with articles on such topics as the growing shortage
of Roman Catholic priests and electronic ``prayer circles''
soliciting prayers on behalf of individuals in need. It includes a
daily quotation excerpted from the writings of the Dalai Lama and
an ``Ask the Lama'' column in which Surya Das addresses such basic
questions about Buddhism as ``Can Buddhists eat meat?'' (Yes,
although many don't.)
</P>
<P>
   Its ``browse religions'' link leads to the home pages of 32
religions from Bahai and Buddhism to Unitarian-Universalist and
Zoroastrianism and includes Christianity (Catholic, Eastern
Orthodox, Mormon, and Protestant), Judaism and Islam as well as
Jainism, Shinto, and Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other sites may have chat rooms, but I'll have a chant room,''
quips Surya Das, an on-line veteran who has had his own Web site
for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new media, and I was hesitant at first,''
acknowledges Cox, a Baptist minister. ``But my students are always
showing me things that they've pulled off the Net, and obviously
that's what more and more people are looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Waldman sees it, this opportunity for spiritual
comparison shopping makes Beliefnet a religious site uniquely
attuned to its times. About 60 percent of Americans now marry
outside their faith or denomination, he says, and people are
increasingly exposed to _ and often intrigued by _ belief systems
other than the ones of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Waldman himself is a product of these times. He describes
himself as ``a standard-issue American Reform Jew raised to know
more about Jewish culture than Jewish theology.'' He's married to a
Presbyterian woman who, he says, agreed to raise their children as
Jews who are aware of their mother's faith. A few nights a week, he
says, they sing their children the Sh'ma, the core prayer of Jewish
belief, ``sometimes before and sometimes after the Lord's Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Beliefnet's goal is to encourage tolerance and a wide-ranging,
faith-based conversation about some of the vexing issues of modern
life. The danger is that by assembling so many religious
perspectives in one place it will promote a superficial,
pick-and-choose approach to belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization provides us with the double challenge of getting
along together and also affirming and projecting our own identity,
and the Internet is a tremendous resource to do that,'' says the
Rev. Theodor Stylianopoulos, who teaches at the Eastern Orthodox
Hellenic College in Brookline, Mass. and writes a column for
Beliefnet. ``In our pluralistic, post-modern world, religion has to
go to the marketplace, but I would be concerned about the site if
it suggests a mingling of religions and a loss of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Waldman anticipates such concerns in a preemptive
article he wrote for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion rubs our faces in certain uncomfortable principles
(like those underlying the Ten Commandments) even when it might be
more convenient to ignore them,'' he writes. ``The Internet, on the
other hand . . . will make shopping for principles a little too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the telephone can be misused to harass and bedevil, so
can the Internet end up either eroding or enhancing religion. It's
our choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Nylen did not set out to launch an Internet company. With
backgrounds in publishing, the original idea was to start a
magazine with a strong Web presence. But after some research they
concluded that a Web site was far more likely to attract investors
and viewers _ as well as make more money _ than a print venture.
And, Waldman says, the interactive nature of the Internet makes it
responsive to the natural rhythms of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media don't cover the most important events in
most peoples lives, like the births of children or deaths in the
family,'' he says. ``An interactive media can let people create a
community and cover themselves and their own life passages.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's ``Milestones'' page chronicles those passages. Its
early postings come from the 35 staff members and their families
and friends. In the memorial he posted to his father, Max, Waldman
writes, ``All his life he worked hard, often exhausted himself to
support his family and see that his only son could go on to better
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Stone, a Methodist minister who teaches evangelism at
Boston University's School of Theology, regularly surfs religious
Web sites. So far _ and for the most part _ he likes what he sees
on Beliefnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the breadth and the attractive format,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could become a kind of religious deli where people select
what they want from here and there,'' he cautions, ``but a better
understanding of other people's traditions and unique contributions
is healthy. The world's problems are too great to be solved by any
one group.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Immersion in a massive display of cars, trucks, and
SUVs, as happens at venues such as the North American International
Auto Show here, can be like a trip to the art gallery to view
pointillist works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you have to step back from the seemingly random
scattering of dots to see the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   Once I stepped back from the acres of vehicles showcased at
Detroit this year, that picture was clear: trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks, in myriad forms _ brutes, sleek throwbacks,
truck/SUV hybrids _ dominated this show. Trucks are the hot
immediate future in the industry and almost everybody is looking
for the truck that will appeal to the most folks. Even Volkswagen
offered a pickup prototype that still managed to look like a coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge showcased a rig called the MAXXcab, cab-forward in design,
part luxury SUV, with a pickup truck bed. GMC rolled out the
Terradyne, a bulky, rugged brute of a prototype. Chevrolet showed
its SSR, a pickup with enough car blended in that I could not help
but think of an updated El Camino. It seems as if everybody's got a
four-door pickup in the works or on the way, and bed extenders,
once the domain of aftermarketeers, come right from the factory
now.
</P>
<P>
   But in Detroit, two trucks in particular emerged and should be
watched closely, one ballyhooed and ready to roll, the other
quietly plopped on the show floor with no fanfare but quickly
drawing plenty of fans.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the Chevrolet Avalanche, the second the Ford
Equator. I suspect they'll be going head-to-head soon.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy calls the Avalanche a sport-utility pickup. That just
makes it part of rising wave when it goes on sale in the first
quarter of 2001. It's got a short pickup bed, a four-door cabin,
much like an SUV, and a distinct truck look at the grill. What it's
got that sets it apart from all others _ and keep this word in mind
_ is a midgate. Until now, the problem with SUV-truck hybrids has
been a bed too small for, say, a sheet of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   What the midgate does is solve that problem. The bed in the
Avalanche is a shade over five feet long. However, when the rear
seats are folded down, the window is removed and stored on board,
and the midgate, which separates bed and cabin, is folded down,
voila: eight-foot bed. The bed can also be securely covered and
locked as you would lock a car trunk to protect tools, groceries,
or whatever you are carrying.
</P>
<P>
   It will be built on a spinoff of the same platform that gives us
the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra and the Chevy-GMC lineup of
sport utes. In fact, it's about the size of a Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bold move for Chevrolet and puts it right back in a
market _ four-door pickups _ that has exploded. Chevy, however,
failed to catch the first wave in a way that Ford did so
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, curiously, chose to quietly slip what could be its entry
into the midgate race onto the show floor. While it has pushed hard
for the F-150 SuperCrew, a four-full-door pickup, and rolled out
the Sport Trac, an SUV-with-bed based on the Explorer, it was
subtle in plopping the loud Equator concept into public view.
</P>
<P>
   The Equator combines the F-150 (length) and F-350 (width) for a
wide and rugged stance. It's got a certain Hummer-like boldness to
it, and it's also got Kevlar bumpers, fenders, wheel wells, and
lower trim for protection in offroad driving.
</P>
<P>
   Its doors are high, and side panels drop down to form running
boards when the doors are open.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reportedly has been working on a midgate design that would
have the window descend into the middle panel _ much like the back
on a station wagon _ before the panel is folded down into the
passenger compartment. That would be a good thing and would avoid
what I suspect could be the annoying problem of taking a window out
and storing it onboard.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford builds the Equator, it will need a midgate of some sort
because the bed is simply too tiny for hauling loads of any
consequence, and without a midgate, it will cede this niche in the
expanding world of trucks to Chevrolet.

KEEPING WARM WHEN YOU CAN'T PUSH UP THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So want to keep warm when it gets cold?
</P>
<P>
   Cold not only outside, but inside, which sometimes happens
during a long cold snap _ and goodness knows we have one right now.
</P>
<P>
   That is when no amount of pumping up the heat, boosting the
thermostat, seems to do much good. Why is it that 65 in summer, out
in the yard enjoying the weather, feels so good and so comfortable,
while 65 indoors in the dead of winter is chilly and miserable?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it is probably the humidity or the lack of
humidity in the house in winter. You know, the house is dry as a
bone, your mouth is dry and your nose gets all caked up. And,
static electricity is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The cure there is easy: Install a humidifier on your hot air
furnace. If you have hot water heat, you cannot put a humidifier on
the boiler. But you can put in a room humidifier, a console type
appliance that produces enough humidity to make you feel a lot
better, not necessarily warmer but certainly more comfortable. Keep
the unit full of water and put one upstairs as well.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, it is difficult to get the relative humdity up to the
ideal of 40 percent, let alone keep it there. But you can try. If
you get it to 30, that's pretty good, and it will make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   There are some ways to heat up the house, which is costly, but
there are more ways to make yourself more comfortbale when the
house cannot get any warmer. We are not talking about putting in
more insulation, fixing the windows and caulking; these are not
accomplished in a day or two. They take a lot more time than that.
</P>
<P>
   What we are talking about are quick fixes, often permanent, that
we all can do without running off and buying all kinds of
insulation, new windows and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing. Wear a hat. It's no insult, to the host or anyone else
living in the house; it was done often in the past. A simple hat _
stocking, skullcap, beret, cap _ will do to keep the head warm. It
is true that one loses the most heat through the head, whether the
head has a gorgeous mane or no hair at all.
</P>
<P>
   Wear layered clothing, not tight, and warm socks. Wool is the
best material for most purposes, and if your feet and head are
warm, and your hands, you are pretty well warm all over.
</P>
<P>
   Invest in thermal underwear. There are new fleece products that
are lightweight and toasty, not to mention trendy, including vests,
shirt-jackets and sports pants.
</P>
<P>
   Wear a scarf _ wool (cashmere is the best) or silk, which is
very warming.
</P>
<P>
   Keep active. No sitting around doing TV. Find a project; your
activity will keep you warm.
</P>
<P>
   Pile on the blankets. When you go to bed, use plenty of
blankets; wool is good but sometimes heavy, and some sleepers are
allergic to it; quilts are good but comforters are best, if you can
keep them from sliding off the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Use passive solar heat: Let the sunshine in. Open curtains and
draperies on the south side of the house (or the sunniest side)
during the day to let the sun heat the interior air. Keep them open
as long as the sun shows in the room. Close them at night.
</P>
<P>
   Tend to the heating system. If you have a forced hot air
furnace, keep its filters fresh by changing them every month. Clean
registers, to make them work their best.
</P>
<P>
   Use that duct tape _ check ducts for leaks and separations and
seal them so you're not needlessly heating uninhabited areas such
as basements or attics.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term fix is to insulate the ducts in a hot air system.
This will keep the hot air in the ducts until it can be delivered
to the rooms without losing the heat to the basement, where it is
wasted. Insulate hot water pipes where accessible.
</P>
<P>
   If you have hot water heat, clean the baseboard radiators and
other radiators as needed to maximize heating capability.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust the heating system. Sometimes you can adjust a hot air
system to bring more heat in often-used rooms and reduce the heat
to bedrooms or rooms that are not used as often.
</P>
<P>
   Go in the basement and inspect the round ducts leading to rooms
from a larger rectangular trunk duct. Where the round duct leaves
the big trunk duct, you may see a little metal lever. This is a
damper; if the lever is parallel to the round duct, it is open; if
is at right angles to the duct, it is closed.
</P>
<P>
   You can open or close those dampers to certain rooms. It may
take some experimenting, but it is possible to make a difference,
and get more heat into the room where you want it most.
</P>
<P>
   You could try closing the registers in the rooms themselves, but
this is less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Caulk and caulk. Use caulks and seals to plug drafts around
doors and windows _ and don't forget to seal around electrical
boxes and plumbing fixtures. Most of this work is done indoors so
you won't have to go out in that frigid air.
</P>
<P>
   Any caulking around the window and door frames (they can lose a
lot of heat) on the inside will not show if a neat bead is applied
from a caulking gun. Besides, with draperies and curtains in place,
you won't see that bead of caulking anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If your windows feel cold and drafty, they are cold and drafty.
So, install an inside storm window, not a fancy permanent one, but
one that you can install with little effort and cash outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a storm window kit at a lumber store; it consists of a big
picee of Saran type plastic and a border system that eases the
chore of setting it against the inside window frame. It will pevent
a lot of drafts and reduce the loss of heat through your windows,
at a fraction of a cost of a regular glass or plastic inside storm.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot find the kit, buy polyethylene plastic and tape it
to the frame.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy foam covers for double plug outlets and switch boxes
as well. Unscrew the cover, insert the foam cover and put the solid
cover back in place.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tricks can make you more comfortable in a cold
house, as long as the house is not really cold.
</P>
<P>
   When it's really cold. But what happens when you are in a condo
or apartment and the heating system in a large building is just not
good enough to get it up beyond 60? Now, that is cold.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes heating systems are undersized in large buildings.
This is done on purpose to save money; besides, the thinking goes,
the really cold snaps will be short, and when the temperature
staggers back up to 30 or so, the heat in the condo or apartment
will go up, too.
</P>
<P>
   For this miserable situation, auxiliary heaters are the answer.
These heaters are electric, and in light of the recent cold snap,
may be hard to find. An auxiliary heater will heat people, so they
have to be relatively close to the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Some heat with a high resistance wire; that is, the wire gets
red hot, protected by a cage to keep the hot wire away from the
person.
</P>
<P>
   These heaters are fast, usually equipped with a fan, and drying,
but here is one idea to add humidity to the house: Put a large,
shallow pan full of water in front of the heater; as the fan blows
the warm air over the water, it will move water vapor toward you
and your caky nose.
</P>
<P>
   Such a heater is safe because it has a tip switch that turns the
heater off if it is tipped over.
</P>
<P>
   But with that pan of water in front of the heater, be extremely
careful that the water and heater do not come in contact with each
other, and that you do not touch the water and the heater at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Another good electric heater is a metal affair that looks like a
radiator and in fact is one, full of water. It produces a low, even
heat, is long in warming up but long in cooling off. The water is
sealed in the unit. It too is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Always be careful that you don't use a heater that is too big
for the circuit; you could overload the circuit or cause a short.
Some of the water-filled radiators have two switches, one 900
watts, the other 600 watts. Do not use them together if the ciruit
is not big enough to handle it. Alone, the 900 or 600 setting is
probably OK.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't fall for the ads that say that certain heaters
are great heaters and save you money, too. 'Tisn't so.
</P>
<P>
   You will get the same heat out of one 600-watt heater as any
other 600-watt heater. Any difference in efficiency will be minor,
and probably undetectable by you as you bundle up in the Hudson's
Bay blanket.

WHAT DOES MCCAIN STAND FOR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not hard to understand the passion that John McCain
inspires in his admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the candidates in the race for president, only McCain
can say, with Walt Whitman, ``I am the man, I suffer'd, I was
there.'' More than most in public life, he knows the meaning of
pain, and that is not a knowledge to be dismissed lightly. If
anyone is the un-Clinton, McCain is: At the worst time of his life,
he behaved with great courage. In the crucible of a POW camp, he
learned the meaning of sacrifice and honor. Neither quality is
associated with the self-indulgent narcissist who lives in the
White House now.
</P>
<P>
   I admire those who have endured grievous suffering without
losing their own decency. My father, who survived Auschwitz, is
such a man. To elect such a man as president after eight years of
Bill Clinton, a man perpetually fascinated with his own appetites,
would be a cleansing experience. But it takes more than wartime
suffering to fit a man for the presidency. What is the case for the
McCain campaign? Is there a reason, the Hanoi Hilton aside, for
voters in the Republican primaries to prefer him over George W.
Bush or Steve Forbes?
</P>
<P>
   For GOP voters who want a solid establishment candidate, the
obvious choice is Bush. He is a proven vote-getter who campaigns
with ease; his political inclination is loosely conservative; and
although he _ like his father _ disdains ``the vision thing,'' he
is advised by some of his party's brightest luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seeking a candidate who will run on Ronald Reagan's
ideology _ greater freedom, smaller government, lower taxes, free
markets _ can choose Forbes. True, he lacks experience in public
office. His philosophy of government, though, is informed and
clear, and his campaign so far has been both focused and mostly
pander-free. As for Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, they offer
themselves to voters who care most about social issues _ abortion
especially _ and moral revival.
</P>
<P>
   But for which Republicans does McCain speak?
</P>
<P>
   His signature issue, campaign finance ``reform,'' would sharply
curtail free speech and enhance the influence of the media. Far
from being a Republican or conservative issue, McCain's bill would
hurt Republicans and conservatives _ who particularly depend on
advertising to get their message out _ the most.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's top Senate priority in recent years was his crusade to
slam a $500 billion ``settlement'' on tobacco companies, supposedly
to recoup the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. It was a
phony rationale: Government takes in far more money in cigarette
taxes than it pays out to treat sick smokers on Medicaid. And since
when has the GOP stood for beating up an industry for making and
selling a lawful product?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a proud conservative,'' McCain said recently, when I asked
why he is running to the left. ``I have not ever voted for a tax
increase. I'm for less government. . . . I'd put my conservative
credentials up against anybody.'' But the impact of his tobacco
legislation would have been a painful new tax on smokers, who are
more likely to be found near the botton of the income ladder. And
the tobacco and campaign-finance bills together would have meant an
enormous expansion of government power _ exactly the reverse of
what McCain claims to want.
</P>
<P>
   McCain holds himself out as a blunt and candid man, a candidate
who tells people ``the truth _ not what they want to hear, but what
I think they should hear.'' His campaign bus is nicknamed the
``Straight Talk Express,'' and there certainly are times when he
seems like the only straight shooter in town. When almost no other
Republican would make the case for using force to stop the Serbs'
assault on Kosovo, for example, McCain did so with unvarnished
clarity. In Iowa, to take another example, he alone refused to
kowtow to the ethanol lobby.
</P>
<P>
   But is it straight shooting to denounce the Confederate flag as
``offensive in many, many ways . . . a symbol of racism and
slavery'' one day, then endorse it as ``a symbol of heritage'' the
next? Or to hold himself out as an opponent of racial preferences,
yet tell a convention of minority journalists that if he becomes
president, he will ``absolutely and unequivocally'' name an
Asian-American to his Cabinet? Do straight-talking Republicans
demonize other Republicans' tax-cut proposals with specious
class-warfare rhetoric (``We give the millionaire a $2,000 refund.
Governor Bush gives him $50,000'')?
</P>
<P>
   Ask McCain about abortion and he has a pat answer: ``I'm for
repeal of Roe v. Wade.'' But in August he told the San Francisco
Chronicle, ``I'd love to see a point where (Roe v. Wade) is
irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer
necessary. But certainly in the short term, or even the long term,
I would not support repeal of Roe v. Wade.'' Straight talk?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is hypocrisy; I think it is ideological
incoherence. For all his fine attributes, McCain seems to lack any
philosophical core. When he talks about honor and duty, he is
unerring; when he talks about issues, he is all over the place. It
is good to hear a presidential candidate who treats questions of
character seriously. But questions of policy and governance are
vital too. The senator makes a fine role model. I'm not sure he
would make a fine president.

HANCOCK ENTERS MARKET AS INSURANCE STOCKS SUFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball greats Sammy Sosa and Hank Aaron will be on the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange to mark the debut of John Hancock
Financial Services as a public company.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Hancock's initial public offering to knock the
ball out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, insurance stocks are about as welcome on Wall
Street as insurance solicitations during dinner time. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's index of life insurance stocks is down 18 percent this
year after a substantial fall last year.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks reek of the old economy at a time when investors are
enamored with the new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stack these stocks up against tech stocks, they put
people to sleep,'' said Lanny Thorndike, a portfolio manager with
Century Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   The life insurers, Hancock included, have respectable earnings
and have been meeting their numbers. These days that isn't good
enough. At the end of trading Thursday, Hancock is likely to have a
market value of between $5 billion and $6 billion. There are
high-tech companies in Massachusetts with minuscule sales and no
earnings that are worth considerably more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the life insurers are suffering from more than a lack of
sex appeal. Money managers and analysts point to three factors that
are depressing the stocks. They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Rising interest rates. Insurance companies stash a lot of
their money in bonds. As interest rates rise, those bonds lose a
portion of their value and the spread the insurers earn on some of
their investments shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   With three interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve last year
and possibly another two or three still to come, the insurers are
hurting along with the rest of the financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets hammered when rates go up,'' complained James E.
Moynihan III, an analyst with Fleet Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   Both insurers and analysts insist investors' fixation on
interest rates is misguided. Like the banks, insurance companies
have gotten quite skillful about managing in any rate environment.
In this case, however, perception is reality, and there is not much
the insurance companies can do about it but wait for rates to peak.
</P>
<P>
   --Intensifying competition, especially in annuities. The basic
life insurance business grows roughly in line with the economy, 3
percent to 5 percent a year. Companies that have done better have
done so by finding faster-growing niches. The best niche in recent
years has been variable annuities _ products that blend life
insurance with mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The annuity business is still strong, but everyone and his
brother _ insurers, banks, mutual fund firms _ has jumped into it,
squeezing margins in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't rocket science,'' said Kevin Callahan, an insurance
analyst with Loomise Sayles. ``Everyone is looking for a way to
grow a little faster and they are all looking in the same places.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is only a tiny player in the variable annuity business,
but once again, the pall on annuities is affecting the whole
industry.
</P>
<P>
   --Too much supply. Think of Hancock as the first plane on the
runway with a number of other planes stacked up behind it waiting
for takeoff. Following close on the heels of the Hancock deal are
IPOs from Sun Life Assurance, which owns Massachusetts Financial
Services; Metropolitan Life, owner of State Street Research; and
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market is asking: `Do we really need another $50
billion worth of life insurance stock?'' said Lanny Thorndike.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hancock, the others are all mutual insurers who feel they
need to be investor-owned companies to participate in the coming
consolidation of the financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the rush to go public is likely to keep the
whole sector depressed.
</P>
<P>
   What would it take to light a fire under life insurance stocks?
Some sign that interest rates were heading back down again, say
analysts. Assuming the Fed succeeds in slowing the US economy, such
a turning point could come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse in some of the high-flying tech stocks might help
too. As long as investors are focused on the techs, it will be hard
to get them interested in solid, steady performers like life
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is consolidation. There is broad agreement that
this country has too many insurance companies and too many banks.
As those numbers shrink through mergers, costs should come down,
margins should increase, and investors should be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   With its better-than-average return on equity and recognizable
brand name, Hancock may do better than many of its competitors over
time. Just don't look for any home runs.

   CLINTON-EDUCATION (Washington) _ In his State of the Union
address, President Clinton calls for a doubling of federal spending
on after-school programs and summer school to help children in
failing schools achieve high academic standards, and expansion of
Head Start by $1 billion. The ambitious plan is likely to encounter
resistance in a Republican-controlled Congress that wants less
federal involvement in education, not more. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   VIEQUES-NEGOTIATIONS (Washington) _ As White House and Puerto
Rican officials meet to discuss permanently closing the Navy's
bombing range on the island of Vieques, Sila Calderon, San Juan's
mayor, blasts the service for its ``appalling'' and ``shameful''
treatment of the island's 9,000 residents. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-N.H. (Stratham, N.H.) _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley presses
his attack on Vice President Al Gore for ``misrepresenting'' his
policy proposals and insists that a candidate must speak the truth
on the campaign trail. Bradley _ who has previously criticized the
president for misrepresenting his health plan _ says if a candidate
does not tell the truth in the campaign, the American people can't
trust him to tell the truth as president. By STEWART M. POWELL.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The message of the dissolving
candidacy of former Sen. Bill Bradley is that if you hold yourself
out as more principled and high-minded than your opponent, it
better be true and you better stick to it.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to reverse his political slide, Bradley suddenly
dropped his mask of statesmanship in the New Hampshire debate,
negating the theme on which he had intended to distinguish himself
from Gore. No more Mr. Nice Guy. But Gore is smoother at the tough
guy tactics. A frustrated Bradley got too personal in his attacks
on Gore and came across as a mean-spirited whiner. By MARIANNE

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ This year's presidential campaign
demonstrates how disproportionately important opposition to
abortion and the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized
it in 1973 have become to Republicans. In their debate the other
evening, the five Republican presidential hopefuls discussed issues
that one would require the attention of the leader of the world's
most powerful nation: taxes, trade, national defense, health care,
education, immigration, campaign finance reform and how to allocate
the budget surplus. But no issue generated more heat or triggered
more passionate declarations than abortion. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   SUPERBOWL-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Whether or not Super Bowl XXXIV
is remembered for the game the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans
will play on Sunday, it will certainly enter the annals of Madison
Avenue as Dot-Com Bowl I. But will consumers recall it as a
dot-comedy of errors or the day that Internet advertisers joined
the ranks of Super Bowl mainstays like Anheuser-Busch, Federal
Express, PepsiCo and Visa? More than a dozen of the 30-plus
companies spending an estimated average of $2.2 million for each
30-second spot will be Web sites and electronic commerce
entrepreneurs. Last year, there were only two dot-com advertisers
during the Super Bowl, three if you count a commercial from the
Victoria's Secret unit of Intimate Brands promoting an online
fashion show. The stakes have never been higher for companies
gambling that the impressions they make by exposing themselves to
the 130 million or so Americans watching the game will justify the
huge outlays to buy commercial time. By Stuart Elliott.

THE EDGE OF M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: note italics below) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months ago, M. Night Shyamalan's name wasn't exactly on the
tip of most people's tongues in Hollywood. Shyamalan (pronounced
the easy way, sha-ma-lan) had written and directed two movies that
had more or less disappeared without a trace. His new film, ``The
Sixth Sense,'' did boast Bruce Willis as a star, but Disney was so
unsure of its prospects that they kept the press from seeing it
until the very last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Half a billion dollars later, Shyamalan still isn't exactly a
household name (people have to learn how to pronounce it first),
but every studio certainly would like to be in business with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that you never know in this business,'' says
Laurence Mark, a veteran Hollywood producer (``Jerry Maguire,''
``As Good as It Gets''), who has also worked as a studio executive
at Fox and Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find really interesting is that his other movie (``Wide
Awake'') was just awful. You never would have hired him based on
that movie. You just wouldn't have. (BEGIN ITAL)He(END ITAL)
wouldn't have. And then he comes out of nowhere with this
phenomenal film.''
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan would probably take exception to that assessment,
particularly the part about ``Wide Awake,'' a warm parable about a
10-year-old's search for meaning that received generally good
reviews when it opened two years ago. But he certainly wouldn't
contest the fact that his life has changed immeasurably since ``The
Sixth Sense'' opened last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has almost been too much of a good thing,'' Shyamalan says.
``I wish it could be spread out. I haven't had enough time to take
it all in.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been much for Shyamalan to absorb. Last month, he sold
his latest script, a supernatural fantasy titled ``Unbreakable,''
to Disney for $5 million. It's the biggest spec script sale in
Hollywood history, and Shyamalan's payday doesn't end there. Disney
is giving him another $5 million to direct the film, which will
begin filming in March for a Thanksgiving release.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the financial rewards, Shyamalan has received several
accolades, including a recent Directors Guild nomination, a Golden
Globe nod for his ``Sixth Sense'' script and the Visionary Award at
the Palm Springs Film Festival. The fact that he co-wrote the
holiday family hit ``Stuart Little'' hasn't hurt his standing,
either.
</P>
<P>
   The attention _ and the avalanche of studio offers _ has been
head-turning, but Shyamalan seems committed to working in Hollywood
on his own terms. That means he makes all his films in his hometown
of Philadelphia, where he can go home at night and be with his wife
of seven years (they met at college) and two daughters. He says he
won't film on location until his children are older.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big concession, and a bit of a surprise given Shyamalan's
huge ambitions for himself and his work. Shyamalan, 29, has been
making movies since the age of 10. Inspired by ``Star Wars,''
Shyamalan would round up his friends and neighbors for the short
films he made with his father's 8mm camera. By the time he was 15,
he already had 45 shorts under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   He bucked his family's tradition of medicine (12 relatives,
including his mother and father, are physicians) and went to New
York University's film school. The goals were always the same:
write and direct his own movies. And be the highest-paid
professional in his field.
</P>
<P>
   ``My target audience is everyone,'' Shyamalan says. ``I make
movies for 13-year-olds and 70-year-olds, which can be a pretty big
burden when you have to make decisions that won't exclude anyone
from that age range. But I want my movies to be seen. I want my
name to be like (Steven) Spielberg's, so when people see it, they
will come to the theater with excitement and anticipation that
there will be a high level of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a filmmaker with Shyamalan's lofty goals would take
up residence in Los Angeles, set up a production deal with a studio
and spend the majority of his time schmoozing, taking meetings and
reading about himself in the trade papers. But Shyamalan's resolve
to put family first keeps him in Philadelphia, and his self-imposed
exile makes him a mystery to many in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a father and a husband before being a filmmaker,'' says
actor Eugene Osment, whose son, Haley Joel, memorably played the
boy who could see dead people in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the Palm Springs Film Festival, Shyamalan delivered a
speech that gave the audience the same mix of goose bumps and
sniffles that ``The Sixth Sense'' produced. Shyamalan told of being
kept in a waiting room for three hours by the head of a company. If
he waited longer, he would break a promise to his wife that he be
home by 6 p.m. to help care for their baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   So Shyamalan put on his coat and prepared to leave. The
surprised receptionist snapped, ``Who do you think you are?''
Shyamalan says he thought long about the woman's question,
eventually determining to drastically reorder his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to be a husband to my wife, a father to my children,
a son to my parents, a brother to my sister and a friend to my
friends, and then I'll be the filmmaker I want to be and reach my
audience,'' Shyamalan told the appreciative audience, who greeted
his address with a rousing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a big heart,'' says Haley Joel Osment, the actor whom
Garry Shandling insists is ``43 and can play 8.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met him, I thought he'd be some really old guy because
the things he writes are just so wise,'' Osment continues. ``He may
be very young, but he has a deep understanding of people and
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan cites his parents' high expectations (``an A- was bad
news'') and his Indian background (he was born in India and moved
to Philadelphia when he was an infant) as important factors
contributing to his early success. Shyamalan attended Catholic
schools but calls himself a Hindu, and as such, believes that
ghosts and spirits are a normal part of life.
</P>
<P>
   Such beliefs informed the spirituality that pervades ``The Sixth
Sense'' and his next film ``Unbreakable,'' which tells the story of
a train wreck survivor who learns that the accident has a deeper
meaning. Shyamalan says it's ``the best screenplay I've ever
written.'' Not surprisingly, Bruce Willis will star again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take people to the edge; that's why I named my
production company `Blinding Edge Pictures,''' Shyamalan says. ``I
want to take people to the place where they see that bright light
and get scared, but there's something beyond that light. And I want
to show them that something. Those are the stories that I'm going
to tell, and that's the challenge I'm going to issue for my
audience.'' &QL;

&HT;     EMPLOYEES THREATEN STRIKE AT LANDMARK RADIO STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY DELGADO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Some 40 news employees of the Pacifica
Foundation are threatening to go on strike Monday in a dispute with
management of the landmark broadcast organization.
</P>
<P>
   The employees claim the Pacifica management removed its popular
national news director in November after he aired a story detailing
a boycott by 16 Pacifica affiliates over a censorship issue. The
disgruntled employees also say that Pacifica has continued a
pattern of censorship and program cancellations throughout its
stations since a bitter labor dispute at KPFA-FM in Berkeley was
settled late last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Glantz, a frequent national news contributor and KPFA's
Sacramento bureau chief, said he had been feeling good about the
resolutions between staff and management that ended the strike at
KPFA and was disappointed to see similar issues arise on a national
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sooner do I get back (from a trip) that I find out that the
news director has been fired because he wouldn't buckle under to
censorship,'' said Glantz, who will join a planned three-month
strike that will begin Monday if worker demands are not met. ``It's
really depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica Radio, established in 1949, is the nation's first
listener-supported radio network. In addition to the Berkeley
station, it operates KPFK in Los Angeles, WBAI in New York, KPFT in
Houston, WPFW in Washington, D.C., and has nearly 60 affiliates in
27 states.
</P>
<P>
   Among its nationally syndicated programs is the Pacifica Network
News, a weekday evening newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Pacifica Foundation chairwoman Mary Frances Berry were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written to Berry, the group of free-lancers,
reporters and producers demanded a reinstatement of
Washington-based Pacifica Network News Director Dan Coughlin and
written assurances that acts of censorship will immediately end.
</P>
<P>
   If those and other demands are not met, the 40 employees pledge
to go on a three-month strike. The work-stoppage would affect about
70 percent of the national news gathering that is distributed to 70
Pacifica-affiliated stations throughout the nation in daily
half-hour broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The censorship charges echo the same issues that prompted KPFA
staffers to strike last summer amid strong public support and heavy
media coverage. On-air personalities at the time complained that
they were censored and reprimanded for doing stories that were
critical of issues related to management. As the strike heated up,
the Pacifica management locked workers out of the station and hired
armed guards to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute lasted for nearly a month in July and August and
ended when the management and KPFA employees hammered out an
agreement that returned operations of the station back to station
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Glantz said Coughlin was also the target of censorship efforts
by management after he aired a report on a protest involving 16
affiliated stations who were disgruntled with Pacifica management.
The report aired on a Friday and by Monday, Coughlin had been
removed from his position and reassigned to another job without
listed job duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that censorship at Pacifica is becoming a way of
life,'' the workers wrote in the letter to Berry. ``These acts
started with the crisis at KPFA, and although that station is once
again on the air, these acts continue.''

   ``As expected, Forbes said he had beaten the expectations.'' _
From an AP story about the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest: Nobody, not even Iowans with dual degrees in
Cornstalk Management and Political Science, understands all the
intricacies of the caucuses _ although I'm pretty sure they're
about as binding as Drew Carey's Sans-a-belt slacks after he's
downed a 12-pack of Buzz Beer.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know is that ``caucus'' is a Native American word for
``suckers,'' which is the term used to describe anyone who got
swept up in the predictably ridiculous coverage of the Iowa sort-of
elections.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, according to the wizards who analyze, speculate,
prognosticate and just plain fill up the airtime on all the MSNBC's
and Fox News Channels and CNNs up and down the dial, it's naive and
simplistic to call Al Gore and George W. Bush the shoo-in winners.
</P>
<P>
   No no no. This is still a horse race!
</P>
<P>
   See, you can't put on your parka, grab your microphone and stand
in front of the town hall and say something like, ``Here in
Ottumwa, it occurs to me that this is all a charade _ that Al Gore
and George Bush are obvious choices for their respective
nominations, unless it's revealed that Bush went on a bank-robbing
spree in the 1970s and Gore was once a woman'' _ even though you'd
be scoring points for honesty with such a speech.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to perpetuate the illusion that the nominations are
still in doubt, that Iowa and New Hampshire are the political
equivalent of the first round of the NCAA tournament _ even though
we're already at the tail end of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   So you try to convince yourself and your audience that it's all
about expectations and projections and polls. Who did better than
expected and who did worse than expected and who did just about
what was expected _ which would have to be considered a
disappointment because everyone sets low expectations so you can
crow about having exceeded expectations once the votes are in.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that retarded logic, Steve Forbes with his 30 percent
and Alan Keyes with his 14 percent in Iowa were jubilant and fired
up, even though Bob Dole (you remember him?) has a better chance of
winning the Republican nomination than either of those two.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John McCain was receiving kudos for not even trying
to win before New Hampshire _ even though some pundits were saying
his 5 percent showing was about 5 percent lower than what his
advisers would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, we know lots of important things from the primaries _
like what? We know that ... well ... Bauer remains considerably
shorter than all the other guys, and Hatch apparently doesn't golf
and had nothing else to do but goof around on the campaign trail
before shutting down his campaign as predicted.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bill Bradley, his pre-election spin was that a 31 percent
total in Iowa would be a nothing-but-net night for him, as that was
the number attained by Teddy Kennedy against Jimmy Carter in 1980.
(Of course, Carter eventually kicked Kenney's Chappaquiddick before
getting his own hat handed to him by Ronnie Reagan, but never
mind.) Bradley wound up with 35 percent, so he bested that 31
percent mark and that means he'll end up, um, losing to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's post-election take: ``This isn't an end, it's a
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the beginning of you thinking about Campaign 2004, my
friend. Might I suggest a discreet waddle-tuck? It's just too
distracting.
</P>
<P>
   As for New Hampshire ... hey, everybody knows it's a grand
tradition to hold the first legitimate primary there.
</P>
<P>
   In the first one, in 1952, Sen. Estes Kefauver upset President
Harry Truman, thus setting the tone for the New Hampshire primary
as an overblown but ultimately irrelevant event. I mean, it's not
like we ever had a President Estes Kefauver, right?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes losers in New Hampshire claim to be winners because
they exceeded those artificial expectations. George McGovern in
'72, Ted Kennedy in '80, Bill Clinton in '92, Pat Buchanan that
same year. And of course, the winners in those same elections were
painted as losers. It's all about spin and perspective and oh yeah,
bull----. (I love it when I have to censor myself.)
</P>
<P>
   So as you're watching all the pre-election coverage in the
coming days, just keep the following little picture in your head.
</P>
<P>
   Think of 275 cheeseburgers, stacked in a pyramid. Now remove a
single cheeseburger from that pile. If the population of our
country is represented by that big mountain of cheeseburgers, New
Hampshire would be the lone burger.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of who wins that cheeseburger, George W. Bush and
Al Gore have already been anointed as the big cheeses of their
respective parties.

&HT;     EMPLOYEES THREATEN STRIKE AT LANDMARK RADIO STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY DELGADO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Some 40 news employees of the Pacifica
Foundation are threatening to go on strike Monday in a dispute with
management of the landmark broadcast organization.
</P>
<P>
   The employees claim the Pacifica management removed its popular
national news director in November after he aired a story detailing
a boycott by 16 Pacifica affiliates over a censorship issue. The
disgruntled employees also say that Pacifica has continued a
pattern of censorship and program cancellations throughout its
stations since a bitter labor dispute at KPFA-FM in Berkeley was
settled late last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Glantz, a frequent national news contributor and KPFA's
Sacramento bureau chief, said he had been feeling good about the
resolutions between staff and management that ended the strike at
KPFA and was disappointed to see similar issues arise on a national
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sooner do I get back (from a trip) that I find out that the
news director has been fired because he wouldn't buckle under to
censorship,'' said Glantz, who will join a planned three-month
strike that will begin Monday if worker demands are not met. ``It's
really depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica Radio, established in 1949, is the nation's first
listener-supported radio network. In addition to the Berkeley
station, it operates KPFK in Los Angeles, WBAI in New York, KPFT in
Houston, WPFW in Washington, D.C., and has nearly 60 affiliates in
27 states.
</P>
<P>
   Among its nationally syndicated programs is the Pacifica Network
News, a weekday evening newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Pacifica Foundation chairwoman Mary Frances Berry were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written to Berry, the group of free-lancers,
reporters and producers demanded a reinstatement of
Washington-based Pacifica Network News Director Dan Coughlin and
written assurances that acts of censorship will immediately end.
</P>
<P>
   If those and other demands are not met, the 40 employees pledge
to go on a three-month strike. The work-stoppage would affect about
70 percent of the national news gathering that is distributed to 70
Pacifica-affiliated stations throughout the nation in daily
half-hour broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The censorship charges echo the same issues that prompted KPFA
staffers to strike last summer amid strong public support and heavy
media coverage. On-air personalities at the time complained that
they were censored and reprimanded for doing stories that were
critical of issues related to management. As the strike heated up,
the Pacifica management locked workers out of the station and hired
armed guards to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute lasted for nearly a month in July and August and
ended when the management and KPFA employees hammered out an
agreement that returned operations of the station back to station
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Glantz said Coughlin was also the target of censorship efforts
by management after he aired a report on a protest involving 16
affiliated stations who were disgruntled with Pacifica management.
The report aired on a Friday and by Monday, Coughlin had been
removed from his position and reassigned to another job without
listed job duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that censorship at Pacifica is becoming a way of
life,'' the workers wrote in the letter to Berry. ``These acts
started with the crisis at KPFA, and although that station is once
again on the air, these acts continue.''

<P>
   Why does Latin America continue to lag so far behind its
neighbor to the north in economic development? Discovery of both
parts of the New World dates to the same year, 1492, and Latin
America was a lot quicker off the starting blocks. Within 50 years
of Columbus's arrival, all of the current capitals had been
founded. European settlement of North America didn't even begin for
another century.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American countries carry considerable legacies from the
earliest days of colonization. This has blessed the region with
cultural riches, enormous pride, and a strong sense of identity.
But it has also burdened it with traditions that have made it
difficult to adapt to the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid globalization in recent years has started to break down
these historical traits. The reward, apart from the greater good of
the region's 410 million inhabitants, will be to find a ``Latin
way'' to prove to the world (and themselves) that they can be as
modern and as successful as other peoples _ without losing their
Latinity, the soul that defines their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Change can be daunting, even for countries that have
successfully embraced and managed it smoothly in the past. The
region's citizens must not only embrace change, they must take
advantage of emerging trends if they wish to become major players
in the global marketplace in the 21st century. We have coined the
term ``Nexts'' to describe the key trends that will shape life in
the future. Understanding the region's ``Nexts'' can help Latin
Americans as their region comes of age. Consider the following
Nexts:
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATELY SEEKING SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   For all its advances in economic stability and democracy, Latin
America is facing an uphill struggle with two related and corrosive
issues _ drugs and violence. The level of violence is so extreme it
shaves 2.1 percent off the region's Gross Domestic Product
annually. A 1999 report from non-government organization Mexico
United Against Crime proclaims Mexico City as one the 10 most
violent cities worldwide, with 800 crimes and three murders a day.
Nations with similar rates are usually engaged in civil war.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ The ``Pit Bull'' Generation:
</P>
<P>
   Reared in an atmosphere of violence and unemployment, today's
youth are perpetuating the violence, on the streets and,
increasingly, in schools. And this trend is being played out in
cities across the continent. For example, in Rio de Janeiro a teen
is twice as likely to be murdered as in Bogota (long considered the
most violent city in Latin America).
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION, POR FAVOR
</P>
<P>
   One of Latin America's greatest natural resources is its young
people. Birth rates are as much as double those in Europe, and the
proportion of youth under age 15 is 30 percent or more, far
outnumbering the elders. In the more ``European'' countries of the
south _ Chile and Argentina _ the ratios of under-15s to over-65s
are around 4:1 and 3:1, respectively, while other countries run
between 6:1 and 8:1, compared with less than 2:1 in the United
States. This is great news for pension planners: Latin America has
plenty of youngsters to provide for the old folk. Education,
however, is a crucial issue. Today, children in Latin America go to
school an average of just five years. With unskilled and manual
work being automated, the governments of Latin America face the
immediate priority of educating their teeming masses of youngsters
if they want to offer a real alternative to the fast-developing
economies of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ ``New School'' Houses Rock:
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect massive spending boosts. Governments just don't
have the cash. In Colombia, New Schools, in which older students
tutor younger children, are compensating for a shortage of
qualified teachers. There are currently 17,000 New Schools in the
country, and these schools enjoy more support from parents and
local businesses than do the nation's public schools. Look for
other creative stop-gaps.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOLY GRAIL OF REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, rampant inflation and boom-and-bust economic
cycles made chronic uncertainty a daily hazard for Latin American
businesses. Much of the progress in Latin America today can be
attributed to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit of ongoing privatizations will bring great changes.
Consider this: In 1989, when the average Argentine requested a
phone from the state-owned service, the average wait for
installation was 10 years. Today, after privatization, the phone
company responds in 48 hours. Free-market thinking will also change
people's mindset: from the paternalistic overseer inherent in the
Spanish colonial legacy to entrepreneurship and the benefits of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Such shifts are subtle, and so far, privatization hasn't
significantly improved the daily lives of the majority of Latin
Americans. Wealth is still concentrated in the hands of the few. In
Argentina _ one of the most stable countries _ unemployment hovers
around 14.5 percent, almost twice as high as it was in 1990. But
most experts believe that privatization is already having a
far-reaching impact on the young, who for the first time have an
almost unfettered thirst for consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ Privatization Payback (Small Is the New Big):
</P>
<P>
   While it is too soon to foretell the final outcome of reform,
free-market thinking could become contagious, leading to a
burgeoning entrepreneurial class. A powerful clique of economic
groups has long controlled economies. Smaller businesses will make
strides in the future, providing jobs and thus gaining clout and
importance. This will create strife with the traditional power
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING UP
</P>
<P>
   Latin American resistance to change is changing. Globality and
technology are enabling _ in fact, forcing _ Latin Americans to
open their minds and their borders.
</P>
<P>
   The region has been notable for conservative and inward-looking
attitudes fostered by an out-of-the-way location and extreme
terrain. Deserts, tropical rainforests, and the soaring Andes all
make overland communication difficult. Latin America's far-flung
populations are finally getting wired to each other and to the rest
of the world. This development opens the exciting prospect that
huge Spanish-speaking Internet communities will coalesce in this
millennium. Although estimates vary, more than 20 million people in
the region will be online within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American companies are increasingly looking abroad and not
just to the United States for education, training, and
best-practice examples. Itausa, a Brazilian conglomerate that
includes a major bank and a computer-hardware maker, illustrates
the new mindset. It sent 50 managers from Duratex, a manufacturer
of bathroom fixtures and wood products, to study top companies in
Japan, and it reorganized decision-making to halve the time needed
to get new products to market.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ ``E''Equals Exponential:
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans are going to take to e-commerce in a big way.
Although some hurdles _ including insufficient phone lines, low
incomes, and lack of credit cards _ continue to hinder the growth
of e-commerce, real progress is being made. Look for companies to
grab hold of online potential _ not just to sell goods, but as a
key tool in modernizing society.
</P>
<P>
   STAND BACK, BOYS
</P>
<P>
   Latin America still has one of the world's lowest numbers of
women in the workplace, according to the International Labor
Organization. But the percentage of working-age women in the
workforce in Latin America increased from 37 percent in the early
1980s to 45 percent by the mid-1990s. Nearly 40 percent of Peruvian
women are heads of households today. Among the contributing
factors: increased urbanization, improved education for women, and
economic need. Women in the smaller, less developed countries such
as Ecuador and Colombia, but also to a certain extent in Mexico,
experience greater economic and autonomous disparity than women in
larger, more urban countries.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ No Longer a Macho World:
</P>
<P>
   Feminism (a gringo import) will disappear. Women will begin to
place more emphasis on the essential differences that set the two
sexes apart. Look for the development of female leadership, Latin
style. This feminine ``Latinity'' means adapting the pragmatic
gains of Western-style feminism to specific cultural demands. The
result: an identity of strength combined with an unabashed female
sensuality, while still maintaining a deep respect for family.
</P>
<P>
   DESTINATIONS GREENEST
</P>
<P>
   TV nature documentaries, travel writing, and high-profile
initiatives by such celebrities as pop star Sting and Anita Roddick
of The Body Shop have all helped introduce the world to Latin
America's vast natural resources and ecosystems. The wilds of
Patagonia are now the ``in'' place for some of the world's rich and
powerful _ media magnate Ted Turner, financier George Soros, and
movie star Sylvester Stallone are just three of the many who have
bought up vast estates at the end of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Latin Americans have viewed the environmental
concerns of outsiders as hypocritical attempts to deny them full
use of their natural resources. But concern is growing within the
region, too. Brazil, for one, is keen to improve its conservation
image. The Amazon rain forest loses 5,700 square miles per year.
Greenpeace warns that, at current rates of deforestation, the rain
forest will be gone in 80 years. To help preserve the remaining
area, Brazil now requires that mining companies replace any forest
cover they destroy. The Brazilian government has also announced
that, by 2000, it will designate 62 million acres of Amazon rain
forest as protected.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ Tourism, Worth Its Weight in Preservation:
</P>
<P>
   As governments wise up to the benefits of sound ecological
policy and the enormous economic potential of tourism _ green or
not _ expect to see more of Latin America in the world's travel
brochures. Already, thrill seekers and adventure travelers who are
searching for that exotic road-less-traveled location are heading
for Latin American backwaters. Latin American tourism, however,
will never achieve its full potential until the region makes
considerable headway in tackling crime and violence.
</P>
<P>
   LATINITY: A SUPER IDENTITY
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of Asian bullishness, the financial crisis of
1997 prompted the world to stand back and take stock of which
countries were hot and which were not. Comparisons between Asia and
Latin America inevitably followed.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia is a region largely defined by geography, Latin
America is imbued with a sense of identity and commonality _ a
Latin consciousness that exceeds geographic limits. This means that
residents of places as far apart as Santiago, Chile, Mexico City,
and the barrios of Miami and New York can communicate. Even
Spanish-speakers and Portuguese-speakers (in Brazil) are usually
able to communicate without recourse to a third language _ a rarity
among the peoples of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This huge pool of people with shared language and cultural roots
has enabled Latin Americans to develop a rich world of culture
independent of globally dominant Anglo-Saxon influences. Such
writers as Jorge Luis Borges of Argentina, Gabriel Garcia Marquez
of Colombia, Octavio Paz of Mexico, and Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru
are widely read throughout the Latin world and beyond. In music,
Latins boast depth, diversity, and vitality that easily match the
considerable output of the English-speaking world. Latin styles
have their roots in specific places _ tango in Argentina, samba in
Brazil, vallenato in Colombia, merengue in the Dominican Republic,
mariachi in Mexico. The styles are constantly cross-fertilizing and
producing hybrids that belong nowhere and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Future Trend Capital:
</P>
<P>
   Latinness has the potential to be the seductive cultural super
power of the future, possibly eclipsing the United States as the
world's biggest exporter of popular culture. As Internet technology
improves, making it more viable for sound and video, expect to see
a huge cross-pollination of Latin American imagination with the
rapid growth of Latin cultural power.
</P>
<P>
   If Latin America is successful in assimilating change and yet
retaining its rich cultural heritage, it will be a region to be
reckoned with in this millennium. For the wildfire to burn out of
control, the region will need to continue to work toward
unification, both within the region and with the U.S. That's what
makes globalization differ from colonization _ power to change
flows both ways.

   Rapid globalization in recent years has started to break down
these historical traits. The reward, apart from the greater good of
the region's 410 million inhabitants, will be to find a ``Latin
way'' to prove to the world (and themselves) that they can be as
modern and as successful as other peoples _ without losing their
Latinity, the soul that defines their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Change can be daunting, even for countries that have
successfully embraced and managed it smoothly in the past. The
region's citizens must not only embrace change, they must take
advantage of emerging trends if they wish to become major players
in the global marketplace in the 21st century. We have coined the
term ``Nexts'' to describe the key trends that will shape life in
the future. Understanding the region's ``Nexts'' can help Latin
Americans as their region comes of age. Consider the following
Nexts:
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATELY SEEKING SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   For all its advances in economic stability and democracy, Latin
America is facing an uphill struggle with two related and corrosive
issues _ drugs and violence. The level of violence is so extreme it
shaves 2.1 percent off the region's Gross Domestic Product
annually. A 1999 report from non-government organization Mexico
United Against Crime proclaims Mexico City as one the 10 most
violent cities worldwide, with 800 crimes and three murders a day.
Nations with similar rates are usually engaged in civil war.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ The ``Pit Bull'' Generation:
</P>
<P>
   Reared in an atmosphere of violence and unemployment, today's
youth are perpetuating the violence, on the streets and,
increasingly, in schools. And this trend is being played out in
cities across the continent. For example, in Rio de Janeiro a teen
is twice as likely to be murdered as in Bogota (long considered the
most violent city in Latin America).
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION, POR FAVOR
</P>
<P>
   One of Latin America's greatest natural resources is its young
people. Birth rates are as much as double those in Europe, and the
proportion of youth under age 15 is 30 percent or more, far
outnumbering the elders. In the more ``European'' countries of the
south _ Chile and Argentina _ the ratios of under-15s to over-65s
are around 4:1 and 3:1, respectively, while other countries run
between 6:1 and 8:1, compared with less than 2:1 in the United
States. This is great news for pension planners: Latin America has
plenty of youngsters to provide for the old folk. Education,
however, is a crucial issue. Today, children in Latin America go to
school an average of just five years. With unskilled and manual
work being automated, the governments of Latin America face the
immediate priority of educating their teeming masses of youngsters
if they want to offer a real alternative to the fast-developing
economies of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ ``New School'' Houses Rock:
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect massive spending boosts. Governments just don't
have the cash. In Colombia, New Schools, in which older students
tutor younger children, are compensating for a shortage of
qualified teachers. There are currently 17,000 New Schools in the
country, and these schools enjoy more support from parents and
local businesses than do the nation's public schools. Look for
other creative stop-gaps.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOLY GRAIL OF REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, rampant inflation and boom-and-bust economic
cycles made chronic uncertainty a daily hazard for Latin American
businesses. Much of the progress in Latin America today can be
attributed to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit of ongoing privatizations will bring great changes.
Consider this: In 1989, when the average Argentine requested a
phone from the state-owned service, the average wait for
installation was 10 years. Today, after privatization, the phone
company responds in 48 hours. Free-market thinking will also change
people's mindset: from the paternalistic overseer inherent in the
Spanish colonial legacy to entrepreneurship and the benefits of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Such shifts are subtle, and so far, privatization hasn't
significantly improved the daily lives of the majority of Latin
Americans. Wealth is still concentrated in the hands of the few. In
Argentina _ one of the most stable countries _ unemployment hovers
around 14.5 percent, almost twice as high as it was in 1990. But
most experts believe that privatization is already having a
far-reaching impact on the young, who for the first time have an
almost unfettered thirst for consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ Privatization Payback (Small Is the New Big):
</P>
<P>
   While it is too soon to foretell the final outcome of reform,
free-market thinking could become contagious, leading to a
burgeoning entrepreneurial class. A powerful clique of economic
groups has long controlled economies. Smaller businesses will make
strides in the future, providing jobs and thus gaining clout and
importance. This will create strife with the traditional power
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING UP
</P>
<P>
   Latin American resistance to change is changing. Globality and
technology are enabling _ in fact, forcing _ Latin Americans to
open their minds and their borders.
</P>
<P>
   The region has been notable for conservative and inward-looking
attitudes fostered by an out-of-the-way location and extreme
terrain. Deserts, tropical rainforests, and the soaring Andes all
make overland communication difficult. Latin America's far-flung
populations are finally getting wired to each other and to the rest
of the world. This development opens the exciting prospect that
huge Spanish-speaking Internet communities will coalesce in this
millennium. Although estimates vary, more than 20 million people in
the region will be online within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American companies are increasingly looking abroad and not
just to the United States for education, training, and
best-practice examples. Itausa, a Brazilian conglomerate that
includes a major bank and a computer-hardware maker, illustrates
the new mindset. It sent 50 managers from Duratex, a manufacturer
of bathroom fixtures and wood products, to study top companies in
Japan, and it reorganized decision-making to halve the time needed
to get new products to market.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ ``E''Equals Exponential:
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans are going to take to e-commerce in a big way.
Although some hurdles _ including insufficient phone lines, low
incomes, and lack of credit cards _ continue to hinder the growth
of e-commerce, real progress is being made. Look for companies to
grab hold of online potential _ not just to sell goods, but as a
key tool in modernizing society.
</P>
<P>
   STAND BACK, BOYS
</P>
<P>
   Latin America still has one of the world's lowest numbers of
women in the workplace, according to the International Labor
Organization. But the percentage of working-age women in the
workforce in Latin America increased from 37 percent in the early
1980s to 45 percent by the mid-1990s. Nearly 40 percent of Peruvian
women are heads of households today. Among the contributing
factors: increased urbanization, improved education for women, and
economic need. Women in the smaller, less developed countries such
as Ecuador and Colombia, but also to a certain extent in Mexico,
experience greater economic and autonomous disparity than women in
larger, more urban countries.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ No Longer a Macho World:
</P>
<P>
   Feminism (a gringo import) will disappear. Women will begin to
place more emphasis on the essential differences that set the two
sexes apart. Look for the development of female leadership, Latin
style. This feminine ``Latinity'' means adapting the pragmatic
gains of Western-style feminism to specific cultural demands. The
result: an identity of strength combined with an unabashed female
sensuality, while still maintaining a deep respect for family.
</P>
<P>
   DESTINATIONS GREENEST
</P>
<P>
   TV nature documentaries, travel writing, and high-profile
initiatives by such celebrities as pop star Sting and Anita Roddick
of The Body Shop have all helped introduce the world to Latin
America's vast natural resources and ecosystems. The wilds of
Patagonia are now the ``in'' place for some of the world's rich and
powerful _ media magnate Ted Turner, financier George Soros, and
movie star Sylvester Stallone are just three of the many who have
bought up vast estates at the end of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Latin Americans have viewed the environmental
concerns of outsiders as hypocritical attempts to deny them full
use of their natural resources. But concern is growing within the
region, too. Brazil, for one, is keen to improve its conservation
image. The Amazon rain forest loses 5,700 square miles per year.
Greenpeace warns that, at current rates of deforestation, the rain
forest will be gone in 80 years. To help preserve the remaining
area, Brazil now requires that mining companies replace any forest
cover they destroy. The Brazilian government has also announced
that, by 2000, it will designate 62 million acres of Amazon rain
forest as protected.
</P>
<P>
   What's Next _ Tourism, Worth Its Weight in Preservation:
</P>
<P>
   As governments wise up to the benefits of sound ecological
policy and the enormous economic potential of tourism _ green or
not _ expect to see more of Latin America in the world's travel
brochures. Already, thrill seekers and adventure travelers who are
searching for that exotic road-less-traveled location are heading
for Latin American backwaters. Latin American tourism, however,
will never achieve its full potential until the region makes
considerable headway in tackling crime and violence.
</P>
<P>
   LATINITY: A SUPER IDENTITY
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of Asian bullishness, the financial crisis of
1997 prompted the world to stand back and take stock of which
countries were hot and which were not. Comparisons between Asia and
Latin America inevitably followed.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia is a region largely defined by geography, Latin
America is imbued with a sense of identity and commonality _ a
Latin consciousness that exceeds geographic limits. This means that
residents of places as far apart as Santiago, Chile, Mexico City,
and the barrios of Miami and New York can communicate. Even
Spanish-speakers and Portuguese-speakers (in Brazil) are usually
able to communicate without recourse to a third language _ a rarity
among the peoples of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This huge pool of people with shared language and cultural roots
has enabled Latin Americans to develop a rich world of culture
independent of globally dominant Anglo-Saxon influences. Such
writers as Jorge Luis Borges of Argentina, Gabriel Garcia Marquez
of Colombia, Octavio Paz of Mexico, and Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru
are widely read throughout the Latin world and beyond. In music,
Latins boast depth, diversity, and vitality that easily match the
considerable output of the English-speaking world. Latin styles
have their roots in specific places _ tango in Argentina, samba in
Brazil, vallenato in Colombia, merengue in the Dominican Republic,
mariachi in Mexico. The styles are constantly cross-fertilizing and
producing hybrids that belong nowhere and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Future Trend Capital:
</P>
<P>
   Latinness has the potential to be the seductive cultural super
power of the future, possibly eclipsing the United States as the
world's biggest exporter of popular culture. As Internet technology
improves, making it more viable for sound and video, expect to see
a huge cross-pollination of Latin American imagination with the
rapid growth of Latin cultural power.
</P>
<P>
   If Latin America is successful in assimilating change and yet
retaining its rich cultural heritage, it will be a region to be
reckoned with in this millennium. For the wildfire to burn out of
control, the region will need to continue to work toward
unification, both within the region and with the U.S. That's what
makes globalization differ from colonization _ power to change
flows both ways.

DETROIT SEES THE FUTURE _ AND THERE ARE A LOT OF TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Immersion in a massive display of cars, trucks, and
SUVs, as happens at venues such as the North American International
Auto Show here, can be like a trip to the art gallery to view
pointillist works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you have to step back from the seemingly random
scattering of dots to see the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   Once I stepped back from the acres of vehicles showcased at
Detroit this year, that picture was clear: trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks, in myriad forms _ brutes, sleek throwbacks,
truck/SUV hybrids _ dominated this show. Trucks are the hot
immediate future in the industry and almost everybody is looking
for the truck that will appeal to the most folks. Even Volkswagen
offered a pickup prototype that still managed to look like a coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge showcased a rig called the MAXXcab, cab-forward in design,
part luxury SUV, with a pickup truck bed. GMC rolled out the
Terradyne, a bulky, rugged brute of a prototype. Chevrolet showed
its SSR, a pickup with enough car blended in that I could not help
but think of an updated El Camino. It seems as if everybody's got a
four-door pickup in the works or on the way, and bed extenders,
once the domain of aftermarketeers, come right from the factory
now.
</P>
<P>
   But in Detroit, two trucks in particular emerged and should be
watched closely, one ballyhooed and ready to roll, the other
quietly plopped on the show floor with no fanfare but quickly
drawing plenty of fans.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the Chevrolet Avalanche, the second the Ford
Equator. I suspect they'll be going head-to-head soon.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy calls the Avalanche a sport-utility pickup. That just
makes it part of rising wave when it goes on sale in the first
quarter of 2001. It's got a short pickup bed, a four-door cabin,
much like an SUV, and a distinct truck look at the grill. What it's
got that sets it apart from all others _ and keep this word in mind
_ is a midgate. Until now, the problem with SUV-truck hybrids has
been a bed too small for, say, a sheet of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   What the midgate does is solve that problem. The bed in the
Avalanche is a shade over five feet long. However, when the rear
seats are folded down, the window is removed and stored on board,
and the midgate, which separates bed and cabin, is folded down,
voila: eight-foot bed. The bed can also be securely covered and
locked as you would lock a car trunk to protect tools, groceries,
or whatever you are carrying.
</P>
<P>
   It will be built on a spinoff of the same platform that gives us
the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra and the Chevy-GMC lineup of
sport utes. In fact, it's about the size of a Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bold move for Chevrolet and puts it right back in a
market _ four-door pickups _ that has exploded. Chevy, however,
failed to catch the first wave in a way that Ford did so
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, curiously, chose to quietly slip what could be its entry
into the midgate race onto the show floor. While it has pushed hard
for the F-150 SuperCrew, a four-full-door pickup, and rolled out
the Sport Trac, an SUV-with-bed based on the Explorer, it was
subtle in plopping the loud Equator concept into public view.
</P>
<P>
   The Equator combines the F-150 (length) and F-350 (width) for a
wide and rugged stance. It's got a certain Hummer-like boldness to
it, and it's also got Kevlar bumpers, fenders, wheel wells, and
lower trim for protection in offroad driving.
</P>
<P>
   Its doors are high, and side panels drop down to form running
boards when the doors are open.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reportedly has been working on a midgate design that would
have the window descend into the middle panel _ much like the back
on a station wagon _ before the panel is folded down into the
passenger compartment. That would be a good thing and would avoid
what I suspect could be the annoying problem of taking a window out
and storing it onboard.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford builds the Equator, it will need a midgate of some sort
because the bed is simply too tiny for hauling loads of any
consequence, and without a midgate, it will cede this niche in the
expanding world of trucks to Chevrolet.

SAAB'S 9-5 WAGON HAS A SLOW, STEADY ANSWER TO WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally we get some snow, and a chance to test the latest in
``winter'' drive modes that are increasingly common on
non-four-wheel-drive autos.
</P>
<P>
   Saab does not let us down.
</P>
<P>
   We're in a 9-5 wagon as it crawls on narrow roads that lead to
empty summer houses that dot a lake. The roads are hard-packed snow
and ice with a fresh dusting of snow atop that. They wind so much
that getting up speed to approach any of the steep hills is
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab is stopped halfway up one of these hills. It is set in
winter mode. Then the gas pedal is pushed.
</P>
<P>
   My Uncle Harold used to say that driving in snow meant you had
to (curious expletive) drive like you've got an egg between your
foot and the gas pedal. Indeed, it was a tricky, touchy thing to
walk the fine line between just enough power for progress and
spinning wheels that ended in a backslide.
</P>
<P>
   Saab handles the egg part for you. Push the gas. The engine
roars _ roars so loudly you assume the wheels must be spinning out
there. They are not. Instead, the engine is straining because it's
producing enough power to start the car barely creeping in what
feels like third gear from a dead start. It works wonderfully, and
that helps make this front-wheel-drive wagon a perfect New England
car. All that, and sportiness, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is no box of a wagon being built as wagons are in the midst
of a minicomeback. It's low and sleek up front, rises in a wedge
over windshield and roofline, and ends above the rear lid with a
subtle, aerodynamic curl toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab wagon was launched last spring, and offered a
4-cylinder, 2.3 liter, 170 horsepower, low-pressure turbo engine as
its base model. For 2000, you can get a 3.0 liter V-6 that cranks
out 200 horses, but I stuck with the smaller engine base model in
this test and it got about 22 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   It's an admirable engine, moving the car effortlessly at highway
speed, climbing hills with a comforting, powerful surge when extra
power is needed. Its low- and mid-range torque is remarkable, but
you should expect that from a company that has been featuring
turbochargers for 20 years now.
</P>
<P>
   I've always liked Saabs, though their standard transmissions
were not my favorite _ long throws, a bit sloppy _ but the 4-speed
automatic on the test car was superb. Shifts up and down were
seamless, with no jolts, no lags.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, the dash setup is wonderfully simple. The leather
front seats (part of an optional package) were broad and supported
thighs, back, and head very well. Take them out and put them on a
swivel base and they'd make fine furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats were comfortable _ for two, not three _ but
legroom back there is limited. Since a wagon is often a family car
used for long trips, it is good that storage space is spread
throughout the car. There are bins in the lower front door panels,
pockets on the front edges of the front seats, pockets on the
seatbacks, a bin in the console, nets on the B pillars, more bins
in the rear cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo area has an industrial look _ and utility _ to it,
with sliding tie-downs and straps that let you safely store luggage
and heavy loads.
</P>
<P>
   There's a standard sliding sunroof, and even the glove
compartment is unique: Hooked to air-conditioning ducts, it can
keep drinks cooled to 42 degrees in hot weather. And the 9-5's got
the neatest cup holder I've ever seen: A vertical slit in the dash
pops out at touch and a circle, a la gyroscope, rotates to
horizontal to hold your drink.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of what makes Saab such a fine niche car with a
loyal following. Plus, it's a safe car. There are crash ``load
paths'' designed to distribute the energy of a collision out and
around passengers. And those passengers are sitting in a steel cage
of high tensile steel.
</P>
<P>
   Front airbags are supplemented by head and torso dual airbags
that deploy from the outside edges of the front seat backs,
cradling passengers in soft protection.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was smooth and stable on highways, with minimal lateral
forces felt during lane changes at speed, and on rough backroads
you could feel the suspension absorbing all the road could hand
out.
</P>
<P>
   That suspension is springs, antiroll bars and shocks all around,
with struts up front and multilink independent in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   There was some hint of understeer when powering through a
corner, but that's not uncommon in front-wheel-drive and you soon
get used to it. Stopping was quick and crisp with discs fore and
aft using diagonally split hydraulics, assisted by ABS.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car meant to compete with other high-end wagons such
as the Audi A6, BMW 528i, Mercedes-Benz E320, and Volvo's V70. If
you're ready to hand over $35,000-$50,000 for a wagon, I'd suggest
you try them all because all are good and the choice becomes
personal. If you're looking for a comparison with a cheaper wagon,
try the new Volvo V40 at around $25,000; it's a bit smaller, but
still a fine car.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to do a lot of upcountry driving in the winter,
make sure you get winter mode. If Uncle Harold were still alive,
he'd be asking, ``Which came first, the Saab or the egg?''
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches
</P>
<P>
   --The rubber ``toggle switches'' that control air flow from the
dash vents.
</P>
<P>
   --The doubled-up visors. Great to be able to block out that low
winter sun both from the side and the front without moving a single
visor back and forth as you change directions.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --A subtle rasping sound that seemed to emanate from the dash
whenever the defroster was turned on.
</P>
<P>
   --Small interior door handles. Hard to get more than a couple of
fingers behind them and, on quick cold runs to fetch the morning
paper, impossible in gloved hands.

   Por que America Latina esta tan a la zaga de su vecino del norte
en desarrollo economico? El descubrimiento de ambas regiones
ocurrio en 1492. A los 50 anos de la llegada de Cristobal Colon,
todas las capitales actuales ya se habian fundado. En cambio, la
colonizacion europea de Norteamerica tardo un siglo mas en
iniciarse.
</P>
<P>
   Los paises latinoamericanos tienen un legado considerable, que
le ha dado a la region una enorme riqueza cultural, un gran orgullo
y una vigorosa identidad. Pero tambien la ha cargado con
tradiciones que han dificultado su adaptacion al mundo moderno.
</P>
<P>
   La veloz globalizacion de los ultimos anos ya resquebraja esos
rasgos historicos. La recompensa, ademas de ventajas para sus 410
millones de habitantes, es hallar una forma autoctona de
demostrarle al mundo (y a si mismos) que pueden lograr la
modernidad y el exito como cualquier otro pueblo sin perder el alma
que los define.
</P>
<P>
   El cambio puede ser intimidante, incluso para los paises que lo
han adoptado con exito en el pasado. Los ciudadanos de la region no
solo deben adoptar el cambio: tambien deben aprovechar las nuevas
tendencias si desean tener un papel de peso en el mercado mundial
del siglo XXI. Hemos acunado el termino ``proximas'' para describir
las tendencias clave que moldearan la existencia. Entender las
``proximas'' de la region ayudara a los latinoamericanos a medida
que el continente madura. Veamos las siguientes ``proximas'':
</P>
<P>
   EN BUSCA DE SEGURIDAD
</P>
<P>
   A pesar de todo lo que ha logrado avanzar en estabilidad
economica y democracia, America Latina enfrenta una batalla cuesta
arriba en dos asuntos relacionados y corrosivos: las drogas y la
violencia. El nivel de violencia es tan alto que consume el 2,1 por
ciento del PIB de la region al ano. Un informe de la organizacion
Mexico Unido Contra el Crimen, emitido en 1999, senala que la
capital mexicana es una de las 10 ciudades mas violentas del mundo,
con 800 delitos y tres asesinatos al dia. Los paises con cifras
similares suelen sufrir una guerra civil.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues _ Una Generacion Violenta:
</P>
<P>
   Los jovenes de hoy, que crecen en medio de la violencia y el
desempleo, perpetuan la violencia en la calle y en la escuela. Por
ejemplo, en Rio de Janeiro un adolescente tiene dos veces mas
probabilidades de morir asesinado que en Bogota, considerada desde
hace mucho tiempo la ciudad mas violenta de America Latina.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCACION, POR FAVOR
</P>
<P>
   Uno de los mayores recursos naturales de America Latina es su
juventud. El indice de natalidad es el doble del europeo, y la
proporcion de jovenes de menos de 15 anos es el 30 por ciento o
mas, muy superior a la de los ancianos. En los paises mas
``europeos'' del sur (Chile y Argentina) la relacion entre los
menores de 15 y los mayores de 65 es de 4:1 y 3:1, respectivamente,
mientras en otros paises es de 6:1 y 8:1, frente a menos de 2:1 en
Estados Unidos. Esa es una gran noticia para los planificadores de
las pensiones: America Latina tiene suficientes jovenes para
costear los gastos de los mayores.
</P>
<P>
   Pero la educacion es una cuestion crucial. Hoy, los ninos
latinoamericanos van a la escuela un promedio de cinco anos. Debido
a la automatizacion de las labores manuales los gobiernos de
America Latina afrontan la prioridad inmediata de educar a los
jovenes si quieren ofrecer una alternativa real a las economias de
rapido desarrollo de la Cuenca del Pacifico.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues _ Las ``Nuevas Escuelas'' Ofrecen Una
Solucion:
</P>
<P>
   No espere grandes aumentos de gastos. Los gobiernos no tienen el
dinero.
</P>
<P>
   En Colombia, las Nuevas Escuelas, donde los estudiantes mayores
ensenan a los menores, compensan la escasez de maestros
calificados. En el pais hay 17.000 Nuevas Escuelas, y tienen mas
apoyo de los padres y la empresa que las escuelas publicas. Habra
otras soluciones creativas.
</P>
<P>
   EL SANTO GRIAL DE LA REFORMA
</P>
<P>
   Hasta hace poco, la elevada inflacion y los altibajos economicos
creaban una incertidumbre cronica para los negocios
latinoamericanos. Gran parte del progreso que disfruta hoy America
Latina se puede atribuir a la reforma economica. Las
privatizaciones traeran grandes cambios. Recordemos que en 1989,
cuando un argentino solicitaba un telefono al servicio estatal, la
espera para la instalacion promediaba 10 anos. Hoy, despues de la
privatizacion, la compania telefonica responde en 48 horas. Los
principios del libre mercado tambien cambiaran la mentalidad de la
gente: de la supervision paternalista propia del legado colonial
espanol a la corriente empresarial y los beneficios de la
competencia.
</P>
<P>
   Esos cambios son sutiles y, hasta ahora, la privatizacion no ha
mejorado significativamente la vida cotidiana de la mayoria de los
latinoamericanos. La riqueza se concentra en pocas manos. En
Argentina, que es uno de los paises mas estables, el desempleo es
del 14,5 por ciento, casi dos veces mayor que en 1990. Pero la
mayoria de los expertos coincide en que la privatizacion yaejerce
un impacto profundo en los jovenes, que por primera vez tienen un
apetito casi insaciable por productos de consumo.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues _ El Fruto de la Privatizacion:
</P>
<P>
   Aunque es demasiado pronto para pronosticar el resultado final
de la reforma, el pensamiento de libre mercado podria resultar
contagioso y dar pie al auge de una clase empresarial. Grupos
poderosos controlan las economias desde hace tiempo. Habra un auge
de los negocios pequenos, que crearan empleos y ganaran influencia
e importancia. Eso creara un enfrentamiento con los que
tradicionalmente han detentado el poder.
</P>
<P>
   LA APERTURA
</P>
<P>
   La resistencia latinoamericana al cambio esta cediendo. El
globalismo y la tecnologia permiten a los latinoamericanos _ en
realidad, los obligan _ a abrir su mentalidad y sus fronteras.
</P>
<P>
   La region se ha destacado por su postura conservadora y
aislacionista, propiciada por su ubicacion marginal y sus
irregularidades geograficas. Los desiertos, las selvas y los
empinados Andes dificultan las comunicaciones por tierra.
</P>
<P>
   Los pueblos latinoamericanos, antes separados, por fin se
conectan entre si y con el resto del mundo. Esta realidad da pie al
entusiasmo: enormes comunidades hispanohablantes se formaran en la
Internet en este milenio. Aunque los calculos varian, mas de 20
millones de personas de la region estaran en linea en un lapso de
tres anos.
</P>
<P>
   Las empresas latinoamericanas buscan cada vez mas en el
extranjero, y no solo en Estados Unidos, educacion, capacitacion y
metodos mejores. Itausa, un conglomerado brasileno que tiene un
banco importante y un fabricante de computadoras, ilustra la nueva
mentalidad. Itausa envio 50 gerentes de Duratex, un fabricante de
accesorios para banos y productos de madera, a estudiar a empresas
de Japon y modifico como se tomaban las decisiones con el fin de
reducir a la mitad el tiempo necesario para colocar productos
nuevos en el mercado.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues: El Comercio Electronico En Grande:
</P>
<P>
   Los latinoamericanos van a dedicarse al comercio electronico en
grande. Aunque ciertos obstaculos (como la falta de telefonos,
bajos ingresos y
</P>
<P>
   escasez de tarjetas de credito) siguen frenando el crecimiento
del comercio electronico, se han logrado avances enormes. Muchas
companias aprovecharan el potencial en linea, no solo para vender
productos, sino tambien como herramienta basica de la modernizacion
de la sociedad.
</P>
<P>
   PASO A LA MUJER
</P>
<P>
   Latinoamerica aun tiene una de las participaciones mas bajas de
la mujer en el mercado laboral, segun la Organizacion Internacional
del Trabajo. Pero el porcentaje de mujeres en edad laboral que
trabajan crecio del 37 por ciento a principios de los anos 80 al 45
por ciento a mediados de los anos 90. Casi el 40 por ciento de las
peruanas son cabezas de familia. Entre los factores que dan pie a
esa situacion: mayor urbanizacion, mas oportunidades de educacion y
la necesidad economica. En paises menores y menos desarrollados
como Ecuador y Colombia, pero tambien hasta cierto punto en Mexico,
las mujeres sufren una mayor disparidad economica y de autonomia
que en paises mayores y mas urbanizados.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues _ Adios al Machismo:
</P>
<P>
   El feminismo (una importacion gringa) desaparecera. Las mujeres
pondran mas enfasis en las diferencias esenciales que distinguen a
los sexos. Hay que esperar un desarrollo del liderazgo femenino, al
estilo latino. Esta ``latinidad'' femenina significa adaptar los
logros pragmaticos occidentales a demandas culturales especificas.
El resultado: una identidad vigorosa combinada con una desenvuelta
sensualidad femenina, junto con la conservacion de un profundo
respeto por la familia.
</P>
<P>
   LA CAUSA VERDE
</P>
<P>
   Los documentales de television sobre la naturaleza, los
articulos de viajes y las campanas lanzadas por personalidades como
el cantante Sting y Anita Roddick, de The Body Shop, han
contribuido a que el mundo conozca los vastos recursos naturales y
ecosistemas de America Latina. Los paramos de la Patagonia estan de
moda entre ricos y poderosos: Ted Turner, el magnate de los medios;
George Soros, el rey de las finanzas, y el astro cinematografico
Sylvester Stallone son tres entre muchos que han comprado vastos
terrenos en el fin del mundo.
</P>
<P>
   Durante muchos anos, los latinoamericanos han considerado las
preocupaciones ecologicas de los extranjeros como intentos
hipocritas por negarles el pleno uso de sus recursos naturales.
Pero la inquietud tambien crece en la region. Brasil, por ejemplo,
quiere mejorar su imagen en el campo ecologico. La selva del
Amazonas pierde 14.763 kilometros cuadrados al ano.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace advierte que con el ritmo actual de deforestacion, la
selva tropical habra desaparecido en 80 anos. Para preservar el
area que todavia queda, el gobierno de Brasil requiere que las
empresas mineras reemplacen las zonas forestales que destruyen. El
gobierno de Cardoso ha anunciado que este ano designara 25 millones
de hectareas de la selva amazonica como territorio protegido.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues _ Mas Turismo:
</P>
<P>
   A medida que los gobiernos reconozcan los beneficios de una
saludable politica ecologica y el enorme potencial economico del
turismo (verde o no) veremos mas de Latinoamerica en los folletos
de las agencias de viajes. Ya los viajeros en busca de aventuras,
emociones y lugares exoticos se dirigen a los rincones remotos de
America Latina. Pero el turismo de la region nunca alcanzara todo
su potencial hasta que se reduzca el nivel de delitos y violencia.
</P>
<P>
   LA LATINIDAD: UNA SUPERIDENTIDAD
</P>
<P>
   Despues de una decada de optimismo en Asia, la crisis financiera
de 1997 hizo que el mundo se detuviera a determinar que paises
tenian mejores posibilidades que otros. La comparacion entre Asia y
America Latina era inevitable. Aunque Asia es una region definida
fundamentalmente por la geografia, America Latina tiene un sentido
de identidad y de comunidad _ una latinidad _ que supera los
limites geograficos.
</P>
<P>
   Esto significa que los vecinos de lugares tan distantes como
Santiago de Chile, Ciudad de Mexico y los barrios latinos de Miami
y Nueva York se pueden comunicar. Incluso los brasilenos, que
hablan portugues, y los demas latinoamericanos, que hablan espanol,
pueden comunicarse sin tener que acudir a un tercer idioma, cosa
que no sucede entre los pueblos asiaticos.
</P>
<P>
   Esta enorme poblacion con raices linguisticas y culturales
comunes ha permitido el desarrollo de un rico mundo cultural
independiente de las influencias anglosajonas, hegemonicas a nivel
mundial. Escritores como el argentino Jorge Luis Borges, el
colombiano Gabriel Garcia Marquez, el mexicano Octavio Paz y el
peruano Mario Vargas Llosa se leen en todo el mundo latino y mas
alla. En el campo musical, los latinos ostentan una profundidad,
una diversidad y una vitalidad que iguala facilmente la enorme
produccion del mundo de habla inglesa. Los estilos latinos tienen
sus raices en lugares especificos: el tango en Argentina, la samba
en Brasil, el vallenato en Colombia, el merengue en la Republica
Dominicana, el mariachi en Mexico. Los estilos se mezclan
continuamente y producen hibridos que no pertenecen a ningun lugar
y pertenece a todos.
</P>
<P>
   El Poder Cultural del Futuro:
</P>
<P>
   La latinidad tiene la posibilidad de convertirse en la
superpotencia cultural del futuro, quiza eclipsando a Estados
Unidos como el mayor exportador de cultura popular del mundo. A
medida que la tecnologia de Internet avance y aumente el acceso al
sonido y al video, veremos un gran cruce de la imaginacion
latinoamericana con el rapido crecimiento del poder cultural
latino.
</P>
<P>
   Si America Latina logra asimilar el cambio y conservar su rico
legado cultural, sera una region con la que habra que contar en
este nuevo milenio. America Latina necesitara seguir buscando la
unificacion, tanto dentro de la region como con Estados Unidos. Eso
es lo que diferencia a la globalizacion de la colonizacion: el
poder de cambiar va en ambas direcciones.

articulos de viajes y las campanas lanzadas por personalidades como
el cantante Sting y Anita Roddick, de The Body Shop, han
contribuido a que el mundo conozca los vastos recursos naturales y
ecosistemas de America Latina. Los paramos de la Patagonia estan de
moda entre ricos y poderosos: Ted Turner, el magnate de los medios;
George Soros, el rey de las finanzas, y el astro cinematografico
Sylvester Stallone son tres entre muchos que han comprado vastos
terrenos en el fin del mundo.
</P>
<P>
   Durante muchos anos, los latinoamericanos han considerado las
preocupaciones ecologicas de los extranjeros como intentos
hipocritas por negarles el pleno uso de sus recursos naturales.
Pero la inquietud tambien crece en la region. Brasil, por ejemplo,
quiere mejorar su imagen en el campo ecologico. La selva del
Amazonas pierde 14.763 kilometros cuadrados al ano.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace advierte que con el ritmo actual de deforestacion, la
selva tropical habra desaparecido en 80 anos. Para preservar el
area que todavia queda, el gobierno de Brasil requiere que las
empresas mineras reemplacen las zonas forestales que destruyen. El
gobierno de Cardoso ha anunciado que este ano designara 25 millones
de hectareas de la selva amazonica como territorio protegido.
</P>
<P>
   Que Viene Despues _ Mas Turismo:
</P>
<P>
   A medida que los gobiernos reconozcan los beneficios de una
saludable politica ecologica y el enorme potencial economico del
turismo (verde o no) veremos mas de Latinoamerica en los folletos
de las agencias de viajes. Ya los viajeros en busca de aventuras,
emociones y lugares exoticos se dirigen a los rincones remotos de
America Latina. Pero el turismo de la region nunca alcanzara todo
su potencial hasta que se reduzca el nivel de delitos y violencia.
</P>
<P>
   LA LATINIDAD: UNA SUPERIDENTIDAD
</P>
<P>
   Despues de una decada de optimismo en Asia, la crisis financiera
de 1997 hizo que el mundo se detuviera a determinar que paises
tenian mejores posibilidades que otros. La comparacion entre Asia y
America Latina era inevitable. Aunque Asia es una region definida
fundamentalmente por la geografia, America Latina tiene un sentido
de identidad y de comunidad _ una latinidad _ que supera los
limites geograficos.
</P>
<P>
   Esto significa que los vecinos de lugares tan distantes como
Santiago de Chile, Ciudad de Mexico y los barrios latinos de Miami
y Nueva York se pueden comunicar. Incluso los brasilenos, que
hablan portugues, y los demas latinoamericanos, que hablan espanol,
pueden comunicarse sin tener que acudir a un tercer idioma, cosa
que no sucede entre los pueblos asiaticos.
</P>
<P>
   Esta enorme poblacion con raices linguisticas y culturales
comunes ha permitido el desarrollo de un rico mundo cultural
independiente de las influencias anglosajonas, hegemonicas a nivel
mundial. Escritores como el argentino Jorge Luis Borges, el
colombiano Gabriel Garcia Marquez, el mexicano Octavio Paz y el
peruano Mario Vargas Llosa se leen en todo el mundo latino y mas
alla. En el campo musical, los latinos ostentan una profundidad,
una diversidad y una vitalidad que iguala facilmente la enorme
produccion del mundo de habla inglesa. Los estilos latinos tienen
sus raices en lugares especificos: el tango en Argentina, la samba
en Brasil, el vallenato en Colombia, el merengue en la Republica
Dominicana, el mariachi en Mexico. Los estilos se mezclan
continuamente y producen hibridos que no pertenecen a ningun lugar
y pertenece a todos.
</P>
<P>
   El Poder Cultural del Futuro:
</P>
<P>
   La latinidad tiene la posibilidad de convertirse en la
superpotencia cultural del futuro, quiza eclipsando a Estados
Unidos como el mayor exportador de cultura popular del mundo. A
medida que la tecnologia de Internet avance y aumente el acceso al
sonido y al video, veremos un gran cruce de la imaginacion
latinoamericana con el rapido crecimiento del poder cultural
latino.
</P>
<P>
   Si America Latina logra asimilar el cambio y conservar su rico
legado cultural, sera una region con la que habra que contar en
este nuevo milenio. America Latina necesitara seguir buscando la
unificacion, tanto dentro de la region como con Estados Unidos. Eso
es lo que diferencia a la globalizacion de la colonizacion: el
poder de cambiar va en ambas direcciones.

INDUSTRY TRENDS AND PHO 
</HEADLINE>

 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sunday afternoon rolls around and that means
soup's on.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the tables crammed together in the back of the
Vietnamese dive are packed with music industry executives, Internet
entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and recent college graduates.
Elbow to elbow, they slurp steaming bowls of noodle soup and swap
ideas, their opinions given equal credence during the weekly
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Pho (pronounced ``fuh'' and named after the soup served
at the Pho 87 restaurant in Los Angeles's Chinatown), the group is
open to anyone with an interest in the intersection of music and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In those circles, over the scores of Sundays since it started in
May 1998, Pho has become a buzzword for innovation and free advice.
Even the food was free until recently, when brunch attendance began
topping 100 on occasion and Jim Griffin's hat was passed around.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, Griffin, the group's founder, picked up the check
himself, even on the Sunday it reached $700. Griffin, who created
and ran the technology department at Geffen Records before
launching a consulting firm called Cherry Lane Digital-One House,
said he simply wanted to share his good fortune. He also wanted a
place where colleagues whose phone calls he couldn't return could
find him every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in this business think about the cost of
everything and the value of nothing,'' said Griffin, who was an
early convert to the power of the computer and is considered one of
the most forward thinkers in the music industry. ``But this is the
soup I love. It was a way for people to find me. That's how it
evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also expanding. A handful of people shared that first
meal; a typical Sunday now draws at least 50 to Pho. The largest
crowd so far was 162, when a major Internet music conference was
held in Los Angeles last year. More recently, swarms of Harvard MBA
candidates dropped by for soup.
</P>
<P>
   Pho offshoots have sprung up in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago,
New York and Minneapolis, although not every group meets on Sunday
and not always at a pho restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry where Wednesday is yesteryore, Pho
aficionados crave contact more than once a week. For them, there is
the invitation-only Pho e-mail list, which sometimes gets so out of
control with postings that one participant recently issued a
desperate plea to ``remove, remove, remove'' his name from the list
sponsored by OneHouse.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every branch of the music industry is represented on
the Pho list, which numbers about 200, from CEOs to producers to
managers to attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   What they share is concern over changes in the entertainment
industry in general and the music business in particular now that
people can download videos and songs from their computers.
Griffin's aim is to help them harness and direct that change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful resource, an opportunity for folks in the
business to bash out an idea, just grab it by both ears until
something makes sense,'' said Kevin Doran, a Manhattan-based music
and Internet consultant who posts at least one e-mail a day to the
Pho list. ``It's a lifeline to thinking people in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent discussions include the Time Warner/AOL merger,
intellectual property rights, the ethics of not paying artists for
their music when it is downloaded via computer, and almost every
announcement coming from the fast-growing world of digital music.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of creating a Pho Web site set off friendly but
heated debate over the security inherent in a relatively exclusive
mailing list versus opinions offered for consumption by the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   In between, one participant invited everyone to a party at a Las
Vegas computer show, another to visit her company's booth at
Cannes, and another to attend her course on career advancement in
the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pho has become a place where people can come together and find
one another,'' said Griffin, who now helps young Internet companies
develop through his incubator Evolab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contacts are being made. Deals are being made. That's good,
because some people have great ideas and some people have the money
to fund them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, much of the most important networking takes
place at the Sunday gatherings, where people can put a name to a
face and talk more freely than an electronic format allows. When
the crowds swell, the waiters know with a glance to bring more
chairs. With no other way to reach the far side of the L-shaped
table _ actually many tables shoved together _ the waiters carry
the chairs out the front door and hand them through a side
door.Then everyone scoots over to make room.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gets up to speak, no one calls anything to order,''
said Mike Griffin, Jim Griffin's younger brother, who moved to Los
Angeles in September to join Evolab. ``You see people who might be
CEOs of companies in T-shirts and shorts. It's nonconformist.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Omega Medina was among the newcomers, invited by a
friend who had been turned on to Pho by another friend, as often
happens. Medina, who is a senior awards coordinator for the
National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, said she was there
to ``pick brains,'' and get in on the discussion that will help
determine how music is delivered to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where there's no turning back,'' Medina
said. ``It's a Web world, a Web lifestyle. The question is: What's
the right way to go?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rafael Quezada never misses a meeting ``unless
something absolutely pulls me away.'' An attendee since April, the
former general contractor turned Internet security specialist said
he knows that the ideas hashed out over soup will be the ideas that
guide music on the Web for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music needs structure more than anything in this new world
that's cyberspace,'' Quezada said. ``The business models haven't
yet been defined and when they are, the people in the room will be
in the best position possible. This room is a seething hotbed of
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The room also happens to be rather dumpy, Griffin noted, which
makes it the perfect place for a free exchange of ideas. No suits,
no pomp, just the circumstance of a shared meal in an otherwise
quiet restaurant with no music playing in the background.

   WINTER-SEAST _ More rotten weather is in store for the
Southeast, still recovering from the monster snowstorm that hit the
East Coast this week. Sleet greeted motorists in portions of
central Mississippi today, heralding what was shaping up as a major
winter event in this Deep South State. Weather watchers said the
arrival of a frigid Canadian air mass, coupled with a
moisture-packed system moving in from the west, promised to bring a
full range of winter precipitation _freezing rain, sleet and snow _
to all areas except the Gulf coast. In North Carolina, officials at
Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina are hoping
to reopen later today after clearing 20 inches of snow. (Manuel,

   FLU _ ATLANTA _ The flu bug hit many states earlier and harder
than expected, the CDC reported Thursday. The 1999-2000 flu season
began to increase in mid-December, four weeks earlier than in the
1997-98 season, and almost eight weeks earlier than in the 1998-99
season. The good news: Influenza cases appear to have already

   ABERNATHY _ ATLANTA _ Former State Sen. Ralph David Abernathy
III says he has turned his life over to God. But his immediate
future rests in the hands of a Fulton County Superior Court judge.
McConnell is scheduled to sentence the son and namesake of
Atlanta's famed civil rights leader on Jan. ??. A jury found
Abernathy guilty last month of a scheme to pocket taxpayer funds.
Although his first trial ended in a mistrial, he was convicted by
the second jury on 18 counts _ five of theft by taking involving
$5,700, five of false swearing, five of violating his oath of
office, two of forgery and one count of influencing a witness. A
decision to appeal is being weighed. Attorney General Thurbert
Baker has indicated that his office will seek incarceration.
Abernathy's lawyer, Theodore Lackland, plans to ask the judge to
spare his client jail time. And most lawyers think the sentence
will not be harsh, based on other sentences for politicians.

&HT;     ADS SHOWING WOMEN WITH MASTECTOMIES DON'T GO OVER IN SAN
FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Look. A woman in a bare-chested, provocative
pose stares at you with pursed lips, one hand on a rounded hip, the
other on a thigh.
</P>
<P>
   It is the classic sexy pose. But for one disturbing fact: The
woman in the poster has scars where her breasts had once been.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph of the woman with a double mastectomy is part of
an ad campaign by the Breast Cancer Fund, a San Francisco
nonprofit, designed to bring attention to the disease that affects
1 in 8 American women.
</P>
<P>
   But in this liberal city where anything goes, this won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very rough poster,'' said Lew Lillian, head of the San
Francisco office of Outdoor Systems, which has exclusive rights to
bus shelter advertising in city and turned down the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it - a four-by-six-foot picture of a woman's
torso and you see these two bare red scars, I mean, to see a
woman's terribly, terribly scarred body, it's just not for public
consumption on the streets of San Francisco where children and
others can be traumatized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian said he had recoiled when first shown the ad, made to
look like a mock Cosmopolitan magazine cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked away,'' he said. ``It's too shocking. Too upsetting.
Too provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows the scarred chest of Andrea Martin, 53, the
director of the Breast Cancer Fund, superimposed over a model's
body.
</P>
<P>
   Two other posters, mimicking ads for Victoria's Secret lingerie
and Calvin Klein perfume, feature models with a single mastectomy.
The Victoria Secret-type ad reads: ``It's no secret society is
obsessed with breasts, but what are we doing about breast cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are meant to be unsettling, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning down the ad, she said, is like saying, ``It's way too
upsetting to see the ramifications of this disease and would you
please leave us alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said she finds it ironic that San Francisco turned down
the ads while they are posted in about three dozen bus shelters in
more conservative, suburban Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Board Supervisor Alicia Becerril doesn't think ads
depicting mastectomies belong in bus shelters for the same reason
Lillian and his staff turned them down. The image is too graphic
for the general population, she said, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   But she thinks the message is an important one that belongs in
locations where it could best target women.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ad in a woman's magazine prompted her to get a
mammogram last year, Becerril said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Luce, co-director of the Breast Clinic at San
Francisco General Hospital, doubts that an ad depicting a
mastectomy would either prompt women to run out to get or avoid a
mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political message rather than a health message,`` said
Luce, who like Becerril had not seen the ads. ``If it's dramatic,
it's going to get people upset and angry and talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Luce has no objection to placing the ads in bus shelters. She
said she found the fear that it would scare children a
double-standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the other crap on TV and movies and all over the
place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, who had one breast removed in 1989 and the other in
1991, understands why the photographs can be upsetting for some
because she had trouble coping with the visual image of herself for
a long while.
</P>
<P>
   What the ads hope to do is stir discussion and outrage, Martin
said. They ``hit something on a real visceral level,'' she said.

&HT;     SAYING GOODBYE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It really hit me when I heard George W. Bush
say, through his perma-smirk, that his victory in Iowa marked ``the
beginning of the end of the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to miss that old boy. If Clinton is replaced by the
son of a Bush he beat in 1992, I'm going to miss him an awful lot.
We can't go back to a Bush, a lesser one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Clinton has been gloriously relaxed, living in a Martha's
Vineyard of the mind while the snow piles up outside.
</P>
<P>
   He's been talking philosophy and football with the reporters he
used to hate, dragging out press conferences as long as he can and
hatching more idealistic schemes than he ever did when he had an
outside chance of getting them through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tax incentives to invest in depressed areas. Computers for the
poor. Funds for basic research. Another increase in the minimum
wage. Sure, the Republicans will go for all those as soon as they
are stirred by Clinton's final State of the Union speech Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looks marvelous, though, and that's what counts, at
least when you're facing a temporary separation from your wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba has slimmed down. He's wandering around in the snow in
blue jeans, boots and a brown suede jacket looking like some kind
of freewheeling Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Clinton and I have had a special relationship,
although not as special as some he's had. Whenever he betrayed his
alleged beliefs, the truth or the public trust, I'd trash him.
That's a lot of columns.
</P>
<P>
   Man, he's been fun, for consumers of politainment as well as
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest symbol of the symbol-ridden Clinton presidency, at
least to me, was in 1997. I learned that he wanted to start his
``national conversation'' on race at a college commencement and he
picked UC-San Diego, which didn't even have a university-wide
commencement.
</P>
<P>
   So UCSD created a huge commencement for Clinton on the athletic
field, renting folding chairs and making laid-back faculty members
rent colorful academic robes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced his fake national conversation on race at an
invented commencement and the national press covered it as if it
were real. It was pure Clinton. The man is the world's best
salesman of cold-pressed, extra-virgin, nouveau snake oil.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to that conversation on race? For some reason
we're talking about that ``symbol of heritage,'' the Confederate
flag, and having a national shouting match over a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are constantly saying they're voting for The W
because he can win and because ``He's our Bill Clinton.``
</P>
<P>
   That's what they say. Sorry, I know Bill Clinton, and he's no
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the Teddy Ruxpin of politics. He's cute and
cuddly, but there are only a limited number of things he has to say
when someone pulls the string.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Teddy Ruxpin, Bush has a tendency to muff his
pre-programmed lines. Not just muff them, but mangle them.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking a week ago about the fall of our former adversary,
the Soviet Union, he spewed pronouns the way his dad once spewed
sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world and we knew
exactly who they were,'' he told his Iowa audience. ``It was us
versus them and it was clear who them was. Today, we're not so sure
who the, they are but we know they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. may have the finest advisors from the finest
conservative think tanks, but if he gets elected, we're going to
have to listen to stuff like that for four years.
</P>
<P>
   His position on Roe vs. Wade, as expressed in Iowa, was, ``I
felt like it was a case where the court took the place of what
legislatures do in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, what? I felt like this was not the finest syntax or legal
reasoning I'd ever heard. His handlers didn't like him talking
about abortion at all. They have to get him past the rhetoric into
the White House so he can appoint anti-abortion judges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is good when he's on the spot. He can talk cogently on
any subject at the drop of a question, a subpoena or an intern.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to miss our Bubba when he's gone, and it almost
seems like he's gone already.

   SUPERBOWL-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Whether or not Super Bowl XXXIV
is remembered for the game the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans
will play on Sunday, it will certainly enter the annals of Madison
Avenue as Dot-Com Bowl I. But will consumers recall it as a
dot-comedy of errors or the day that Internet advertisers joined
the ranks of Super Bowl mainstays like Anheuser-Busch, Federal
Express, PepsiCo and Visa? More than a dozen of the 30-plus
companies spending an estimated average of $2.2 million for each
30-second spot will be Web sites and electronic commerce
entrepreneurs. Last year, there were only two dot-com advertisers
during the Super Bowl, three if you count a commercial from the
Victoria's Secret unit of Intimate Brands promoting an online
fashion show. The stakes have never been higher for companies
gambling that the impressions they make by exposing themselves to
the 130 million or so Americans watching the game will justify the
huge outlays to buy commercial time. By Stuart Elliott.

 &HT;    YEARS AFTER INTIFADA, ISRAELIS RETURNING TO OLD CITY
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Jan. 30 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ These days, Israeli Yael Boksenboin(cq) can visit
Jerusalem's Old City like a tourist: With her toddler daughter and
without the rifle she used to carry.
</P>
<P>
   She was a soldier here during the Palestinian Intifada uprising
that swept the region 10 years ago. Then, this tourist haven _ an
ancient walled district in downtown Jerusalem _ was the scene of
frequent attacks on Jews by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   There was a permanent Israeli presence in the small Jewish
Quarter. But most Israelis stopped their frequent shopping or
dining excursions to the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   When the Intifada ended in 1993, the fear remained. So did
Israeli troops, stationed along the narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the last year, Israelis have been rediscovering the Old
City. Especially on Saturdays, Hebrew can be heard sprinkled among
the Spanish, English and Italian of the foreign sightseers and the
Arabic of the locals.
</P>
<P>
   When Boksenboin, a 30-year-old lawyer, visited a couple months
ago, it was the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   She strolled by the Western Wall, sacred to Jews. She took in
the scents of the bazaar's spices and hummus, which she recalled
from her visits as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was here I was a soldier and I walked with a
gun,'' she said. ``I don't have to look behind my back like I used
to. It's feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Israelis are returning now is not clear. People cite
the current rarity of political violence. Some say that progress in
the peace process makes them feel more at ease among Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Israelis are feeling more at home in the
heart of their cherished, yet disputed, capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good sign,'' says Israeli Meron Benvenisti, who
was a top city official during the Intifada and saw the decline in
Israeli visits to the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to define the whole thing as the geography of fear.
People are overcoming the fear,'' said Benvenisti, whose book
``City of Stone'' describes the city's ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis still rarely venture into other Arab areas of
Jerusalem. Benvenisti is skeptical that the political climate is
responsible for their return to the Old City. He said that the lack
of recent violence has prompted Israelis to simply rediscover a
delight they had missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real a phenomenon,'' said Israeli tour guide Doron Bar,
who was leading a group of Israelis recently.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the group toured China. With Bar, they were
visiting the Old City's Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed by
many to be the site of Christ's crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit may belong to an exhibit of works from
American glass sculptor Dale Chihuly. Opened in July in a museum
garden just inside the Old City walls, it has sold nearly 700,000
tickets to foreigners and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   From the exhibit, many venture further to Old City shops and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The stone streets of the Old City, which is less than a square
mile in area and dates back more than 3,000 years, are lined by
more than 3,000 shops. They sell everything from tacky tourist
T-shirts to the meat, vegetables and clothes used by the locals.
They also offer fine jewelry, pottery and carpets from throughout
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Around the shops live the residents. The large Moslem Quarter is
home for more than 20,000 Palestinians. The Christian Quarter is
also mostly Palestinian. There are smaller Armenian and Jewish
Quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Israel took total control over the Old City when it captured it
from the Jordanians in 1967. Palestinians seek to govern their own
affairs there and most countries officially consider the matter up
for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian merchants seem pleased to see Israeli shoppers
returning.
</P>

   Recently, Palestinian Adel Kawasmi has seen the return of a few
Israelis who came to his shop regularly before the Intifada. They
would share tea and buy his glass bowls and drinking glasses.

<P>
   ``We are happy to see them here, of course,'' he said. ``The
business is much better.''
</P>
<P>
   And Israelis don't mind that Arab merchants have commercial
motives for wanting them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt really welcome. They all said, 'Please come in,'''
said Anat Inbar, a 24-year-old television producer. ``I know it's
for economic reasons, but that's good. That's normal life.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ She's diminutive, soft-spoken and genteel.
</P>
<P>
   She's also an ardent feminist and one of Mexico's most powerful
political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Garcia, 48, is the first woman to be elected president of
a political party in this country where machismo still generally
rules. Born just before Mexican women won the right to vote in
1953, she was committed to politics by 1975 _ the year Mexico
finally erased a law declaring that husbands could forbid wives
from working.
</P>
<P>
   Since her election in a nationwide vote last July, Garcia has
led the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, founded 10
years ago in opposition to Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   To some, her rise to the top of one of this country's most
powerful opposition parties could signal a new age for women
leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's victory certainly set a trend. In November the PRI
appointed another woman, Dulce Maria Sauri, president of the ruling
party. It was a move widely acknowledged here as a nod at Mexico's
women, who represent 52 percent of the potential electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Both these women lead their parties during a competitive
election year when Mexicans will select a new president on July 2,
along with a new Congress and other top offices.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the single mother of a college-age daughter, is a firm
believer in the liberal creed that government should intervene to
solve social problems and help the poor. But she's also so feminist
that she doesn't hesitate to criticize people within her own party
when macho attitudes threaten to keep women in secondary roles.
</P>
<P>
   She was instrumental, in fact, in a party rule that requires
that no more than 70 percent of any PRD administration be dominated
by one gender.
</P>
<P>
   Men make jokes about the policy, Garcia said, smoothing her
skirt primly as she sat down for an interview with Cox Newspapers
in her office at party headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joke that the quota should guarantee that at least 30
percent should be men so they won't disappear,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice and a veteran politician who fought to upgrade laws
against rape and sexual harassment, Garcia is a woman on the
constant go and a regular front-page item in the country's
newspapers. She flies from city to city meeting constituents and
political leaders of all backgrounds, and she has been credited
with helping transform the PRD from a party on the margins to a
force to a reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's style has helped her party move toward ``the famous
middle road,'' a strategy that's worked for other leftist parties
in the world, said political analyst Joel Estudillo of the Mexican
Institute for Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amalia Garcia could be the PRD's future,'' Estudillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, has controlled the country's
presidency, its Congress and most state governments for 70 years.
It was only two years ago that the PRI lost full control of the
lower house of Congress here and the PRD began to gain more power.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 500 members of the lower house, the PRD now counts 123.
Mexico's oldest opposition party, the conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, counts 117. Nine members are independents or
affiliated with other opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is considered one of the brains behind another successful
electoral strategy that is starting to boost the PRD presence in
the governors' mansions and mayoral offices in various states:
softening the party's militant image and forging coalitions with
unlikely partners, including the conservative PAN and dissident PRI
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the party has been elected to governors' offices in
four of Mexico's 31 states. Last December, it sponsored a candidate
that won the mayoral election in the high-profile,
economically-powerful resort city of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacatecas, Garcia's home state, she and the PRD wooed a
dissident PRI leader and sponsored him as their candidate for
governor. They did the same thing in the state of Tlaxcala. Both
candidates won.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD also won the governorships of Baja California and
Nayarit, where they established coalitions with the PAN to defeat
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both the PRD and the PAN are trying to drive the PRI from office
and label the ruling party corrupt, negligent and anti-democratic.
Their bedrock philosophies are worlds apart, however. The PAN is
considered pro-free market and socially conservative, and it
supports a continuing ban on abortion here.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't made choice a top issue in this largely Catholic
country, the PRD favors decriminalization of abortion and believes
in only limited free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, the PRD had its first substantial
national victory when its leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won the Mexico
City mayor's race. Cardenas left office last year to run for
president and appointed another PRD woman, Rosario Robles, his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico City in its control along with four states, the PRD
now governs a territory with more than 20 million of Mexico's 93
million people. Even though Cardenas is lagging third in polls,
Garcia is convinced the party's experience will help him and other
party candidates in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago, during the 1994 presidential election the PRD
didn't govern any entity,'' Garcia said. ``Now we govern five and
citizens have seen there is no chaos, no uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It was said that businesses wouldn't trust (the
PRD). None of that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   While she acknowledges that Mexico's presidency is the top prize
long coveted by this country's opposition parties, Garcia believes
that her party should also continue to try to win local elections
city-by-city, state-by-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, everything has revolved around the figure of the
president,'' she said. ``We believe that we should put an accent on
each and every space in the government where there could be an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, politics is not only a passion but a birthright _
although her critical view of the PRI took her down a different
path than her family. Her father was diplomat and governor of
Zacatecas who belonged to the ruling party. The year 1968 was
pivotal for her; her father was posted abroad and she opted to
return to Mexico to continue studying when a student uprising for
more democracy was violently repressed.
</P>
<P>
   She studied sociology at the National Autonomous University and
history at the Autonomous University of Puebla. She fought for the
release of Mexican political prisoners in the late 1970s, and
plunged into the women's rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly joining the Communist Party and then the Socialist
Party, Garcia became a founding member of the PRD. As a federal
congresswoman, she led a successful fight to toughen rape and
sexual harassment laws. Afterward she served in Mexico City's
legislative assembly and fought police corruption, forcing a police
chief out of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was also instrumental in reforms allowing Mexico City's
residents to finally elect their mayor, who, prior to 1997, was
always appointed by Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign for party president last year, Garcia said, ``was
difficult in a in a country that has a tradition, or at least the
reputation, for being macho.'' She said she encountered more
resistance from male party leaders than from the party's
rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty percent of woman voted for me,'' she said. ``We've
decided that women shouldn't be (in the party) just symbolically. I
think that if we're able to get women to identify with the PRD then
that will bear a lot of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course that commitment has to be real, not
artificial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her party's relative success recently, Garcia's
experience hasn't been entirely positive. The first party election
that she ran in ended in disaster last July when the party was torn
apart by accusations of vote tampering from all sides. The PRD
annulled the election, but the party's reputation suffered. A
second election in July was smoother.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Garcia continued high-stakes negotiations last
year that would have established an historic alliance to pick on
opposition candidate for Mexico's July 2 presidential election. Had
it been successful, the coalition would be have included nearly all
of Mexico's opposition parties and posed a formidable threat to the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks ultimately failed; while the conservatives and
leftists came up with a common platform, they couldn't agree on how
to select a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was disappointed by the coalition's collapse, but has no
lost love for the PAN _ particularly because she doesn't think the
conservative party gives enough opportunities to women.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled an observation that annoyed her while she sat in
negotiations in rooms filled with choking smoke from cigars
brandished by a PAN leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we were in meetings during the negotiations
for an alliance _ four months of daily meetings _ the PAN was the
only party that never had a woman there,'' Garcia said.

 &HT;    ISRAELI POLICE TO PROBE BARAK'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With public support crucial for his efforts in peace
talks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday faced the first
scandal of his administration as police started a probe into his
campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubenstein ordered the probe
based on a report from the government's independent comptroller,
issued earlier Wednesday. The report fined Barak's campaign more
than $3.2 million for using non-profit organizations to get around
campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited 11 other parties with violating the rules and
Rubenstein ordered that four, in addition to Barak's One Israel
faction, be investigated. But, nearly half the 62-page report
focused on One Israel, which it said was clearly the worst
violator.
</P>
<P>
   Barak won a landslide election victory in May and has presented
himself as a man Israelis can trust with the life-and-death
decisions in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   He came before reporters Thursday to deflect the allegations and
say he may appeal the fine to the Israeli supreme court(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   The former army commando is known for his meticulous attention
to detail. As prime minister, he has overseen every step of peace
negotiations and doubled his role by serving also as defense
minister. But Thursday, he said he was not aware that his campaign
was raising millions of dollars through non-profit groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave clear guidelines to act only within the framework of
the law,'' he said. ``It is not reasonable to expect the prime
minister candidate to make sure all his instructions are carried
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had been questioned briefly during the probe by Israeli
Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg. In his report, Goldberg said Barak
should have known what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially with the wide range of the activity explained in
this report, the candidate should have seen a red light,'' Goldberg
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The report and the police probe cap a series of unrelated
political scandals rippling through Israel's upper echelons. Former
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under investigation for gifts
he accepted on the job. President Ezer Weizman, whose role is
mostly ceremonial, is under investigation for taking nearly
$500,000 in cash from a wealthy French supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's opponents in the right-wing Likud Party, who have seen
limited success leading opposition to Barak's approach to peace
talks with Syria and the Palestinians, seized on the elections
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should stop whining and take responsibility,'' said Likud
leader Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Barak's campaign used recently formed
groups like ``Advancement of Taxi Drivers in Israel'' and ``Our
Hope is Not Lost'' to collect money from donors whose identities
were concealed. The money then went to pro-Barak campaign
activities, such as conducting polls and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The spending allegedly put Barak's campaign over the
approximately $21 million spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said that a top campaign manager, Yitzak
Herzog, used money for the campaign from the estate of deceased
European philanthropist Octav Butner. The report said Herzog was
managing the estate, but that the money was supposed to go to
charities.

50 pieces in this serenely beautiful show were part of a larger
exhibition of ceramics from the same museum that traveled to
Chicago, San Francisco and the Met in 1992. But it scarcely

   BACH-ANNIVERSARY (Undated) _ The last Bach year wasn't so long
ago: 1985, to be exact, the 300th anniversary of the composer's
birth. And although Bach had to share the celebration with other
masters born in the fateful, fertile year 1685, Handel and
Scarlatti, he did not lack for attention. Now, in the calculus of
births and deaths, centenaries and quarter-millenniums, and points
in between, comes another Bach year: the 250th anniversary of the
composer's death. Not complaining, mind you. In addition to the
commercial aspects _ books, records and scores; concerts, recitals
and festivals _ and the odd bit of flimflammery, such
commemorations typically give a jolt to scholarship on the subject
as well as a boost in public awareness. By James Oestreich.

   _ Jeanne's Diary
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jeanne Sather has learned a lot about possible side
effects since she was first diagnosed with cancer 17 months ago.
She's learned about nausea, headaches, hair loss, the usual things
that go with cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And she's learned about some things you don't always hear about
_ orange urine, pink tears.
</P>
<P>
   Getting fired.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the unwritten side effects, the collateral damage of
serious illness that no one mentions _ friends who disappear
because your mortality reminds them of their own. Jobs that vanish
without explanation. These are the side effects you don't prepare
for because you don't see them coming.
</P>
<P>
   Sather wasn't sure what to expect Jan. 11 when her supervisor at
OnHealth Network Co. in Seattle called her into his office.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her cancer treatment, Sather had shared her most
private thoughts in the most public of forums _ the Web. As an
editor for OnHealth.com, Sather chronicled her cancer ordeal in an
online journal that drew hundreds of correspondents and national
media attention to the then-fledgling Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst of her battle, she thought, was behind her. She
had completed her second round of chemo and radiation. She was
looking forward to new projects at work and savoring a newfound
serenity in life. She was feeling healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   She was shocked when her supervisor closed the door and told her
she was being let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally blown away,'' Sather said. Officially, she was
told the company didn't have room for her anymore because of a
redesign of the Web site. Her supervisors said they hadn't been
entirely happy with her performance. They offered her two months'
severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   Sather, however, believes that she was fired because having
cancer interfered with her ability to work without adjustments to
her schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials would not comment specifically on the reasons
for her dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Her dismissal came two working days after OnHealth had received
a letter from her physician recommending she be allowed to work
flexible hours while her body recuperated from her second round of
chemo and radiation. It came one day after the company had abruptly
canceled her previously scheduled performance review.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the company, Dr. Robert Livingston, professor of
medicine at the University of Washington and Sather's primary
oncologist, wrote: ``For women who have had the cancer treatment
that Jeanne has had _ mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation _ it
usually takes a year to return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston recommended she be allowed to leave the office after
six hours to take a nap, then complete her work from home in the
evenings, an ``accommodation'' Sather and her doctors felt was
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Under both the Washington State Law Against Discrimination and
the Americans with Disability Act, employers are required to make
reasonable accommodations for employees with short- or long-term
disabilities, said Kelby Fletcher, an attorney specializing in
employment law who is representing Sather. Sather declined the
severance offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired her knowing full well she had cancer,'' said Mary
Bruno, senior vice president of publishing for OnHealth Network.
``In fact, it was on the strength of Jeanne's Diary that we offered
her a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides information for consumers about
health, was looking for someone who could provide a personal touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very much in keeping with our editorial philosophy,''
Bruno said. ``We're providing good medical information from a
consumer point of view, trying to remove that sense of professional
chill and provide a kind of warmth. I think Jeanne's Diary hit that
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diary was very well written with a great narrative voice.
It touched a chord with users.''
</P>
<P>
   No warning:
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) I don't remember exactly the words I used back in
September when I told my sons I had cancer, but I was dreading the
conversation. Finally, after worrying for a week, I simply told
them that I had breast cancer, that I was having surgery to remove
the breast, that I'd have some other treatment after the surgery,
and that I'd be fine. Then I waited for their questions ... Akira,
my 14-year-old, wanted to know what it was about cancer that hurt
you. So what if those cells were growing, where was the harm in
that, he asked. I couldn't answer that one. (End italics)
</P>
<P>
   The end of her job, like her cancer, came without warning, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sather was 43 and had no known risk factors for breast cancer
when she found out she had a tumor growing in her breast. She never
felt the lump. Neither did her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really fortunate _ I just went in for an annual exam _
and it was all fine,'' said Sather, who sports a brush cut of
strawberry blonde hair, thanks to chemotherapy. ``The doctor told
me to get a mammogram and I really resisted. I had one when I was
40 and wasn't convinced I needed another one yet. But she was
pushy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably saved my life. It gives you chills.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) The night before my mastectomy, I said goodbye to my
right breast in the shower as I scrubbed with a special
antibacterial soap to prevent infection in the operating room. I
washed my breast, knowing that by the same time the next day it
would be gone, part of it off to a lab for analysis, the rest sent
to an incinerator, I suppose, with the other medical waste. There
is a tremendous feeling of unreality: This is not happening.(End
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Sather, then a freelance writer and editor, started work on a
half-time contract basis for OnHealth.com in October 1998, a week
after her mastectomy. In December, she began writing the online
journal for the company as a free-lancer. The site had links to
information about breast cancer, as well as a bulletin board where
cancer patients and others could respond to the journal. Sather was
staggered by the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had women telling me their happy stories, and their sad
ones,'' she said. ``I put a human face on it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) But let me tell you what my friends did for me in
those early weeks: They brought me stories of women who had
survived. They gave me phone numbers of more women who had survived
breast cancer and who could tell me, with authority, that I would
survive it, too.
</P>
<P>
   These women told me that I would cry when my hair fell out, that
I would feel sick with chemo, that I would sometimes feel very
sorry for myself, that I would laugh sometimes at the indignity of
it all, but that I would get through it, as they had.
</P>
<P>
   They were the greatest gift, these stories.(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   New priorities:
</P>
<P>
   Sather has always loved her work. With a master's in journalism
from the University of California-Berkeley, she has worked for a
variety of news organizations, including a five-year stint as a
reporter in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After her diagnosis, she made adjustments, but never considered
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly realized, it's really true _ life's finite,'' she
said. ``I've tended to slow down, cut a lot of things out. My
children are my first priority, and my work and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, OnHealth made Sather a permanent, full-time
employee when it hired her to direct promotions. She continued to
do some writing and editing in addition to promotions work.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after getting hired full time, her cancer came back.
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) There I was, lying in bed on a sunny Sunday morning
with the newspaper and a cup of coffee, enjoying feeling well.
After five months of cancer treatment and five more months of
recovery _ gaining energy day by day, remaking my life to fit my
new values _ it was the kind of moment I'd learned to savor: The
sun through the blinds, buttery yellow and warm, but not too hot;
the coffee, strong and rich with cream. And then I rubbed my hand
across my chest where my right breast used to be and felt a
lump.(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   She froze. The odds of surviving breast cancer are 80 to 90
percent for a localized tumor, she said. If the cancer spreads to
other organs, ``it's a whole other ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was lucky. The second lump was a local recurrence, which
happens in only about 3 percent of cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommended more surgery to get ``clean margins,'' then
a course of chemotherapy with Taxol, and radiation five days a week
for 6{ weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she was determined not to let cancer be the center of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   She took her younger son, Robin, 9, with her to appointments.
``He'd play Nintendo and I'd get zapped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) Facing chemo again, I made several promises to myself:
First, to stay away from people who seem to believe I am going to
die or people who depress me with their own fears about cancer.
Second, to exercise through my treatment if at all possible ... And
third, I decided not to let the cancer treatment take over my
life.(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   She scheduled chemo for Fridays so the worst of it would be over
by Monday morning when she had to go to work. A former marathon
runner, she was accustomed to pain, but this was different.
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) My joints ached as if I'd run a marathon and
contracted the worst flu of my life at the same time. I spent the
next three days hiding in my bed crying with pain. Late on the
third day, I was able to walk around a bit. On the fourth, still
feeling achy, I went back to work, and for a swim afterward.(End
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Taxol treatments came every three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked through it,'' she said. In the fall, the company put
her on special projects so she could do more work from home. She
finished treatment in early November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been really fortunate,'' she said. ``I'm strong, and it
didn't beat me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she returned from her special projects assignment, OnHealth
Network gave her a written job description for the first time, she
said. It specifically declared her job was a ``full-time on-site''
position. She figured it meant they wanted her in the office 40
hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   She canceled doctor appointments and physical therapy
appointments to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, she went for her two-month, post-treatment
checkup and was told she was working too much.
</P>
<P>
   That's when her doctor wrote the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden dismissal two days later upset her for practical
reasons _ life and health insurance are difficult for a 45-year-old
cancer patient to obtain, and crucial for a single, working mother
of two children.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also the principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a health Web site, and here's somebody asking for
accommodation,'' she said. ``And yet they were not willing to work
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her willingness to be absolutely candid in her journal
that attracted ``hits'' to the site. Readers followed her through
her bout with medication-induced depression, her first purchase of
a breast prosthesis, and her forays into alternative treatments
(light therapy, vitamins, hypnotism).
</P>
<P>
   They commiserated over side effects such as weight gain and
``chemo brain.'' They laughed when she nicknamed her ``sluglike,
jiggly'' prosthesis ``Jabba'' (after the Star Wars character). A
friend later brought her a box for it labeled ``Jabba's Hut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my life on the Web,'' Sather said. ``And it brought them
a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails continue to this day, she said. Her journal was
mentioned in media reviews of the Web site, including ones in the
Los Angeles Times and AV Video.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity helped fuel OnHealth's breakneck growth. OnHealth
was launched in June 1998 by Robert Goodman, formerly of MSNBC.
Since then, the company, which now has about 125 employees, has
attracted more than 100 advertisers and e-commerce partners,
including American Express, Merck, Glaxo Wellcome and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson. It is considered one of the most successful health Web
sites in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Reality check:
</P>
<P>
   Two days after losing her job, Sather got the news every cancer
patient dreads: her X-rays appeared to show a spot on her lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd lost my job, and I was very upset about that. But my life
is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, more tests showed her lungs are clear. But the
scare forced her once again to focus on priorities. These days, she
walks with friends, plays with her kids and works on free-lance
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have so much energy,'' she said. ``And I can't put it
into being angry. I have to put it into being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) It is too soon to write the last word on what breast
cancer means to me, or even to write the next-to-last word. But
looking back, I can say cancer made me bold _ bold enough to
buzz-cut my own head, bold enough to go out in public without a
hat. Bold enough to write this diary and put it up on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer made me brave _ brave enough to tell the people I love
most that I have cancer, brave enough to face the changes in my
body and the possibility of a shorter life, brave enough to say,
``I need help right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer made my priorities crystal clear, even when so much else
was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer made me laugh. I had to laugh. (End italics)

&HT;     ABORTION, SUPREME COURT CONSUME THE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 30)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the hour approached for the five remaining
Republican presidential hopefuls to begin sparring on the New
Hampshire field of debate, a reporter asked Sen. John McCain of
Arizona what he would do if his teen-age daughter were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Would he sanction an abortion or would he demand that she give
birth to the child and rear it as a single mother?
</P>
<P>
   McCain replied that the decision would rest with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, as news services and television reporters
spread word of McCain's answer, the Arizonan claimed he had not
understood the question and announced that he wished to correct his
answer. The matter, he said, would be considered by his whole
family prior to a decision.
</P>
<P>
   News of the incident, a seemingly minor matter, demonstrated how
disproportionately important opposition to abortion and the Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure have
become in the GOP quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In their debate that same evening, the five Republican
presidential hopefuls discussed issues that would require the
attention of the next president: taxes, trade, national defense and
how to allocate the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But no issue generated more heat or triggered more impassioned
declarations than abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Former diplomat Alan Keyes, the most eloquent and reactionary of
the five, accused McCain, a former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner
of war, of displaying a ``profound lack of understanding'' of the
abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, the most plain-spoken and independent of the
Republican hopefuls, pointed out that he was the only one of the
five who has voted on the Senate floor for the ``preservation of
life of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, said McCain, ``proud of my pro-life record.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the senator reveled in a 6-3 Supreme Court decision
upholding a Missouri law limiting the amount of money that an
individual can contribute to a candidate for public office. McCain
was a co-sponsor of a bill to overhaul the nation's campaign
financing laws, legislation that was defeated by the Senate's
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   McCain contended that the high court decision was a
``magnificent affirmation the effort I've been making for years.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow GOP senators had claimed such limits on campaign
contributions were unconstitutional because they violated the
guarantee of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who triumphed over other Republicans
in the Iowa caucuses last week, repeated his contention that a
limit on campaign contributions would hurt the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who did not compete in the Iowa caucuses, replied that
he has always believed that what is good for America is good for
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   When the two contenders for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, mounted the stage following the GOP debate, they were not
troubled with abortion or restrictions on campaign contributions.
Both Democrats defend a woman's right to choose and they have
expressed support for changing campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the candidates in both parties demonstrated that
they had done their homework and were prepared to speak
knowledgeably on matters that are vital to the future of America.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gore and Bradley got bogged down in charges and
counter-charges about they have campaigned against each other.
Therefore, much of their hour-long debate was consumed with
assertions about the personal conduct of the candidates rather than
a fuller explanation of their positions on critical issues.
</P>
<P>
   What was incredible about the evening was the amount of heat and
anger displayed by Republicans over abortion, which is one of the
most divisive issues confronting the men who seek to lead the
world's most powerful nation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, former Reagan administration aide Gary Bauer cited
Justice David Souter, who wrote the Supreme Court's decision on
campaign spending, as the kind of judicial activist who should not
be appointed to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Bauer, Bush grinned nervously but said nothing.
It was his father, President George Bush, who appointed Souter,
with the consent of the Senate, to the court. In words tinged with
disgust, Bauer also noted that seven of the nine justices were
named by Republican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   He might also have noted that four of the six justices who ruled
in favor of limits on campaign spending were nominated by the last
four Republican presidents _ Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald
Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite obvious that as the campaign continues, the
Republican presidential candidates will distance themselves as far
as they can from the Supreme Court.

   A Depiction Of Progress
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago the Russian emigre Conceptual artist
Ilya Kabakov created ``Monument to the Lost Glove,'' a giant glove
made of red plastic resin, which was bolted to the traffic triangle
where Fifth Avenue and Broadway cross at 23rd Street. Organized by
the Public Art Fund, which presents art around the city, the glove
was meant to seem as if it had dropped from nowhere. It became one
of the Public Art Fund's most popular projects.
</P>
<P>
   Kabakov and the fund have teamed up again with a more ambitious
endeavor. From June 13 to July 15, they will present ``The Palace
of Projects,'' originally commissioned and exhibited by Artangel, a
nonprofit group that organizes art projects in England and at the
Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid. It is to be shown at the 69th
Regiment Armory, Lexington Avenue at 26th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a strong project that spoke to the
millennium,'' said Tom Eccles, director of the Public Art Fund.
``But also an intellectual humanistic project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palace of Projects'' is a collection of 65 model
environments with explanatory texts, drawings and sketches that
explore the improvement of the human condition. It is housed in a
40-foot-tall spiraling wooden structure in which one room follows
another, up several levels.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the enormousness of the project, the armory was one
of the few spaces in Manhattan that could house it. It was also the
site Kabakov chose for the installation _ the longest event ever
held at the armory, since most last only a few days. It will cost
$300,000 to produce, making it one of the Public Art Fund's most
expensive projects. Bloomberg News has agreed to be the show's main
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money for the project, Kabakov has created a pair of
limited-edition lithographs for sale through the Public Art Fund.
They cost $600 each or $1,000 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palace of Projects is a summation of Kabakov's work,''
Eccles said. ``It's also an incredible moment to have a Russian
artist in the process of becoming an American citizen exhibiting in
an active military armory.''
</P>
<P>
   Met's Web Site
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art created its Web
site. It was a pretty rudimentary affair, with only calendar
listings and basic information about the museum. This week, after
two-and-a-half years of intense planning involving every department
in the museum, the Met has introduced a new, undated web site
(www.metmuseum.org). It is packed with images, including a large
portion of the Met's vast collection, and information including an
interactive calendar, exhibition previews and 26 educational
features.
</P>
<P>
   The site has sections called ``My Met Gallery,'' which allows
visitors to store their favorite images, and ``Explore and Learn,''
which offers extensive resource modules on ancient Egypt and on
Byzantine art. Users can create ``My Met Calendar,'' a personalized
list of preferences, and request e-mail reminders about particular
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see what's happening today or six months from now,
when you know your mother will be visiting,'' said Emily Rafferty,
senior vice president for external affairs, who headed the project.
``The entire site is meant to be a microcosm of who we are, to
create a sense of depth that mirrors the museum.'' Every aspect of
the Met, from fund-raising and subscriptions to education to the
collection, is represented.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafferty said the site would be updated daily. ``It is like
a house that can be added to, either out or up,'' she said. Over
time, the museum plans to add virtual-reality tours of some
galleries, including the period rooms of the American Wing, and to
double the number of objects from its collection that may be viewed
online.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Curator
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of the Whitney Museum of American Art's
curatorial puzzle is in place. This week, Lawrence R. Rinder,
director of the CCAC Institute at the California College of Arts
and Crafts in San Francisco, who was one of the freelance curators
of this year's Whitney Biennial, was named curator of contemporary
art.
</P>
<P>
   New Role at Christie's
</P>
<P>
   Although Christopher Burge is now honorary chairman of
Christie's in America, not its chairman as he has been for six
years, he said he would still be the principal auctioneer,
presiding over major sales in New York. He plans to continue
working with experts on attracting business. Stephen Lash, vice
president of Christie's, will become the new chairman in the
Americas.

ANTIQUES: HIGH STYLE AND CHARM IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, Fla., the premier social event of the winter
season is traditionally the Red Cross Ball, a huge charity dance
that brings out Old Palm Beach society in couture gowns and real
jewelry. Now another Palm Beach party is beginning to attract
attention: the preview of the Palm Beach International Art and
Antique Fair, which this year will be on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The fair opens to the public next Friday and runs through Feb.
13.
</P>
<P>
   This vernissage, a benefit for the Norton Museum of Art in West
Palm Beach, cannot boast the Red Cross Ball's parade of diplomats,
its detachment of military men who present the flag, or a society
band, but it does pull an affluent crowd, which is all you want if
you are one of the 78 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   The New York interior designers Mario Buatta and Ann Downey are
co-chairmen of the Collectors and Connoisseurs Committee, whose
mission is to encourage collectors and Norton Museum benefactors to
attend the fair. This year the committee includes high-profile
decorators like Lars Bolander, Tom Britt, William Diamond, Anne
Eisenhower, Juan Pablo Molyneux, Juan Montoya and Bunny Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a social evening where you go to see and be
seen,'' said Buatta, who was chairman of the Winter Antiques Show
in New York for 17 years. ``The party attracts people from South
America and all over. It brings in new clients for the dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fair's organizers, David and Lee Ann Lester, instituted some
changes this year, their fourth. ``In the past, the fair suffered
from not having enough antiques,'' Lester said, ``so we cut down
the number of paintings dealers and added more furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 30 dealers from the United States, 31 from Britain, 10
from Paris and one each from Argentina, Austria, Canada and
Germany, Lester said. ``We have more diversity this year,'' he
added, ``including specialties like antique pianos at Maximiliaan's
House of Grand Pianos, numismatics at Louis DiLauro and gilded
furniture at Ossowski.''
</P>
<P>
   New dealers from London include the Silverfund.com (vintage
Georg Jensen silver), Graham Gallery (18th- and 19th-century
English furniture), Windsor House (19th-century Continental
furniture), Adrian Alan (19th-century Continental furniture) and
Marilyn Garrow (antique textiles).
</P>
<P>
   Among the first-time American dealers are Charles Edwin Puckett
of Dallas (antique maps and prints), Kenneth W. Rendell of New York
(autographs and manuscripts), Elise Abrams of Great Barrington,
Mass. (Tiffany and Limoges antique tableware), Antonio's of San
Francisco (18th- and 19th-century Italian furniture) and Earle D.
Vanderkar of Knightsbridge Inc. (ceramics) from New York.
</P>
<P>
   For people in South Florida, the influx of outside dealers
offers an opportunity to learn as well as to shop. Many dealers
have been in business for decades. One exhibitor, for example, is
Florian Papp, a New York company founded in 1900, whose famous
clients have included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and her sister,
Lee Radziwill. It is now run by the granddaughter of the founder,
Mindy Papp, with her brother William and their mother, Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Because Florian Papp has a large stock of 18th-, 19th- and early
20th-century English and Continental furniture, it is particularly
popular with designers charged with the instant decoration of
50,000-square-foot ``megahouses'' in Long Island, N.Y., and Palm
Beach. Nina Campbell of London, the Chicago architect Stanley
Tigerman and the New York designers Greg Jordan, John Saladino,
Kitty Hawks, David Easton and Stephanie Stokes are in this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mindy used to have all period furniture, but now she has
decorative pieces as well,'' Ms. Stokes said. There still is a lot
of period furniture at Florian Papp, a three-floor gallery on
Manhattan's Madison Avenue. ``My mother is basically interested in
18th-century English furniture,'' Ms. Papp said. ``My brother
William studied at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and got
us into 19th-century English, with Aesthetic Movement and Arts and
Crafts pieces and 20th-century Art Deco. I don't have any special
period. In an average week, I review about a thousand antiques and
buy one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that the job of an antiques dealer ``is to provide
things you wouldn't find elsewhere,'' Ms. Stokes elaborated:
``Mindy has the eye of an art director. All her pieces have some
special detail that sets them apart from the ordinary and makes
them interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, for example, Ms. Papp will show a cabinet with
chinoiserie decoration. It is an example of a Western type of
furniture decorated with Western-painted Chinese motifs, as opposed
to a piece of Western-style furniture made by the Chinese for
export.
</P>
<P>
   The black lacquered piece is a Regency Pagoda cabinet that sits
on a stand. It was made in England about 1810 and has a
pagoda-shaped roof that was inspired by the Royal Pavilion at
Brighton, England, a folly made between 1802 and 1831 that boasts
one of the richest chinoiserie interiors ever created.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet has a two poly-chromed chinoiserie panels depicting
Chinese figures in a temple. The black lacquered cabinet legs and
panel borders are decorated with small motifs in parcel gilt. The
cabinet is delicate, unusual and charming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so interested in age, provenance or country of
origin,'' Ms. Papp said. ``A piece has got to be pleasing to the
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   It is completely unlike another, more traditional chinoiserie
bureau bookcase she is offering at the fair. This one is an
18th-century English form, with a double dome top and a slant-front
desk. It is the kind of cabinet particularly popular among
Anglophile Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Buatta recalled that the decorator Rose Cumming, a famously
flamboyant person, had three such bureaus in one room of her house
on West 53rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rage for chinoiserie got started with the Duchess of
Windsor, who had a brown-lacquered one,'' Buatta said. ``They
became popular here because of Colefax &AMP; Fowler, a London
decorating firm founded by Nancy Lancaster, a decorator from
Virginia. Later on, Eleanor Brown, the founder of McMillen &AMP; Co.,
had a red one made in Spain. Americans think that chinoiserie
bureau bookcases are high style; the English like lacquer in the
Chinese style, but for them it's not so serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Buatta added that he has shopped at Florian Papp for 40 years.
``Most dealers play it safe,'' he said, criticizing the ``boring
brown furniture'' he sees in some other galleries, particularly
common antiques in the Chippendale and Hepplewhite styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most New York dealers sell chickendale and hecklewhite,'' he
said, laughing.

STORY OF A BOY AND HIS DOG, OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MY DOG SKIP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Muniz, Kevin Bacon, Diane Lane, Luke Wilson, Caitlin
Wachs, Bradley Coryell, Daylan Honeycutt, Cody Linley, Harry
Connick Jr. (Narrator) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jay Russell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 95 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's summertime and the livin' is mighty sentimental in Yazoo
City, Miss. The year being 1942, Dink Jenkins (Wilson), the high
school golden boy next door, is off to fight Hitler, much to the
distress of young Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz) and the rest of the
Norman Rockwell knothole gang that tosses fat footballs and rides
balloon-tire bikes along neat sidewalks past shady porches and
well-tended yards.
</P>
<P>
   But while folks are plenty patriotic, the war is far removed
from a time and place where life turns on what goes on at the
dinner table and maybe across town at the farthest. Within these
borders Russell's film applies embellishment to the childhood
memoir by the writer and editor Willie Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The adventures begin when Willie gets a puppy on his ninth
birthday. A Jack Russell terrier with a hankering to climb into the
toilet bowl, Skip wins one and all with his frolicsome ways.
Preferring books to football, Willie gets pushed around by
neighborhood boys. But with the dog's companionship as an
inducement, they gradually let him into their circle.
</P>
<P>
   In a midnight foray to the graveyard, Skip and Willie earn
respect by standing their ground in a run-in with moonshiners. But
even Skip can't improve Willie's embarrassing performance on the
baseball field. A falling out between the two leads to Skip's
temporary disappearance and a formulaic boy-dog crisis. Here, boy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A moonshiner swats Skip with a shovel, which could be
fatal, but not in this movie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6 They'll love Skip and Willie, but the dog eventually
goes the way of all flesh and other elements could prove
upsetting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-10 For parents and grandparents, this is a nostalgic
film, providing they don't gag on the thick sentimentality. Young
children will be drawn by Skip and the boy (Frankie Muniz also is a
star in the new television series ``Malcolm in the Middle''),
Willie's gentle perseverance in the face of his troubles and the
loyalty and caring of his family.
</P>
<P>
   They will also notice his friendship with a black boy and his
early sensitivity to racial issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP The PG will drive them away, and they won't
appreciate the saccharine moralizing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEXT FRIDAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ice Cube, Mike Epps, Justin Pierce, Don Curry, John Witherspoon,
Kym E. Whitley, Tamal Jones, Tommy Lister Jr., Lisa Rodriguez &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Steve Carr &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 93 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling Mom,'' Karla (Ms. Rodriguez) warns her brothers,
Joker, Lil Joker and Baby Joker. As is their habit, the Joker boys
are running around their large suburban house getting drunk and
stoned, flashing automatic weapons and flaunting wads of cash from
their latest gangster escapades downtown, having sex with a fresh
shift of young women and encouraging their pit bull, Chico, to
attack the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But the welcome mat is out in Rancho Cucamonga, a suburb of Los
Angeles. In another large, candy-cane house on the same cul-de-sac,
Uncle Elroy ( Curry) pauses in his debauchery with Suga (Ms.
Whitley) long enough to greet his nephew Craig (Ice Cube), who has
been sent out from South-Central Los Angeles for a stay in
relatively genteel surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, though, Chico chases Craig to the roof of a
BMW. The car belongs to Day-Day ( Epps), Elroy's son and Craig's
cousin, who bought the vehicle with the same lottery winnings that
enabled his father to buy the house across the street from the
Joker boys.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the families, one black and the other Hispanic, are
interacting, with Craig and the reluctant Day-Day trading epithets
with the aggressive Jokers, drugging Chico and raiding the Joker
lair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, headed their way after breaking out of prison, the
giant Debo ( Lister) is gunning for Craig, who helped get Debo
convicted in ``Friday,'' this film's 1995 predecessor. Finally
everybody convenes at chez Joker. Mom would have a conniption. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Much violence is threatened, but it's mainly talk and
mostly comical. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX The Jokers and their women friends partake enthusiastically,
as do Suga and Uncle Elroy. But there is no nudity and again the
mood is comic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Always a phrase away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE After taking in almost $15 million at the box office
during its first weekend, this film stood as the No. 1 movie in
America. Parents should realize that it is a spoof, but every
racial and sexist stereotype is played for all it is worth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 15 A coarse, vulgar (and occasionally hilarious) film
will attract many young teen-agers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP This is the audience. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLAY IT TO THE BONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Banderas, Woody Harrelson, Lolita Davidovich, Tom
Sizemore, Robert Wagner, Lucy Liu &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ron Shelton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 124 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With one contestant already out cold with a drug overdose and
the second one dead in a car crash, the undercard for a Mike Tyson
bout in Las Vegas suddenly needs two bodies to fight a 10-rounder
before the main event. So the promoters ring up two faded
middleweights, Cesar Dominguez (Banderas) and Vince Boudreau
(Harrelson), who happen to be friends and train at the same gym in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the proposition: Get to Las Vegas by 6 that evening,
fight each other, split $100,000. After some haggling the pair set
out in a green convertible driven by Grace Pasic (Ms. Davidovich),
who at one time was involved with Vince and is now with Cesar. Or
was. Shortly into the trip the likable, plain-speaking Grace
announces that she is ending their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A long, talkative drive across the desert reveals that both men
were once contenders, that Cesar lost his major chance by being
knocked out in Madison Square Garden, and Vince got robbed when his
biggest fight was ruled a draw. By telling Cesar that Vince is the
better fighter but Cesar is a better lover, and informing Vince
that Cesar is superior in the ring but inferior to Vince in bed,
Grace supports them both.
</P>
<P>
   Tension builds after Cesar says he briefly experimented with gay
sex. That greatly bothers Vince, who has found Jesus. At the bell
the two come out for the patented movie slugfest. And the winner? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The fight is a gory one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Vince has explicit sex with a hitchhiker (Ms. Liu) in a gas
station storeroom. At the arena there is toplessness among the
women announcing the rounds, and there are graphic references to
gay sex acts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A stream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER 15 Not for them, of course, though the determined will
make it past the velvet ropes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP Is this a sports movie or a road movie? Some
teen-agers may feel talked to death during the ride to Las Vegas.
Either way, the film is a rough, tough one and gamier in the sexual
department than many.

   KOREAN-CERAMICS (New York) _ ``Korean ceramics from the Museum
of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka'' is not, as Yogi Berra might have
said, a case of deja vu all over again. More than 35 of the nearly
50 pieces in this serenely beautiful show were part of a larger
exhibition of ceramics from the same museum that traveled to
Chicago, San Francisco and the Met in 1992. But it scarcely
matters. The recidivists, like the first-timers, constitute the
masterworks of the Osaka museum's extensive Korean holdings. By
Roberta Smith.

   APPLES-MINNEAPOLIS (Minneapolis, Minn.) _ Snow paralyzes some
American cities and disheartens others. But Minneapolis and its
unidentical twin, St. Paul, cope with it. More than that; many
people here positively revel in it. Winter is their favorite
season. Our peripatetic correspondent R.W. Apple Jr. reports from

   BACH-ANNIVERSARY (Undated) _ The last Bach year wasn't so long
ago: 1985, to be exact, the 300th anniversary of the composer's
birth. And although Bach had to share the celebration with other
masters born in the fateful, fertile year 1685, Handel and
Scarlatti, he did not lack for attention. Now, in the calculus of
births and deaths, centenaries and quarter-millenniums, and points
in between, comes another Bach year: the 250th anniversary of the
composer's death. Not complaining, mind you. In addition to the
commercial aspects _ books, records and scores; concerts, recitals
and festivals _ and the odd bit of flimflammery, such
commemorations typically give a jolt to scholarship on the subject
as well as a boost in public awareness. By James Oestreich.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Snow paralyzes some American cities and
disheartens others. But Minneapolis and its unidentical twin, St.
Paul, cope with it. More than that; many people here revel in it.
Winter is their favorite season.
</P>
<P>
   Come here the morning after a blizzard, and main roads have
already been cleared. One time my wife, Betsey, and I, inured to
snow-induced civic inertia in Washington, watched dumbfounded as a
miniature street-sweeping machine brushed snow from downtown
sidewalks as soon as it fell.
</P>
<P>
   Take a ride out to Lake of the Isles, southwest of downtown
Minneapolis, on a crisp, cold Saturday, with the skies a pure,
cerulean blue and the snow heaped eye-high in front of wonderful
big Prairie Style houses by gifted acolytes of Frank Lloyd Wright
like George Washington Maher and George Grant Elmslie. Young men
and women play exuberant pick-up hockey on the frozen lake, like
figures in an Avercamp painting, while more sedate souls glide past
on cross-country skis. At times like that, ``Winter Wonderland'' is
more than a song title.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard polar winds blow, people here say ``You
betcha,'' just the way they did in the movie ``Fargo.'' They smile
and urge you to have a nice day, so earnestly that they convince
you they mean it. So sincerely that cynics call Minnesota ``the
Land of the Bland,'' a dubious epithet for a state with a
counterculture that gave the world Bob Dylan and an electorate that
chose Jesse Ventura, a bullet-bald former wrestler, as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans and Scandinavians who flocked here toward the end of
the 19th century were used to cold weather. The Vietnamese,
Mexicans and Somalis who came here toward the end of the 20th
century were not, but they quickly got the hang of it. And a good
thing, too: from December to March, there is an average of about 6
inches of snow on the ground; in January, midday temperatures often
struggle to reach the balmy double digits.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Twin Cities are so far north. Seattle and
Montreal, London and Berlin and even Paris are all nearer the
Arctic Circle than Minneapolis and St. Paul, but they're all
reasonably close to the sea. The Twin Cities lie hundreds of miles
from the Atlantic or Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by this newspaper's assertion in 1885 that Minnesota
was an American Siberia, a group of civic boosters founded the St.
Paul Winter Carnival, which has evolved over the years into a sort
of Arctic Mardi Gras. Every year, with unfailing regularity,
Vulcanus Rex, the king of fire, drives wintry King Boreas from his
throne, insuring the return of spring. Otherwise sane men and women
run in the world's frostiest half-marathon, and in some years an
ice palace weighing millions of pounds is constructed.
</P>
<P>
   The humorist Garrison Keillor, the pot-roast poet laureate,
whose weekly radio program, ``A Prairie Home Companion,''
originates most weeks from the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, once
said that ``true Minnesotans have a fondness for storm fronts, a
lack of fashion sense and a belief that there is moral worth in
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, The Wall Street Journal ran a piece about John
Glotzbach, one of a group of nutty Minnesota Vikings fans who
regularly watch the team's games not from seats inside the
relatively toasty Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome but on portable
television sets outside their cars in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got offered tickets, but I hate the dome,'' he said, with
all the righteous zeal of an ice fisherman. ``It's way too
corporate.''
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case, obviously. Less masochistic Twin Cities
residents keep frostbite at bay during their brutal winters by
spending a lot of time indoors. The world's first enclosed shopping
mall, Southdale, opened in Edina, a Minneapolis suburb, in 1956. It
was a smash hit, soon copied in other suburbs. Alarmed, downtown
merchants invented the Skywalk, a system of enclosed passages a
story above the street, linking buildings and making it possible to
reach shops, restaurants and offices without venturing outside. Now
100 buildings in Minneapolis and 65 in St. Paul are linked.
</P>
<P>
   Musical and Stage Riches
</P>
<P>
   For such relatively young cities _ Minneapolis was not
incorporated until after the Civil War _ these two have a
startlingly rich artistic tradition. Philanthropic families like
the Pillsburys, Cowleses and Daytons have helped build orchestras,
museums and theaters of national repute.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Orchestra (formerly the Minneapolis Symphony),
which will celebrate its 100th birthday in 2002-3, has been led by
conductors of the caliber of Eugene Ormandy, Dimitri Mitropoulos,
Antal Dorati and Neville Marriner. Its home is Orchestra Hall in
Minneapolis, whose superb acoustics are enhanced by a distinctive
``icefall'' of white cubes that runs across the ceiling and
cascades down the wall behind the players.
</P>
<P>
   Eiji Oue, the Hiroshima-born incumbent conductor, came here as a
complete unknown, on the recommendation of Seiji Ozawa, the music
director in Boston. Some critics praised his work, including
Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, who wrote in 1998 that Oue
seemed to be ``making good things happen.'' But he has never earned
the full confidence of the orchestra, and attendance has fallen
from 84 percent of capacity to 69 percent during his tenure. He
will leave in 2002, ``by mutual agreement,'' and the orchestra is
seeking a big name as his replacement at a time when big names are
scarce and at least a half-dozen orchestras in America, plus
several in Europe, are in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, the closest American counterpart
to such European groups as the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields,
is also losing its leader, Hugh Wolff. A successful successor to
Christopher Hogwood and Pinchas Zukerman, among others, he has been
the principal conductor in St. Paul since 1988 and the music
director there since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Music is served here in other ways as well _ by the Minnesota
Opera, a tireless promoter of new music, based at the Ordway Center
for the Performing Arts in St. Paul, which plans to move next year
from four productions annually to five; the Viennese Sommerfest,
founded by the conductor Leonard Slatkin; and Minnesota Public
Radio, long a national leader in classical-music programming.
</P>
<P>
   An Irish stage genius named Tyrone Guthrie, fresh from triumphs
at Stratford in Canada, gave the Twin Cities a theatrical showplace
in 1963, with an unconventional thrust stage like those of ancient
Greece and Elizabethan England. Under another Irishman, Joe
Dowling, the Guthrie company is enjoying its greatest successes
since the early days, with classics like Shaw's ``Misalliance,''
O'Neill's ``Ah, Wilderness!'' and O'Casey's ``Plough and the
Stars,'' plus modern fare like John Guare's new play, ``Lake
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   It wants to do more, and Minneapolis has just released a plot of
land downtown, previously reserved for a baseball stadium, for a
proposed new Guthrie Theater containing three auditoriums of
various sizes.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Art and Architectural Depth
</P>
<P>
   The Walker Art Center is one of the nation's foremost museums of
modern art, second only, in some people's thinking, to the Museum
of Modern Art. It rotates its collection constantly, to make space
for special shows, so many of its iconic pictures, like Franz
Marc's ``Large Blue Horses,'' are always in storage. But its
holdings of Jasper Johns and Donald Judd, Ellsworth Kelly and
Robert Rauschenberg are large, and a selection is always on view.
So is more contemporary stuff, like a 1997 sculpture by Charles
Ray, a life-size plastic cast of a wrecked Pontiac. Is it a comment
on the fragility of modern life or modern culture, or perhaps both?
</P>
<P>
   A large sculpture garden occupies most of a block across from
the museum, dominated by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje Van Bruggen's
hilarious giant teaspoon, topped with a brilliantly red cherry.
</P>
<P>
   A second major museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts,
aspires to mini-Metropolitan Museum of Art status, with collections
sampling all of world art history. After a 10-year restoration
ending in 1998, its collections have been reinstalled, with 4,000
objects now on view, as against 1,125 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Its strengths lie in German art between the wars (lots of Ernst
Ludwig Kirchner, a great Max Beckmann triptych, an extraordinary
Emil Nolde, all orange and blood-red); in Impressionism and
Post-Impressionism, including major van Goghs and Gaugins; in
Chinese jade, and in American decorative arts. A hall from one of
Wright's triumphs, the Francis W. Little house on Lake Minnetonka,
demolished a number of years ago, is on display here, along with
furniture by Wright, Maher and Elmslie. (Another part of the Little
house is in the Met.)
</P>
<P>
   The main museum building is a finely detailed Beaux Arts temple
by McKim, Mead &AMP; White, the Minneapolis counterpart of St. Paul's
great hilltop landmark, the state capitol by Cass Gilbert, a
hometown boy. With its refined marble dome and gilded quadriga by
Daniel Chester French, the capitol can hold its head high in the
company of Boston's and Richmond's.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Minneapolis, two of the most dramatic structures,
the IDS skyscraper by Philip Johnson and the Hennepin County
government center by John Carl Warnecke, have large glazed atriums
perfectly suited to the climate. The seven-story Crystal Court at
the IDS Center is particularly felicitous, a meeting place for the
city, with a ring of water dropping from the ceiling into a pool.
The opening of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' set in the Twin
Cities, was filmed there.
</P>
<P>
   Eliel Saarinen and his son, Eero, built a spare Lutheran church
in Minneapolis that might be in rural Finland. Marcel Breuer built
a much-praised, Corbusier-influenced concrete chapel at St. John's
College in nearby Collegeville. But neither dazzles quite as much
as Frank O. Gehry's shimmering Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum
(1993), at the University of Minnesota, a kind of dress rehearsal
for his Bilbao Guggenheim, which changes color with the changing
weather. Clad in brushed stainless steel, its lopsided cubes and
irregular cylinders tumble down the east bank of the Mississippi
like Duchamp's ``Nude Descending a Staircase'' in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Big Suburbs, New Ethnicity
</P>
<P>
   These are not river towns in the sense that St. Louis or Memphis
are, but the Mississippi, which rises in Lake Itasca, near Bemidji,
220 miles northwest of here, flows right through the middle of the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis is mostly but not wholly on the right bank, St. Paul
mostly but not wholly on the left. Which is a shame, because it
spoils the otherwise telling gibe of Trevor Fishlock, an English
journalist, who wrote after spending some time here that the Twin
Cities ``are divided by the Mississippi River and united by the
belief that the inhabitants of the other side of the river are
inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis is often called a small big city, St. Paul a big
small town. Once Minnesota consisted of the Twin Cities, the
prairies and not much else, but in recent years the suburbs have
taken over. Today Minneapolis and St. Paul have only about 500,000
people between them, yet there are roughly 3 million in the
metropolitan area, a seemingly uncontrollable sprawl that now ranks
15th in population among the nation's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Out there, due south of Minneapolis, stands the humongous Mall
of America, incorporating no fewer than 500 stores, 49 restaurants,
14 theaters and 12,000 employees, a walk-through aquarium and a
seven-story Ferris wheel. People fly to the Twin Cities from Europe
just to shop there.
</P>
<P>
   The old ethnic order has changed rapidly in the last
quarter-century. No longer is Minneapolis mostly Swedish and
Lutheran and St. Paul mostly German, Irish and Catholic. After the
Vietnam War, Minnesotans opened their arms to boat people and other
immigrants from Southeast Asia, notably the Laotian hill people
known as the Hmong. They poured into the cities, followed by
Latins, Africans and others. John W. Milton, an old college chum
who grew up in St. Paul, told me that children in the St. Paul
public school system came from households in which no fewer than 63
languages were spoken.
</P>
<P>
   By now, there are 60,000 members of the Hmong in the area. They
are passionate about education. Joua Xiong, a semiliterate
health-care attendant who grows vegetables for sale in a farmer's
market to make ends meet, has six children with university degrees.
One of them is working on a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Robber Barons' Legacy
</P>
<P>
   The old economic order has changed, too. The first great
fortunes hereabouts were made from flour, timber and railroads; you
can sense how big those fortunes were by visiting the enormous
Richardsonian Romanesque mansion of James J. Hill on Summit Avenue
in St. Paul. It has 18 bathrooms, 35 fireplaces, a pipe organ and a
two-story art gallery. When built in 1891, it was the largest house
in the Midwest. Hill, a notoriously obstreperous gent, came to St.
Paul when it was still named Pig's Eye and built the railroad that
linked the Twin Cities to the wheat fields and to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   West of Hill's pile, along a four-mile section of Summit Avenue,
his fellow robber barons built Belle Epoque piles of their own,
most of which have been diligently preserved. In the homely
brownstone at 599 Summit Ave., which he described as ``a house
below average on a street above average,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald, a
St. Paul native, spent the summer of 1919 finishing ``This Side of
Paradise,'' the novel about Princeton that made him famous.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A block south of Summit runs Grand Avenue, the capital of the
New Bohemia in the Upper Midwest _ young, hip, brainy, almost
Bostonian. At the corner of Grand and Victoria, you'll find the
nexus of the local cafe culture, chockablock with bookstores and
coffee houses. Cafe Latte, in an old Studebaker showroom, serves a
deservedly famous three-layer turtle cake, dripping chocolate,
caramel and pecans, indescribably rich, improbably light. Betsey
spent a half-hour trying to figure out how to get one home.
</P>
<P>
   Big business seems far away, but it isn't. The Twin Cities have
lost some headquarters lately; Norwest Bank bought Wells Fargo, but
its CEO and its main office moved to San Francisco, and the new
bank took the Wells Fargo name. Honeywell, an old Minneapolis firm,
has been sold to Allied Signal; the merged operation will be called
Honeywell but will move East.
</P>
<P>
   Still, plenty of big names remain, like Northwest Airlines, 3M
(Scotch Tape, Post-Its and $16 billion in annual sales) and the St.
Paul Companies (insurance). With Pillsbury, now a part of the
British conglomerate Diageo PLC, Cargill and General Mills
(Wheaties, Betty Crocker), Minneapolis remains the greatest
grain-milling center in the world. Dayton Hudson, which owns big
department stores here, in Chicago and in Detroit, is changing its
name to Target to reflect the national scope of its discount
stores. Innovators abound. The Radisson Hotel chain, once regional,
is now international. The Best Buy retail chain has made its
founder, Richard Schulze, a billionaire. Medtronic and St. Jude
have flourished in the realm of new medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzgerald cult has survived in the face of all these
changes, proving to be hardier than Fitzgerald himself. Keillor
campaigned successfully to have a restored St. Paul theater named
for him, and there the whimsical Minnesotan and his lively
co-conspirators tell tales about a Thanksgiving turkey that fell in
love with a dog, and reassure us, no matter how frazzled we may be,
that there is one place where ``the women are strong, the men are
good-looking and the children are all above average.''
</P>
<P>
   That place, of course, is Lake Wobegon, as important a part of
the Minnesota landscape as Lake Minnetonka near Minneapolis and
White Bear Lake near St. Paul. Upward of 2.6 million people listen
to the Wobegon news each week on 450 public stations across the
nation. But the Twin Cities are worldly, civilized places. They
resemble Lake Wobegon no more than they resemble another North
Country stereotype, Sinclair Lewis' ``Main Street,'' based on his
proverbially provincial hometown, Sauk Center, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvest of Politicians
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Twin Cities sent politicians on to prominent
roles on the national stage. Every four years from 1948 through
1984, with only a few exceptions, a Minnesotan sought the
presidency or vice presidency _ Harold Stassen, a serious contender
before he became a standing joke; Hubert H. Humphrey, Eugene J.
McCarthy, Walter F. Mondale. Several others, like Orville Freeman
and Donald Fraser, played significant supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, a garrulous, big-hearted electoral warrior, made his
national debut at the 1948 Democratic convention. As ``the boy
mayor of Minneapolis,'' he fought the South, exhorting his fellow
delegates to step ``out of the shadow of states' rights and into
the bright sunshine of human rights.'' Two decades later, Humphrey
came agonizingly close to the White House, even though he found
himself, as Lyndon B. Johnson's vice president, saddled with
support for the hugely unpopular Vietnam War. Not until late on the
morning after Election Day 1968 did he finally, tearfully concede
defeat to Richard M. Nixon in the ballroom of the old Leamington
Hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful political culture,'' Mondale said over
dinner one night recently. ``Clean, progressive, tolerant.
Minnesota had a magnificent moderation then.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, that is gone. Neither of the not terribly prominent
current senators, Rod Grams, a Republican, and Paul Wellstone, a
Democrat, fits the old mold. Each resides on the ideological edge
of his party. Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal pressure
group, gives Wellstone a perfect score of 100 and Grams a zero.
Humphrey's son, Hubert Horatio Humphrey III, called Skip, ran for
the Senate in 1988 and for governor in 1998, but despite a good
record as state attorney general, his feet never quite reached the
stirrups.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant Centrist
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Jesse Ventura, elected governor on the
third-party Reform ticket in 1998, who is still a highly popular
figure in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As a wrestler, under the nom de guerre Jesse the Body, he wore a
feathered boa, and he has lost none of his flamboyance. But beneath
it all, he is a centrist, not an extremist, who won in part because
the voters were tired of far-out politics. A political libertarian
on cultural issues, who stands firmly against gay-bashing, Ventura
is also a fiscal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style may be fire-engine red,'' Professor Steven Schier of
Carleton College observed not long ago, ``but his politics are
beige.''

   IF YOU GO

<P>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions in Minneapolis and St. Paul, ,
along with travel information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   NICOLLET ISLAND INN, 95 Merriam St., Minneapolis, (612)
331-1800. Built as a sash-and-door factory in 1893, this modest,
three-story hotel sits in mid-Mississippi, just upriver from the
stone arch bridge constructed by James J. Hill to carry his
railroad west. Antiques in the lobby and guest rooms give the place
a rural feel, and an agreeable restaurant with sweeping river views
occupies the glassed-in former loading dock. Room rate: $125 to
$160.
</P>
<P>
   HYATT WHITNEY, 150 Portland Ave., Minneapolis, (612) 339-9300.
An atypical Hyatt, installed in a cleverly converted flour mill,
the Whitney offers 96 rooms, slightly spartan in mood. The best are
duplexes, with sitting rooms linked to sleeping rooms by spiral
staircases, facing the Mississippi at the spot where Minneapolis
began. A red sign across the way _ ``Pillsbury's Best Flour'' _
recalls the city's economic roots. Room rate: $185 to $210 week
nights; $99 to $210 weekends; $25 to $35 more for duplexes.
</P>
<P>
   MARQUETTE HOTEL, 710 Marquette Ave., Minneapolis, (612)
333-4545. Built into the IDS skyscraper, and now managed by the
Hilton chain, the Marquette has a prime location, with connections
to the Skywalk system. In a city of mammoth hotels, it is
manageable in size and individual in character. The oversize rooms
on the upper floors have steam baths and attractive views over the
city, but there is no valet parking and the staff can be dim. Room
rate: $240 week nights; $119 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ST. PAUL HOTEL, 350 Market St., St. Paul, (651) 292-9292. If
business or pleasure takes you to the smaller of the Twin Cities,
make a beeline for the St. Paul, the region's best hotel. Built in
1910 and brought up to date 75 years later, blessed with a good
concierge, furnished with a lavish hand (Oriental carpets,
exuberant flower displays), it has an ideally central site. The
hotel's grill is St. Paul's finest restaurant. Room rate: $180 week
nights; $125 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   AQUAVIT, 75 S. Seventh St., Minneapolis, (612) 343-3333. A
branch of New York's top Scandinavian restaurant in America's top
Scandinavian city seems like a no-brainer. But instead of mailing
it in, Marcus Samuelsson, the chef at both places, brings witty,
sometimes wacky ideas to the Twin Cities, aided by a bigger
kitchen: smoked salmon and mango foam wrapped in newspaper (fish
with no chips?); lobster wrapped in tuna and gravlax, bathed in a
spicy tomato broth.
</P>
<P>
   D'AMICO CUCINA, 100 N. Sixth St., Minneapolis, (612) 338-2401.
In his two years at the helm of this urbane, understated
establishment, J.P. Samuelson, who worked for David Bouley in New
York, has developed a vivid style. A smoked trout salad with
horseradish creme fraiche and lots of flat-leaf parsley explodes
with flavor, as does crisp flatbread with prosciutto, gorgonzola
and rhododendron honey. The all-Italian wine list is a revelation,
packed with Barolos from the 1970s and '80s, from Aldo Coterno et
al. Except for the snowdrifts outside in wintertime, you could be
in Piemonte.
</P>
<P>
   LA BELLE VIE, 312 S. Main St., Stillwater, (651) 430-3545. After
a long stint at D'Amico Cucina, Tim McKee opened this bistro in a
picture-book village on the St. Croix River. Spanish, Moroccan and
Portuguese influences, as well as French and Italian ideas, are
evident in his brightly seasoned, deeply flavored dishes and on the
imaginative wine list. Harissa, mojo verde and Serrano ham on the
American steppes? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   GOODFELLOWS, 40 S. Seventh St., Minneapolis, (612) 332-4800.
Newly installed in a magnificent Art Deco space that once housed a
cafeteria, with black glass and silvery grillwork, this longtime
local favorite features regional products like walleyed pike and
pheasant. The cellar holds dozens of superb American wines at
sensible prices. Unhappily, the kitchen sometimes resorts to empty
Asian flourishes in pursuit of culinary fashion, and the service is
often klutzy.
</P>
<P>
   LUCIA'S, 1432 31st Street West, Minneapolis, (612) 825-1572. A
double storefront, with uncovered floors and plain tables, this is
a Twin Cities Cafe Chez Panisse, with short weekly menus and a
commitment to ``locally grown, organic and naturally raised
ingredients.'' Killer eggs Benedict with perfectly timed yolks for
weekend brunch, on smoked pork tenderloin.
</P>
<P>
   QUANG, 2719 Nicollet Ave., Minneapolis, (612) 870-4739. Take it
from someone who learned the hard way, this is real Vietnamese
food: a long list of soups, including several kinds of pho;
caramelized shrimp and onions on rice, and the best cha gio (spring
rolls) I have eaten _ greaseless, crisp and flavorful. Bright,
clean and always packed, Quang may be the best of the small Asian
and Latin eateries, spawned by Twin Cities ethnicization, that
stand shoulder-to-shoulder along Nicollet Avenue, ``Eat Street.''
</P>
<P>

   Germans are learning that the political machine of former
chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party was lubricated
with a hidden flow of illegal funds. For Germany, as for its
allies, the scandal over Kohl's slush fund should serve as a
political allegory.
</P>
<P>
   There is first of all the familiar spectacle of a politician who
accomplishes great feats for his people but succumbs to the
attrition of power.
</P>
<P>
   With Kohl, as with lesser political figures in town halls and
chancelleries around the world, too long a turn in office induced a
common syndrome. The symptoms include an addiction to one's
position, a belief that one must do whatever it takes to remain on
top, and finally the fatal decision to break the rules so a
sovereign people will not be deprived of their indispensable
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The rules Kohl has admitted breaking were the heart and soul of
a democratic polity. He sold influence, or the illusion of
influence, for money _ reputedly to a shady arms dealer, among
others _ and then used that money to buy loyalty. Having an
unreported slush fund at his disposal enabled him to ensure that
restive members of his Christian Democratic Party would not even
think about replacing him as their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's covert peddling and purchasing of influence violated the
principle of transparency that distinguishes representative
governments from those in China, Syria, or Sudan. The moment an
elected leader takes secret funds from undisclosed donors, he
ceases to be the leader chosen by voters or party members. If he is
for sale, he belongs to any buyer who pays his price, not to the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a certain pathos when a statesman capitulates to
the temptation of corruption, but the case of Kohl is more pathetic
than usual because he earned a place in history as the chancellor
who peacefully retrieved East Germany into a single democratic
German state and integrated that state into a stable, harmonious
Europe. But money, which has no conscience, can erode even the
finest of democratic reputations.

A MUTING OF MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ink is barely dry on the largest merger agreement in US
history and already one of the partners _ Time Warner _ is planning
another one. Its $20 billion marriage with Britain's EMI, a music
publishing company representing top acts from the Rolling Stones to
the Spice Girls, has serious implications for art as well as
business.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the music industry _ as in filmmaking,
publishing, and other fields _ is accelerating. Such conglomeration
is not always to the benefit of the music itself, since it tends to
favor blockbuster acts over less mainstream efforts. Musicians
without corporate patronage don't get distribution or marketing
support. Independent record labels that used to sign edgier,
unknown artists were long ago swallowed up by the giants.
</P>
<P>
   But trends in the music industry are also pulling for the
noncommercial artist. It is now so cheap to produce a CD _ often
less than $2,000 _ that musicians don't need established labels.
And computer advances like MP3 _ a technology for downloading music
over the Internet _ gives less well-known artists who post their
music on the Web exposure to huge new audiences. Soon they will no
longer need to produce a physical CD at all.
</P>
<P>
   The established powers are trying to enter the digital music
market but don't want to share. This week the Recording Industry
Association of America, on behalf of Time-Warner, EMI, and others,
sued MP3.com for copyright violations. A new service MP3 began
offering this month allows customers to copy and store music on
their own CDs for later downloading into customized discs. The big
labels claim that MP3.com has no right to copy the work of artists
they represent, even on behalf of consumers. They are seeking
hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, which seems designed to
put MP3.com out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The giants may have a legal point. But lawsuits cannot be
allowed to stifle every innovation on the Web, especially when it
holds such promise for nurturing creativity. As Paul Simon wrote
long before MP3: ``The music suffers, baby, the music business
thrives.''

(Washington) _ In his State of the Union address, President Clinton
calls for a doubling of federal spending on after-school programs

ambitious plan is likely to encounter resistance in a
Republican-controlled Congress that wants less federal involvement
in education, not more. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   CLINTON-SPEECH (Washington) _ What a difference a year makes.

treatment of the island's 9,000 residents. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

   Desperate to reverse his political slide, Bradley suddenly
dropped his mask of statesmanship in the New Hampshire debate,

demonstrates how disproportionately important opposition to
abortion and the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized
it in 1973 have become to Republicans. In their debate the other
evening, the five Republican presidential hopefuls discussed issues
that one would require the attention of the leader of the world's
most powerful nation: taxes, trade, national defense, health care,
education, immigration, campaign finance reform and how to allocate
the budget surplus. But no issue generated more heat or triggered
more passionate declarations than abortion. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   `Pretty Woman,' Then and Now &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the director Garry Marshall remembers it, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
the Dreamworks executive who was then at Disney, called him with an
idea for a movie about a hooker who falls for a mogul. ``He said,
`I have this piece that's a little too dark for us, but maybe you
can give it a different twist,''' Marshall recalled this week.
</P>
<P>
   As a reference point, they used ``Mona Lisa,'' Neil Jordan's
fine, dark film about a call girl. ``He said, `If `Mona Lisa' is a
2 and `My Fair Lady' is a 10, give me a 7 or an 8,''' Marshall
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The result, of course, was ``Pretty Woman,'' directed by
Marshall and starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, to be
released on Tuesday on a 10th-anniversary DVD from Touchstone.
Together with ``Runaway Bride,'' also directed by Marshall and
issued this Tuesday on tape and disc by Paramount, that makes two
Roberts-Gere video vehicles in one week.
</P>
<P>
   The ending in ``Runaway Bride'' isn't any unhappier. ``I've
spent my career being put down for happy endings,'' Marshall said,
``but that's all right; that's my specialty.'' No one is blaming
him for ``Pretty Woman,'' which stands as something of a landmark.
``Back then the general opinion was that no romantic comedy could
make it internationally because they only wanted action,'' Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then audiences saw Ms. Roberts. She had appeared in ``Steel
Magnolias'' a year earlier. ``Wonderful, but crying mostly,''
Marshall said. How funny was she? ``I tested her, but I couldn't
find her unique humor. So I said, `Julia, I'm going to bring in an
actor who is much, much funnier than you are. He's going to
improvise, so try to stay with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor was Charles Grodin, who didn't get the Gere part but
did reach Ms. Roberts. ``Suddenly she had that championship spirit
that has carried her for 10 years,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Pretty Woman'' disc he adds many asides during a
director's commentary. The Gere character, Edward Lewis, is
``businessman rich,'' he says. ``That's all the audience needs to
know.'' But he felt it imperative to make clear that Vivian Ward
(Ms. Roberts), already a streetwalker in a film that would have
enormous appeal with teen-agers and pre-teen-agers, was not a drug
user.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that goal, he had Edward confront Vivian clutching
something in the bathroom. It turns out to be not drugs but dental
floss.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Bronx, Marshall speaks in a classic New York
accent. In New York, he says on the disc, people steal your
equipment. In Los Angeles, where the film was shot, everybody wants
to be in the movies, so you say ``action'' in a whisper. He has a
bit part in ``Pretty Woman,'' sweeping the sidewalk in front of the
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later it was entirely different working with Ms.
Roberts and Gere on ``Runaway Bride.'' Both actors gave it their
all, but this time they had cell phones. ``People trying to get on
the set, shooting with long lenses from faraway rooftops,''
Marshall said. ``What happens with big stars is that they bring
along other agendas,'' he said. That can't be helped. ``I don't let
lawyers and agents on the set,'' he said. ``That's why they're on
the cell phones.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freed by computer-generated motion, a lithe apeman flows through
the treetops. After his parents are wiped out by a rogue leopard,
the baby is taken in by the gentle ape Kala (voice of Glenn Close)
over the objections of the leader of the pack, Kerchak (Lance
Henriksen), who shuns the boy as not one of their kind.
</P>
<P>
   Years later Tarzan has his accustomed confrontation with the
animal collector Clayton (Brian Blessed) and communion with Jane
(Minnie Driver). While this is familiar territory, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, ``the exultant agility of its jungle
scenes makes it clear that an animated version of this story really
is something new.'' &QL;

   The Winslow Boy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the rain in his naval academy uniform, 13-year-old
Ronnie Winslow (Guy Edwards) clutches a letter from the British
admiralty expelling him from school for stealing a five-shilling
postal order. His father, Arthur (Nigel Hawthorne), wants to know
one thing from his son: is the accusation true?
</P>
<P>
   Delivered with an unblinking eye, Ronnie's denial sets off a
protracted defense that consumes Arthur and Ronnie's sister
(Rebecca Pidgeon) and drives the British government to distraction.
With no embellishment, David Mamet's film, based on Terence
Rattigan's play, ``pares the play down to its essentials, arriving

   But let Elvis' temperature go above 50 degrees and it will kill

DiCaprio in a scene from ``The Beach'' and Winona Ryder in a scene

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Talk to movie stars, especially these days, and you'll notice
one theme that keeps coming up.
 &HT;    No matter which multimillionaire actor you talk with, you can
count on hearing about the terrible toll of fame, the plague of the
ever-bolder media and the pressure of never being able to simply
disappear into the crowd.
 &HT;    In short, they're saying that, having achieved what they dreamed
of from childhood _ as did many others who never realized those
dreams _ they still aren't satisfied.
 &HT;    Promoting her movie ``Girl, Interrupted,'' Winona Ryder talks
about the pressures that sent her into a mental hospital in her
late teens. Gwyneth Paltrow complains that winning an Oscar for
``Shakespeare in Love'' (l999) left her a virtual prisoner in her
own home, hiding from a swarming horde of ruthless paparazzi.
 &HT;    Such complaints are nothing new, of course, and it's not always
mere attitude _ fame can be debilitating: Drew Barrymore was an
alcoholic at 10 and a drug addict at 12. Charlie Sheen, another
prominent second-generation star, has had recurring drug problems.
In November Matthew McConaughey was arrested after police in
Austin, Texas, found the handsome actor naked in his living room,
banging on bongo drums and surrounded by drug paraphernalia.
 &HT;    Fame can also have practical drawbacks for actors. After all,
their job is to observe human behavior, and that's difficult to do
when the whole world seems to be observing you. Add in a paparazzi
corps which, these days, often acts little better than a gang of
criminals, and it's understandable if actors sometimes have second
thoughts about stardom.
 &HT;    But as a rule it's hard to sympathize with people who, after
devoting their lives to chasing fame and riches, start complaining
as soon as they succeed _ especially since they're usually quite
happy to manipulate the publicity machine when it suits them,
jumping restaurant lines and copping free invitations to the
hottest sports events and social affairs.
 &HT;    The latest star singing the fame blues is Leonardo DiCaprio, who
has pocketed $20 million for his role in ``The Beach,'' which will
open Feb. 11.
 &HT;    DiCaprio's life was, of course, turned upside down by his
success as the romantic artist Jack Dawson in ``Titanic'' (l997).
He became the darling of the teen crowd, whose fanatic devotion
made the movie the all-time box-office king of the world.
 &HT;    Wearing a wispy goatee beard and looking anything but the hunk
his worshippers consider him, DiCaprio is casually dressed in a
baggy T-shirt, blue jeans and sandals as he meets the media at the
Ritz Carlton Hotel on the Hawaiian island of Maui. His look is
almost a rebuttal to the idea of Hollywood glamour, which he admits
he finds overwhelming.
 &HT;    ``I wish someone had written a book about what to do to
survive,'' he says. ``It's a monster you have no control over. They
advised me to become a hermit and stay out of sight _ but I
thought, why do that? So I became a party animal.
 &HT;    ``As a result,'' he adds with a crooked smile, ``there were some
pretty weird stories being published.''
 &HT;    Those kinds of stories are rarely written about stars who choose
not to live their private lives in public, of course. Paul Newman
and Robert Redford, for example, have managed to be big stars while
still keeping their private lives more or less out of the public
eye for decades.
 &HT;    But once you've become tabloid catnip, it's difficult to go back
to being just a working actor. And as the papers scramble to top
their last stories, the reports tend to get more and more lurid.
 &HT;    During the Thailand shoot of ``The Beach,'' for example, there
were stories that DiCaprio had been attacked by sharks. He was also
said to have become obsessively fearful of being poisoned, to the
extent of hiring food-tasters. Furthermore, the tabloids reported,
he'd impregnated his leading lady, French actress Virginie LeDoyen.
 &HT;    ``All rubbish,'' DiCaprio says. ``I think it's sad that they
have to make up that stuff.''
 &HT;    His main buffer between himself and the madness, DiCaprio says,
is his family. His parents divorced when he was a child, but both
remain his closest advisers.
 &HT;    ``Leonardo is not the kind of actor who comes with a huge
professional entourage,'' notes Danny Boyle, director of ``The
Beach.'' ``And he's not someone who asks for huge perks. The only
perk he has in his contract is that he gets extra money to fly in
his friends and family to wherever he happens to be on location.''
 &HT;    But they can't be with him all the time, and it's when he's out
on his own that the bizarre realities of celebrity hit home, the
actor says.
 &HT;    ``I was at an airport and this young girl ran to me, threw
herself on the floor and attached herself to my leg,'' DiCaprio
recalls. ``And she refused to let go. I looked down at her and just
wanted to say, `I'm just an ordinary guy,' but I could see in her
eyes she wouldn't believe it anyway. It got crazy.
 &HT;    ``I've seen `Titanic' four or five times,'' he adds, ``but I'm
told some young women have seen it 100 times or more. That's sad,
because there's so many other good movies out there.''
 &HT;    Many stars blame the tabloid press, and especially its
photographers, for their increasing problems. Alec Baldwin even
came to blows with one paparazzo, who was trying to photograph the
actor and his wife, Kim Basinger, as they arrived home from the
hospital with their new baby.
 &HT;    Paltrow learned firsthand how uncivilized the paparazzi could be
when, one day, she was out driving and ran out of gas.
 &HT;    ``There are pictures of me walking down the street with a gas
can, looking for the nearest service station,'' she says. ``No one
had the decency to give me a ride. They just wanted those demeaning
pictures.''
 &HT;    Ryder is 28, and unlike DiCaprio or Paltrow has been under the
spotlight for virtually her entire life.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in front of everybody,'' she says. ``I went through
puberty on film and even had my first period, literally, on film.''
 &HT;    At the same time, Ryder understands that the public is often
impatient with the constant ``poor me'' refrain from celebrities.
 &HT;    ``We're sickeningly well paid,'' she admits. ``We get these
amazing bonuses and lead these very charmed lives. But along with
it there's demons the public doesn't see.''
 &HT;    Like Ryder, DiCaprio admits that he enjoys the up side of his
fame.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to sound bitter,'' he says, ``because my
celebrity has given me a world of opportunities that others can
only dream of.''
 &HT;    Instead of complaining, he hopes to cool the media heat by
playing fewer romantic leads, re-establishing himself as one of his
generation's best actors, not simply a teen stud. His quirky role
in ``The Beach'' plays into that plan.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to play another doomed romantic,'' he says.
``I'd gone from `Romeo and Juliet' (l996) to `Titanic,' and was
looking for a harder-edged character, one that wouldn't be so easy
for an audience to identify with.''
 &HT;    The only real escape he has, DiCaprio adds, is in the anonymity
of the highway.
 &HT;    ``It's getting into my car and just driving around
anonymously,'' he says. ``Sometimes I have to get a friend to whisk
me away secretly to where I've parked my Lexus _ and then I hit the
open road.''

`STELLA DOES TRICKS': BLEAK, PERCEPTIVE AND CONVINCINGLY ACTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stella McGuire is a nice-looking, reasonably bright and
occasionally mischievous teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Her problem is that she is a prostitute with a past of childhood
sexual abuse by her widowed father in Glasgow and a present in
thrall to Mr. Peters, a polished middle-aged pimp in London who
looks as if he might be running a major corporation instead of a
string of adolescent whores.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because Stella, despite her haunting psychological
wounds, shows some spirit and gives evidence of an inner life that
lies beyond the reach of Mr. Peters, she is his favorite. He turns
to her for sexual relief at their outdoor meetings. Giving her
extra money, he fancies himself her generous benefactor. But fully
aware of his power and her damaged psyche, he takes offense at the
possibility that Stella might actually seek to break away from her
demeaning, perhaps deadly, life.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility lends poignancy and suspense to ``Stella Does
Tricks,'' Coky Giedroyc's bleak, perceptive portrait of the
prostitute as a young girl torn between a need for genuine love and
a career of sexual exploitation. Knowing that it can lead only to
ruin, she possesses the intelligence to realize what she should do.
The question is whether she possesses the psychological strength to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   Written by the novelist A.L. Kennedy, ``Stella Does Tricks,''
which opens Friday at the Screening Room, is convincingly acted by
a cast that includes Kelly Macdonald of ``Trainspotting'' and
``Elizabeth'' as Stella; James Bolam as the smooth, evil Mr.
Peters; Ewan Stewart as Stella's father, McGuire; and Hans Matheson
as Eddie, the weak young drug addict with whom she hopes to make a
fresh start when she leaves Mr. Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the other young prostitutes kept by Mr. Peters
in a shabby bed-and-breakfast hotel seem resigned to their fate, a
streak of anger and yearning remains alive in Stella, seen in
flashbacks as a happy little girl whose childhood is corrupted by
her father, a talentless stand-up comic who enchants her with his
dreams of fame and fortune in London.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Stella's rage erupts in acts of vandalism as
she scratches the finish of cars, rips off their aerials and
mirrors, and kicks in their headlights. One night, after one of her
colleagues has been assaulted by a bunch of punks, Stella enlists
Eddie in finding the car of the ringleader and dropping a match in
its gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   The assault convinces her that she should try to make a new
life, but not before the fatherly Mr. Peters, who is not above
meaningful torture, sends three brutes to the hotel to make an
example of her for the other prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   And after Stella, accompanied by Eddie, pays a visit to her
unsuspecting father in a Glasgow club to wreak vengeance on him,
she sets out to better herself by working at a flower stand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world Stella inhabits, the dream of love still comes
at a price.

`BELFAST, MAINE': A SMALL TOWN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review. Film is being screened in
New York this week and will air on PBS next week) 
(bl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To call ``Belfast, Maine,'' Frederick Wiseman's spellbinding
documentary portrait of a small New England coastal town, a
romantic movie might be overstating the mood evoked by this stately
four-hour film, which bursts with glowing images of fall foliage,
autumn sunsets and Halloween decorations. Yet when you come away
from the movie (the director's 30th), which Friday opens the Film
Society of Lincoln Center's monthlong survey of Wiseman's career
and is to be shown on PBS next Friday, there is no escaping a sense
that in many ways that Belfast represents his passionately elegiac
vision of an American community that works.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there is anything especially glamorous about this
blue-collar town of 6,000, beyond its picture-postcard landscape
and streets lined with handsome clapboard houses. Although the
movie has one scene of a high-school class and another of youthful
skateboarders, most of the lives it examines are middle-aged and
beyond. While some are obviously better off than others, there are
no glaring class differences. The closest thing to a mansion on the
hill is the large credit card company that is the town's chief
employer.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit that the film pays to that company's offices,
where we observe clerks doing telemarketing from their immaculate
cubicles, is surprisingly brief. For what ``Belfast, Maine'' really
wants to do is capture a deeper, more timeless sense of the town as
a hardy organism more closely tied to nature than many other more
affluent American communities.
</P>
<P>
   Its flourishing credit card company notwithstanding, what seems
to hold Belfast together is more spiritual than economic and has to
do with the town's austere 1940s and '50s-like culture, economy and
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place whose churchgoing citizens feel a responsibility
to care for their own and a town conscious of its history. (In one
scene a lecturer remembers Belfast's contribution to the Civil
War.) And by cherishing its past, the film implies, Belfast is able
in many ways to live in the past. One local minister warns his
congregation that we live in ``a broken world''; but while there is
plenty of suffering in Belfast, the part that is truly broken seems
kept at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Wiseman's other films, the movie is suffused with a
compassion that sees everyone in the camera's view as an equally
worthy subject. At the same time the movie, which has no narrator
and doesn't formally introduce anybody, maintains an aura of
scientific detachment.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``Belfast, Maine,'' like other Wiseman films, also
conveys the sometimes slightly unnerving vision of the human
anthill put under a magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   From Wiseman's earliest film, ``Titicut Follies'' (1967), a
harsh investigation of a prison for the criminally insane in
Massachusetts, he has always been fascinated by institutions as
microcosms of that anthill. His films have included two studies of
high schools and two of hospitals, as well as portraits of an urban
police department, a juvenile court, a Chicago housing development
and the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on an entire community instead of one element of the
system, ``Belfast, Maine'' finds the director integrating aspects
of his earlier movies into a fuller vision of how everything works
together. His choices of which cogs in the social system to
emphasize are extremely revealing. The two activities to which the
film devotes the most time are people working in factories, stores
and restaurants, and social services for the sick and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of fish and potatoes being harvested and processed
and of fresh baked goods being prepared have a hypnotic
fascination. There's something deeply reassuring in watching how a
food product is made from scratch by silent, dedicated workers
patiently executing their mechanical tasks in hygienic settings.
(The speed with which women slice off the heads and tails of
sardines to be packed in cans is remarkable.)
</P>
<P>
   Their patience is mirrored by the forbearance of the social and
welfare workers calmly questioning clients about their health,
medication, living habits and states of mind. One of the film's
most vivid characters is a mentally disturbed, physically ailing
man, addicted to tobacco and dependent on welfare, who lives in a
metal trailer and can barely lift himself out of his chair to be
weighed. Yet in his own way he seems to be flourishing. For in
addition to meeting his basic needs, his scrupulous care provides
him with feelings of self-worth and social inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belfast, Maine,'' for all its pastoral beauty, is no seaside
idyll. The statistics spouted about smoking and obesity in the area
are alarming; many of the people on whom the film focuses are
suffering physically and emotionally. The movie repeatedly reminds
us how hard life really is. Those attuned to more sophisticated
styles will also find Belfast plain and even downright boring.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Belfast doesn't have an intellectual
life. In the film's most moving scene a high-school teacher
discoursing on ``Moby-Dick'' to his enthralled students speaks
eloquently about 19th-century whaling, Herman Melville's troubled
life, the working class and the tragic hero in literature. It is a
startling bravura performance that captures a quality of faith, a
spark of passion, that is inherent in all of Wiseman's mature
films, even the most hard-bitten ones.
</P>
<P>
   Handsomely photographed by John Dewey, with every shot of the
landscape a beautifully balanced composition, ``Belfast, Maine,''
which is not rated, conveys a deeply emotional sense of place,
season and time of day. In contrasting the breathtaking landscape
with the troubled lives of many of those living there, it reminds
us that the fleeting beauties of the natural world _ the simple
pleasures available to all _ are among life's deepest consolations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ With the New Hampshire primary only days
away and
</P>
<P>
   California about to become every candidate's prom date, a new
poll shows Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
remain the favorites among California voters.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco Examiner/KTVU poll of 806 registered voters
found Gore capturing 29 percent of those surveyed, including 54
percent of the Democratic vote in the statewide poll while Bush
captured 26 percent of those surveyed, including about 49 percent
of GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   Well behind them are former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley and
Republican Sen. John McCain. Both candidates received 12 percent of
the voters surveyed, about the same level of support in previous
polls. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a shot at winning California Bradley and McCain
will have to focus on the state's independent voters who will be
able to vote for the first time in the state's new ``open'' primary
on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But, only votes from registered Republicans will count in
selecting GOP delegates and only votes from registered Democrats
count in selecting Democratic delegates for the national
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you break it down, there is not much of a race right
now,'' said Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md., which
conducted the Examiner/KTVU poll between last Friday and Monday.
``Those numbers could change, however, depending on what happens in
New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Bradley and McCain need big wins Tuesday in New
Hampshire to gain momentum for California on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley _ who has a much more significant campaign operation in
California than McCain _ was damaged in Monday's Iowa caucus votes.
He spent an estimated $2 million in Iowa, but lost to Gore 63
percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faces other difficulties in California as well. He's
been running on the anti-establishment platform, continually
telling voters that if they prefer the status quo, then they
shouldn't vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Californians have resoundingly said they
like the status quo. With the economy roaring, voters in the 1998
gubernatorial race picked a middle-of-the-road candidate who looked
a lot like former GOP Gov. Pete Wilson: Gray Davis, a centrist
Democrat and Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, California voters like Clinton much better than do voters
in other states. The poll found continued high approval rates for
the president. When asked to rate Clinton, 58 percent said he was
doing a good or excellent job. Thirty-two percent said he was doing
a fair job and 10 percent rated his job performance as poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's support (in Iowa came) significantly from Democrats
who do not like Bill Clinton personally and do not approve of
him,`` said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the School
of Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate University.
``California has been very supportive of the president over time.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bebitch Jeffe said, McCain faces even larger obstacles
capturing the Golden State, in part because he doesn't have the
money or the campaign operation that Bradley does in California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain currently leads Bush in most polls in New Hampshire,
though the Bush camp is counting on momentum from their first-place
finish in the Iowa caucuses. McCain needs a victory in New
Hampshire to mount a challenge in California to Bush, who is much
better funded, said Jack Pitney, an associate professor of
government at Claremont-McKenna College.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's early edge in polls, analysts still see a chance
for Bradley here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be premature to declare a Bradley defeat in
California,''
</P>
<P>
   said Tim Hodson, professor and director of the Center for
California
</P>
<P>
   Studies at Cal State Sacramento. ``If he does better than
expected in New
</P>
<P>
   Hampshire, he could hit California as the comeback kid, as the
center of
</P>
<P>
   media attention. He could attempt to parlay his image as the
outsider, the
</P>
<P>
   one impatient with conventional politics into a major message.''
</P>
<P>
   But that same attitude could help McCain especially if he picks
up a win New Hampshire and does well in South Carolina and his home
state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians again could look at McCain as being different,
unconventional, not afraid to break with the past,'' Hodson said.

SPOTLIGHT ON A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELBY LYNNE: ``I Am Shelby Lynne'' (Mercury). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Lynne's sixth album is the latest installment of Life
After Nashville, an ever-growing story with contributions by Willie
Nelson and Steve Earle, among others.
</P>
<P>
   A special, urgent quality _ mordant but free _ emanates from
albums made shortly after artists have cut themselves away from the
songwriting, producing and marketing practices of the country music
capital, and this is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynne, whose first five albums failed to sell her to a
mainstream country audience, is from Alabama and sounds like it;
for country credibility, there's a song recalling a water parade
near her hometown. But for her wider frame of reference _ the
reason she left Nashville _ there's the rest of this
not-really-country record, indebted to sources as disparate as
Dusty Springfield, Phil Spector and Doug Sahm.
</P>
<P>
   There's a trombone solo oddly stuck in the middle of a shambling
country-rock tune; lush string orchestrations, Floyd Cramer piano
chords and steel guitars, the ghosts of her Nashville past, are
matched with self-consciously low-tech rhythm machines. (The record
is produced by Bill Bottrell, whose mixes and production _ just
different enough from the roots-rock norm to lodge in one's brain _
enlivened Sheryl Crow's album ``Tuesday Night Music Club.'')
</P>
<P>
   Her stout but resigned voice lingers over lyrics that are almost
gothically depressing, often about ended relationships or the
constitutional impossibility of having one at all. (She's got a
voice that used to be described as tragic.)
</P>
<P>
   But musically, the record changes instrumentation and character
so many times that its sadness doesn't become overwhelming; it's
cranky, but shrewd and original.

evening, the five Republican presidential hopefuls discussed issues
that one would require the attention of the leader of the world's
most powerful nation: taxes, trade, national defense, health care,
education, immigration, campaign finance reform and how to allocate
the budget surplus. But no issue generated more heat or triggered
more passionate declarations than abortion. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

`NOT LOVE, JUST FRENZY': A DARK FARCE FROM SPAIN: ALMODOVAR? NOT
THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``Not Love, Just Frenzy'' were a Renaissance painting, it
might be attributed to the school of Almodovar. It hardly takes a
connoisseur to recognize the hallmarks of the master's style: drag
queens, crowded Madrid discos, an atmosphere of exuberant
polymorphous perversity and a plot that scrambles together elements
of farce, melodrama and film noir.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas Pedro Almodovar at his best composes gaudy, vibrant
tableaux that hold silliness, cruelty and earnest emotion in
perfect balance, his epigones Alfonso Albacete, Miguel Bardem and
David Menkes, who share writing and directing credits for ``Not
Love, Just Frenzy,'' have made a movie that, perhaps unwittingly,
lives up to its title.
</P>
<P>
   All the elements are in place, the colors have been studiously
applied, but the result is too neat and too sloppy, as though
painted by numbers with an unpracticed hand.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which came out in Spain in 1996, has no doubt been
released in this country to capitalize on the success of
Almodovar's recent masterpiece, ``All About My Mother.'' Lacking
that movie's mature dignity and stylistic assurance, ``Not Love,
Just Frenzy'' instead recalls lesser, messier incarnations of
Almodovarismo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie to see if your videocassettes of ``Dark Habits''
and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' are finally starting to wear out,
and you're desperate for a fresh infusion of post-post-Franco
Iberian fabulousness.
</P>
<P>
   And who isn't? Who but the sourest of scolds could be immune to
the charms of a gamine heroine named Yeye (Ingrid Rubio), her best
pal, Alberto (Gustavo Salmeron); and the assorted friends, rivals
and lovers (would-be and ex) who populate this happy muddle of a
movie? And who, for that matter, could resist a film that features
Bibi Andersson _ the erstwhile Bergman ingenue who has become the
leading Swedish actress in modern Spanish cinema _ as a high-class
lesbian pimp?
</P>
<P>
   And what about those drag queens, decked out as Daliesque
visions of Jackie O, Cindy Crawford and Dolly Parton? Or a finale
that features a costume party gone haywire, a naked artist's model
greeting sunrise on a rooftop and a showdown in a nightclub men's
room?
</P>
<P>
   The nightclub, by the way, is called Frenesi, the frenzy of the
title, which also, we're informed by a pop song on the soundtrack,
refers to sex. There is plenty of frenzied sex on screen: between
Alberto and Alex (Javier Albala), a handsome man with a secret,
then between Monica (Cayetana Guillen Cuervo), Yeye's slutty,
hard-boiled roommate, and Max (Nancho Novo), the brooding gigolo
who once broke Yeye's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Max, sad to say, is not only a cad, a philanderer and, possibly,
a murderer; he's also a drag, and not the glamorous, subversive,
gender-bending sense. His dour machismo dampens the film's general
insouciance, and the story lines that go with him _ about an
apparent sex killing, a vengeful cop and his star-crossed
relationship with Yeye _ are off-putting and implausible.
</P>
<P>
   The best parts of ``Not Love, Just Frenzy'' present the casual
outrageousness of the characters and their milieu with humor,
tenderness and tact. The romantic dreams of a student radical named
Clara; the easy, loving banter between Yeye and Alberto; the sight
of three female impersonators boarding a bus _ moments like these
are humane and comic in the best Almodovarian tradition. The rest
is just frenzy. &QL;

&HT;     BRADLEY BLOWS IT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The message of the dissolving presidential
candidacy of former Sen. Bill Bradley is that if you hold yourself
out as more principled and high-minded than your opponent, you
better walk the walk and not just talk the talk.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, desperate to revive his flagging fortunes, suddenly
dropped his mask of statesmanship in the New Hampshire debate
Wednesday evening, abandoning the image he had hoped would
distinguish him from the pragmatic, aggressive Gore. No more Mr.
Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   But what appeared in Nice Guy's place was a mushy-thinking
whiner who came across as petulant and mean, accusing his
Democratic rival of lying and complaining that Gore was
``demeaning'' him. ``Why should we believe you that you will tell
the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a
candidate?'' Bradley inquired sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a negative attack?'' Gore responded wryly. Later,
Gore warned, ``If you are going to talk about a higher standard,
you need to live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's new attack mode was a stunning role reversal for a
fellow who has made a big deal of being too intellectually aloof to
run a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The above-the-fray pose wasn't working, but neither will the new
pitch. Sometimes, the rule is if you can't beat them, you join
them. But there's a giant political chasm here between the two
approaches. Bradley does not come to mind as a tough-minded slugger
who will do anything legal to win.
</P>
<P>
   And voters want a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is more practiced at the tough guy tactics and better at
them. He repeatedly challenged Bradley's interpretation of the
issues on which they differ. But he cloaked his attacks in the
language of policy wonkery that is more politically acceptable than
the personal insults Bradley was hurling.
</P>
<P>
   And the voters who like Bradley do so precisely because they
prefer a candidate with a softer focus than the hard-charging Gore.
Bradley sold himself as a ``different'' kind of politician who
would restore dignity and gentility to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now he doesn't look different at all. He sounds like Sen. Bob
Dole, growling after Vice President George Bush beat him in New
Hampshire's Republican primary in 1988: ``Tell him to stop lying
about my record.'' The voters didn't buy such sour grapes then and
are unlikely to do so now. The preferred posture for losers is to
behave like gracious good sports.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, both sides predictably shaded their
interpretations of what the other was up to. The differing impact
of their competing health and education plans can be argued fairly
with all sorts of legitimate variations. This is complicated stuff
to explain in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's politics. Harping on the other's ``distortions'' is
standard campaign fare. Believe whatever makes the most sense to
you.
</P>
<P>
   But this debate was supposed to be the forum to get Gore, except
it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   It started when CNN anchor Judy Woodruff challenged the vice
president to explain if he was operating on ``misinformation'' or
just ``being political.'' She cited his complaint that Bradley's
support of private school vouchers would siphon off money from
public education. ``Which is not the case,'' she opined.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fired back. And he's right. Bradley's proposal says nothing
about overtly subtracting money from public schools, but in fact
that is what would happen. Many teachers and educators are opposed
to such vouchers because the pool of tax money for education is
limited; tax dollars that go to subsidize pupils in private schools
are not available for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it was good theater. Gore pushed Bradley to explain
his Senate vote for Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981, opposed by
most Democrats and so severe that much of the excised funding was
soon restored. ``I just don't see how you can vote for Reagan's
budget cuts and then try to campaign like Robert Kennedy,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley countered that he had actually worked to diminish the
effect of the budget cuts, adding that Gore's complaint reminded
him of Richard Nixon _ ``the kind of politician who'd chop down a
tree, then stand on the stump and give a speech about
conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   But amid the hyperbole and hypocrisy, Gore came out looking the
most forceful, decisive and confident. (If only he would junk that
jarring blue-striped tie. Bring back the comfy earth tones.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ended the debate badly, claiming that regarding his
personal medical records he has ``done the same thing Al Gore has
done, which is to lay out the latest doctor's report.'' Gore
properly interjected that ``I don't want to be put in the same boat
here. I've released all of mine fully.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Bradley's medical records is relevant in the light
of his recent problems with irregular heartbeat. If he has nothing
to hide, why did he incorrectly pretend he has disclosed as much
about his health as Gore has?
</P>
<P>
   It would not be wise for Gore to make an issue of this, and he
won't. But Bradley has just done it himself. Can Bradley stand up
to the pressures of the presidency? I don't think so.

 &HT;    Zoo's fight to save ailing Willie B.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Question: How does a famous, beloved, elderly,
seriously ill 400-pound gorilla get his sweet potatoes?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Any way he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   And when the hulking primate happens to be Willie B. _ weak from
chronic heart disease, receiving intensive care _ he wants those
yams cooked with the skins on one day. Then he wants them raw and
skinless the next day. That day, he doesn't care how many pounds of
cooked, unskinned sweet potatoes you've just stockpiled in the Zoo
Atlanta kitchen. No, if you hand him one of these offending cooked
tubers, the 41-year-old alpha male turns over his massive mitt with
the delicacy of an opera diva, dumping the yam on the floor. Or he
pushes it through the wire mesh into the neighboring gorilla pen.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes his handlers exasperated _ and hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign, actually,'' says senior veterinarian Dr.
Rita McManamon, who has ministered to His Hugeness since 1984. The
mere fact that Willie wants to play food games shows he may be
feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he's not eating enough, we have people there constantly
trying to entice him with a smorgasbord of foods. He's a smart
fella, he knows the game. He's working this angle for all it's
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo staff looks for any tiny, promising sign, because the
underlying reality is that Willie B. is a very, very sick gorilla.
He suffers from cardiomyopathy, a weakness of the heart muscle that
can't be cured, only managed. The zoo won't allow reporters or
other outsiders to see the star _ infection from human germs is a
danger _ but staffers decribe an ape much changed from the lordly
one who has held court at the zoo for 39 years. Sometimes he leans
his head wearily against the wall. Keeper Charles Horton can see a
``crestfallen'' expression in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While the staff administers daily oral heart medication, usually
mixed with tempting yogurt and M&AMP;Ms, Willie's kept in his own
indoor cell, because in recent weeks he was eating and drinking
much too little when he had to compete with younger, jostling apes.
All 23 gorillas are kept indoors and off exhibit when the
temperature goes below 40 degrees, and the members of Willie's
troop _ his five children and five grown females _ often cram into
a small ``visiting room'' where they can make visual and vocal
contact with poppa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know something is wrong and they're agitated, breaking
into more fights because Willie's not there to settle them,'' says
Horton, Willie's main keeper for 25 years. ``They're reassured when
they can see and hear him _ and he is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A crack medical team
</P>
<P>
   Horton first knew something was wrong in late December when
Willie allowed a female in his troop to break gorilla etiquette and
sit close, right in front of him, to eat. It was, Horton says, ``a
clear sign that he wasn't feeling so macho.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie was one of several gorillas suffering from the flu _ the
same virus that commonly affects humans. In his case it led to
pneumonia, which in turn strained his already faltering heart. The
titanic one was anaesthetized and wheeled on a gurney into the
zoo's gorilla clinic for X-rays, ultrasonograms and other tests by
outside specialists, including a cardiologist and pulmonologist.
(Based at such institutions as Emory University and volunteering
their free time for Willie, these specialists have asked to remain
anonymous, citing time constraints, zoo officials say.)
</P>
<P>
   When advanced cardiomyopathy was diagnosed, the medical team
prescribed daily heart medications, which are adjusted daily to
offset the worrisome fluid that keeps collecting in Willie's mighty
chest. The specialists consult daily on the phone with McManamon
and her assistant vet, Maria Crane. Because he is still a dangerous
animal _ in 1980 he slipped out of his cage and ``played'' with a
keeper, breaking his leg _ Willie must be put under for even the
simplest exam or test. But anesthesia itself can strain his heart.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, Willie's illness is an expensive
burden for Zoo Atlanta, a non-profit institution, costing an extra
$2,500 a week in medication, special foods and overtime, plus
intermittent lab tests at $4,000 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo would go to these lengths to save any animal,
spokeswoman Gail Eaton says, ``But let's face it _ there's only so
much you can do to save a rattlesnake. Since a gorilla is so much
like a human, we know more ways to help Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   Since news got out about Willie's illness, some people have sent
get-well cards, often with candy that the ape likes. This support,
however, doesn't pay the bills. ``We don't need people sending us
any more candy for Willie,'' Eaton says, ``but we could sure use
money.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend's night vigil
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the extras that can't be captured on a ledger
sheet, like the devotion of Horton, who has spent half of his 50
years with Willie: tickling the gorilla's toes when he was younger,
playing tug-of-war with a rope. Watching with amazement as the
middle-aged silverback played tenderly with his first infant
daughter, Kudzoo.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, in a clean-looking zoo work room powerfully
redolent of gorilla waste, Horton's sleeping bag was stretched out
on a counter. The lifetime Atlantan has shared a few of Willie's
worst nights here _ as close to his old friend as he can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's meant more to me than I have to him,'' Horton
says. ``Right now we still can't accept that we might not have him
with us. The emotion is something you try to hold in.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Horton's duties is manning the ``smorgasbord'' table,
tempting Willie with such items as bananas, celery, candies and
white bread (an experiment with healthier whole wheat was a
fiasco). The gorilla will gaze at an item, and when Horton puts his
hand on it, Willie will confirm the choice with a grunt.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, for the first time in weeks, he ``barked'' when
the other gorillas were getting bamboo. Translation: ``What about
me?'' It was another tiny hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   Says Horton, ``I like it when he's finicky.''

mixed with tempting yogurt and M&AMP;Ms, Willie's kept in his own
indoor cell, because in recent weeks he was eating and drinking
much too little when he had to compete with younger, jostling apes.
All 23 gorillas are kept indoors and off exhibit when the
temperature goes below 40 degrees, and the members of Willie's
troop _ his five children and five grown females _ often cram into
a small ``visiting room'' where they can make visual and vocal
contact with poppa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know something is wrong and they're agitated, breaking
into more fights because Willie's not there to settle them,'' says
Horton, Willie's main keeper for 25 years. ``They're reassured when
they can see and hear him _ and he is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A crack medical team
</P>
<P>
   Horton first knew something was wrong in late December when
Willie allowed a female in his troop to break gorilla etiquette and
sit close, right in front of him, to eat. It was, Horton says, ``a
clear sign that he wasn't feeling so macho.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie was one of several gorillas suffering from the flu _ the
same virus that commonly affects humans. In his case it led to
pneumonia, which in turn strained his already faltering heart. The
titanic one was anaesthetized and wheeled on a gurney into the
zoo's gorilla clinic for X-rays, ultrasonograms and other tests by
outside specialists, including a cardiologist and pulmonologist.
(Based at such institutions as Emory University and volunteering
their free time for Willie, these specialists have asked to remain
anonymous, citing time constraints, zoo officials say.)
</P>
<P>
   When advanced cardiomyopathy was diagnosed, the medical team
prescribed daily heart medications, which are adjusted daily to
offset the worrisome fluid that keeps collecting in Willie's mighty
chest. The specialists consult daily on the phone with McManamon
and her assistant vet, Maria Crane. Because he is still a dangerous
animal _ in 1980 he slipped out of his cage and ``played'' with a
keeper, breaking his leg _ Willie must be put under for even the
simplest exam or test. But anesthesia itself can strain his heart.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, Willie's illness is an expensive
burden for Zoo Atlanta, a non-profit institution, costing an extra
$2,500 a week in medication, special foods and overtime, plus
intermittent lab tests at $4,000 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo would go to these lengths to save any animal,
spokeswoman Gail Eaton says, ``But let's face it _ there's only so
much you can do to save a rattlesnake. Since a gorilla is so much
like a human, we know more ways to help Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   Since news got out about Willie's illness, some people have sent
get-well cards, often with candy that the ape likes. This support,
however, doesn't pay the bills. ``We don't need people sending us
any more candy for Willie,'' Eaton says, ``but we could sure use
money.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend's night vigil
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the extras that can't be captured on a ledger
sheet, like the devotion of Horton, who has spent half of his 50
years with Willie: tickling the gorilla's toes when he was younger,
playing tug-of-war with a rope. Watching with amazement as the
middle-aged silverback played tenderly with his first infant
daughter, Kudzoo.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, in a clean-looking zoo work room powerfully
redolent of gorilla waste, Horton's sleeping bag was stretched out
on a counter. The lifetime Atlantan has shared a few of Willie's
worst nights here _ as close to his old friend as he can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's meant more to me than I have to him,'' Horton
says. ``Right now we still can't accept that we might not have him
with us. The emotion is something you try to hold in.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Horton's duties is manning the ``smorgasbord'' table,
tempting Willie with such items as bananas, celery, candies and
white bread (an experiment with healthier whole wheat was a
fiasco). The gorilla will gaze at an item, and when Horton puts his
hand on it, Willie will confirm the choice with a grunt.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, for the first time in weeks, he ``barked'' when
the other gorillas were getting bamboo. Translation: ``What about
me?'' It was another tiny hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   Says Horton, ``I like it when he's finicky.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last Bach year wasn't so long ago: 1985, to be
exact, the 300th anniversary of the composer's birth. And although
Bach had to share the celebration with other masters born in the
fateful, fertile year 1685, Handel and Scarlatti, he did not lack
for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the calculus of births and deaths, centenaries and
quarter-millenniums, and points in between, comes another Bach
year: the 250th anniversary of his death. Not complaining, mind
you. In addition to the commercial aspects _ books, records and
scores; concerts, recitals and festivals _ and the odd bit of
flimflammery, such commemorations typically give a jolt to
scholarship on the subject as well as a boost in public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   And in this case, the proximity of the years allows for a happy
connection. Among the events best recalled from 1985 were recitals
by the pianist Andras Schiff, devoted to the Partitas and the
``Goldberg'' Variations, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Now, in
the first major Bach event of the year in New York, Schiff begins a
monumental survey of Bach's keyboard works, with the English Suites
on Wednesday and the French Suites on Feb. 5, at Alice Tully Hall,
and the Partitas on Feb. 13, at Avery Fisher Hall. The series picks
up in the fall at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff must compete with much accumulated wisdom on the subject,
including some of his own, retained in memory and on records. So
the classical-music critics of The New York Times provide a partial
backdrop by choosing favorites among the CDs of the keyboard works
available.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, yes; along with these choices, expect any number of
additional releases in this Bach year.
</P>
<P>
   _ By JAMES R. OESTREICH
</P>
<P>
   Here are some favorite Bach recordings of the classical-music
critics of The New York Times. Many are available in two-CD sets
or, in one case, a six-CD set. Prices range from $5.98 to $12.98
for a single CD, to $32.99 for a two- or three-CD set, to $38.94
for the set of six. )
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Holland
</P>
<P>
   ``The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Books 1 and 2 (BWV 846-93).
</P>
<P>
   Bach's early admirers knew him as the father of harmony. This is
a specific rather than a general eulogy and refers to ``The
Well-Tempered Clavier,'' 48 preludes and fugues in every major and
minor key. ``Well-Tempered'' is a system of tuning. Bach did not
invent it, but he promoted it heavily in these pieces as a
reasonable solution to theoretical turmoils that had preceded him
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify, purely tuned scales render a C sharp and a D
flat that are slightly different; by jimmying intervals out of
their pure state, the two pitches can be made to occupy the same
black key on a piano. Without this compromise, most of Wagner's
harmonic wanderings and Schubert's abrupt modulations would sound
dreadful. (Organists using old systems complained that fifths in
distant keys howled like wolves.) The well-tempered method is not
quite the equal temperament generally accepted now, but it is a
direct predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The tuning wars, despite continuing skirmishes, are behind us,
and Bach's preludes and fugues are honored as the ``daily bread''
(Schumann's term) of every keyboard player. Beethoven memorized
them as a child, and every student who has laid hands to keyboard
knows their ability to teach the ear to hear the inner voice and
the hand to respond accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   There are two books: the first from 1722, the second from nearly
20 years later. Book 1 tends toward open drama and pleasing
sentiment. Book 2 has, with exceptions, a more dour air. Maybe this
is why we know it less well, or maybe we become too bogged down in
the riches of Book 1 to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Period instruments have less moral force here. ``Clavier'' is
18th-century German for just about any instrument played on keys.
But if the harpsichord pleases you, turn to Gustav Leonhardt, who
plays Book 1 on splendid modern copies of Bach-era instruments and
addresses the music with a caring sobriety (Deutsche Harmonia Mundi
77011-2-RG, two CDs). Excitement is at a minimum in Leonhardt's
playing, but then our preoccupation with excitement is not one of
music's admirable traits.
</P>
<P>
   Andras Schiff plays both books using a modern piano (London 414
388-2 and 417 236-2, two CDs each). The modesty is admirable, the
mood almost placid; the pianist muses quietly by himself. Also on
the piano is Keith Jarrett's recording, brisk and correct (ECM
21362 and 21433, two CDs each). Edwin Fischer's expansive piano
playing in Book 1 (Pearl GEMS 0016, two CDs) adopts Bach into the
Romantic era. Mieczyslaw Horszowski's twilight Book 1 (Vanguard OVC
8046/7) has the quiet innerness of an 87-year-old and some of the
technical strains as well. For a wonderfully operatic treatment
based on sound musicianship return to Wanda Landowska playing her
souped-up Pleyel harpsichord (RCA Victor 6217-2-RC, two CDs, and
7825-2-RC, three CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Treat Glenn Gould (Sony Classical SM2K 52600 and SM2K 52603, two
CDs each) as a series of clever pranks occasionally interrupted by
playing of astonishing beauty and originality. Gould plays against
the grain of these pieces: with staccato where legato is
compellingly implied; at tempos that are either ridiculously slow
or ridiculously fast. The fugue textures are amazingly clear, and
it is all great fun, but I hear there are serious students who take
his ``Well-Tempered'' as gospel. That is a horrifying thought.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Griffiths
</P>
<P>
   Keyboard Partitas (BWV 825-30).
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Gould, of course. It is not surprising that Gould's
recordings (Sony Classical SM2K 52597, two CDs, with preludes and
fugues) are as extraordinary now as when they were made some 40
years ago. The surprise is that current recordings of the complete
set offer no satisfying alternative. The closest approach comes
from Sergey Schepkin (Ongaku 108/9, two CDs, with other pieces),
but highly accomplished as Schepkin is, he sometimes undervalues
the rhythmic life of the principal voice and sometimes
overornaments.
</P>
<P>
   With Gould such criticisms are impossible because he always
means exactly what he plays. The results will usually be unexpected
because responses so complete and detailed are bound to be
unforeseeable and they may be extreme. In the fugal Allegro from
the opening movement of the C minor Partita, for instance, Gould's
staccato seems satirical, exposing an element of pomposity. But
there is no gap between the performer and the composer. If one
finds the section funny, one is smiling either at Gould and Bach or
with them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most other performers fail at the first challenge of Bach's
music, which is to keep each movement in the air, despite
intermittent endings at the closes of phrases and sections, until
the final cadence. This is not a problem, though, in two classic
recordings, available in mixed programs: Dinu Lipatti's recording
of the B flat Partita (EMI Classics, 7243 5 67003 2; or Great
Pianists of the 20th Century (Philips, 456 892-2, two CDs) and
Martha Argerich's discs of the C minor (Great Pianists of the 20th
Century, Philips, 456 700-2, two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   The Lipatti is miraculously fluent, all grace. It is not full of
ideas in the way that Gould's performances are. Ms. Argerich, by
contrast, establishes continuity more by unassuageable tension.
Some movements seem to get more impassioned as they go on, without
any sacrifice to tonal brilliance or rhythmic definition. The
Allemande is just a wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In the same partita, Grigory Sokolov (Opus 111, OPS 529116/7,
two CDs) offers a grander view, but a strongly compelling one, with
plenty of contrapuntal life: the coupling is ``The Art of Fugue.''
Sokolov, no less than Gould, can be utterly persuasive in doing
something odd, as in his performance of the Sarabande in detached
notes, an idea he makes beautiful and moving.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Fiorentino (Appian, APR 5558) would never have wanted to
interrupt his golden singing line in that way, but he had his own
marvelous strange notions. After a beautiful performance of the B
flat Partita, he extends the beauties of the slow movements of the
D major to the extent that the Allemande lasts more than a quarter
of an hour. But what a quarter-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Kozinn
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldberg'' Variations (BWV 988).
</P>
<P>
   Something about the ``Goldberg'' Variations brings out
musicians' inventiveness and eccentricity. And it is not only
pianists and harpsichordists who are drawn to this journey through
30 magnificently diverse variations on a graceful aria; although
the present survey covers recordings on those instruments only,
transcriptions for guitar, organ, string trio, orchestra and brass
quintet are available.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, quite a few favorite harpsichord versions have gone
out of print. But Kenneth Gilbert's supremely rational 1986
recording (Harmonia Mundi France HMX 2951240), recently reissued as
part of Harmonia Mundi's Bach Edition, has several appealing
qualities, among them an interesting approach to the perennial
question of how to handle the repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert takes some but not all of them, his decision based on
the form each variation takes. Canons are repeated, so listeners
can focus on different voices with each pass, although he tends not
to emphasize the voices very differently the second time.
Variations for which Bach supplied alternative endings are repeated
as well, so none of Bach's notes are left out.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert does not go wild in matters of registration. For a
lesson in how tastes and techniques have changed, compare his
account with the aggressively colorized versions by Wanda Landowska
(from 1933 on EMI) and Karl Richter (from 1958 on Teldec), both
still available.
</P>
<P>
   Pianists have long found the ``Goldberg'' Variations a canvas on
which to paint richly hued self-portraits in more or less Bachian
garb. Surely the champion here is Glenn Gould, whose 1955 recording
on piano (Sony Classical SMK 52594) is classic Gould and, in its
way, classic modern Bach. Gould liked extremes and provocations,
and they abound in this brisk reading. A typical few moments are in
the contrasting Variations Nos. 26 and 27. The first is played in a
whisper and fades away; its successor is brash and torrential.
There are also, of course, the humming and singing. If you're new
to Gould, learn to ignore them; it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the early-music movement made pianists shy about
Bach, but since the mid-1980s they have returned to the
``Goldberg'' Variations with a vengeance. Andrew Rangell recorded
the work in 1991 (Dorian DOR-90138) and Sergey Schepkin in 1995
(Ongaku 107) in versions that should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Schepkin's performance has an electrifying energy, but it is
most striking for the florid ornamentation the pianist applies at
every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a picture of textural clarity, a quality it shares
with Rangell's account. Here the strands of counterpoint sing with
extraordinary transparency; you will hear relationships never
apparent before.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest of her periodic examinations of the ``Goldberg''
Variations, also on piano, Rosalyn Tureck takes all the repeats and
plays at remarkably leisurely tempos. Her recording (Deutsche
Grammophon 459 599-2, two CDs) takes the prize for figurative bells
and whistles. If you play it on your CD-ROM drive, you can follow
the score (in black-and-white or with individual voices color
coded) or read a variation-by-variation analysis and an illustrated
biography of Bach.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Oestreich
</P>
<P>
   English Suites (BWV 806-11), French Suites (BWV 812-17).
</P>
<P>
   The English Suites, hardly less French in idiomatic gesture than
the French Suites, pose the greater challenge for performers, in
their length and density. Whether despite that reason or because of
it, they are represented in slightly greater diversity among
current recordings.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly happy venture in the English Suites is Murray
Perahia's recording for Sony Classical (SK 60276/7, two CDs). To
this pianist's virtues in more standard repertory _ a wonderful
suppleness, freedom and fluidity _ are added the curiosity of a
relative outsider and a fresh sense of adventure in ornamentation
and such matters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations for the English set extend with more or
less equal force to the French Suites as well. The pianist Andras
Schiff, who performs both sets at Alice Tully Hall next week, has
recorded both for Decca/London (English Suites, 421 640-2; French
Suites, 433 313-2; two CDs each). Schiff quite simply lives and
breathes Bach, and the nimblest fingers this side of Glenn Gould's
allow him to avoid the sustaining pedal, a practice that in his
case paradoxically yields more variety rather than less.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff is also deft at finding humor in Bach's writing (as
opposed to creating it, as Gould so often seems to do). This
attribute, perhaps rarer among harpsichordists than pianists, is
nevertheless notably shared by the splendid New York harpsichordist
Bradley Brookshire, who in 1997 gave the finest performance of the
French Suites in recent memory, which so far has no counterpart on
records: a worthy project for some label in the Bach year.
</P>
<P>
   The maniacally virtuosic Gould, meanwhile, makes essential
listening on Sony Classical (English Suites, SM2K 52606/7; French
Suites, SM2K 52609/10; two CDs each) despite his infuriating
vagaries and mannerisms. Even at his most outrageous, he turns up
unexpected features in the music and shows the way to piquant
interpretive possibilities that one might enjoy if applied with
greater restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on piano, listeners on a tight budget might well, as
so often, turn to Naxos, for performances of both sets by Wolfgang
Rubsam that occasionally transcend the acceptable (English Suites,
8.553012/3; French Suites, 8.550709/10; two CDs each).
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable how decisively excellent and characterful
performances of Bach on the piano in recent decades have settled
the once contentious issue as to whether that instrument should
continue to be used in Bach at all. Who would surrender Gould,
Schiff or Perahia?
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of us Bachians nourish a special fondness for the
prickly, colorful sonorities of the harpsichord, and the good word
here (for those who continue to find Gustav Leonhardt's readings a
bit sobersided) is in the two big Bach editions just appearing.
Kenneth Gilbert's fine recordings of both sets of suites (as well
as the Partitas) are available in a six-CD package in Harmonia
Mundi France's Bach Edition (HMX 2908078/83). Alan Curtis' somewhat
livelier versions of the suites are more inaccessibly buried at the
moment in the 153 CDs of Teldec's Bach 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Tommasini
</P>
<P>
   Miscellaneous keyboard works.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anyone who ever took piano lessons as a child has played
at least a couple of Bach's 15 Two-Part Inventions. Bach composed
these short works as study pieces for his children, and they have
been used by youngsters ever since. With just two lines of music to
execute, one by each hand, the inventions allow elementary pianists
to develop finger independence and learn to hear two voices at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Though staples of children's recitals, the pieces are seldom
performed by professionals. Happily, Peter Serkin recorded them in
1997 (RCA Victor 09026-68594-2). With his exquisite pianism and
sense of adventure, he reveals just how musically inventive these
inventions are. They are paired on this disc with fine accounts of
the 15 Sinfonias, or Three-Part Inventions, often used as teaching
works for more advanced students: here two hands must play three
independent lines. This rewarding program also includes four
seldom-heard duets from the ``Clavierubung.''
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt that Bach's keyboard music can be terrifying,
listen to the historic 1935 recording of his stormy Chromatic
Fantasy and Fugue by the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska (EMI
Classics CDH 7 61008 2, two CDs). Landowska took a bold,
rhythmically free approach to Bach, but this work especially
invited it. She plays the grimly rhapsodic fantasy as if it were
some harmonically experimental late piano work by Liszt. Her
intrepid march through the fugue, with the final statement of the
theme in thick bass octaves, is positively Horowitzian. The
two-disc set includes her famous accounts of the ``Italian
Concerto'' and the ``Goldberg'' Variations.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Andras Schiff offers quite a different approach to
the work on a recording from 1994 (Hungaroton HCD 11690). He also
captures the music's ominous quality and shifting moods, but his
performance is bracingly lucid and fleet. Whereas Landowska plays
the final moments of the fantasy as a weighty, inexorable descent
to the depths of chromatic abyss, Schiff plays them with affecting
poignancy, as if all the energy had been beaten out of the music
and the only consolation were the affirming fugue that follows.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other works on Schiff's disc is a lively account of
the popular Toccata in D. For a more provocative take on that work,
along with the other six Bach toccatas, try Glenn Gould's set,
recorded between 1963 and 1979 (Sony's Classical SM2K 52612, two
CD's), in Glenn Gould Edition.
</P>
<P>
   Some listeners find Gould's Bach eccentric; others think it
supreme. Either way it is impossible to resist. Gould's alert ear,
startling imagination, rhythmic sparkle and ability to project
contrapuntal intricacies with uncanny clarity combine impressively
in these riveting performances.
</P>
<P>
   Another recording in the Gould Edition offers the pianist in
vibrant interpretations of the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue, the
``Italian Concerto'' and, most notably, several seldom-heard works,
including three fantasies, two fugues on themes by Albinoni, and
the ``Aria Variata Alla Maniera Italiana,'' a theme with 10
variations (Sony Classical SMK 52620). No, the ``Goldberg''
Variations are not Bach's only keyboard work in this genre,
something I have never forgotten since I flubbed a question about
it on my doctoral oral exam.

   &UR; BACH BY THE BOX FOR THOSE WITH THE SHELF SPACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JAMES R. OESTREICH &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The first thundering volleys in the record wars of the Bach year
have been fired by Teldec, which has released Bach _ all of Bach _
on 153 CDs, and Harmonia Mundi France, which is releasing some half
of Bach, evidently, on 81 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   A full review of this largess will take time, obviously: perhaps
the rest of a lifetime. But several things can be noted at the
outset. In contrast to the Harmonia Mundi project, appearing in
small packages ranging from single CDs to a 12-CD set, the Teldec
load was dumped in a single box; make that suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on the rage (among producers if not necessarily
consumers) for monster coffee-table packages, this box might itself
serve as a coffee table. And in a manner not calculated to appeal
to serious collectors, with CDs already spilling off their shelves,
it holds mostly air; repackaged sensibly in soft plastic sleeves,
the CDs and booklets shrink down to fit into less than two shoe
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are treasures galore, starting with the already historic
complete series of sacred cantatas led by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and
Gustav Leonhardt in the 1970s and '80s. (Those who purchased them
in an earlier coffee-table edition from Teldec can buy a ``lite''
version of Bach 2000, without those cantatas, for $850 rather than
the full $1,250.)
</P>
<P>
   As with those versions, most of the recordings are reissues.
There are also bonuses: in addition to comprehensive booklets, an
entire book, Wolfgang Sandberger's ``Bach 2000: 24 Inventions on
Johann Sebastian Bach,'' retailing up-to-date information and
theories on Bach, particularly where they tend to debunk cherished
myths, and a CD illustrating performance practice in Bach's ``St.
Matthew Passion'' through much of the century.
</P>
<P>
   That disc offers 10 minutes or so of excerpts (around and
including the soprano aria ``Aus Liebe will mein Heiland sterben'')
from recordings conducted by Willem Mengelberg in 1939, Wilhelm
Furtwangler in 1954, Karl Richter in 1958, Georg Solti in 1987, Ton
Koopman in 1992 and Christoph Spering (using Mendelssohn's
arrangement) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the set's thoroughness and Bach's propensity to reuse
choice material, considerable light is also cast on recent and
current varieties of period practice. The 11-disc volume devoted to
secular cantatas, for example, includes two versions of what is
basically the same work musically: the Cantata No. 207
(``Vereinigte Zweitracht der Wechselnden Saiten,'' or ``Resolved
Discord of the Vibrating Strings''), conducted by the firebrand
Reinhard Goebel from Cologne, and the Cantata No. 207a (``Auf,
Schmetternde Toene der Muntern Trompeten,'' or ``Come, Blithesome
Trumpets' Blare''), led by the altogether mellower Koopman from
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Bachians of unlimited means can throw many more close
comparisons of period performances into the mix with the Harmonia
Mundi sets. Especially prominent among the performers here is the
fine Belgian conductor Philippe Herreweghe. Another Belgian, Rene
Jacobs, proves no less revelatory in a disc of secular cantatas.
</P>
<P>
   Again, most of the material is repackaged from earlier releases.
But instead of reissuing Herreweghe's first version of the ``St.
Matthew Passion,'' Harmonia Mundi has rerecorded the work with him,
and with the English tenor Ian Bostridge as the Evangelist, a role
in which he will undoubtedly have much to say in the future.
</P>

`ISN'T SHE GREAT' SANITIZES LIFE OF JACQUELINE SUSANN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Hollywood so bent upon slapping a coat of painted-over
optimism on sordid lives?
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Michelle Pfeiffer starred in ``Up Close and
Personal,'' an eviscerated and homogenized look at the life of
newscaster Jessica Savitch.
</P>
<P>
   Now writer Jacqueline Susann gets the honor of having her world
sanitized and prettied up in ``Isn't She Great.''
</P>
<P>
   Susann's reality was anything but TV sitcom light. Yet writer
Paul Rudnick, adapting his homage from a The New Yorker tribute by
Michael Korda, and director Andrew Bergman (``The Freshman'') have
opted to go for colorful camp, canned laughter one-liners, true
love and 1960s Pucci wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   They sashay past the frequently dark and painful world of
determination, disappointment and ardent self-promotion behind
Susann's best-selling success.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know about are aging stars, hopeful hookers and people
popping pills and winding up in the gutter ... and nobody writes
books about that.'' So believes failed starlet Jacqueline Susann
(Bette Midler) until her devoted husband and publicist, Irving
Mansfield (Nathan Lane), urges her to write a trash novel about
that world she once knew intimately. Jackie responds with ease and
catty glee, talking to God in Central Park and begging for fame and
``10 more years.''
</P>
<P>
   She writes ``Valley of the Dolls,'' and it shoots to the top of
the best-selling book list. A bout with breast cancer, the pain of
her son Guy's autism and institutionalization and her rampant
thirst to be the best helps her pump out two more trash 'n sex
tomes _ ``The Love Machine'' and ``Once Is Not Enough'' _ before
her death.
</P>
<P>
   Midler plays Susann like Ethel Merman might have, belting out a
number at her book party and swearing like a sailor at her mousy
blue-blooded editor (David Hyde Pierce), who of course, comes to
love her, as does everyone in ``Isn't She Great.'' And that's the
problem with the film. Though it does present the facts of Susann's
life, it skims them so quickly and with such glorious glee that we
never get a sense of who this woman really was.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mansfield, from whom Susann once was separated, comes off
as such a nice, solid guy that we can't believe they ever even had
sex. The rest of the cast is utterly wasted _ the great Stockard
Channing and John Cleese are thrown in in adoring, trivial little
parts. By the end, it's frustratingly clear that everyone involved
wanted to avoid sending any audience member home feeling bad or
thinking that Susann, or at least Midler, was anything but great.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't She Great. Directed by Andrew Bergman. Written by Paul
Rudnick. Cast: Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, David
Hyde Pierce, John Cleese. Universal Pictures. 105 minutes. Rated R
for language.

`ISN'T SHE GREAT': CAMPING TRIP TO SUSANN'S VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Originally slugged SUSANN-FILM-REVIEW) 
(Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading a Jacqueline Susann novel is like watching a drunk
disarm a bomb, an experience that makes you flinch and generates a
freakish kind of excitement. The kind of lurid pulp that we now
take for granted _ with titles that sound like soft-core porn
movies from the pay-per-view channels _ was a genre that Susann
took to a new, sweaty level with books like ``Valley of the Dolls''
and ``The Love Machine.'' Humid novels about wide-eyed girl victims
sucked into the world of sex, drugs, sex, celebrities and (gasp)
sex while being romanced by heart-of-stone guys had been written
before. But never in the way that Susann did, with the
contradictory elements of pleasure in mining that mother lode of
cubic zirconium and an undercurrent of sheer rage.
</P>
<P>
   That bile probably built up from experience. By the time she had
become a novelist _ banging out copy on frosty pink paper with a
matching Olympia typewriter _ Susann had had more careers (actress,
model, etc.) than most people have socks. The new interest in
Susann must be one of the things that drove the producers of
``Isn't She Great'' to turn Michael Korda's encounter with her,
which he recounted in a New Yorker article, into a bio-pic.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the line that best sums up the Jackie (Bette Midler) of
the picture is trilled by her friend Florence (Stockard Channing):
``Talent isn't everything.'' That sobriquet could apply to the
movie as well. It's not that there's no talent among the
collaborators. It's just that no one gets much of a chance to show
it.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva than Ms.
Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic self-absorption
than anyone else. And Nathan Lane, who plays Irving Mansfield,
Jackie's husband, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark plug: His
voice shows up before he does. (That's why he's so good at
animation voice-overs.) No one in his right mind expects much
sexual chemistry between these two, but the ambition of Susann and
Mansfield _ they were like separate species of predator circling
each other _ provides a chemistry all its own. Yet in this
adaptation of the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy
and cute. Sly hostility seems to be a facet of the writer Paul
Rudnick's talent. But Rudnick and the director Andrew Bergman
(``The In-Laws,'' ``Honeymoon in Vegas'') have so defanged ``Isn't
She Great'' that it's like watching a sketch from the old ``Carol
Burnett Show'' that has mildewed.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Another Life,'' Korda, an anthropologist in
Susann's Land of the Drama Queen, was a smoothie from a show
business family and smart enough, as her editor, to keep his hand
out of her cage, or habitat, or wherever it is that such creatures
dwell. And she seemed content to catch her reflection in Korda's
gleaming blazer buttons. It was Mansfield, one of those producers
without portfolio, who caught the brunt of Susann's rages. (Korda
summarized Mansfield's role by noting that most of his life
``consisted of hanging around with his hands in his pockets telling
people, `Jackie will be down in five minutes.''') But like most
pilot fish, Mansfield saw an appetite worth trailing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Midler doesn't have the No. 2 pencil trimness of
Susann, who turned up on 1960s talk shows as often as commercials
for Fresca, girlish willfulness is a quality both share. Ms.
Midler's presence _ soft curves masking pantherish comic reflexes _
is as old-fashioned as Susann's rough-hewn prose. ``Isn't She
Great'' turns Susann and Mansfield into a couple of sweeties; they
even wander into Central Park so she can have breezy chats with
God.
</P>
<P>
   No cliche is left unturned, complete with the conversion of the
Korda figure (renamed Michael Hastings and played by David Hyde
Pierce) into a stock, repressed WASP, a man who orders an American
cheese sandwich with mayo. Pierce, who's on the verge of becoming a
professional yuppie, was better in a small role as an editor in
``Wolf'' than here, where his Niles Crane character is stripped of
two of its dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few funny bits, like a scene of a woman moving her
lips as she reads a Harold Robbins novel. The reteaming of Burt
Bacharch and Hal David, who wrote the buttercream-rich theme songs
that accompanied the film versions of several Susann novels, is a
nod to Susann's campy standing. And John Cleese, an emblem of a
'60s over-aged swinger as drawn by Jules Feiffer, is all comic
confidence as Jackie's publisher. (He wears enough fabulously
patterned suits to suggest that the Artist Formerly Known as Prince
should check his closets to see if anything's missing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Great'' also offers some oddly staged '60s references, like
appearances by Jim Morrison (James Villemaire), Truman Capote (Sam
Street) and even a ``Forrest Gump'' insertion of Susann/Midler into
a clip from an old ``Tonight'' show with Johnny Carson. (Perhaps a
miscalculation on a grand scale, since Ms. Midler's serenading of
Carson on the penultimate ``Tonight'' is now legend.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Isn't She Great'' has a mandate to make Jackie Susann
nice, because she's suffered. (Susann did suffer but had the good
taste not to exploit it.) Too bad: Ms. Midler was born to play the
Susann that Korda met. She has played this role before. Even Nathan
Lane has played it, in ``The Birdcage.'' If you're looking for
laughs, give ``Valley of the Dolls'' another read instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It contains drug use and the kind of
language found in a Jacqueline Susann novel.

&HT;     RAM'S WHITE NOT BITTER ABOUT BEING FIRED BY OAKLAND RAIDERS

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Semantically speaking, there's a difference between
being bitter and being bitterly disappointed. That difference
defines Mike White, who was fired after two seasons as head coach
of the Oakland Raiders but is now assistant head coach of a Super
Bowl-bound team with the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   White, who spent most of his coaching career in college as the
head coach at Cal and Illinois, went 8-8 with the Raiders in 1995
and 7-9 in '96. Then he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bitterly disappointed in the Raiders' situation because,
just as happened here, the third year is always the key,'' White
said. ``You can trace rebuilding programs and you can trace what it
takes for a person to get the job done. And I was only given two.''
</P>
<P>
   But, White, 64, stopped short of blaming Al Davis for his demise
as the club's head coach, but he did say his respect and authority
waned in inverse proportion to the power of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   However, he credited Davis for being the ``one guy in the NFL
who gave me an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   White started out 8-2 his first season, but the Raiders lost
their last six games and missed the playoffs by one game. That was
the beginning of the end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That began to erode my credibility with the squad, and it
began to erode the respect with which I was held,'' White said.
``My role as the head coach was totally diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's Dick Vermeil's assistant head coach, White is not
in line for succession when his friend of 35 years retires.
Offensive coordinator Mike Martz has been promised the head job, in
writing. That's fine with White, who was given a two-year contract
extension that mirrors the length of Vermeil's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I had no designs on being a head coach
anymore, especially atly at the NFL level,'' White said. ``I've had
my place in the sun.''

&HT;     TITANS HEAD COACH FOUND SOMETHING USEFUL FROM HIS NFL COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - From every man he has worked for in his coaching
assignments over the past 14 years and in his five preceding years
as an NFL player, Jeff Fisher has taken something with him.
</P>
<P>
   From Mike Ditka: ferocity, passion and the ability to chew gum
and coach at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   From Buddy Ryan: a defensive scheme based on constant pressure
and attack.
</P>
<P>
   From John Robinson: how to look and act like a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   From George Seifert: the art of preparation and the expectation
of victory.
</P>
<P>
   From Jack Pardee: the head coaching job after Pardee was fired
10 games into the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the experience of going through a number of
organizations,'' Fisher said. ``You're going to take a little from
each organization. I can't say I'm a Buddy Ryan disciple. There's
something to be said for being yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, the 41-year-old Fisher learned how to
remain calm and focused while the building was collapsing around
him. Make no mistake - the Houston Oilers could have been reduced
to rubble as they made their prolonged and painful transition into
the Tennessee Titans, a four-year process that began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Fisher was the guy with the hard hat and pickax,
ready to dig out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pretty much held the ship together and kept it from
sinking,'' Tennessee linebacker Terry Killens said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason Floyd Reese is beaming these days, and it's not
all because the Titans made the Super Bowl in their 40th year of
existence. Reese, the club's vice president and general manager,
hired Fisher away from the San Francisco 49ers in 1994 as defensive
coordinator and promoted him to head coach later that season when
he fired Pardee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his youth and relative inexperience - or maybe because
of it - Fisher kept the team competitive during its last two
apathetic years in Houston and its first two years in Tennessee.
The Titans were 8-8 for three straight seasons before this year's
breakthrough 13-3 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get thrown into a situation like we were, you have to
be a certain type of personality to survive,'' Reese said. ``I've
coached with 25 guys who would have had strokes in the last three
years. He's level-headed. He's not going to get thrown out of whack
if the plane is two minutes late. He's able to adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   That describes, or at least used to, Fisher's opposite number in
Super Bowl XXXIV, Rams coach Dick Vermeil. While the term
``burnout'' can be traced to Vermeil's Philadelphia tenure, Fisher
is slow to rile. If you told him his pants were on fire he'd make a
note to fetch the extinguisher at his earliest convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's something of the grinder in Fisher, who went to
USC and played in the same defensive backfield as Ronnie Lott. He
didn't realize how much the job had consumed him until he spent
some time with his family during Tennessee's bye week this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my kids to read at least 15 minutes a night,'' Fisher
said. ``I took advantage of a rare night at home and I went up to
read with my youngest son (Trent, 7). I went downstairs and told my
wife, Juli, 'Trent can read.' She said, ``Yeah, he's been reading
for two years now. Where have you been?''' Moving from Houston to
Memphis to Nashville, that's where, trying to build a team for the
future without having it fall apart in the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to win in the NFL with a level playing field,
and we weren't there,'' Fisher said. ``The types of things we went
through helped us get to where we are today. We are a strong team
mentally. If we didn't go through that, there's no telling where
we'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafting on consecutive years Steve McNair, Eddie George, Kenny
Holmes, Kevin Dyson (who caught the lateral on the kickoff return
for a touchdown against Buffalo) and Jevon Kearse provided a solid
foundation for the Titans as they finally settled into their new
home at Adelphia Coliseum in the Music City.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had a tougher job in the league the last three years
than he did,'' tackle Brad Hopkins said. ``For Jeff to keep the
team together, to keep us focused to win eight games, is a great
thing to me. When he took over we were in a seven-game losing
streak. He's done a great job of maintaining his focus.''

   ATTENTION EDITORS:
</P>
<P>
   For Black History month, which begins on Monday, Feb. 1, The New
York times Syndicate is offering a five-part feature, ``The
Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major moments in the
civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell, the nationally
acclaimed black journalist whose early career was shaped by that
dynamic era.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter, was witness to some
of the most important events of the last 40 years. He covered the
riots that swept many American cities during the summer of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Association of Black Journalists presented
Caldwell with its President's Award, saying his record of
professional achievement made him ``one of the most important
journalists in the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C.
Maynard Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and
is writing ``The Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site.

   &UR; PART 1: THE BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his

killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the

   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a

about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.

   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

`GRIZZLY FALLS': GRIZZLY BEAR AND HER BOY IN A POSTCARD FROM AFAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pretty as a picture and pious as a sermon, ``Grizzly Falls''
combines old-fashioned boys' adventure with a heavy-handed modern
lecture on parenthood. The film possesses a decent heart but
suffers from a simple mind.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Stewart Raffill (``Swiss Family Robinson'') and
written by Richard Beattie, this Canadian-British co-production is
constructed as a flashback, illustrating a story told around a
wilderness campfire by Old Harry Bankston (Richard Harris) to his
two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale of a self-absorbed parent, Tyrone (Bryan Brown),
who learns the meaning of fatherly love only when Harry, as a
little boy (Daniel Clark), is carried off into the Canadian Rockies
by an enormous female grizzly bear (Ali Oop is its professional
name) after Tyrone captures her two cubs.
</P>
<P>
   While Tyrone and his half-Indian friend, the expert tracker and
wise man Joshua McTavish Standing Bear (Tom Jackson), pursue boy
and big bear into mountainous, forested terrain cut by rushing
rivers, the boy learns to subsist on grubs and raw fish and meat as
he and the huge, slavering grizzly develop their own affectionate
child-parent relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Not for a moment is there doubt that in the end both parents
will be happily reunited with their offspring and that father and
son will be forever enriched by their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing Dickensian sentiment with Teddy Roosevelt-era costumes
and attitudes toward self-reliance and manhood, ``Grizzly Falls''
tells of Harry's youth in Chicago, where his beloved mother died of
consumption while his adventure-loving father was off in the Orient
collecting artifacts for a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Shipped off to a boarding school, the lonely child yearns for
his father's return. When that happy day arrives, the man he barely
knows whisks the boy off to the Far West, where Tyrone is mounting
an expedition to deal with his own childhood trauma by capturing a
grizzly alive.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he and Joshua have recruited a crew of ruffians,
including the nasty Genet and his pack of hunting dogs, they're off
to the wilderness, where instead of teaching a bear a lesson, the
father will learn a few.
</P>
<P>
   `Grizzly Falls' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It
includes violence and mild profanity. &QL;

<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

STUNNING VISUALS THE ONLY BEAUTY IN DREADFUL `EYE OF THE
BEHOLDER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this moronic thriller was written and
directed by the same guy who gave us that camp outback classic,
``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Stephan Elliott also gave us the egregious ``Welcome
to Woop Woop,'' which pretty much went straight to the video
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' wastes a nifty cast in an abysmal,
incoherent story. Ashley Judd, Ewan McGregor and even the French
Canadian legend Genevieve Bujold, who rarely makes movies and is
reportedly very selective about her choices, opted to take a chance
with this one.
</P>
<P>
   So you have to wonder just what happened. Did a third of the
movie end up on the editing room floor?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is it can't make up its mind what it wants
to be. Is it a stalker movie, a high-tech detective film or a
black-widow murder mystery? In a way, it's all three.
</P>
<P>
   So many inane things occur _ coupled with plot twists and
characters that spring out of the blue _ that we ultimately haven't
a clue as to who is who, or what their motivations are or their
relationships to each other.
</P>
<P>
   The press notes tell us the film is a ``surrealistic thriller
that takes a visceral journey deep into the eerie, seductive
recesses of the obsessive psyche.'' Well, they're terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' never delves deeper than its noirish
surface and McGregor, who plays surveillance expert Eye, and Judd,
who is his beautiful and elusive target, Joanna, have to to keep
running from city to city just to get to the end of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   But their labors take them nowhere and, by the absurd finale, we
know little more about these misguided, sad souls than we did in
the first five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The film may catch the eye of audiences drawn by its fine cast,
but they'll be sorely disappointed once they discover this is a
perfect example of form without content.
</P>
<P>
   The form includes visuals that are stunningly gothic and
stylish, and costumes designed by the Oscar-winning Lizzy Gardner
(she collaborated with Elliott on ``Priscilla'' and wore the
revealing American Express card dress to the awards).
</P>
<P>
   As for content, Elliott leaves the audience in the lurch by
blatantly rejecting narrative cohesiveness and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Eye of the Beholder. Directed and written by Stephan Elliott.
Cast: Ewan McGregor, Ashley Judd, k.d. lang, Patrick Bergin,
Genevieve Bujold. Destination Films. 105 minutes. Rated R for
nudity, violence.

FROM GAY BASHING TO GAY MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The notion of an hourlong drama that traces the experience of
homosexuals in America from the 1950s to the present is not
altogether promising. It invites a programmed account that goes
from harsh crackdowns to resistance, from closet practices to
comings out, from sexual shakiness to liberation. At its best
``Common Ground,'' Saturday night's ``Showtime'' production,
manages to mitigate the conventions by focusing on individuals
caught between their perplexities and society's injunctions.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, the three-parter begins with Paula Vogel's play,
``A Friend of Dorothy's,'' about a young woman who returns to
Homer, Conn., after receiving a dishonorable discharge from the
Navy for sexual deviance. The lightweight but heavy-handed script
(``I will not have filth and perversions in my home,'' announces
Dorothy's mother) is not helped by an incessantly wide-eyed
performance by Brittany Murphy and Donna Deitch's blunt direction.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Dorothy comes down with a crush on a male sailor (Jason
Priestley), who reveals, ``I'm homosexual'' and introduces her to a
gay bar, which supplies more romance than rough trade. The hopeful
ending finds Dorothy, still searching, on a bus to Greenwich
Village, where sexual identities are known to abound. So much for
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Roberts,'' Terrence McNally's more polished contribution,
carries life in Homer to the 1970s and the puzzlement of Toby
Anderson (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), a high school senior, scholar,
swimmer and pianist, who keeps being taunted and beaten up by his
classmates when they discern that he isn't like them.
</P>
<P>
   The play draws its strength from Toby's relationship with the
title character, a French teacher (Steven Weber), who is having
trouble finding the courage to emerge from his own closet. When
Toby reaches out for some sort of advice or consolation, Roberts
ducks: ``I'm sorry I'm not what you think I am.'' Their effort,
finally, to help one another reach honest understanding is
touching, if a touch predictable. ``I let you down, and I let
myself down,'' Roberts confesses.
</P>
<P>
   The third play, ``Andy and Amos,'' by Harvey Fierstein is the
slightest effort but the most successful, owing to some smart
Fierstein dialogue and his turn as a gay florist hired this year to
provide the floral arrangements for the marriage ceremony of Amos
(James Le Gros) and Andy (Andrew Airlie). The occasion provides
Homer with a cause celebre in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the work's heart is an affectionate conversation between Amos
and his father (Ed Asner), who sports a World War II uniform that,
remarkably, still fits despite what the years must have added to
his waist. Dad's boosterism prompts him to show solidarity with
some protesting veterans and a contingent of offended Roman
Catholics. But his better nature and his love for his son prevail
as he helps the younger man overcome his own misgivings about the
ceremony. Dad's point is simply that homosexuals as well as
heterosexuals are entitled to ``the wedding jitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The hour ends with a sort of commercial from the narrator: ``We
owe our lives to the generation of gays and lesbians who struggled
before us.'' All right, but as Dad says, ``Enough lecturing
already.''

`COMMON GROUND' DELIVERS WORTHWHILE LESSONS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A high school senior, gifted in athletics, confronts the
realization that he might be ``playing for the other team.'' Beaten
and brutalized by his teammates for his sexual orientation, he asks
a gay teacher: ``Do people ever stop hating you?''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, ashamed of his own failure to offer the boy support
and sympathy, replies: ``I don't think some of them can.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the intended message of ``Common Ground,'' a
collection of three short films airing Saturday on Showtime premium
cable. But, more than any other lines in the three screenplays,
they lend sharp focus to why a project such as ``Common Ground'' is
worthwhile and why Showtime deserves a bouquet for green-lighting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Paula Vogel (``How I Learned To Drive''), Terrence
McNally (``Kiss of the Spiderwoman'') and Harvey Fierstein (``Torch
Song Trilogy''), the films go together like mustard, onions and a
hot dog on the Fourth of July. And it's no accident that each takes
place in fictional Homer, Conn., the first in 1954, the next in
1974, the last in 2000. Homer is the sort of safe haven where
All-American values are always in stock at the corner store. Eric
Stoltz, as narrator Johnny Burroughs, provides the continuous
thread, observing events in Homer through the eyes of a child, then
a young father, and finally a middle-age man.
</P>
<P>
   What Johnny sees as keeper of the town commons, raiser of the
town flag, isn't always pretty, and at one point he is moved to
lament, ``Small town, smaller minds.'' But Homer's odyssey through
the second half of the 20th century isn't completely discouraging.
Attitudes do change. They just change more slowly than the
stoplight at the corner of Intolerance and Bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The first film, Vogel's ``A Friend of Dorothy,'' centers on a
young woman dishonorably discharged from the Navy for suspected
homosexual activity. Brittany Murphy gracefully plays Dorothy
Nelson, someone so naive that she knows nothing of lesbianism until
warned against it by her commanding officer (Mimi Rogers), and
nothing of the closed-mindedness that awaits her back home in
Homer. Even her mother (Margot Kidder) declares, ``I will not have
filth and perversion in my home'' as she switches on TV coverage of
the McCarthy hearings, and Dorothy realizes she must find solace
and support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Roberts,'' the second and most powerful of the films,
introduces Toby Anderson and his French teacher, Gil Roberts, who
pronounces his surname ``ro-BAIR'' because, well, he's the French
teacher and also because an alternate identity makes life seem less
threatening to a closeted gay man. In little more than half an
hour, Steven Weber, as the teacher, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas, as
the student, create a tension so dramatic, so elastic, that one
ponders the what-ifs had McNally written ``Mr. Roberts'' as a
full-length film.
</P>
<P>
   The preachiest of the films is Fierstein's ``Andy &AMP; Amos,'' a
flamboyant salute to present-day acceptance of gay couples, even by
stubborn and confused parents like Amos' dad, Ira (Edward Asner).
Ira doesn't like the idea of Amos (James Le Gros) marrying his
longtime partner, Andy (Andrew Airlie), and he even helps organize
a protest of the ceremony by the town's macho military veterans.
But when Amos experiences wedding-day jitters, Ira realizes his son
isn't so different after all.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of ``Common Ground'' will be obvious to many, but
instructive to anyone who thinks devotion to a set of values is
immutable. With elegance, power and the sort of humor often missing
from such message films, ``Common Ground'' is a fertile place to
plant the seeds of change.
</P>
<P>
   Common Ground. A collection of three short films dealing with
attitudes toward homosexuality in small-town America. Starring
Edward Asner, Beau Bridges, Harvey Fierstein, Brian Kerwin, Margot
Kidder, Dan Lauria, James Le Gros, Brittany Murphy, Jason
Priestley, Mimi Rogers, Helen Shaver, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Taylor
Thomas and Steven Weber. Saturday night on Showtime; repeating
Monday and Feb. 10. Parental guideline rating: TV-MA.

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS IN HESSE DISCLOSE MORE OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The Christian Democratic Union in the state of Hesse
said Thursday that it illegally transferred $10 million to overseas
accounts, more than double the amount it had previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Manfred Kanther, a former interior minister
and party leader in the state, said only $4.2 million had been
moved into accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, where shrewd
investment had increased the sum to more than $7 million. He later
resigned his seat in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But Roland Koch, the Christian Democratic premier in the state
of Hesse, said Thursday that a new audit showed the money
transferred was far larger than Kanther had claimed. ``This has got
to be the right figure,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily revelations of illicit financial dealings by the
opposition Christian Democrats have generated a mood of deep
political unease in Germany, exacerbated by the refusal of former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to heed the law and reveal what he knows
about the sources of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Hesse, home to Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt, has
emerged as the place where most money of uncertain origin was
secretly put to use by the party. Koch, who was elected premier
last year, painted a picture Thursday of a covert system eventually
involving more than $16.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The seed of this hidden treasure, whose origin remains unknown,
was the $10 million disclosed Thursday. This sum, whose origin
remains mysterious, was transferred in 1983 from accounts at
Metalbank in Frankfurt run by the longtime treasurer of the party
in Hesse, Prince Casimir Prinz of Sayn-Wittgenstein. It went to
accounts in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of the money _ less than $1 million _ quickly
returned to Christian Democratic accounts in Germany. The rest,
with capital gains from investment, was eventually used to
establish a foundation named ``Zaunkonig'' (or ``Wren'') in
Liechtenstein, secretly controlled by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Schnee, a spokesman for the Hesse Christian Democrats,
said that $8.8 million remained on the foundation's accounts. He
added that a recent inspection of the foundation's books revealed
that, through the years, a further $7.5 million had been moved back
into Germany, generally disguised as ``bequests.''
</P>
<P>
   These two figures, totaling $16.3 million, are the result of the
initial $10 million transfer from Frankfurt to Switzerland. ``It's
a lot of money, and we still don't know what may pop up in the next
two days,'' Schnee said.
</P>
<P>
   The party's investigation in Hesse is now focused on discovering
where the $10 million came from and ensuring that no more hidden
money surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, the party appears to have committed several
crimes: misrepresenting the source of party contributions as
``bequests,'' placing undeclared sums in overseas accounts, evading
tax on capital gains there, and failing to identify the source of
the $10 million in the original account at Metalbank.
</P>
<P>
   An audit last week of the federal accounts of the Christian
Democratic Union revealed about $6.3 million in illicit
contributions under Kohl. In all, with the $16.3 million in
unexplained money in Hesse, the Christian Democrats are grappling
with a system that generated more than $21.5 million that has not
been properly accounted for.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A further mystery surrounds the money. Of the $7.5 million taken
from the Liechtenstein foundation and transferred back into
Germany, only about $5.2 million turned up on the accounts of the
Christian Democratic party. The rest has apparently been stolen or
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of these illicit dealings led the Social Democratic
party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to seek the annulment of
Koch's election last year. But that attempt was narrowly rebuffed
this week by the Hesse legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted to taking more than $1 million in secret
payments between 1993 and 1998. But he continues to insist that he
will not identify ``donors'' to whom he promised anonymity,
flouting a law that says the source of any party contribution of
over $10,500 must be revealed.

`EYE OF THE BEHOLDER':   SHE'S A REAL KILLER, AND HE'S SMITTEN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only question worth asking about Stephan Elliott's surreal
thriller ``Eye of the Beholder,'' is whether Ashley Judd, coming
off the success of the surprise hit ``Double Jeopardy'' can draw
enough unsuspecting patrons into theaters for this impenetrable
mess of a movie to turn a profit. Ms. Judd, who was the scowling
embodiment of female vengeance in ``Double Jeopardy,'' has a
vaguely similar role in ``Eye of the Beholder.'' Here she is Joanna
Eris, a glowering, peripatetic psycho killer who changes wigs and
aliases every few minutes while cutting a deadly swath from New
York to San Francisco to Alaska with many boring stops in between.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Joanna becomes the obsessional love object of a
British intelligence agent and surveillance expert known simply as
the Eye (Ewan McGregor). The Eye, who is more than a little nuts
himself, chooses the oddest moment to fall in love. Assigned to spy
on Joanna, who may be blackmailing the son of a British government
official, he is busily filming one of their kinky assignations when
he sees her pull a knife, lunge at her blindfolded partner from
behind and repeatedly stab him in a frenzy of blood lust. From that
instant, he is hopelessly smitten. Who wouldn't be?
</P>
<P>
   As the Eye follows Joanna from city to city, always staying in
the same hotel and putting his ear to the bathroom tile to discern
her stirrings in her bubble bath beyond the wall, the Eye is
accompanied by the accusing spirit of his young daughter Lucy
(Ann-Marie Brown). Although the Eye hasn't seen Lucy in years, he
hallucinates her presence in airports and train stations where she
is always signaling for his attention. In a hotel room he is joined
by two Lucys, one playing jump-rope on the bed, the other yelling
nonsense rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   Flashbacks reveal the Eye and Joanna to share a tormented
father-daughter link. When Joanna was 9, her adored but no-account
father abandoned her on Christmas Day. The Eye's wife and daughter
likewise abandoned him when his work took over his life, and now he
is consumed with guilt and loneliness. Or so we must deduce,
McGregor's performance being so flat and devoid of feeling that his
character emerges as less than a zero.
</P>
<P>
   You can see what the director is trying to get at in this clumsy
screen adaptation of Marc Behm's 1980 noir novel. Especially in a
scene where the Eye hides out in a San Francisco bell tower, the
movie wants to be a souped-up, serial-killing ``Vertigo,'' with a
big dash of ``Obsession'' thrown in. But Elliott, who made his
reputation with ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert'' and followed it with the chaotic black comedy ``Welcome to
Woop Woop,'' hasn't the temperament for noir movies.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea of how to establish a mood of menace or to use a
setting to evoke an emotional landscape. Everything from the
movie's sudden abrasive intrusions of fake thunder and lightning to
Lucy's jarring appearances in the Eye's life is a garish surface
effect. Instead of Bernard Herrmann's fractured Wagnerian
orchestrations for Alfred Hitchcock, the score for ``Eye of the
Beholder'' pounds us with the usual electronic cliches. The voice
of Chrissie Hynde whining ``I Wish You Love,'' which becomes a
recurrent refrain, is more an annoyance than a haunting theme.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Judd, at least, emerges from this fiasco with her dignity
intact. Her role may make no psychological sense, but as she acts
out Joanna's crazy personality changes, from cunning femme fatale
to a gender-reversed Norman Bates, she is clearly giving her all to
an unsalvageable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of gory
violence and some nudity.

`RESTAURANT': A MOVIE WITH A LOT TO SAY ABOUT AMBITION, FRIENDSHIP
AND RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Restaurant'' is the kind of movie that deftly registers the
self-conscious gawkiness people exhibit at weddings, especially
when they're dancing. It's a movie that attends to the tones and
rhythms of a stoned late-night conversation between old friends, to
the hectic clatter of a restaurant kitchen on a busy weekend night
and to the edgy, exhausted buzz of an impromptu after-hours party
in a crowded apartment. It pauses to record, with admirable tact
and affection, the pillow talk of young lovers after their first
night together, and it does not flinch from the tears and
accusations that ensue when things begin to go wrong between them.
</P>
<P>
   Because Eric Bross, who directed ``Restaurant,'' and Tom
Cudworth, who wrote the screenplay, pay such close attention to the
details of their story, they manage, more often than not, to get
the big themes right. This is a movie with a lot to say about
class, about friendship, about ambition and about race, but it does
its talking, for the most part, through the experiences of its
characters and the particularities of its northern North Jersey
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurant'' tracks the hectic interactions of a group of
friends who work at a swank Hoboken bar and grill called J.T.
McClure's. Their haphazard community is thick with emotional
complications, and the movie sometimes feels burdened with too many
story lines. But then again, so does life, especially if you're
Chris Calloway (Adrien Brody), an aspiring playwright whose moral
struggles constitute the film's narrative core.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the movie, Chris, a recovering alcoholic,
has fallen off the wagon and placed a desperate late-night phone
call to his former girlfriend, Leslie (Lauryn Hill _ yes, that
Lauryn Hill), who broke his heart when she slept with one of his
friends, a rakish actor named Kenny (Simon Baker-Denny). Chris'
relationship with Leslie is the subject of his latest play, and to
his chagrin Kenny is cast in the lead role. But soon Chris is
distracted by the arrival of Jeanine (Elise Neal), a newly hired
waitress who wants to be a singer and who is plenty complicated in
her own right. Meanwhile, a hostess is about to be married, the
other bartender is looking for a new roommate and Reggae (David
Moscow), Chris' childhood friend from the old neighborhood (the
Ironbound section of Newark, a mostly white working-class enclave),
is exhibiting worrisome self-destructive tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leslie, Jeanine is black. Chris and Reggae are white.
Nobody in the movie makes a big deal out of this, although Chris
likes to imagine his bigoted father rolling over in his grave. For
its first third, ``Restaurant'' feels like a well-made romantic
comedy, or an especially naturalistic pilot for a new young-adult
melodrama on the WB network, in part because it features a number
of actors whose faces have appeared on shows like ``Zoe, Duncan,
Jack and Jane,'' ``The Hughleys,'' ``Malcolm and Eddie'' and ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Television, of course, rarely allows its fresh young black faces
to share screen time _ to say nothing of pillow talk _ with its
fresh young white faces. But ``Restaurant'' especially in its
fluid, fast-moving early sequences, matter &UR; - &LR; of &UR; - &LR; factly presents a
milieu in which a number of taboos _ against smoking marijuana in
public, against using certain racially inflammatory words, against
interracial love _ seem to have disappeared. Not that race is not
an issue in the film, but it's not, in the usual Hollywood sense,
an Issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurant'' allows its racial themes to emerge slowly. It
depicts a world in which race doesn't seem to matter at all, except
when, for reasons no one quite understands and with consequences no
one can control, it matters a lot. The three line cooks at
McClure's _ Reggae, Quincy (Jesse L. Martin) and Marcus (Vonte
Sweet) _ happily exchange playful banter and hang out together
after work.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually we learn that Reggae, the head line cook, makes
more money than his friends. In spite of this, Marcus and Quincy
feel a greater bond with Reggae than with Chris, the conscientious
liberal, or with Steven (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), a black law student
who works as a waiter and whom they sneeringly call ``white boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven is not white enough to be promoted to bartender,
despite his enthusiasm and his qualifications; when he is, it's
only after Chris confronts the manager (John Carroll Lynch). But
this intervention, while it is an occasion for honest gratitude on
Steven's part and self-congratulation on Chris', also resonates
with undertones of paternalism, resentment and shame.
</P>
<P>
   It takes very good actors to convey this kind of nuance, and the
cast of ``Restaurant'' does consistently splendid work. Bross'
camera moves as efficiently and smoothly as Cudworth's understated
script. Unfortunately, as the movie nears its end, the filmmakers
lose touch with their better storytelling instincts, and it falls
to the actors to prevent the movie from swerving into melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Its climax seems to come out of nowhere, or rather out of too
many viewings of ``Mean Streets'' and ``Do the Right Thing,'' and
its desperate turn to random violence and emotional extremity
nearly spoils the careful sense of proportion that had been the
film's greatest strength. But at its best, this is a movie of
unusual integrity and insight.

GOLDEN GLOBES AS CRYSTAL BALLS 
IVY LEAGUE INTRIGUE 
`SCREAM' DYING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Producers, studio executives and agents agree that
in a town of often odd events, the Golden Globes ceremony ranks
quite high as one of the oddest.
</P>
<P>
   The annual nationally televised award show on NBC, presented
last Sunday, is often seen as a harbinger of the Academy Awards.
But the track record of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,
which gives the awards, is mixed. And the organization itself, with
only 82 voting members, some of them freelance writers with only
vague journalistic connections, is treated with a shrug and a
certain humor by the Hollywood elite.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, though, Hollywood treats the Golden Globes
seriously, sort of. ``They are important because they are seen as a
bellwether for the Academy Awards,'' said Terry Press, in charge of
marketing at DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Press was speaking, perhaps, with a bit of wishful thinking.
The DreamWorks film ``American Beauty,'' starring Kevin Spacey and
Annette Bening , took home three of the top awards at the Golden
Globes ceremony. The awards were for the best drama, for the
director, Sam Mendes, and the screenwriter, Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Even though only four of the 13 Golden Globe winners went on to
win Academy Awards last year and even though the organization
itself is a bit offbeat _ ``Feed them, and they will come,'' said
one studio publicity agent about the Foreign Press Association _ a
triumph at the Globes is an important ingredient as the Oscar
season moves into high gear. (The nominations for the 72nd annual
Academy Awards will be announced on Feb. 15, and Oscars will be
presented on March 26.)
</P>
<P>
   One day after winning best picture in the drama category for
``American Beauty,'' DreamWorks announced that it was re-releasing
the movie at 750 theaters around the nation. At the same time
DreamWorks made plans to promote the film, which is now, at least
for the moment, the front-runner in the best film category.
Potential rivals include ``The Insider,'' ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'' and ``Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Press said the notion of being seen as a front-runner
appalled her and the company. Last year DreamWorks was seen for
months as the front-runner for Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' But after a savvy and high-priced marketing campaign by
Miramax, its ``Shakespeare in Love'' won the Oscar for best
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume nothing now,'' said Ms. Press. ``We're grateful to
have won the Golden Globes. But I'm not going to repeat the sins of
last year. We've been there. We've been front-runner before. This
is our second time around with this. It didn't work out last year
and we're not counting on anything this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, Ms. Press said that DreamWorks got caught up in the
competition with Miramax last year and may have overspent on the
Academy Award campaign on trade paper and newspaper advertisements.
This year, she said, that will not happen. ``We'll have a presence,
but a restrained and tasteful presence,'' Ms. Press insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which earns
substantial sums from its telecast, is struggling to gain
credibility. Years ago gifts and free trips from studios were
commonplace. Last month though, Sharon Stone, who was up for an
acting award for ``The Muse,'' sent watches worth $295 to $395 to
the 82 members of the association. Helmut Voss, the president of
the group, returned them. ``We were touched by her generosity, but
this is definitely a no-no for a group like ours to protect the
integrity of the awards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone failed to pick up a Golden Globe this year. But
another actress, Angelina Jolie, who won a supporting actress award
for ``Girl Interrupted,'' thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press and
said: ``You guys are so kind to me. Like I must be paying you or
something!''
</P>
<P>
   Ivy League Intrigue
</P>
<P>
   John Pogue, Yale, class of '87, joined a secret society in his
senior year. ``I can't tell you which one,'' said Pogue. Rob Cohen,
Harvard, '71, never joined one of the school's private eating
clubs. ``A guy with the name of Cohen didn't get invited to join
too often back then,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Using their experience and knowledge of the Ivy League elite,
the two men have created a thriller, ``The Skulls,'' about an
overachieving and poor New Haven townie who joins an elitist secret
society called the Skulls, which has members including lawmakers,
business executives and top government officials. The film _
written by Pogue and directed by Cohen _ opens on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie is fiction _ there is a suicide and assorted
mayhem _ ``The Skulls'' was created to use the secret Ivy League
bastions of privilege as a backdrop for a drama about corruption.
Cohen, who previously directed ``The Rat Pack'' for HBO, said he
became interested years ago in Skull and Bones at Yale as well as
other clubs while researching a project about the Central
Intelligence Agency. Cohen said that many CIA directors and top
officials _ as well as Supreme Court justices, chief executives at
Fortune 500 companies and diplomats _ were members of Skull and
Bones and played a significant role in shaping American society,
especially since the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys were classmates and soul mates,'' said Cohen.
``They linked up in their college years, and stayed in a very tight
web throughout their lives to create American society in their own
image.''
</P>
<P>
   (President Bush was a member of Skull and Bones, and so was his
son George W. Bush, the Texas governor and Republican presidential
candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   Pogue, who wrote ``U.S. Marshalls,'' said he became aware of the
secret ways of Skull and Bones in his freshman year at Yale when he
visited one of his advisers, a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some problems I wanted to talk about,'' Pogue said. ``I
noticed that he had a gold pin inadvertently sticking out beneath
his shirt, and I said, quite innocently, `Are you in Skull and
Bones?' He turned away very cold. He said, `We'll have to talk
about your problems later.' He left the room. Clearly his
allegiance to his secret society was more important than his job
helping freshmen out. It sort of irritated me.''
</P>
<P>
   But why did Pogue himself join a secret society in his senior
year. ``It was a curiosity mixed with a strong desire to see who
was in them,'' he said. ``I wanted to know what went on inside
those stone temples that were all over the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stereotype to say they were all Boston Brahmin, all
from Phillips Academy. They take them from every race and color.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pogue's depiction of the secret clubs in the movie was
hardly positive. ``Maybe it was hypocritical, on my part, to
join,'' Pogue said. ``In retrospect, it probably was. I was just
intrigued.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `Scream' Dying
</P>
<P>
   The violent, witty and weird ``Scream'' trilogy is drawing to a
close, and Wes Craven, the horrormeister and director of all three
films, insisted he was happy. ``We always said it would be a
trilogy,'' said Craven, whose new film, ``Scream 3,'' opens on Feb.
4. ``The trilogy completes our theme: Real life is reflected in
movies and movies reflect real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two earlier movies, with their teen-age and 20-something
audiences, have taken in more than $100 million each at the box
office. These are probably the most lucrative films ever made by
Miramax, which usually releases arty films. (Miramax created a
separate unit, Dimension Films, to release movies like ``Scream.'')
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the success of the series so far is based on its
shrewd casting of popular actors mostly from television shows who
appeal to the teen crowd. While previous horror films were often
made up of unknown young actors as well as older ones, the third
``Scream'' reunites Craven with David Arquette, Neve Campbell and
Courteney Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horror films until recently would be populated by first-time
actors and actresses and maybe an older star for the European
market,'' Craven said. ``You could always get Telly Savalas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the newest ``Scream,'' the lines are blurred between fiction
and a vague sense of reality. The film takes place during a
Hollywood production of ``Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro,'' a thriller
that asks questions about the murderous events that took place in
the town that was the setting of the earlier films.
</P>
<P>
   Why the success of the ``Scream'' films? ``They're actually very
contemporary films,'' Craven said. ``There's the sense in these
movies that we need to look no further than the people we know in
looking for the real villain. In most horror films, you have
supernatural mysterious figures like Jason or Freddy. In the case
of `Scream,' the villains are real people, well-known to the
victims, their contemporaries. It makes them somehow more
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The films also have a quick wit about popular culture,'' he
said. ``The names of famous people and famous movies are used. It's
closer to our own reality than the fabricated reality of making up
the names of movies.''

`THE CUP': TV AND SOCCER INVADE A BUDDHIST MONASTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the opening credits of ``The Cup,'' the camera pans
across the surface of a mani stone, a sacred object for adherents
of Tibetan Buddhism, on which prayers are inscribed in elegant,
stylized script. A few minutes later, in the dusty courtyard of a
Tibetan monastery-in-exile, the camera notices another object,
whose surface is decorated with stylized script of another kind: a
Coca-Cola can.
</P>
<P>
   The can, which is being used as a soccer ball by a group of
young monks, soon finds its way into the hands of Geko, a stern
older monk who, if this were a Hollywood high school comedy, would
be the assistant principal. Geko (Orgyen Tobgyal) brings it to the
monastery's kindly, absent-minded abbot. It ends up in the hut of
an eccentric lama, who fashions it into a candleholder for the
makeshift altar in his hut. It has evolved into a sacred object.
</P>
<P>
   This empty soda can might serve as an apt metaphor for the
film's wry perspective on the relationship between the sacred and
the profane, and for its understated approach to the phenomenon of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The penetration of Western consumer culture into remote corners
of the world tends to be viewed, simplistically, as either cause
for celebration or for alarm, a force that will either sweep away
outmoded traditions or destroy ancient, fragile systems of custom
and belief.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Cup,'' which chronicles the arrival of television in
the closed world of the monastery, finds ironies and nuances in the
encounter between modernity and tradition that media critics rarely
notice.
</P>
<P>
   The young monks, played by the residents of an actual monastery
in the tiny Himalayan nation of Bhutan, have devoted their lives to
an ancient religious tradition predicated on rigorous spiritual
discipline. They are also rambunctious, spirited adolescent boys,
who scrawl graffiti on the walls, play pranks on each other during
prayer sessions and do whatever they can to outwit the vigilant
Geko.
</P>
<P>
   He and the abbot, who happens to be a devoted collector of
postcards from around the world, strive to protect them from
outside influences.
</P>
<P>
   But their charges are obsessed with soccer. Beneath his red and
orange monastic robes (``a 2,500-year-old fashion,'' one of his
friends dryly remarks), a runty 14-year-old named Orgyen (Jamyang
Lodro) sports a tank top on which he has emblazoned the name and
number of Ronaldo, the Brazilian star.
</P>
<P>
   Orgyen's tiny room is plastered with photographs clipped from
soccer magazines, and he is the ringleader of an elaborate plan to
haul a satellite dish and a television set onto the premises in
time for the 1998 World Cup final between Brazil and France.
</P>
<P>
   Geko at first disapproves of the boys' plan but soon finds
himself explaining international sports _ ``two civilized nations
fighting over a ball'' _ to the bemused abbot, who decides that it
sounds pretty harmless, as long as there's no sex involved.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Tibet are admired around the world for their
heroic resistance to Chinese domination, and ``The Cup'' has a
quiet political urgency, as well as a luminous air of religious
conviction. It is also a very funny movie, alive with a sense of
absurdity and human foible.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, especially the deadpan Tobygal (an eminent Tibetan
theologian) and Lodro (his son and a monk), have flawless comic
timing. If he were not pledged to a higher calling, Lodro could
become an international child movie star.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps he could anyway. Khyentse Norbu, who wrote and
directed ``The Cup,'' has clearly found a way to balance his
evident love of movies with his own religious obligations. Norbu,
trained in Buddhist philosophy, is spiritual director of several
Buddhist colleges and meditation centers in India, Bhutan and
Sikkim, and is recognized in his culture as the third incarnation
of a leading 19th-century lama. ``The Cup,'' his first feature,
proves that he is also a born filmmaker. &QL;

`BETWEEN FATHER AND SON': HOW NAIPAUL'S BITTERSWEET NOVEL GOT THAT
WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most collections of a writer's youthful correspondence,
this volume of letters between V.S. Naipaul, then a college student
on scholarship at Oxford, and his family back home in Trinidad
draws a telling portrait of the artist as a young man. At the same
time, the book provides a fascinating map to the autobiographical
underpinnings of what is arguably Naipaul's finest novel, ``A House
for Mr. Biswas'' (1961), which created a bittersweet fictional
portrait of his father, a struggling Trinidadian journalist trying
to support his large family while holding onto his own dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That novel closed with the aging, ailing hero worrying about his
precocious son in England. ``Anand's letters, at first rare, became
more and more frequent,'' Naipaul wrote in ``Mr. Biswas.'' ``They
were gloomy, self-pitying; then they were tinged with a hysteria
which Mr. Biswas immediately understood. He wrote Anand long
humorous letters; he wrote about the garden; he gave religious
advice; at great expense he sent by air mail a book called
`Outwitting Our Nerves' by two American women psychologists.
Anand's letters grew rare again. There was nothing Mr. Biswas could
do but wait.'' The world had opened for his son, he realizes, while
for him now, ``there was nothing to wait for. Except the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   As this volume of letters reveals, that passage from ``Mr.
Biswas'' perfectly captures the relationship that existed between
Naipaul and his father in the early 1950s: the father, increasingly
burdened with financial woes and failing health, transferring his
own dreams of literary success to his talented son; the son, torn
between self-absorption and familial concern, writing home out of
duty, need and affection.
</P>
<P>
   Although we see spasms of self-doubt on the part of the young
Naipaul, he already evinces, in these letters, many of the traits
that would later make him so controversial as a writer: an
impatient elitism (``people outside are perhaps even stupider than
Oxford people, and incredibly coarser'') and a judgmental
dismissiveness: Austen's ``Emma'' is written off as ``mere
gossip,'' Conrad's ``Lord Jim'' as ``dull,'' and Tolstoy's ``Anna
Karenina'' as ``tedious.'' ``A friend told me the other day that
people don't like me,'' he writes his older sister Kamla, ``because
I made them feel that I knew they were fools.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier letters, dating from Naipaul's arrival in 1950 at
Oxford, his father tends to be the one dispensing advice: he warns
his son not to give in to depression and exhorts him to be sincere
in his writing. ``What do you think literature boils down to?'' he
asks. ``To writing from the belly rather than from the cheek. Most
people write from the cheek. If the semi-illiterate criminal wrote
a long letter ordinarily to his sweetheart, it would be what most
letters of such people generally are. If the criminal wrote this
letter last thing before his execution, it would be literature; it
would be poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   As time passes and Naipaul settles into his studies, however, it
becomes clear that his relationship with his father has begun to
change. For a time they write to each other as colleagues, as two
writers, grappling with the frustrations of their craft, each
encouraging the other to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   While Naipaul's ambition is all too apparent _ he is already
working on a novel, even as he crams for exams _ his father grows
increasingly weary, ``hemmed in by hard, unescapable facts'' and
the demands of supporting a wife and seven children on a salary of
$165 a month. His requests for help in getting his stories
published in England sound more and more plaintive, and in 1952 he
effectively passes the literary torch to his son, pledging to
support him after his graduation from Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to have that chance which I have never had,'' he
writes, ``somebody to support me and mine while I write. Two or
three years of this should be enough. If by then you have not
arrived, then it will be time enough for you to see about getting a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Naipaul, on his part, increasingly identifies with his father.
``As I grow older,'' he writes his sister Kamla, ``I find myself
doing things that remind me of Pa, more and more. The way I smoke;
the way I sit; the way I stroke my unshaved chin; the way in which
I sometimes sit bolt upright; the way in which I spend money
romantically and foolishly. I am afraid Pa won't like this. For he
will presently have no secrets from me. The more I learn about
myself, the more I learn about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a successful writer was, for Naipaul, a way of paying
homage to his father and his father's dreams, and it was also a way
for him to escape his provincial past. Though the most lyrical
passages in Naipaul's otherwise flatly written letters attest to
his nostalgia for home (``I long for the nights that fall blackly,
suddenly, without warning,'' he writes his father. ``I long for a
violent shower of rain at night''), he remains contemptuous of
Trinidad as one of those countries he would later describe as
``half-made'' societies ``doomed to remain half-made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I shall die if I had to spend the rest of my life in
Trinidad,'' he writes his mother. ``The place is too small, the
values are all wrong, and the people are petty. Besides, there is
really very little for me to do there.'' Despite promises to visit
his family, he will not return home for six years, by which time he
has sold two books, ``The Mystic Masseur'' and ``Miguel Street,''
and launched himself on a successful literary career. By then his
father, like Mr. Biswas, is dead from heart problems at the age of
47.

`THE BIG TEASE': HOLLYWOOD MOCKUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nuclear missiles could be zooming in all directions and
earthquakes and plagues devastating the planet, but as everybody
(especially in Hollywood) knows, there's nothing worse than a bad
hair day. Joan Rivers would understand. Beyond cosmetic surgery and
selecting the right dress, a woman's choice of hair color and style
can spell the crowning difference between being deemed a lady or a
tramp while making that perilous journey down the red carpet into
the awards show ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of awards, forget the Oscars and the Golden Globes!
The only Hollywood competition that really matters is the World
Freestyle Hairdressing Championship. Never heard of it? Well, ``The
Big Tease,'' a campy, moderately amusing new comedy, will take you
behind the scenes at this ultraexclusive event in which the world's
leading hair stylists battle tooth and nail, comb and curler, for
the Platinum Scissors Award, a priceless pair of gleaming shears
once possessed by Czar Nicholas II of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And wait till you see their creations! More than mere hairdos,
they resemble elaborate window displays teetering precariously atop
plumes that have been teased, sprayed, glued and lacquered into
unsinkable vessels bearing enough tchotchkes to fill an F.A.O.
Schwarz window at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks: If you have overdosed on the preening
narcissism and nutty hyperbole of recent Hollywood awards
ceremonies and their surrounding hoopla, this funny but ramshackle
movie might be the purgative you need. A mock documentary directed
by Kevin Allen, ``The Big Tease'' follows Crawford Mackenzie (Craig
Ferguson), an indefatigably cheerful hairdresser from Glasgow,
Scotland, all the way to Los Angeles, where he arrives under the
mistaken impression that he is an official contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Although continually patronized and humiliated, with doors
slammed in his face and receivers clicking in his ear, Crawford,
with his can-do spirit and boundless enthusiasm, eventually melts
the hearts of the officious Hollywood handlers who stand in his way
and whom the movie assesses with a cheerfully withering eye.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's chief sources of humor is its extreme case of
tunnel vision, which mirrors that of its main character. ``The Big
Tease,'' which is being smartly promoted by Warner Brothers as
``Rocky in Curlers,'' never questions Crawford's values, which are
finally as dubious as those of the snooty entertainment
professionals he charms. Its other biggest asset is Ferguson, the
popular Scottish comedian who plays Drew Carey's boss on television
(Carey puts in a cameo appearance) and who wrote the screenplay
with Sacha Gervasi. Ferguson's Crawford is an original: a
blustering party-loving bloke who is gay but sleeps with a woman
when the occasion demands, although afterward she wonders why he
kept murmuring the name Gareth (his Glasgow boyfriend) during
lovemaking.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner has Crawford's plane touched down than the procession
of Hollywood caricatures begins. There's a goonish limo driver and
self-described ``player'' peddling a screenplay about aliens and
basketball. There's the hotel clerk impressed by Crawford's
Scottish accent who blurts, ``I love the Beatles,'' and the nutty
hotel manager who lectures Crawford about his ``fiscal
responsibility'' when it turns out the competition isn't paying for
his fancy hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford makes some headway by trading on a distant connection
with his fellow Scot Sean Connery, whose publicist, Candy Harper
(Frances Fisher), he wins over by giving her an in-office follicle
makeover. Eternally grateful for the restoration of her
self-esteem, Candy begins pulling strings and opening doors. Ms.
Fisher makes this obnoxious powermonger _ the kind of person who
boasts, ``This is MY town'' _ into someone almost lovable.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking on the outskirts of the movie, which increasingly
forgets to act like a mockumentary, is the dour filmmaker (Chris
Langham) whose movie about Crawford for British television is a big
change of pace from his usual fare, which normally deals with
issues like poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Big Tease'' sustains an antic mood, it is crudely
edited (most of an extended disco sequence seems to have landed on
the cutting-room floor), and its closest thing to a villain, a
hulking Scandinavian hairdresser named Stig (David Rasche) who is
Crawford's rival for the Platinum Scissors, doesn't work as a
character. Still, ``The Big Tease'' is diverting. As it rubs our
noses in our own fascination with vanity and the silliest values in
life, it's charming enough to make us like it.

`TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON': FAULTY PRODUCTION IS STILL WORTH
SEEING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Teahouse of the August Moon,'' set in 1946, is about a
poor American Army slob who has never been able to do any job
right. His latest assignment is to Americanize a small village on
occupied Okinawa, but he is talked into building a teahouse instead
of a schoolhouse and into selling particularly potent sweet-potato
brandy for profit. He is the one who ends up being taught _ that
there may be something superior about a culture that makes a daily
ritual of sitting in the pine grove, sipping tea and watching the
sunset.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, he declares that he has taken ``a step backward in
the right direction.'' (In 1953, when John Patrick's play was first
staged on Broadway, this was, believe it or not, high transcultural
praise.)
</P>
<P>
   Take that and the fact that the movie version is notorious
because Marlon Brando was cast as the Asian interpreter, and you
can see why the Pan Asian Repertory Theater wanted to revive this
work. Unfortunately, the production is a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Abuba, who is Asian-American, does a fine job as the
interpreter, Sakini. Scott Klavan is lovable and funny as Fisby,
the pushover American captain. John Daggett as Captain McLean, the
psychiatrist who would rather be reading seed catalogs, has a
couple of nice moments. But a few cast members are absolutely
wooden, letting Tony-winning, Pulitzer Prize-winning jokes die on
the vine. A goat puppet, playing the role of a live goat, gets some
of the most heartfelt laughs, and it's not THAT cute.
</P>
<P>
   But even a faulty production of ``The Teahouse of the August
Moon'' is almost worth seeing, just for the play's juxtaposition of
ahead-of-its-time awareness and cultural stereotyping. (All the
Okinawan characters speak without verbs: ``Pornography question of
geography.'') Colonel Purdy (Peter Von Berg) says things like
``You'll find these people lack the capacity for sustained
endeavor,'' and when Fisby volunteers to study the local dialect,
Purdy dismisses that idea in the blink of an eye. ``No need,'' he
says. ``We won the war.'' But the colonel has always been the
villain, and he is proved wrong at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning the play seems to show Okinawans as fatuous
manipulators and Americans as blithering idiots, but the humanity
on both sides soon shines through. Fisby learns that geishas are
not prostitutes, and he learns to be happy working in a bathrobe,
which is as close as he can come to a kimono. His final
realization, to the horror of his superiors, is that by making all
the villagers members of the brewing cooperative, he has actually
brought communism to Okinawa. That observation was left out of the
1956 movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Teahouse of the August Moon'' is directed by Ron Nakahara,
with attractive, inventive sets by Robert Klingelhoefer. It
continues at Playhouse 91 through Feb. 13.

`SANTITOS': WHY A YOUNG WIDOW WENT NOBLY INTO BROTHELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things are not dull at Padre Salvador's confessional, especially
after Esperanza Diaz, a lovely young widow, starts dropping by so
often. By the middle of ``Santitos,'' a disarmingly endearing film
from Mexico, Esperanza is confessing about her activities at more
than one brothel.
</P>
<P>
   The padre (Fernando Torre Lapham) would rather be back in his
room watching his favorite telenovela, but the male parishioners,
who stand impolitely close to the confessional, are fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when Esperanza (Dolores Heredia) saw St. Jude
through the dirty window of her oven. (``Thank God I ran out of
Easy Off &UR; , &LR; '' she tells the priest.) The saint spoke to her,
informing her that Blanca, her 12-year-old daughter, was not dead
after all and could be found in ``La Casa Rosa'' (the pink house).
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza, who lives with another widow (Ana Bertha Espin), is
beside herself with joy. Her daughter's recent death had been
suspicious anyway. Blanca (Maya Zapata) had gone into the hospital
just to have her tonsils out. But she suddenly died of ``an unknown
virus,'' the doctor said, which was why the coffin had to be
sealed. So Esperanza never saw her daughter's body.
</P>
<P>
   After St. Jude starts appearing, Esperanza will stop at nothing
to find out the truth. This leads her to the hospital (where she
learns that Blanca's doctor disappeared right after the girl's
supposed death), to the cemetery (where, denied an exhumation
order, she goes grave digging in the middle of the night) and to a
cleaning job at a local brothel (because she has been told that
young girls are sometimes kidnapped and sold into prostitution).
</P>
<P>
   When she hears about a house of ill repute called La Casa Rosa
in Tijuana, Esperanza is on her way to new adventures. They will
involve prostitution on her part, a French provincial waterbed, a
secret room, a rich client from California, a gray-haired madam who
has the look of a ladylike drag queen (understandably, since she is
played by Roberto Cobo), an illegal border crossing and a wrestler
called the Angel of Justice, who doesn't like to take off his mask.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the story goes astray, and the last half-hour or so
is disappointingly banal, but it makes a nice recovery at the very
end.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of ``Santitos,'' which was shown at last year's
Sundance Film Festival, is its knowing but joyous life-affirming
tone. Both the director, Alejandro Springall, and the screenwriter,
Maria Amparo Escandon, have done well by Ms. Escandon's novel, on
which the film is based.
</P>
<P>
   But a great deal of credit should also go to Ms. Heredia, a
Mexican actress who lives in Switzerland, for making Esperanza's
common-sense faith and bright innocence believable, and admirable,
from beginning to end.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A batch of wintry precipitation, mainly in the form of ice
pellets, moved across northern Texas on Thursday morning as a
potent jet stream disturbance approached from eastern New Mexico.
Snow fell in Oklahoma and Arkansas, where a deep layer of cold air
prevailed above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, broken areas of light to moderate wintry precipitation
will affect an area ranging from the lower Mississippi and
Tennessee valleys to the southern Appalachians as the disturbance
lifts northeast and gradually weakens. However, a narrow swath of
locally heavy snow could affect the Tennessee Valley, where a
surface trough of low pressure reaching north from the Gulf of
Mexico enhances the lifting of moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of light to moderate snow will develop over the lower
Ohio Valley, but its northeastward advance will be checked by a
robust high pressure system over the upper Ohio Valley. Meanwhile,
showers will spread toward Florida from southern Mississippi as a
low pressure system grinds eastward. Rainfalls of an inch are
possible near the Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous combinations of Arctic air and strong winds will
prevail across New England, which will stay in the windy, frigid
wake of a low pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes. Wind and
Arctic chill will ease Saturday as the weakening low heads toward
the Labrador Sea.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of accumulating snows will blanket parts of the Missouri
Valley as an upper-level low lifts moist air drawn northwestward
from the Tennessee Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow Legacy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the snow cover left by this week's storm can have
important effects on temperature. Newly fallen snow reflects up to
90 percent of the energy from the sun, resulting in daytime
temperatures a few degrees colder than when the ground is bare. On
a clear and calm night, the snow aids in the process that radiates
energy away from the earth, allowing temperatures to fall more
sharply. This weekend, the snow cover in valleys near the southern
Appalachians will help keep the air near the ground chilled,
heightening the risk of an ice storm as moisture arrives from the
south. &QL;

&HT;     BOXER VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. CITIZENSHIP FOR CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND and MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer pledged Thursday to block any
legislation to grant U.S. citizenship to Elian Gonzalez, saying
efforts to keep the Cuban boy in this country amount to ``child
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, D-Calif., said in an interview that ``it's just
horrible'' that the 6-year-old boy ``has been made a political
pawn'' in American-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the
American relatives of Gonzalez to return the boy to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba. Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the
time, was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida
on Nov. 25 after the boat carrying him to the United States
capsized, killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing to this child is causing him to suffer
another loss on top of this incredible loss of watching his mother
die before his very eyes,'' Boxer said. ``Now as a result of U.S.
action we're going to say he's going to lose his father? This is
child abuse in my opinion. This is not right. This is untenable. If
you really believe in family values you wouldn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the boy should be back in Cuba with his father as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's young enough that after time this memory will be
put into some kind of perspective,'' she said. ``The longer this
goes on, the more traumatic this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said she
continued to be willing to work with the family to reach a
compromise, but the government's decision to return the boy to Cuba
would not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we recognize that what is at stake
here is a bond between a parent and his child, and that in almost
every legal system I know, certainly in ours, (that bond) is
something that is interrupted only in extreme circumstances,'' she
said at her weekly new conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno declined to say whether the Justice Department
would fight the citizenship legislation, she made clear her
opposition to any such action by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American children ended up abroad, and American parents
wanted them returned, and a foreign country made them a citizen so
they did not return, I don't think people in the United States
would be very happy about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., is pushing legislation to grant
citizenship to the boy, but Boxer said she doubts there is enough
support in the Senate to approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's unclear whether he'll bring this to the
floor,'' said Boxer, who vowed to filibuster the citizenship bill
if there were a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who has one grandchild, said she empathizes with
Gonzalez's grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, who
returned to Capitol Hill Thursday with a tearful plea to have their
grandson returned to Cuba. Boxer said she met with the women on
Tuesday and got ``a strong feeling that this is from their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Quintana spent Thursday pressing their case with
lawmakers on Capitol Hill while at the same time, American
relatives of the boy urged Congress to approve the citizenship
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters through a translator in a hallway,
Quintana said she and Rodriguez ``have been suffering a lot'' since
they met with their grandson on Wednesday in Miami. ``Our grandson
is a whole different boy. He has changed completely. They are doing
something to him that has changed the child,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
   Quintana said her grandson was very shy at first but ``became
more interested'' after they showed him photos of his friends and
family in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to save this child as soon as possible to bring him
back to his family and father in Cuba,'' Quintana said, adding that
is the only way he will ``recover and be the happy boy he was
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintana added that when the grandmothers told the boy they want
to bring him back home, ``he nodded his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the grandmothers ``are under tremendous stress and
strain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that this isn't doing any good for the
anti-Castro cause,'' Boxer said. ``They're looking as if they'll do
anything for politics and ideology. You have to put a little boy's
health and safety before politics. They ought to take their stand
on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with the Cuban
government of Fidel Castro. Gonzalez's relatives in Florida are
fighting to prevent his return to Cuba.

WEB SITES CALL ATTENTION TO ALL RELIGIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies in fourth from last graf that Max Waldman was Steve's
grandfather.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking old-time religion (or New Age spirituality) on line can
be a hellish business of sifting through myriad sites as diverse as
the homepage of a Minnesota-based sect that practices ``spiritual
dreaming'' and the official Web site of the Holy See. With Yahoo
listing almost 7,500 Christian sites alone, cyberspace promises as
much daunting journey as heaven-sent opportunity for believers and
searchers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Now, striding boldly into this on-line chaos comes
Beliefnet.com, thought to be the first Web site to attempt to
encompass all of the world's principal religions and belief
systems. Launched this month by two journalists with strong roots
in traditional print media, Beliefnet targets a multifaith audience
with a slickly packaged magazine-style mix of news and advice and
inspirational writing from a panoply of religious perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that Beliefnet will be a place where adults and
children alike can find answers to some of life's stickiest
questions,'' says co-founder Steven Waldman, former editor of US
News &AMP; World Report, ``or at least find other people similiarly
baffled, curious, or in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Beliefnet has attracted more than $5 million of start-up capital
and a Who's Who of regular writers, ranging from liberal Catholic
sociologist and novelist Rev. Andrew Greeley to Harvard theologian
Harvey Cox, from conservative Catholic Tom Bethell of American
Spectator magazine to rabbinical writer Joseph Telushkin, from
American Buddhist lama Surya Das of Cambridge to National Public
Radio correspondent and Wicca priestess Margot Adler.
</P>
<P>
   Based in New York, it's the brainchild of Waldman, 37, and
Robert Nylen, 55, founding publisher of the former New England
Monthly, who shuttles between a Manhattan apartment and his home in
Ashfield.
</P>
<P>
   While providing a site for all those ``sticky'' questions, they
also devoutly hope to make money in the process. In an on-line
world where most religion sites are ``dot.org,'' not ``dot.com,''
Beliefnet is a for-profit venture. An estimated 25 million
Americans regularly peruse the Internet for religious information,
and Waldman and Nylen want to tap that potential market with an
e-commerce component scheduled to go on line in the spring. They
expect to sell and advertise inspirational books, tapes, videos,
and CDs as well as holistic health products and trips with a
religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate doing tens of millions dollars in business
within five years,'' says Nylen.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's sound prediction or fervent prayer, of course,
remains to be seen. There are several large Christian commercial
Web sites such as iChristian and Crosswalk but none that targets as
broad an interfaith market as Beliefnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very well-designed site and they seem to have
leap-frogged over what else is out there. I've never heard of
another aggregator who cuts across all these differrent sectors and
is a portal for all religions,'' says Jill Frankle, director of
retail research at Gomez Advisors of Lincoln, Mass., an e-commerce
analysis firm. ``Getting visitors is the key and having leading
religion writers and columnists should attract strong participation
from religious communities. Then, e-commerce can be layered on top
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beliefnet's menu offers a virtual smorgasbord of spiritual
concepts and religious practices whose strength _ and weakness _ is
its one-stop shopping approach to matters of the soul. It's an
equal-opportunity portal where major and minor religions get equal
access.
</P>
<P>
   It offers everything from tips on the best way to say grace in a
restaurant (bowed head and silent prayer) and weekly Torah
commentaries to advice about what to give a newlywed pagan couple
(matching goblets, hanging crystals, and a broom made of birch or
cinnamon to put over the door). It aims to be both intellectual and
interactive, with articles on such topics as the growing shortage
of Roman Catholic priests and electronic ``prayer circles''
soliciting prayers on behalf of individuals in need. It includes a
daily quotation excerpted from the writings of the Dalai Lama and
an ``Ask the Lama'' column in which Surya Das addresses such basic
questions about Buddhism as ``Can Buddhists eat meat?'' (Yes,
although many don't.)
</P>
<P>
   Its ``browse religions'' link leads to the home pages of 32
religions from Bahai and Buddhism to Unitarian-Universalist and
Zoroastrianism and includes Christianity (Catholic, Eastern
Orthodox, Mormon, and Protestant), Judaism and Islam as well as
Jainism, Shinto, and Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other sites may have chat rooms, but I'll have a chant room,''
quips Surya Das, an on-line veteran who has had his own Web site
for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new media, and I was hesitant at first,''
acknowledges Cox, a Baptist minister. ``But my students are always
showing me things that they've pulled off the Net, and obviously
that's what more and more people are looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Waldman sees it, this opportunity for spiritual
comparison shopping makes Beliefnet a religious site uniquely
attuned to its times. About 60 percent of Americans now marry
outside their faith or denomination, he says, and people are
increasingly exposed to _ and often intrigued by _ belief systems
other than the ones of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Waldman himself is a product of these times. He describes
himself as ``a standard-issue American Reform Jew raised to know
more about Jewish culture than Jewish theology.'' He's married to a
Presbyterian woman who, he says, agreed to raise their children as
Jews who are aware of their mother's faith. A few nights a week, he
says, they sing their children the Sh'ma, the core prayer of Jewish
belief, ``sometimes before and sometimes after the Lord's Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Beliefnet's goal is to encourage tolerance and a wide-ranging,
faith-based conversation about some of the vexing issues of modern
life. The danger is that by assembling so many religious
perspectives in one place it will promote a superficial,
pick-and-choose approach to belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization provides us with the double challenge of getting
along together and also affirming and projecting our own identity,
and the Internet is a tremendous resource to do that,'' says the
Rev. Theodor Stylianopoulos, who teaches at the Eastern Orthodox
Hellenic College in Brookline, Mass. and writes a column for
Beliefnet. ``In our pluralistic, post-modern world, religion has to
go to the marketplace, but I would be concerned about the site if
it suggests a mingling of religions and a loss of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Waldman anticipates such concerns in a preemptive
article he wrote for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion rubs our faces in certain uncomfortable principles
(like those underlying the Ten Commandments) even when it might be
more convenient to ignore them,'' he writes. ``The Internet, on the
other hand . . . will make shopping for principles a little too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the telephone can be misused to harass and bedevil, so
can the Internet end up either eroding or enhancing religion. It's
our choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Nylen did not set out to launch an Internet company. With
backgrounds in publishing, the original idea was to start a
magazine with a strong Web presence. But after some research they
concluded that a Web site was far more likely to attract investors
and viewers _ as well as make more money _ than a print venture.
And, Waldman says, the interactive nature of the Internet makes it
responsive to the natural rhythms of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media don't cover the most important events in
most peoples lives, like the births of children or deaths in the
family,'' he says. ``An interactive media can let people create a
community and cover themselves and their own life passages.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's ``Milestones'' page chronicles those passages. Its
early postings come from the 35 staff members and their families
and friends. In the memorial he posted to his grandfather, Max,
Waldman writes, ``All his life he worked hard, often exhausted
himself to support his family and see that his only son could go on
to better things.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Stone, a Methodist minister who teaches evangelism at
Boston University's School of Theology, regularly surfs religious
Web sites. So far _ and for the most part _ he likes what he sees
on Beliefnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the breadth and the attractive format,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could become a kind of religious deli where people select
what they want from here and there,'' he cautions, ``but a better
understanding of other people's traditions and unique contributions
is healthy. The world's problems are too great to be solved by any
one group.''

CHRISTMAS COMES AGAIN FOR AGASSI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Christmas came a little late, but Andre Agassi
didn't mind. As long as he had Pete Sampras gift-wrapped _ or was
it rapped? _ he could stand the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a little late, but it's here,'' he says, acknowledging
that Christmas Eve and Christmas Day had been largely devoted to
running up and down the steep hill in Las Vegas that he and his
gargantuan trainer, Gil Reyes, call ``Magic Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had tears in my eyes, Andre was working so hard to get ready
for this,'' Reyes says. Reyes's tears reappeared as Agassi
propelled one last high-kicking serve to Sampras's vulnerable
backhand, certifying that the hard labor had paid off in another
long-distance run, five fantastic sets, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (0-7), 7-6
(7-5), 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 minutes before that, Agassi had hung from the high wire
by his pigeon toes, so close to falling to defeat that all Sampras
had to do was give him a last nudge. But Agassi resisted any last
rites, righted himself in a triumph of fine-tuned will and
physique, and now the glitter-domed little guy, the reformed
wastrel of a monster talent, is in the final of the Australian Open
for a second time. He beat Sampras for the title in 1995, and is
the first guy to qualify for four consecutive major championship
bouts since Rod Laver did so while making his 1969 Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   For almost three hours, the shotmaking brilliance of the
universe's two best players, a smorgasbord of acrobatics and daring
strokes, may have constituted the finest match seen in the
12-year-old amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another of our epics,'' says Sampras, winner of four of their
previous five encounters, and still ahead, 17-12. He shrugs and
shakes his head. ``I got a little down after I came so close to
winning in four. How did I let it happen? I'll be asking myself
that for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament isn't over. It just seems that way, as though it
were the proper final, hyped for nearly two weeks, since the draw
pointed to a semifinal collision between No. 1 Agassi and the
dispossessed ruler, No. 3 Sampras. They lived up to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the pounding in Reyes's body shop, or the good karma of
Agassi's love affair with a fairly resolute champion herself,
Steffi Graf, or the overdue decision to ante every last ounce of
himself on the table that has made this Vegas venturer the highest
roller in his game? Probably all of that as well as the faith of
coach Brad Gilbert when Agassi fell so low in the rankings that he
needed a miner's helmet a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes coddles Agassi like a jailer overseeing a guy on a chain
gang breaking rocks. And ``Rock,'' as the recent champion of France
and the United States is called in his camp, was positively
Gibraltarian in breaking down Sampras, his rival since childhood,
in their 29th professional clash.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear Reyes singing ``Jingle Bells'' as he and
Graf and Gilbert went into a three-way hug while their man blew
kisses at them and bowed north, south, east, west to the
thundering, exhilarated full house of 15,000 in Rod Laver Arena.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of jingle and tingle left in Agassi after the
fourth set. However, Sampras, twice two points from victory,
couldn't grasp it with his smooth, effortless strokes and faded
beneath the relentless staccato of Agassi's whippy uppercuts.
</P>
<P>
   Melbourne lost summer somewhere during the last week. You would
have believed that a late white Christmas might appear as toothy
gusts took the wind chill down into the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cold,'' says Agassi, who played hot. ``Sometimes all I
was moving was my head, watching Pete's serves go by. But you have
to get yourself in a frame of mind not to be bothered. He can serve
you right out of here _ he almost did.'' Sampras's high-velocity
zingers, up to 125 m.p.h., were zephyrs as chilling to Agassi as
the natural breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Though Agassi is the returner supreme, Sampras knocked a
career-high 37 aces past him _ 17 in the fourth set, but down to
two in the fifth _ plus 46 service winners. But Agassi was serving
cleverly, moving the ball astutely, damaging Sampras with his
kicker and coming up with 13 aces and 17 service winners on less
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Agassi says, ``that when the match looked close
to the end in the fourth-set tie-breaker, it was actually close to
beginning for me. That's what got Pete. One second he's two points
away, and a couple of minutes later, he's lost his serve (for only
the second time) and is down, 2-0, in the fifth. That was a huge
momentum change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I had to do was not make mistakes. Make him earn it in
the fourth set-breaker. I was a spectator (7-0) in the first
tie-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras slashed a forehand for a mini-break to 4-3, but Agassi
snatched it back to 4-4. Then Sampras hooked his 35th ace, an
astounding 120 m.p.h. second ball to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept raising the stakes,'' Agassi says. ``I'm two points
from gone, so I have to make no mistakes, make sure on my serve.''
Which he did with a pair of service winners to 5-5 and 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   A toenail-painting backhand return that set up a backhand passer
suddenly punctured Sampras for the set. Agassi gave forth a leonine
growl that could be heard above the raging crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would have suspected that Sampras, 8-0 in five-set
matches here, was through. Nevertheless, he was, collapsed by
Agassi's controlled abstinence from blunders: a mere 19 unforced
errors to Sampras's 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're pushed to the limit, and then dig for some more .
. . well, that's where I am now,'' Agassi says, smiling. He still
has either the defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov or the pesky
Swede Magnus Norman to contend with for first prize Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But he had survived the evening's bombing _ by Sampras and a
flock of seagulls. ``I didn't mind them flying over, but then they
decided to drop me a few presents.'' Sampras fans, maybe. After
taking a towel from a ball boy and mopping up the deposits, Agassi
continued to mop up Sampras.

FLARE-UP AT `FEVER'  
 POPULAR FARE, NO FUSS 
WITTY AND WITCHY 
ACTION ON THE BOARD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actors Equity, the union of actors and stage managers, was
investigating an increasingly tense backstage scene at ``Saturday
Night Fever'' this week, a situation apparently triggered by a
dismissal of the stage manager. That move has sparked bad blood
between some in the cast and management, as well as the resignation
of three assistant stage managers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What set off the dispute seems surprisingly minor. In
mid-December, the musical's cast sent a letter to Robert Stigwood,
the show's lead producer, about the quality of the souvenir
program. Among the complaints were several captions in which cast
members' names had been omitted and several images that were
described as poorly reproduced. These oversights and others, the
letter pointed out, violated the Equity contract and should be
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cast signed the letter, as did Perry Cline, the
production stage manager. The letter was delivered to Stigwood at
Barton Manor, his estate on the Isle of Wight in England, around
Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent back to the cast and posted on the call board,
Stigwood said he thought the criticism was misdirected as well as
poorly timed. (His return letter stated: ``I much rather would have
heard Happy Christmas.'')
</P>
<P>
   Company members said that they thought that was the end of the
issue until early this month, when word leaked out that Cline had
been dismissed. This action infuriated some cast members, who
called the move a clear retaliation against Cline. ``He signed it,
so he got fired,'' said one cast member. ``They believed he
co-wrote it or wrote it, which wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Kladitis, the show's associate producer and general
manager, disputed this account, saying that Cline's departure was a
``mutual decision'' and that there was no connection between the
letter and the decision to change stage managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage manager is not being dismissed because of the
letter,'' Kladitis said. ``I think everybody's misunderstanding
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Eisenberg, the union's executive director, said Thursday
that the union was investigating the situation and would be meeting
with the company Friday. In general, cases of this sort result in
severance packages for the fired individuals but rarely
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a spokesman, Stigwood said Thursday that
Cline's dismissal did not have to do with his signing of the letter
and added that disputes between cast and management were
commonplace in Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fever,'' which opened in October at the Minskoff Theater, was
the second-highest grossing show on Broadway last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cline, a respected stage manager with a dozen Broadway shows to
his credit, is still on the show but is expected to leave next
month. He did not return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, cast members said the incident has soured
relations between the company and the show's management. ``It's
horrible,'' one cast member said of the mood backstage. ``Everyone
thinks it's completely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Kladitis, however, said the discontent was news to him. ``No one
in the company has discussed this with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Fare, No Fuss
</P>
<P>
   It may not have the name recognition of ``The Vagina
Monologues'' or the name deconstruction of ``Fuddy Meers,'' but
``Dinner With Friends'' has quietly become one of off-Broadway's
more solid hits.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the Donald Margulies comedy, at the Variety
Arts Theater in the East Village, has been regularly selling more
than $100,000 in tickets a week, and during the first week this
month, the figure topped $175,000. All of which has led to an
advance of about $300,000, an enviable figure for a 499-seat
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which opened on Nov. 4, is about the repercussions on
the lives of two couples when one of those couples splits up. It
received favorable reviews but has maintained a relatively low
profile, with no marquee stars but strong word of mouth. Producers,
who invested $660,000 in the production, said Thursday that they
expected to recoup their investment by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Witty and Witchy
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Edward Hibbert earned good reviews at the Long
Wharf Theater in New Haven for doing a role that few actors tackle,
that of Lady Bracknell, the bon-mot-tossing matron at the heart of
Oscar Wilde's ``Importance of Being Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hibbert is back as a missus. Beginning April 1, he will be
appearing as Tartagliona, the witchy grandmother in ``The Green
Bird,'' Carlo Gozzi's 18th-century Italian fable at the Cort
Theater. He joins a cast that includes Kristine Nielsen, Derek
Smith and Andrew Weems.
</P>
<P>
   Action on the Board
</P>
<P>
   Last fall didn't work out exactly as Illeana Douglas thought it
might. After all, it was only a few months ago that the actress was
starring in ``Action,'' easily the most hyped television show of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics raved about her performance as Wendy, a wisened
streetwalker, but audiences didn't take to the show. It was
canceled last month.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of ``Action'' was sad for Ms. Douglas, it has
opened up a chance to do something she hadn't tried in years.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Feb. 18, Ms. Douglas will be heading an impressive
cast in ``The Moment When,'' a new play by James Lapine at
Playwrights Horizons. Rehearsals begin Friday, with a company that
includes Estelle Parsons, Kieran Culkin, Mark Ruffalo, and Arija
Bareikis.
</P>
<P>
   Known for her film work, Ms. Douglas trained and worked the
trenches of the New York theater world. She studied at the
Neighborhood Playhouse in the mid- 1980s, worked with the Naked
Angels theater company and performed ``very off-off Broadway.''
After directing three short films and playing smaller roles in
handful of films, she broke through in 1995 in ``To Die For,''
playing opposite a villainous Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making a joke yesterday that every theater I worked at
no longer exists,'' she said. ``I'm hoping for better luck this
time.''

FOUR YEARS AND NOTHING FOR JANE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tues., Feb. 1)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy news comes from Los Angeles where Sukie Miller has become
the proud possessor of a new kidney, courtesy of her second cousin
Cynthia. Recuperation has begun and the e-mail reports are all
upbeat. The friends are relieved and celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   But sad news comes from Sebastopol, Calif., where Jane Flood has
died waiting for a liver transplant. She'd been on the waiting list
for almost four years and watched others in her hepatitis C support
group get their livers, but Jane's blood type was harder to match.
</P>
<P>
   But damn, four years?
</P>
<P>
   We all know about the life-giving promise of organ transplants.
A person can have a vital organ stop on them but then get a new
one. Those kinds of miracles happen all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sukie will probably go on to write another book, travel the
world, give workshops. Jane would have returned to teaching,
written more poems, gone hiking along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone gets her miracle and that's our fault because as a
society we're too busy, complacent or scared to donate. There's an
ongoing organ shortage in the United States. Yet it costs no time
or money to be a donor. You fill out a form, put a little sticker
on your driver's license and tell your family that you want your
organs to be available to someone else when you die. And then you
go on living.
</P>
<P>
   When you die you leave behind a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Sukie got her kidney from a living donor, which is possible with
kidneys. But many people also die waiting for kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Jane had to wait for someone with the right blood type, a
healthy liver and a donor card to die in Northern California.
Friends say she never stopped believing that would happen.
Hospitalized with an infection, she told friends the day before she
died she needed to get stronger so she could get her liver.
</P>
<P>
   There's really no reason not to agree to be a donor. Most
religions don't seem to have a problem with it. Some people seem to
worry that if they're a known donor and are critically injured some
ghoul in the ER is going to snatch their liver or other valuable
parts rather than patch them up. But that doesn't seem to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Jane used to say that people resist becoming a donor because
they don't like to think about their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of things can happen between now and death which might
have us hope that someone else had been more generous than
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   These things kind of creep up on people. This time last year
Sukie hadn't a clue her kidneys were in bad shape. A routine blood
test last spring showed she had advanced kidney disease and her
doctor said she better start thinking dialysis or transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Jane believed she was likely infected with hepatitis C 30 years
ago, but it only hit her so she knew it five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So, something could be cooking in our bodies right now that
someday will eat away at one of our organs. One of the replaceable
ones. We may be waiting to be transplanted long before we're doing
the donating.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's friend Betty Nudelman, who had a successful liver
transplant years ago, is pretty angry about losing Jane. She thinks
it ought to be policy that no one gets a replacement organ unless
they themselves have signed a donor card.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the drug companies that make money on the very
expensive immunosuppressive drugs that every transplant patient
takes for life sponsor public service campaigns?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great if organ donation became the American thing
to do, so popular and widely presumed that only people who felt
otherwise needed to carry cards?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a great way to start out the century. Create a legacy and
get your karma aligned at the same time.

East Coast this week. Sleet greeted motorists in portions of
central Mississippi today, heralding what was shaping up as a major
winter event in this Deep South State. Weather watchers said the
arrival of a frigid Canadian air mass, coupled with a
moisture-packed system moving in from the west, promised to bring a
full range of winter precipitation _ freezing rain, sleet and snow

McConnell is scheduled to sentence the son and namesake of
Atlanta's famed civil rights leader on Jan. ??. A jury found
Abernathy guilty last month of a scheme to pocket taxpayer funds.
Although his first trial ended in a mistrial, he was convicted by
the second jury on 18 counts _ five of theft by taking involving
$5,700, five of false swearing, five of violating his oath of
office, two of forgery and one count of influencing a witness. A
decision to appeal is being weighed. Attorney General Thurbert
Baker has indicated that his office will seek incarceration.

 &HT;    Seeking the artist within in the City of Light
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Valerie Boyd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shay Youngblood's second novel is as stimulating as a stroll
down the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-born author's first novel, 1997's ``Soul Kiss,'' was
an exquisite and erotic story of a girl's sexual and sensual coming
of age. Full of the same lush language, ``Black Girl in Paris'' is
also a coming-of-age story, but it explores a different kind of
maturation _ that of an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Walking in the footsteps of iconic figures such as Josephine
Baker, Langston Hughes and James Baldwin, 26-year-old Eden arrives
in Paris in 1986 with two years' worth of nearly forgotten college
French in her head and a few dollars pressed into the soles of her
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be a writer and, like others before her, believes
Paris will teach her how: ``I was making a map of the world. In
ancient times maps were made to help people find food, water, and
the way back home,'' Youngblood writes in Eden's diarylike,
intimate voice. ``I needed a map to help me find love and language,
and since one didn't exist, I'd have to invent one following the
trails and signs left by other travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris that Eden finds, however, is not quite the Paris of
Baldwin's youth, nor the city of her dreams. It is a potential
paradise tarnished by terrorism. Within a few days of her arrival,
four explosions kill several people and wound hundreds. But she is
undaunted. Born in Birmingham, she is no stranger to terrorism:
``During that time the city was nicknamed Bombingham. When the four
little girls were killed by a segregationist's bomb at church one
Sunday morning in 1963, I had just started to write my name,'' she
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   What frightens the grown-up Eden more than terrorists' bombs is
the prospect of poverty driving her home before she can meet
Baldwin, the legendary African-American essayist, novelist and
playwright rumored to be living in France. (Youngblood's research
is accurate: Baldwin spent his final years in France, before his
death in December 1987.) To avoid this fate, she does stints as an
au pair, an artist's model, a poet's helper and, occasionally, a
thief pilfering a meal. She even spends a night as a blues singer,
urged on by her white, jazz-playing boyfriend:
</P>
<P>
   ``Music drifted above the smoke and laughter and loud talk in
the tiny bar. A dozen tables were heavy with elbows, strong
cigarettes, and booze,'' Eden tells us in you-are-there detail.
``My short, natural hair was hidden under a straight black wig with
bangs. The fragrant white flower tucked behind my left ear.
Red-painted lips, gold dust at the corners of my eyes, pearls of
sweat on the tip of my nose. I hoped the makeup hid my fear. My
legs atop the silver high heels suddenly felt weak, but then I took
a deep breath and closed my eyes. I was back in Georgia in a small
roadside juke joint. I opened my mouth again, and Billie Holiday
came out. ... I was crying when the music stopped. The audience was
wild with appreciation, clapping, whistling, and cheering. I closed
my eyes and clicked my heels together, part of me wishing I was
home.''
</P>
<P>
   This nod to ``The Wizard of Oz'' (or its African-American
update, ``The Wiz'') is not accidental. Eden's search is much like
Dorothy's: She is looking for her personal wizard, her very own
muse embodied as Baldwin _ and she must find him to know that what
she's truly looking for is already within.
</P>
<P>
   In a not-always-linear narrative that includes a few recipes and
primer-type lists (``How to Look at Art,'' ``How to Be an Au
Pair''), Youngblood introduces several supporting characters who
serve as Eden's guides in her search for Baldwin _ and in her
deeper quest for the writer within. These characters and the
episodic structure of the novel are among the novel's few
weaknesses _ yet, ultimately, among its many strengths. On one
hand, a reader might wish for Eden to slow down as she moves
through other characters' lives, to let Youngblood apply her
considerable character-development skills to making these
supporting players more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Youngblood seems to say, who cares about
them? She wants you to focus on Eden, whose quest for the artist
within is her most important _ and most daring _ adventure. And
it's a testament to Youngblood's talent that Eden's inner adventure
is as riveting as any exploit in Paris.
</P>

 &HT;    Director takes fresh look at Gilbert and Sullivan
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing that would likely pop into moviegoers' minds
while watching ``Topsy-Turvy,'' English director Mike Leigh's new,
opulent costume tale of comic opera legends Gilbert and Sullivan,
is a vision from ``Naked.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Topsy-Turvy,'' was recently named best picture of
the year by the New York Film Critics Circle, is an ornate
depiction of 19th-century artistic whimsy that includes a detailed,
highbrow staging of ``The Mikado.'' The decidedly seedier
``Naked,'' which Leigh directed to critical acclaim in 1993, kicks
off with its brilliant and deeply disturbed modern-day main
character raping a crying woman in a damp, dark alley.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something about ``Topsy-Turvy'' that establishes a
twisted connection not only to ``Naked,'' but to ``Secrets &AMP; Lies''
and just about every other Leigh film. They are each unrelenting in
the precision with which they hone in on the intelligence, quirks,
motivations, oppressions, infatuations and psychological damage
inherent in their main characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I wanted to do _ to deal with Gilbert and Sullivan
in that way,'' says Leigh, 56. ``The only real separation is the
culture (all those characters) are in. You really don't have to
scrape away more than the finished surface of `Topsy-Turvy' and
it's a Mike Leigh film.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Leigh is in New York, recovering from jet lag. He's
flown from England to accept the New York critics award for
``Topsy-Turvy'' and work in a visit with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, all I did was watch a bit of TV and drink from the
mini-bar,'' he says. ``That's what we call getting over jet lag.
Tonight I'll have dinner with friends at their house in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he know what they'll cook?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. But they're good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking by telephone, Leigh discussed not only why he decided to
make a two-hour-and-39-minute film about W.S. Gilbert and Arthur
Sullivan, but how he first became interested in movies and the
genesis of the unique process he uses to develop his art.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's kind of surprising to see you tackle a subject like
Gilbert and Sullivan. Why pick them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to do a period film in the same way I approach a
modern story. And a film about us: people who do popular
entertainment seriously. I was attracted by the idea of taking what
would seem kind of a chocolate-box subject and subverting it and
taking it seriously as a real working world. And I grew up in
Manchester in the '40s and '50s, and it maintains this Victorian
look and feel. The houses, the schools and the culture that just
hangs in the air. So, in effect, I grew up with Gilbert and
Sullivan. They've always been there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How true is your film to what happened in their relationship
and the first staging of ``Mikado''?
</P>
<P>
   A: In broad terms, the general narrative is accurate. Gilbert
did originally cut that famous song in the dress rehearsal, and the
chorus did go to him in a posse. But what they actually said (we
don't know).
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert had already thought of ``Mikado'' before he went to the
Japanese exposition. There are all kinds of small details that are
not true. What I was concerned about was that these two creative
forces got stuck. Their partnership was jeopardized. We also went
to great lengths to tackle the language. That to me had to be
accurate. I had my researcher forever with me with a trolley of
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you concerned much about the length of the film?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was supposed to be shorter. Films are normally expected to
be shorter. It seems to me that this movie is what it should be.
There were a few battles about it. It just takes all that time to
deal with what we were trying to get across. I don't think people
will ultimately think it's too long. If I thought it was tedious, I
would have hacked it to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This film has a rather unique presentation of the inventions
of the time: the telephone, the first fountain pen. I can't think
of another film that introduces inventions in such a way that they
are integral parts in revealing the characters' personalities.
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't either. That period was so rich in that sense.
Because of the way I'm able to explore these things and actors and
action, if you put it in a three-dimensional way, you come up with
those moments.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you first get interested in movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the '40s and '50s when I was growing up, I went to the
movies as much as I possibly could. There were tiny cinemas in
Manchester. All showed two films. I saw loads and loads of films
that were American and British. None in foreign languages. Then in
the '60s, I was exposed to more world cinema: Renoir, Kurasawa and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What films did you use as inspiration for ``Topsy-Turvy''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There were obviously films and things lurking in the back of
my mind. ``Les Enfants du Paradis.'' Jean Renoir. We also looked at
a load of period films and a huge amount of historic footage shot
in 1896 through 1901. It was still very useful. Another film that
we did look at was 1953's very British ``The Story of Gilbert and
Sullivan.'' Obviously, that was a film this film attempts not to be
like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read about the life drawing class where you had this
flash that formed how you work _ the months-long rehearsals, the
preliminary collaborations, all of it leading to a script and
shooting. What happened in that life drawing class that led to the
flash of inspiration?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't one particular thing. What I experienced as an art
student was that I became aware of something I hadn't experienced
before. What we experienced (in that class) was looking at the real
world. In an English drama school, you didn't look at the real
world. It didn't relate to the street but regurgitated plays and
didn't actually deal with who are these people and what are they
about. ... It was a revelation in the kind of liberating thing it
was to be an art student. There we were asked to investigate and
deal with realities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How intense were the ``Topsy-Turvy'' rehearsals?
</P>
<P>
   A: We had five weeks to do all the things in the theater, in a
heat wave. All these people were wearing terribly hot kimonos and
wigs and makeup and things. I have to say, though, those are merely
the ordinary stuff of filmmaking. The preparation, rehearsing for
seven months, all the rehearsals and improvisations and working
with historical background. All of that was what was difficult and
hard. And not really traumatic were the contemporary films that I
normally do. We can take it for granted we know about the world
we're in. The minute you're in the late 19th century, no matter how
recent it seems, you have to have really researched it. Every
detail of the time period is this huge worm you have to get your
head around.

 &HT;    Obsession and pursuit pace muddled thriller
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we all know, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But what
is in the eye of the beheld? Fear? Murder? Loss? Manipulation?
Calculation? Damaged innocence? Perhaps all of the above in the
case of the new thriller ``Eye of the Beholder,'' which begins as a
respectable _ occasionally hypnotic _ riff on the Coppola-Hackman
classic ``The Conversation'' but veers off in another direction
altogether, ending up in a kind of who-cares nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor, now forever immortalized as a ``Star Wars'' doll,
plays a high-tech British surveillance agent known only as the Eye.
Abandoned by his wife and child several years ago, the Eye lives a
cut-off, voyeuristic existence, using the sophisticated tools of
his trade to get the job done and the world shut out. As his
sympathetic contact at the agency, played with down-to-earth appeal
by k.d. lang, notes, ``God forbid you'd ever actually come out of
your hole and actually talk to another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   What she doesn't know is that the Eye is always talking _ to the
imaginary figure of his long-lost little girl, Lucy. Or, at least,
to the girl he imagines Lucy must be, because all he has left of
her is a tattered old class picture, and even then he's not sure
which of the assorted 8-year-olds is his Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   Handed an assignment that seems routine _ find out what's up
with a diplomat's son who's dipping into the family trust _ the Eye
becomes fascinated with the inevitable femme fatale (Ashley Judd)
on the scene. ``Don't leave her, Daddy,'' whispers imaginary Lucy.
``She's just a little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the film becomes a tale of obsession and pursuit, of
abandoned daddies and abandoned daughters entwined in a sad
psychological duet. The mystery woman _ she changes names as often
as she changes wigs _ criss-crosses the country with the
ever-faithful Eye on her trail as a kind of guardian angel in spite
of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephan Elliott, best-known for the striking ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' makes sure his
picture is as stylishly acted as it is stylishly filmed. Which only
makes its increasing incoherence all the more frustrating. ``Eye''
gets caught in a web of its own homages, ranging from Alfred
Hitchcock to Orson Welles to, finally, boringly, Wim Wenders. The
more complex it tries to be, the less compelling it becomes.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why two such gifted actors as McGregor and Judd
would be attracted to the material. But you have to wonder, did
they read the whole script or just the first 30 pages?
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. Directed by Stephan
Elliott. Rated R for language, sex, nudity and violence. 1 hour,

beholder.

 &HT;    A not-so-great take on `Valley' girl's life
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' isn't. Or even moderately good. A comedy
about the garish, glamorous life of self-promoting, best-selling
author Jacqueline Susann, the movie suffers from a fatal problem:
The filmmakers don't know what to make of their overblown subject.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a New Yorker magazine article and scripted by Paul
Rudnick (the usually reliable laugh-meister behind ``Addams Family
Values'' and ``In &AMP; Out''), ``Great'' isn't quite biography, but
it's not exactly burlesque, either. It's a highlights-only look at
Susann's life, with jokes trying to plug up the narrative holes and
compensate for the movie's lack of view and wobbly tone. Rudnick
and director Andrew Bergman (``Honeymoon in Vegas'') can't decide
whether Susann is great or a gargoyle, a heroine for the
paperback-buying masses or a fabulous monster who rode bad taste to
the penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler plays Susann, but mainly she's playing Midler,
trotting out her usual tics and tricks and adorable wiggles. Nathan
Lane plays her publicity agent husband, Irving Mansfield. Though he
narrates the movie, he remains as indecipherable a figure as
Susann. User or used?
</P>
<P>
   The movie's Irving offers Jackie unconditional love. He even
puts up with her need to go to Central Park, stare up into her
favorite tree and conduct one-on-one discussions with God, whom she
seems to confuse with a talent agent. (The movie has several of
these scenes, each one a little more painful.) Irving is the one
who encourages her to write her epic of page-turning tawdriness,
``Valley of the Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' finally picks up by pitting Susann against a
WASPish, appalled book editor (David Hyde Pierce, doing his usual
``Frasier'' dithering). Their scenes at least pay off with some
good laughs, as Susann's blunt exuberance collides with the gentile
gentility of Pierce's Connecticut clan.
</P>
<P>
   Before it dwindles into movie-of-the-week mawkishness as Susann
battles breast cancer, ``Great'' gives Midler several moments to
show off her lethal comic timing. Making a guest appearance on a
cooking show, she tells its hostess, ``Any woman who cooks is a
fool.'' Midler also has a few choice things to say about ``Ozzie
and Harriet,'' chatting with her pal, the actress Flo (Stockard
Channing, who boosts the movie tremendously every time she walks
on-screen). The cast also includes John Cleese, underused as
Susann's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Though it squanders a great story, you can see why everyone
involved was fascinated by Susann. It's harder to see why they
needed to make a puffball tribute to the writer, who reportedly
could be vicious. In the movie, Jackie admits, ``I need mass
love.'' ``Isn't She Great'' tries to make that relentless hunger
for fame something cute. It would have been more interesting if the
film saw it for what it really was: a kind of pathology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane and Stockard Channing. Rated
R for language.1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``Talent isn't everything,'' as one character says;
too bad that applies to this movie.

 &HT;    In telling the story of Gilbert and Sullivan's 19th-century
partnership, illuminates the gap between life and art
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas
to enjoy ``Topsy-Turvy.'' But a love of the theater can help you
appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the film seems to be a startling departure from
Leigh's usual kitchen-sink realism (he's best-known in America for
``Naked'' and ``Secrets &AMP; Lies''). But it's not really. Despite the
period costumes and Victorian furniture, the writer-director is
continuing to do what he does best: document everyday moments and
present a rich slice of life. This slice just happens to be set 100
years ago, and it's populated with historical characters instead of
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in 1885, the movie finds longtime collaborators William
Gilbert (Jim Broadbent), the librettist-director, and Arthur
Sullivan (Allan Corduner), the composer, at an impasse after years
of success. Their latest operetta, ``Princess Ida,'' isn't drawing
the expected crowds. Sullivan has tired of Gilbert's repetitive
librettos, which send characters into a land of ``topsy-turvydom,''
usually via a magic spell or potion. Each man claims that he
subverts his own gifts to the work of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Covering only a tiny portion of their career, ``Topsy-Turvy''
focuses mainly on the rejuvenation of the men's partnership when
Gilbert, inspired by an exhibition of Japanese culture, comes up
with the idea for ``The Mikado.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a biopic per se. Most biographical movies look at
their subjects from the outside in. ``Topsy-Turvy'' (reflecting its
own title) does the opposite. It places us in the midst of the
lives, triumphs and frustrations of Gilbert, Sullivan, their actors
and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The actors include longtime Leigh collaborator Timothy Spall as
an insecure baritone and Kevin McKidd as the opera company's
romantic lead, a Scotsman who objects to the leg-revealing kimono
he's required to wear. While Gilbert is married to plucky,
forbearing Kitty (Lesley Manville), Sullivan spends time with the
husky-voiced, sensual widow Mrs. Fanny Ronalds (Eleanor David).
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' shows us who they are, but it's equally
interested in what they do. Leigh revels in the process of work and
creation. That includes a beautifully sustained rehearsal scene
between Gilbert and his actors, as the writer-director tells his
cast exactly how to speak a line and move. We also witness Sullivan
guiding his orchestra, politely pointing out the mistakes they've
made in their playing. The movie places equal focus on mundane
moments, such as the hanging of an ornamental sword on a wall or
the nervous tics of actors waiting around backstage.
</P>
<P>
   For many viewers, this may spell boredom. But if you get into
the movie's rhythm, you start to see what Leigh is up to: He's
gently balancing life against art, the demands of the daily world
against the pleasures of theater.
</P>
<P>
   The lead comedian (Martin Savage) has a drug problem, the
ingenue (Shirley Henderson) has a secret, and her colleague
(Dorothy Atkinson) has a bum leg and has to rely sometimes on a
cane. The movie doesn't italicize these things, but quietly
presents them as part of the texture of life.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gilbert, who should be happy with his success, always seems
to be somehow bothered by it. His marriage is the most poignant
relationship in the movie. While Gilbert's work speaks directly to
the thousands of Londoners who flock to his show, he can't really
make a true human connection to his own wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Leigh shows us that the blissful upside-down worlds
Gilbert and Sullivan created were a place that everyone _ including
the artists involved _ could escape to as a way to forget the
everyday disappointments and frustrations of real life. Spall's
character sums up the movie's theme succinctly with three words:
``laughter, tears, curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble is superb, but it's Broadbent who turns in a
monumental performance. His Gilbert is a mountain of stoked
pomposity, given to shouting ``horror, horror, horror'' at the
breakfast table on hearing that ticket sales are slacking off. He
doesn't even crack a smile when he's reciting his own witty-silly
lyrics. The only time his dour bulldog face melts into something
close to happiness is when the inspiration for ``The Mikado''
sparks his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' is the sort of movie that asks you to be patient
with it, to live with its characters for a few hours. Despite its
draining length, it proves to be even better and richer on a second
viewing. And for G&AMP;S fans, it serves up several delightful
re-creations of numbers from ``The Mikado'' and other works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner. Directed by Mike
Leigh. Rated R for a scene of risque nudity.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A meticulous valentine to the theater that gently
contrasts everyday reality and artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: An outside shot for best actor (Jim Broadbent)
and director (Mike Leigh) and a stronger chance at original
screenplay, art direction and costumes.

 &HT;    Cell phone ultimate Sundance star
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ There he is. You can spot him just to the
right of the trees at the top of the slope, gliding on what must be
perfectly waxed skis atop powdery snow. He's the impeccable icon of
an entertainment industry gone perfectly out of whack: slicked-back
dark hair, black wraparound sunglasses, white turtleneck and one
hand cupping a cell phone to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Call it frozen hydrophoning. It's what Hollywood does here every
year at the Sundance Film Festival. And every year, they say, it
just gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Walk down Main Street on the way to a screening, make a call.
Nestle into a seat before the theater goes dark, make a call. Ride
the shuttle bus. Between bites at a sushi bar. Up in the lift, skis
dangling, en route to the highest slopes. That's three more calls.
</P>
<P>
   What's so important? Just listen to a few of the one-sided
conversations overheard on the street: ``There's all these cameras.
It's getting wild here.'' ``He's one of the big shots at BMI. He
told me to call him.'' ``Redford and I are good friends. We're like
brother and sister. It's great.'' ``Whatever, baby.'' ``That movie.
There was no way anybody was going to get into it. I just stayed on
the shuttle and kept going.'' ``James Spader called.'' Of course he
did.
</P>
<P>
   With so much cell-phoning here ``it reaches the point it's no
longer unusual,'' says Chuck Collins of Kennesaw's Digital
Projection Inc., who's here to set up equipment for the festival's
first major foray into projecting digital films on theater screens.
And he should know. He has a cell phone and a Motorola hand-held
radio to use while here. Which is what he's doing. Over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Redford's annual 10-day celebration of independent
movies, which ends today in this small, century-old silver mining
town nestled in the snow-dusted valley of Utah's Wasatch Range, is
many things. A celeb-filled frenzy (among this year's glitterati:
Ben Affleck, John Sayles, Heather Graham, Julianna Margulies, Danny
DeVito, Oliver Stone and Ethan Hawke). A movie lover's paradise of
112 films (the most persistent fan can watch six or more movies a
day). A nonstop movie industry networking party. And a sea of
wandering individuals _ at least 15,000 _ clad in enough black
leather to reupholster every den sofa in Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   Some who come here to see movies and people-watch strike
celebrity gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went skiing and saw Stanley Tucci on the slopes,'' says
George Nakos, 41, of Atlanta, an investment banker, vacationing
here with friend Michael Randman, 44, of Birmingham, a former
junior agent for the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're movie buffs,'' Nakos says. They sat near Jodie Foster at
the first-night film, Tucci's ``Joe Gould's Secret.'' (Nakos'
verdict: ``It was no `Big Night.''') Also in the theater were
Redford and ``Gould'' star Ian Holm.
</P>
<P>
   The previous night Nakos and Randman ventured into Grappa, a
local upscale restaurant featuring a 2000 Sundance Film Festival
prix fixe menu. For $60 each they could dine on such dishes as
grape and Gorgonzola salad, wild mushroom soup and baked salmon
encrusted with horseradish and bread crumbs atop homemade
fettuccine. At a nearby table sat R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, who
produced ``Spring Forward,'' one of 16 films in the festival's
noncompetitive American Spectrum category.
</P>
<P>
   With each day bringing more than 50 screenings of independent
movies, documentaries and shorts, the Sundance Film Festival is the
be-all, but not the end-all, of what's going on here.
</P>
<P>
   Several renegade mini-festivals have popped up in small pockets
throughout town. There's Slamdance (started in 1995 by four
filmmakers whose works were rejected by Sundance), No Dance,
SlamDunk, LapDance, Digi-
</P>
<P>
   Dance, Dances With Films and Son of Sam Dance. The latter
consists of a Toyota van roaming the town and screening films from
a projector atop its roof.
</P>
<P>
   You want independent? The No Dance crowd shuns publicists (or,
rather, often can't afford them) and pushes its own movies.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Kaleo Quenzer, 27, of Memphis has perched himself on
Main Street with a cardboard sign that reads, ``Will work for
distribution.'' He's promoting the $20,000 ``Central Garden,'' the
movie he wrote and directed and submitted to No Dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this to make people laugh and to get attention,''
Quenzer says. ``We're real low-budget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke. It's just so busy,'' says Miranda Price, 20, of
Salt Lake City, who commutes the 40-minute drive here to run the
Starbucks espresso machine on Main Street for a continuous line of
customers from 7 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third year, and it gets busier every year,'' she
says, whipping up another tall latte. ``The Sundance crowd is so
uptight. They're not as friendly. We're just so laid-back here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tips?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they're very fair,'' she says. ``In that way, they're very
fair.''

 XXXIV ISN'T OLD FOR HIM: MATTHEWS REACHES SUPER BOWL IN HIS 17th(bl) 
 By DOUG FERNANDES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee's Bruce Matthews is so old ...
</P>
<P>
   How old is he?
</P>
<P>
   He's so old that he played at the University of Southern
California with his current head coach, Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have much to say my freshman year,'' Matthews said.
``He always seemed a studious guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's so old that Titan rookie guard Zach Piller was 7 years old
when Matthews went through his first training camp with the
then-Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even really imagine that,'' Piller said.
</P>
<P>
   He's so old that he once blocked for Earl Campbell and knows, at
38, that Father Time is closing in on the tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the end is very near for me,'' Matthews
said. ``But I guess I'm too selfish to set a date.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be Monday, the day after he makes the first Super Bowl
appearance of his glorious 17-year career. He signed a four-year
deal with the Titans in the off-season. Matthews will be 41 if he
fulfills the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. In a league where the average career lasts four years,
Matthews is a 6-foot-5, 305-pound anomaly. He's as reliable as the
sun. He's never missed a game because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   He shines brightly too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt I understand the only reason I'm here is
because God just blessed me with this body and the desire to play
this game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health and desire aside, a player doesn't play 17 seasons
without a large dose of skill. This season, Matthews earned his
12th Pro Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   In his time with the Oilers/Titans, he has played at least one
season at each of the five offensive line positions. Matthews has
been named to eight Pro Bowls at guard, four at center.
</P>
<P>
   This season he shattered ex-Ram Jackie Slater's record for most
games played by an offensive lineman in NFL history (259.) He's
played in 200 consecutive games, the longest current streak in the
league. He's protected 14 different quarterbacks, opened holes for
24 different running backs.
</P>
<P>
   But mere numbers don't reflect the true value of Matthews.
That's best expressed by the people who have witnessed his
exemplary performances over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say?'' said Titans general manager Floyd Reese.
``I don't know what to say. Every year I try to think of something
that can describe what he's done. I can't. He just plays, plays at
the top level, comes back every year and does it again. That's
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an icon around here,'' fullback Lorenzo Neal said. ``So,
no, I can't describe what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' 20-something teammates have the same problem. Many
can't believe what he's done. Or whom he's done it with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They read the press guide,'' Matthews said, ``and they come up
to me and their jaws are hanging and it's like, `You played with
coach Fisher?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, so what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He played?''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher believes he knows why Matthews remains a powerful force
along the Titans' offensive line, able to control defensive linemen
15 years his junior. Love of the game aside, Fisher said it's
Matthews knowing exactly what he's doing every moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very instinctive,'' Fisher said. ``He never puts himself
in an awkward position where he's risking injury. He understands
what's going on around him and he sees things very well.''
</P>
<P>
   He's soaking it all in this week. Matthews knows better than
most that reaching the Super Bowl is anything but a birthright. He
always believed an appearance in the NFL's biggest game wasn't
needed to validate his career.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after witnessing the significance placed on the game,
he knows his career wouldn't have been complete without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess without being here I wouldn't have realized what a
great loss it would have been if I had never been here,'' Matthews
said. ``There would have been a void in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was one of the first people to congratulate him
because I feel for him,'' wide receiver Kevin Dyson said. ``I told
him, `I don't know if I could have waited 17 years.' I'm happy for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So is his brother, Clay Matthews. It appears longevity is part
of the family makeup. Clay played 19 years at linebacker in the
NFL. As you might expect, the two brothers were competitive growing
up.
</P>
<P>
   One game could have ended both of their dreams' of reaching the
NFL. It was a dangerous version of baseball with a 2-by-4 and a
dart. One Matthews brother swung the board, the other threw the
dart. A hit was recorded when the hitter got the dart to stick in
the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the first beanball,'' Bruce said, ``and that game was
retired by our parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's dad, Clay Sr., was a wrestler at Georgia Tech and is in
the school's athletic Hall of Fame. He convinced Bruce to wrestle
in high school, saying it would help him on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the ninth and 10th grade, we used to get on the
living room floor,'' he said. ``He inflicted more injuries on me
than anyone on the wrestling team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matthews knows the reason he's in Atlanta. For some time,
he didn't quite believe his Titans, which he calls an ordinary team
performing extraordinary things, belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took awhile to think, `Hey, we're a Super Bowl team,''' he
said. ``But now that we're here, it's like, `Why not? Let's go out
and win this thing.' ''

 &HT;    Even an aunt's warning wasn't enough to keep two slick
pickpockets from victimizing an Atlantan on holiday
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this life, one thing counts:
</P>
<P>
   In the bank, large amounts.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to pick a pocket or two.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fagin in the musical ``Oliver!''
</P>
<P>
   A few days before my wife and I departed on our first trip to
Italy, I visited my Aunt Sara, who had been there years before. We
talked about the beauty of the countryside, the culture, the food.
After we hugged and I headed for the door, she added an
afterthought in a completely different vein:
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out for the pickpockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I was warned. No, it didn't make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   Having your wallet pinched in a foreign land, as mine was in
Rome recently, is an infuriating, disorienting experience. I felt
so helpless, thousands of miles from home, unable to even remember
which credit cards I was carrying. Or how much cash I had. Or
whether my Social Security number was on anything. Or whether I had
the receipts for my traveler's checks. It all made me wish I had
read those dull pages in the guidebook that dealt with security
precautions _ or had at least better heeded Aunt Sara's advice.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that frequent travelers like those of us in the
media would be wise to the occasional dangers of overseas trips.
Not always. Even the most experienced travelers get victimized. In
fact, I was the third reporter in my department at the
Journal-Constitution to be pickpocketed in Italy last year.
</P>
<P>
   One writer, on assignment at the Vatican, ducked into the
bookstore and bent over to examine some titles, her purse slung
over her shoulder. When she went to check out, her pocketbook was
open and her wallet missing. This, where the pope blesses the
flock!
</P>
<P>
   Another staffer, a fashion writer, traveled to Milan to cover
the spring shows. When he arrived, sleepless and foggy-headed, he
took his eyes off his luggage for half a minute to deal with a
clerk at a currency exchange. In an instant, a leather bag
containing his camera, silver pens and other valuables vanished
like yesterday's hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   And now me, a middle-aged innocent abroad. Let me tell you what
happened _ and, in an accompanying story, how to guard against such
calamities. Don't say you haven't been warned.
</P>
<P>
   It was our first day in the Eternal City. Pam and I had managed
perhaps two hours of sleep on the overnight flight from Atlanta and
were addled with fatigue and excitement. We checked into our hotel
near the Colosseum, took a short nap and then roused ourselves so
as not to waste a minute of precious daylight.
</P>
<P>
   I read that one of the best ways to fend off street crime on
vacation is to blend in with the locals. That was hard for me to do
in Rome, since I am neither dark nor handsome, do not smoke, do not
have a cell phone appended to my skull, and do not wear tailored
black suits and expensive leather loafers when I am about to walk
10 miles on cobblestones. I fear that we looked like 100 percent
prime USDA-inspected tourist meat as we left the hotel _ Pam with
her camera bag, me with my cargo pants, ballcap and windbreaker
with a deep zippered pocket outside the left breast. I put a lot of
faith in that pocket. Having been cautioned about sticky-fingered
lowlife, I prudently slipped my wallet next to my heart instead of
carrying it on my hip.
</P>
<P>
   Tag-team assault
</P>
<P>
   We drifted toward the Colosseum with the rest of the pilgrims
and came to a set of steps marred by graffiti and trash. Vendors
and beggars clogged the sidewalk. There was no other way to go. I
reflexively patted my breast pocket _ inadvertently showing where
my wallet was _ and prepared to run the rapids.
</P>
<P>
   The turbulence hit immediately. A straggly-haired woman cradling
a baby confronted us from the left, sticking out a palm and
imploring, ``Bambino, bambino.'' We veered away and steered into
another woman waving a publication of some sort. I shook my head
no. She grabbed my right wrist. I flung my forearm away. Two
distractions in 10 seconds: more than enough opportunity for a pair
of good pickpockets to work their mischief.
</P>
<P>
   As we scampered down the steps, I was thinking to myself that
these were the most aggressive panhandlers I had ever encountered.
Then we turned out of the stairwell and caught our first full view
of the Colosseum. The beggars and peddlers were instantly
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   We strolled around the Colosseum and the Roman Forum for a
couple of hours. At one point, outside the Temple of the Vestal
Virgins, we watched as a white-haired man slapped at his hip and
cursed an urchin who had been nipping at his heels: ``Get your damn
hand out of my pocket!'' I didn't think to check my pocket. Vestal
virgins, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't discover that we had been violated until we stopped
for coffee on the way back to the hotel. I ordered a latte and
fished for my wallet. The pocket was unzipped and empty. The beggar
with the baby, the woman who gripped my wrist _ I suddenly
understood that I had been tag-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   We held out a dim hope that I had left the wallet in our room.
We hurried back to the hotel and turned our belongings inside out.
Nothing. It was time for damage control.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel manager, an amiable young man named Luca, kept a tiny
apartment down the hall from our room. He came to the door
barefooted and listened sympathetically as we spun our tale of woe.
He invited us in and set a phone on the table so we could start
canceling credit cards. We must have looked like wet puppies,
because he asked whether we needed some whiskey. I noticed a fifth
of Jack Daniel's sitting incongruously on a hot plate and felt
better just knowing that Tennessee's finest was in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens all the time,'' Luca consoled us. ``It is the
Gypsies.''
</P>
<P>
   We heard this across Italy whenever we mentioned that I had been
pickpocketed. ``Gypsies,'' waiters and desk clerks would spit as
their eyes narrowed, and then proceed to tell their own horror
stories. It seems that every street crime in Italy is blamed on
Gypsies, whether they are truly members of the wandering tribe of
Romania or merely dark-featured refugees from the Balkan wars. The
pickpockets who targeted me certainly fit the description.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling cards wasn't as easy as I had imagined. One of the
first rules of charge cards is to keep a separate record of account
numbers and theft-reporting lines. I had those records _ back in
Atlanta. In Italy, I was clueless. I wasn't even certain which
cards I was carrying. For the next 90 minutes, we worked the phone,
blocking our long-distance card, canceling our MasterCard,
reporting the stolen traveler's checks.
</P>
<P>
   Visa was the toughest. Pam didn't have a copy of that card in
her wallet, so we had no idea what the toll-free number was. Nor
did I know which bank had issued the card. We reached a Visa rep in
England, who gamely phoned banks in Missouri, Maryland and
Massachusetts in search of our line of credit. She even patched me
through to Equifax, the credit bureau in Atlanta, whose friendly
representative wasn't able to find our account but did tell me that
a chilly rain was falling back home.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes, Visa finally located the issuing bank in
Delaware and blocked the card. That raised a new problem: What were
we going to use to make purchases during the remaining 13 days of
our vacation? Fortunately, Pam had brought our ATM debit card,
which I had left behind. Thus, we had accidentally followed one of
the cardinal rules of secure travel: Divide your assets.
</P>
<P>
   As we were thanking Luca for his help, I decided that we ought
to make one more call, to the U.S. Embassy. We should have called
there first. The duty officer had every phone number we had spent
more than an hour scrambling to find. He also had some welcome
words of counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't feel too bad,'' he told me. ``These pickpockets are very
good. Try to enjoy the rest of your trip. It could have been
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. We didn't lose our passports or airplane tickets,
which can be very time-consuming to replace. We were out perhaps
$300 in cash, but we still had a live charge card. And no one had
physically harmed us, which is what foreigners fear most about
visiting the gun-happy United States.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paperwork
</P>
<P>
   The duty officer suggested that we report the theft to the Rome
police in case one of the credit card companies wanted to see proof
of the crime. Next morning, we visited the closest station and were
directed to a bilingual desk clerk in the Aliens Department. The
officious young woman handed me an incident report to fill out in
English. I was lucky in this regard. My newspaper colleagues tell
me that they recited the facts to cops who took it all down in
Italian and then asked them to sign a statement, never mind that
they couldn't understand a sentence of it. At least I knew what I
was signing.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished, I handed the statement to the clerk and she
gave me another, blank copy of the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write it again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scusi?'' I replied, using one of the few non-menu Italian
words I knew.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I said; what I was thinking was: Do I look like
Bartleby the Scrivener? Use a copying machine. I'm sure the Rome
police have them. I mean, Olivetti makes the damn things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again,'' she instructed, and I schlepped back to my hard
plastic seat and did as I was told.
</P>
<P>
   I completed the duplicate and gave it back to the clerk, who
summoned an officer. He listened as she translated and then he
asked me, in broken English, to show him what had happened. Act it
out. Right here.
</P>
<P>
   So I cradled an imaginary baby and stuck out a palm and bleated,
``Bambino, bambino,'' and grabbed my wrist and jostled myself and
unzipped my breast pocket and _ abracadabra! _ conjured an air
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' the cop said, stroking his chin thoughtfully.
``Gypsies.''
</P>
<P>
   It was comforting to know that Sherlock Holmes was on the case.
</P>
<P>
   No one said anything else to us, so we sat back down and awaited
further instructions. Ten minutes passed. I got up and asked the
clerk if she needed anything further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is finished,'' she said, shooing us away with her hands.
``Go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its undeniable entertainment value, the morning had
not been a meaningless exercise in paperwork. Later that day, when
we stopped by the American Express office at the Spanish Steps, the
first thing the teller wanted to see before replacing our
traveler's checks was a police report. The duty officer at the
embassy knew what he was talking about; it pays to have
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the trip, we enjoyed Italy quite nicely with one
charge card and one driver's license, which we needed to rent a car
in Tuscany. When we returned home, I did something I've been
meaning to do for several years now: I bought a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   An inexpensive one.

 &HT;    Experts' suggestions for South Africa
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   South Africa, here we come.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, Delta Air Lines and South African Airways will
offer nonstop, code-shared service from Hartsfield International
Airport to Johannesburg, with alternating daily service to Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, South African Airways had teamed with American
Airlines for flights out of Miami and New York. Monday, Delta takes
over for American and the Miami service will be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The move is designed to make the flights much more accessible _
Delta is the world's most-flown airline, connecting to 365 cities
in 60 countries. South African and Delta are offering an
introductory deal of $747 round trip to Cape Town and Johannesburg
for departures through March. You must stay from three to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's easier for Atlantans, and indeed most other
Americans, to travel to South Africa, what do you do when you get
there? We asked two local experts _ travel agents who specialize in
excursions to southern Africa _ to suggest the best trips for
animal lovers, sightseers, newlyweds, senior citizens and families.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Udwin, a native of Zimbabwe, runs the north Atlanta agency
Mushinda (a Shona term meaning ``personal attendant to the king'')
with her husband, Leon. Robert Goolsby is the co-founder of the
Sandy Springs agency S. A. Adventures. Here are their suggestions
(prices converted from South African rands to U.S. dollars):
</P>
<P>
   GAME
</P>
<P>
   VIEWING
</P>
<P>
   Udwin: Kruger National Park is popular, but I prefer to send my
clients to more secluded camps such as Phinda, which is on a
private game reserve in Zululand on the Indian Ocean. There are
regular leopard sightings, and the ecosystem in this region allows
for a vastly different game-viewing experience. Phinda has
beautifully decorated bungalows with private showers, toilets and
baths. There's even a little swimming pool. One day we came back
from a game drive and there was a hippo in the pool. We didn't go
swimming that day. (Cost: $300-$350 a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby: Kruger National Park is far and away the best-known of
the 16 national parks in South Africa. It's about the size of
Massachusetts and is home to great numbers of amphibians, reptiles
and birds as well as 147 species of mammals, including the big
five: elephants, rhinos, cape buffaloes, lions and leopards.
Accommodations in the park range from tents to luxury guest houses.
(Cost for a three-day stay: about $647.)
</P>
<P>
   SIGHTSEEING
</P>
<P>
   Udwin: Cape Town, which is without a doubt one of the most
beautiful cities in the world, is definitely worth a visit. From
here, private guides may take you on a day trip to the wine
district, about 45 minutes outside the city. The stately Cape Dutch
estates are magnificent. Another guided excursion takes visitors
along the awesome coastline to Cape Point. From here you can see
the confluence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. (Guided tours are
about $100.)
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby: No visit to Cape Town would be complete without a cable
car ride to the top of Table Mountain, which rises out of the
center of the city. The cable car rotates around a spindle, so you
don't have to fight to get a good view. From the top, you can see
all of Cape Town and the tip of Cape Point. To add a bit of poetry,
when the clouds come down, the locals say that the mountain has its
tablecloth. (Cable car rides are about $10.)
</P>
<P>
   NEWLYWEDS
</P>
<P>
   Udwin: Honeymooners usually want to experience all Africa has to
offer and still have their romance and privacy. The staff at many
lodges and camps in the region goes out of its way to ensure that
this is a trip of a lifetime. For example, at Barker's Lodge in
Zimbabwe, my clients walked into their cottage to find rose petals
strewn from the door to the bed with a bottle of champagne nestled
among the pillows. (Barker's rates are about $100 a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby: One of the big attractions for honeymooners in Cape
Town is the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens on the eastern
slope of Table Mountain. More than 6,000 species of plants are
here, including hundreds of varieties of protea, a flower
indigenous to South Africa. The protea blossoms range from the size
of your thumb to big enough to hold in both hands. (Entrance fee:
about $1.75.)
</P>
<P>
   SENIOR CITIZENS
</P>
<P>
   Udwin: A South African safari is the ideal vacation for anyone
who can ride in a Land Rover. Unlike in east Africa, all safaris
are in open vehicles (no sides), which afford a 360-degree
panorama. Whether traveling on their own or in large groups, all
our clients are met and escorted. Most camps cater to the dietary
requirements of the individual. Also, while it's a necessity to
take anti-malaria medication, no shots or other inoculations are
required. ($300-$350 a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby: A three-day tour from Cape Town to Pretoria on Rovos
Rail, a vintage train, has wide appeal for senior citizens. Many of
them remember trains like this from their childhood _ the dining
car was built in the 1920s. When you're inside the train, it's
elegant like the Orient Express except each cabin has its own
bathroom. The easy tour pace includes a stop at the diamond mines
in Kimberly. ($1,135 per person).
</P>
<P>
   FAMILIES
</P>
<P>
   Udwin: We first took our children on safari when they were 7 and
10. Not once did they moan or ask for TV. They were absolutely
enthralled, as were we all. Many of the camps will not accept
children under 12. For those that do not, we have alternatives such
as setting up private tented camps. For more of a resort
atmosphere, I recommend the Palace of the Lost City. This
fantastical hotel was built to resemble an ancient African palace.
No expense has been spared and the results are breathtaking. It is
part of a huge entertainment and resort complex in the middle of
the dry bushveld. ($350 a night for standard room to $3,500 a night
for full-service suite.)
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby: Our Makutsi Safari Farm package offers a complete tour
of South Africa. On the farm, which lies between the Drakensberg
Mountains and Kruger National Park, you can see jackals, antelopes,
giraffes, crocodiles and rhinos. But besides game viewing, the tour
visits tribal villages, a cheetah farm and natural sights such as
God's Window, the cliff seen in the movie ``The Gods Must Be
Crazy.'' The cost for seven days and six nights includes airfare
and works out to be fairly inexpensive for families. ($1,587 per
person.)
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Game viewing in South Africa is best in May and June, says Judy
Udwin. ``That is their winter, and it's a dry season. The animals
are looking for water, so they come out to the watering holes.''
However, Udwin notes, Cape Town can be cold and rainy then, so for
touring the city and relaxing on such beaches as Muizenberg and
Simonstown, she suggests going during the summer _ December through
March.

 &HT;    `Sanctuary' bears stark witness to unthinkable dark era
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The noose abruptly tightens and the neck snaps, tilting
uselessly to one side. Its oxygen cut off, the heart goes into the
frantic arrhythmia called fibrillation, and within seconds is
still. The bowels loosen.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupts in frenzied satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   On the shoulders of parents, children consume it all, a
whoop-it-up, public spectacle often accompanied by a barbecue
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   One 9-year-old, his appetite whetted, wanted more. ``I have seen
a man hanged,'' he told his mother; ``now I wish I could see one
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   At a particular time in the history of this country _ in the
late 19th century and well into the 20th _ he would have had
opportunity aplenty. Two or three people were lynched or burned at
a stake every week, most of them in the South, most of them black.
</P>
<P>
   The facts themselves are well-known, at least among scholars and
anyone who cares to look into the matter. What freezes the
attention is the sight of it: human beings dangling from trees,
lamp poles and bridges, while a crowd gazes at the contorted forms
in glassy-eyed glee.
</P>
<P>
   Few people today have ever seen such a sight; few people, at one
time, had never seen it.
</P>
<P>
   To see it in photographic retrospective is to look not so much
at the dead as the living _ those who thrilled to see someone
stripped bare, bullwhipped and put to death in whatever macabre
manner suited the audience. The dead are only mutilated corpses
that have to be disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who opens ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography
in America,'' an extraordinarily impressive documentary of American
vengeance and barbarism, agonizing death induces a sucking in of
breath, only to be followed by somber contemplation of the pleasure
it brought spectators _ ``lingering in the woods, circling after
the kill,'' as James Allen writes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't like to know the dark side of their history;
some would deny there ever was a dark side. But it is there, and
the period photos that Allen, an Atlanta antiques dealer, collected
are the palpable proof. Lynching was not an aberration but a way of
life supported in pulpits, in the offices of governors, on the
editorial pages of leading newspapers. If it was not exclusively a
Southern way of life, nowhere did it flourish as in the South. And
if it was not directed exclusively at African-Americans, they were
disproportionately its victims. As one black man said, ``We always
in season.''
</P>
<P>
   Shame for sale
</P>
<P>
   Allen calls himself a picker, a collector of quotidian odds and
ends. He searches out the yellowed scraps of news and salutation
that end up in the bottom of a drawer _ postcards, for example _
and sells them to people for whom such refuse has curious value.
``In America,'' he writes in an eloquent afterword, ``everything is
for sale, even a national shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, another dealer called Allen to say he had
come across, in an old roll-top desk in Macon, something that might
interest him. ``Until I came upon a postcard of a lynching,'' Allen
writes, ``postcards seemed trivial to msshapen Rubber-maid products
might seem now.''
</P>
<P>
   The postcard was a photograph of Leo Frank, the Jewish factory
worker accused of murdering a young woman and hanged by a mob in
Marietta in 1915. Soon afterward, Allen came upon another such
postcard, this one of a young black girl dangling from a tree. Now
he was interested, and he began calling other dealers and even set
up a Web site (www.willbuy.com). With the financial help of his
friend John Spencer Littlefield, he paid as little as $15 and as
much as $30,000 for postcards and other records that today are on
deposit in the special collections department at the Robert W.
Woodruff Library at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Sanctuary'' reproduces 98 images from the
Allen/Littlefield Collection, along with a foreword by U.S. Rep.
John Lewis (D-Ga.), Allen's afterword and essays by the Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian Leon Litwack and Hilton Als, a writer for
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are, in their different ways, powerful responses to
what can be seen with the eye. But it is the pictures that speak
most powerfully.
</P>
<P>
   When the townsfolk found the right tree for John Richards, they
left his shirt on but pulled his trousers below his crotch. It was
1916, in Goldsboro, N.C. Richards' hands are tied behind his back
and his muscular black butt is hard against the bark. From the
bottom of his trousers, his toes _ once the stubby toes of an
infant _ protrude. His executioners have his pine coffin open and
ready. Their faces wear grins of satisfied competence, a signal
from which bystanders take heart.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Frank Embree, were not dispatched with such swift
mercy. Unclothed and handcuffed, Embree was stood before the
citizenry of Fayette, Mo., in 1899, the skin on his legs and back
blistered and ripped open from repeated whip lashes. A camera
catches him eye-to-eye. His expression is without hope but also
without pity. Two images later, Frank Embree hangs from a tree, the
same eyes open but lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   Grim as these pictures are, the events they document once were
spectator events.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a Sunday afternoon, April 23, 1899,'' Litwack writes,
``more than 2,000 white Georgians, some of them arriving from
Atlanta on a special excursion train, assembled near the town of
Newnan to witness the execution of Sam Hose, a black Georgian.''
</P>
<P>
   Hose was chained and slathered with oil. Wood soaked in kerosene
was stacked around him. Before the torch was applied, fingers, ears
and genitals were cut off _ souvenirs of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Captured on film
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, lynchings and public burnings became
something to which people brought their cameras, still a
comparatively new gadget for most Americans. The open use of
cameras testified to an interest in memorializing the occasion.
``Not only did photographers capture the execution itself,''
Litwack writes, ``but also the carnival-like atmosphere and the
expectant mood of the crowd, as in the lynching of Thomas Brooks in
Fayette County, Tenn., in 1915.'' Litwack quotes a contemporary
report:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of kodaks clicked all morning at the scene of the
lynching. People in automobiles and carriages came from miles
around to view the corpse dangling from the end of a rope. ...
Picture card photographers installed a portable printing plant at
the bridge and reaped a harvest in selling postcards showing a
photograph of the lynched Negro. Women and children were there by
the score. At a number of country schools the day's routine was
delayed until boy and girl pupils could get back from viewing the
lynched man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1890s, Litwack writes, 139 people were lynched each year.
Others were burned alive. Three-quarters of the victims were black.
The number of lynchings and burnings declined in the next decade,
``but the percentage of black victims rose to 90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, there is something predictable to the eye in seeing
the stripped figure, brown shoulders sloped, arms bound in cuffs.
But in an odd way there is something ghostlike about seeing a
victim such as John Holmes, a white man hanged in San Jose, Calif.,
as late as 1933. He hangs naked 3 or 4 feet over the bowler hats of
spectators, pale as putty, almost like a rag doll that had never
breathed.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is what one takes away from ``Without
Sanctuary'': the extinguishing of life, and the enjoyment in doing
so. So exuberant is that enjoyment that on occasion it denied life
even to the unborn. In Valdosta in 1918, Mary Turner, eight months
pregnant, was hanged upside down from a tree for what The
Associated Press called ``unwise remarks'' about the execution of
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In their ``indignant mood,'' the AP reported, the people ``took
exception to her remarks, as well as to her attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   As she hanged by her ankles, someone ripped her belly open with
a knife used for splitting hogs. Her infant fell from her womb and
cried briefly.
</P>
<P>
   A man ended its cries with his heel.

 &HT;    Old head: Spoleto exercises esoteric lineup in `spa for the
mind'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verdi's ``Aida'' will be there _ as a marionette show. Sweden's
Cullberg Ballet will be there _ with a darkly beautiful,
controversial ``Swan Lake.'' ``Mother Courage'' will be there _
with a diminutive actress in the monumental Brecht role. And Joel
Shapiro's angular sculptures will be there _ dancing across the
18th-century gardens of Middleton Place.
</P>
<P>
   In what looks like one of its more esoteric lineups in recent
memory, Spoleto Festival USA has announced the $6.2 million event
planned for May 26-June 11 in the historic city of Charleston, S.C.
The 17 days of opera, dance, theater, music and visual arts will
showcase new productions of Verdi's ``Luisa Miller'' and jazz
composer Diedre Murray's ``Running Man''; modern dance by Susan
Marshall and Bill T. Jones; and a bigger-than-usual jazz roster,
including Chick Corea and Gary Burton, pianist Fred Hersch and
vocalist Dianne Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best metaphor is that it's going to be like a spa for the
mind,'' says general director Nigel Redden. ``You end up doing a
whole bunch of exercises ... and it's sort of wonderful finding
these muscles that one had forgotten existed.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, opera _ and the chamber music series led by
impresario Charles Wadsworth _ will be major draws.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Luisa Miller,'' Spoleto is importing a Welsh National
Opera production of Gluck's ``Iphigenie en Tauride,'' to be
directed by Spoleto opera and orchestra leader Steven Sloane, who
recently announced that he won't be renewing his contract beyond
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Redden says the jazz opera ``Running Man,'' about a young boy
who has lost his way in life, is ``a story that you feel that you
read about in the newspaper all the time.'' Rounding out the opera
program is ``The Silver River,'' based on the ancient Chinese
legend about the creation of night and day. It was composed by
Bright Sheng, with libretto by Tony Award winner David Henry Hwang
(``M. Butterfly'').
</P>
<P>
   If, as in Redden's words, the Spoleto experience is like
``walking a tightrope,'' then this year it is even more so.
``Filao,'' by the French company Les Colporteurs, employs trapeze
artists, dancers and musicians in a surreal circus adaptation of
the Italo Calvino novel ``The Baron in the Trees,'' about a young
man who refuses to come down from his perch in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the nouvelle cirque (``new circus'') is anything like
the popular Cirque du Soleil, Redden says: ``If Cirque du Soleil is
Broadway, then this is off-Broadway. It doesn't have the glitz of
Cirque du Soleil, and people shouldn't expect that kind of smoke
and lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he says, Cullberg Ballet's ``Swan Lake'' is nothing
like Matthew Bourne's theatrical, mostly male version that played
Broadway last year. Though wildly contemporary, with emaciated
figures wearing stockings over their heads, the Cullberg telling is
faithful in spirit to the Petipa original. It is about dance. But
Redden warns: ``You have to come to it with an open mind. You can't
come expecting the `Swan Lake' you saw at American Ballet Theatre
several years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Aida'' puppet show is by Italy's Compagnia Carlo Colla e
Figli, which will also be doing Jules Verne's ``Around the World in
80 Days,'' with 300 puppets and some of the original music and sets
from the company's 1896 production.
</P>
<P>
   This season's only straight theater production will be ``Mother
Courage and Her Children,'' from London's Shared Experience
Theatre. Playing the title role will be Kathryn Hunter, whose
outsized mannerisms (and cigarette holder) mesmerized Spoleto-goers
who saw Theatre de Complicite's ``The Visit'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The singer Kurt Elling will open the jazz series at the Cistern,
and guitarist Bill Frisell will bring his fusion sound to the
Cistern and Kiawah Island Resort. Corea will be jamming with
vibraphonist and old pal Burton before breaking out into a set with
his new six-piece acoustic band, Origin. Hersch will wear two hats,
performing a solo piano concert and accompanying one piece on the
Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company program.

   ADDRESS-ANALYSIS (Washington) _ President Clinton has had many

 &HT;    How to reduce odds you'll become a target
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, at least I'm not alone. Pickpocketing is the one of the
most common complaints American travelers report to U.S. embassies
and consulates abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clark Howard, Atlanta's consumer and travel authority, has
been victimized. While he hasn't been pickpocketed, his rental cars
have been broken into twice _ once, in Amsterdam, when he unwisely
left a camera in plain view through a soon-to-be-smashed
windshield. Both his sister-in-law and father-in-law have been
pickpocketed. The latter was hit at the Colosseum in Rome, just
like me.
</P>
<P>
   So it can happen to anyone. The trick is reducing the odds.
Here's a checklist of precautions from Howard and from a useful
State Department publication called ``A Safe Trip Abroad'' (which
can be viewed on the Bureau of Consular Affairs Web site:
travel.state.gov _ click ``travel publications''):
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lighten your wallet and pocketbook before leaving. Carry no
more cash or credit cards than you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make two photocopies of passports, airline tickets, driver's
licenses and credit and ID cards. Write down the phone numbers to
report theft. Leave one photocopy at home with family or friends.
Pack the other in a place separate from your other valuables.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't carry any irreplaceable objects. A friend of mine was
heartbroken when some of her one-of-a-kind jewelry was stolen from
her hotel room in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Split up your cards and cash and carry them in different
places. Howard divides his between a front pants pocket and a body
wallet; ``I try not to reveal my main source of money.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Beware of pickpocket MOs: people who jostle you, spill food on
you, ask you for directions or time. Sad to say, but beggars _
particularly beggars with babies _ figure in a lot of incidents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Know where you are. Poor countries, large cities and tourist
sites like the Colosseum seem to attract more pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wear the strap of your pocketbook or camera bag across your
chest, bandolier-style. Carry it away from the curb, where drive-by
purse snatchers can't get at it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't carry your wallet in an outside pocket or fanny pack.
Some people put their money in body wallets worn inside their
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   This last one was my big mistake. My pocket was deep and zipped
shut, but because it was on the outside of my windbreaker, I was
vulnerable. Never underestimate the skill of professional
pickpockets.
</P>

&HT;     BOXER VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. CITIZENSHIP FOR CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND and MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer pledged Thursday to block any
legislation to grant U.S. citizenship to Elian Gonzalez, saying
efforts to keep the Cuban boy in this country amount to ``child
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, D-Calif., said in an interview that ``it's just
horrible'' that the 6-year-old boy ``has been made a political
pawn'' in American-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the
American relatives of Gonzalez to return the boy to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba. Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the
time, was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida
on Nov. 25 after the boat carrying him to the United States
capsized, killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing to this child is causing him to suffer
another loss on top of this incredible loss of watching his mother
die before his very eyes,'' Boxer said. ``Now as a result of U.S.
action we're going to say he's going to lose his father? This is
child abuse in my opinion. This is not right. This is untenable. If
you really believe in family values you wouldn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the boy should be back in Cuba with his father as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's young enough that after time this memory will be
put into some kind of perspective,'' she said. ``The longer this
goes on, the more traumatic this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said she
continued to be willing to work with the family to reach a
compromise, but the government's decision to return the boy to Cuba
would not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we recognize that what is at stake
here is a bond between a parent and his child, and that in almost
every legal system I know, certainly in ours, (that bond) is
something that is interrupted only in extreme circumstances,'' she
said at her weekly new conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno declined to say whether the Justice Department
would fight the citizenship legislation, she made clear her
opposition to any such action by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American children ended up abroad, and American parents
wanted them returned, and a foreign country made them a citizen so
they did not return, I don't think people in the United States
would be very happy about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., is pushing legislation to grant
citizenship to the boy, but Boxer said she doubts there is enough
support in the Senate to approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's unclear whether he'll bring this to the
floor,'' said Boxer, who vowed to filibuster the citizenship bill
if there were a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who has one grandchild, said she empathizes with
Gonzalez's grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, who
returned to Capitol Hill Thursday with a tearful plea to have their
grandson returned to Cuba. Boxer said she met with the women on
Tuesday and got ``a strong feeling that this is from their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Quintana spent Thursday pressing their case with
lawmakers on Capitol Hill while at the same time, American
relatives of the boy urged Congress to approve the citizenship
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters through a translator in a hallway,
Quintana said she and Rodriguez ``have been suffering a lot'' since
they met with their grandson on Wednesday in Miami. ``Our grandson
is a whole different boy. He has changed completely. They are doing
something to him that has changed the child,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
   Quintana said her grandson was very shy at first but ``became
more interested'' after they showed him photos of his friends and
family in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to save this child as soon as possible to bring him
back to his family and father in Cuba,'' Quintana said, adding that
is the only way he will ``recover and be the happy boy he was
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintana added that when the grandmothers told the boy they want
to bring him back home, ``he nodded his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the grandmothers ``are under tremendous stress and
strain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that this isn't doing any good for the
anti-Castro cause,'' Boxer said. ``They're looking as if they'll do
anything for politics and ideology. You have to put a little boy's
health and safety before politics. They ought to take their stand
on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with the Cuban
government of Fidel Castro. Gonzalez's relatives in Florida are
fighting to prevent his return to Cuba.

KEARSE'S BROTHER IN THE DARK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS ANDERSON   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune.    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Millions of people will watch Jevon Kearse play
football in Sunday's Super Bowl. His brother, however, will not be
one of them. Television sets are not allowed inside his silent
cell.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kearse, who is serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence
at DeSoto Correctional Institution in Arcadia for armed robbery,
was recently placed in disciplinary confinement for a fight with
another inmate on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kearse will not be able to watch his younger brother play
defensive end for the Tennessee Titans. Stripped of his privileges,
he is not permitted to watch television, listen to the radio, read
a newspaper or use a telephone until Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   DeSoto Correctional Institution Warden Linda Williams said the
facility will not make an exception and let Joseph Kearse watch the
game, even though his brother is one of the Super Bowl's stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never dream of doing that,'' Williams said. ``That's
not fair to the other inmates, just because he's got a brother in
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say, `We'll let you watch,' and not let someone else
watch because they don't have a brother in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way Joseph Kearse will know who won the Super Bowl, or
how his brother played, is if a correctional officer tells him
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kearse had been housed in an open dorm but was moved to a
cell after the fight. Since the wing is isolated, he won't even be
able to hear televisions from other parts of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Jevon Kearse is having one of the best seasons of any defensive
rookie in NFL history. He was named the league's Defensive Rookie
of the Year and was also selected to the Pro Bowl. His 14 and a
half sacks were the most by a rookie ever.
</P>
<P>
   According to Florida Department of Corrections spokesperson
Debbie Buchanan, Joseph Kearse and another inmate got into a fight
on Jan. 1. A report was filed by a correctional officer and Kearse
was placed in confinement on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   He is eligible to return to the dorm and regain his privileges
on Feb. 5, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who go into the confinement area,'' she said.
``When it is over, if he asks one of the officers who won, I'm sure
they'll tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Joseph Kearse has been in confinement, his brother has
been the focus of the national media in Atlanta, the site of
Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At media day on Tuesday, Jevon Kearse stood at a podium and
spoke of his brother. He said they keep in touch, but if he was
aware that his brother can't watch the Super Bowl, he didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's as big a celebrity in there as I am out here,''
Kearse told reporters. ``Hopefully when he's able to get back out
and get his life together we can catch back up. There's a lot of
catching up to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kearse once attempted to use Jevon's identity to escape
trouble with the law in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, 1995, a man claiming to be Jevon Kearse was arrested
in north Sarasota for being in possession of a stolen car. When the
man failed to appear for a March court date, a warrant was issued
for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In September '95, Jevon Kearse, a redshirt freshman at the
University of Florida, was washing his car in Gainesville when
someone complained that his music was too loud.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded to the noise complaint, discovered the warrant,
and Jevon Kearse was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Jevon Kearse, who spent one night in jail, claimed he had never
been to Sarasota, and suspected the man arrested was his brother.
After fingerprints confirmed the man was Joseph Kearse, the state
attorney's office dropped a grand-theft charge against Jevon
Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while to get over it,'' Jevon Kearse said. ``But
knowing the type of person my brother is, I'd like to think he was
trying to turn his life around when they stopped him.''

weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Vin Diesel
in a scene from ``Pitch Black.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Vin Diesel is a creature of the night.
 &HT;    ``I love the nightlife, I love to boogie,'' he says, crooning a
classic disco tune, horribly off-key. ``Really, I am a night
person.''
 &HT;    It's virtual typecasting, then, that the imposing actor co-stars
in the new sci-fi adventure ``Pitch Black'' _ written and directed
by ``The Arrival's'' David Twohy and opening Feb. 18 _ as Riddick,
a convicted murderer with shimmering, surgically enhanced eyes that
enable him to see in the dark.
 &HT;    That ability proves useful when Riddick and a group of space
travelers crash-land on a desolate planet whose three blazing suns
swiftly set, giving way to nightfall and the onslaught of ravenous,
flesh-eating flying creatures.
 &HT;    Nearly as dangerous are Riddick's volatile relationships with
his fellow survivors: Johns (Cole Hauser) is the lawman
transporting Riddick to prison, while Fry (Radha Mitchell) is the
pilot who crashed the ship but now leads the group. Imam (Keith
David) is a Muslim whose faith is put to the test by the crisis,
and Jack (Rhiana Griffith) is a teen with a secret. ``Farscape''
star Claudia Black plays Shazza, a plucky geologist, with Lewis
Fitz-Gerald as Paris, a selfish antique dealer.
 &HT;    ``It's almost impossible not to retrace some of the steps taken
by other sci-fi films, but we wanted to make `Pitch Black' as
original as possible,'' Diesel says. ``We did that through the
characters.
 &HT;    ``Riddick, specifically, is going on a journey to explore his
humanity,'' the actor adds. ``He comes off at first as a villain,
as beastlike and nefarious, but later we discover he may have more
humanity than some of the characters to whom we've attributed
heroic qualities.
 &HT;    ``That's fascinating.''
 &HT;    Sitting in a suite room at Manhattan's Regency Hotel, Diesel is
dressed head to toe in black. He's got muscles on top of muscles
and speaks in a voice as deep as the Atlantic Ocean. Muggers would
flee from this guy.
 &HT;    That physicality, however, bolsters Diesel's performance and the
film. The actor handled most of his own stunts, which meant
tussling with both Hauser and the monsters.
 &HT;    ``Cole and I worked very hard with the stunt coordinators,'' the
former bouncer says. ``In rehearsals and then every week during
production, we allocated time to making sure that those scenes came
off.
 &HT;    ``These guys wouldn't just walk in and start pummeling each
other,'' he adds. ``They are masters at what they do, and they
fight in a cobralike way, with striking movements.
 &HT;    ``Fighting the creature was a little more difficult,'' Diesel
says. ``There was a contraption created that was part puppet and
part animatronics. It took several people to work it. I'd hold each
arm and push the thing.
 &HT;    ``After an hour of takes my arms got tired,'' he adds. ``I got
scrapes. But it looks good.''
 &HT;    For those who can't get enough of Riddick or ``Pitch Black,''
there's ``Into Pitch Black,'' a Sci-Fi Channel special that will
debut on Feb. 20. The inventive, hour-long companion piece centers
on the government's search for Riddick following the crash, and
includes original footage, scenes from ``Pitch Black'' and Diesel
reprising his role as Riddick.
 &HT;    Diesel may not yet be a household name, but in millions of homes
he's already a household voice: The actor, whose credits include
``Strays'' _ which he also wrote, produced and directed _ and
``Saving Private Ryan,'' put the words in the mouth of the title
alien robot in ``The Iron Giant.''
 &HT;    That superb animated feature got lost in the shuffle upon its
release last summer. However, it's finding a sizable audience in
home video.
 &HT;    ``I was very proud to be a part of `The Iron Giant,''' Diesel
says. ``My mother said, `If you never do anything again, I'll
always be proud of you for being the Iron Giant.'
 &HT;    ``It was a very different experience,'' he says. ``We had to
dissect little things that in live-action films you overlook. A
`Hmmm' was something you did 20,000 times, 1,000 different ways.
Then I had to do the guttural sounds, which were deeper than my
voice. I had to perfect that, then keep doing it.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't able to talk for two hours after each session.''
 &HT;    That's not to say there weren't similarities between the Iron
Giant and Riddick.
 &HT;    ``They are both perceived as the villain, as the enemy,'' Diesel
says. ``In the case of the Iron Giant, it's all in the way he's
treated.''
 &HT;    ``The Iron Giant'' actually carries a spiritual message, the
actor believes.
 &HT;    ``It preaches that the soul doesn't die,'' he says. ``That's
what I believe, and I thought it was beautifully done in the film.
It was done without being as didactic as some of the Walt Disney
films, but it was effective. It's a message you want kids to hear.
 &HT;    ```South Park' and `Inspector Gadget' are cool,'' he admits.
``They're entertaining, but there's something about quality films
that have heart, with a substantial message, that just make the
world a better place.''
 &HT;    Diesel catches himself and smiles.
 &HT;    ``As idealistic as that sounds, there's something to be said
about that in a world with no boundaries, where the envelope is
pushed wide open,'' he says. ``Films like `The Iron Giant' come in
handy.
 &HT;    ``You feel good when `The Iron Giant' is your kid's favorite
film.''

after the state comptroller issued a blistering account of its

elections. The comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, did not implicate
Barak personally but he held him accountable for what he described
as a ``trampling of the law'' by his One Israel party. Barak's
associates circumvented strict campaign finance restrictions
systematically, channeling illegal contributions into a host of
non-profit organizations, the comptroller said. By Deborah Sontag.

   FRANCE-PRISONS (Paris) _ While working at La Sante prison in
Paris, Dr. Veronique Vasseur met inmates so deranged or depressed
that they had swallowed rat poison, forks or drain cleaner. Skin
diseases were rampant because showers were only available twice a
week, though temperatures sometimes soared to more than 100 degrees
in cramped cells holding four prisoners each. Some of the weaker
inmates had been turned into slaves by their cellmates. Moreover,
nearly half of the France's 55,000 prisoners have never been
convicted, because the law here allows investigating magistrates to
put suspects in jail indefinitely without trial or bail. Dr.

TITANS OR RAMS? TWO OPPOSING PREDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE TITANS WILL WIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE FREEMAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Williams, Tennessee's defensive coordinator, was asked how
difficult it is for an offense to play the week following a game
against Tampa Bay's hard-hitting defense. A smile went across
Williams' face.
</P>
<P>
   After St. Louis had beaten Tampa Bay in the National Football
Conference championship game, Rams players were limping around as
if they had just played two games instead of one. That is why
Williams was smiling. He knows that this season, teams did not fare
well the week after having faced Tampa Bay. They usually start
slowly because the Bucs' physical play would still be having an
effect. Tennessee coaches talked about this fact in their meetings
this past week, and Williams plans to be aggressive with his calls
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys like it when I tell them, `We're not holding back,'''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Said cornerback Dalnon Sidney: ``When you take it to the Rams
early, you can unsettle them. That's our approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee defense has not received its due for just how
daring, and good, it is. The Titans may not have the speed at
linebacker that the Buccaneers do, but over all, they still have
good quickness. And because of Williams and coach Jeff Fisher, they
have solid defensive schemes to match.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be the Tennessee's secondary _ and the beginning of
the game. St. Louis has scored 123 first-quarter points, most in
the NFL, and mainly through the air. Tennessee likes to play a lot
of man to man, a scheme that worked when the Titans defeated the
Rams earlier this season. In that game, St. Louis had 25 snaps with
four wide receivers and 20 snaps with three receivers. While other
teams have crumbled when St. Louis went to those receiver packages,
the Titans stayed firm. They will again. Titans, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE RAMS WILL WIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS GEORGE &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The glamour offense in this Super Bowl belongs to St. Louis,
which in the regular season scored 526 points, the third-most in
National Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kurt Warner threw 41 touchdown passes, 12 of them to
receiver Isaac Bruce, 8 to receiver Az-Zahir Hakin and 5 to running
back Marshall Faulk. No Titan caught more than 4 touchdown passes.
Faulk rushed for 1,381 yards, 77 more than Tennessee's Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
   Offense is the staple of today's pro game, but for those who
believe that defense is essential to winning championships, the
Rams defense is the front-runner there, too. It allowed an average
5.37 yards per pass attempt, the Titans 6.05. The Rams allowed 33.8
percent in third-down conversion percentage, the Titans 35 percent.
It gained 57 sacks, the Titans 54.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are balanced, but the Rams have more balance. And
their ability to strike deep from any spot on the field makes them
more suited to jump ahead or to climb from behind. St. Louis is
simply more dangerous and capable of coloring the complexion of
this game on both sides of the ball, even in its special teams,
masterfully coached by Frank Gansz. Expect the Rams to play with
more flash, with more flair. Rams, 27-23.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A batch of wintry precipitation, mainly in the form of ice
pellets, moved across northern Texas on Thursday morning as a
potent jet stream disturbance approached from eastern New Mexico.
Snow fell in Oklahoma and Arkansas, where a deep layer of cold air
prevailed above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, broken areas of light to moderate wintry precipitation
will affect an area ranging from the lower Mississippi and
Tennessee valleys to the southern Appalachians as the disturbance
lifts northeast and gradually weakens. However, a narrow swath of
locally heavy snow could affect the Tennessee Valley, where a
surface trough of low pressure reaching north from the Gulf of
Mexico enhances the lifting of moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of light to moderate snow will develop over the lower
Ohio Valley, but its northeastward advance will be checked by a
robust high pressure system over the upper Ohio Valley. Meanwhile,
showers will spread toward Florida from southern Mississippi as a
low pressure system grinds eastward. Rainfalls of an inch are
possible near the Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous combinations of Arctic air and strong winds will
prevail across New England, which will stay in the windy, frigid
wake of a low pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes. Wind and
Arctic chill will ease Saturday as the weakening low heads toward
the Labrador Sea.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of accumulating snows will blanket parts of the Missouri
Valley as an upper-level low lifts moist air drawn northwestward
from the Tennessee Valley.
</P>
<P>

   Mr. Bush comes off as a man who wants it, but not at any price,
and sometimes not as much as he wants to wake up in his own bed at
the Governor's mansion in Austin, Tex., wander downstairs to make a
pot of coffee, let out the pets, fetch the newspaper and get back
under the covers with Mrs. Bush to read it.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, that is one of the reasons why many
Ameri- cans like him, a possibility of which Mr. Bush is
undoubtedly aware.
</P>
<P>
   (NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mr. Bush is happy to sepa- rate himself from both Mr.
Gore and President Clinton, and has been more aggressive about it
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new line appeared in his speeches, and that does
not hap- pen too often. To rally Republican voters in Iowa, Mr.
Bush began talk- ing about what this election really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the end of the Clinton era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a freighted statement, be- cause one of the signals it
sent to Republican voters was that if they wanted the White House
back, as they surely did, it was time to unite around the front
runner and send him into the general election as un- scathed and
unbowed as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It also made a tacit claim to mo- rality at the same time that
Mr. Bush was facing questions about abortion and giving answers
that might not be wholly satisfying reli- gious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Mr. Bush's victory speech after the Iowa caucuses on Monday
night, he went a step further, not only re- ferring to the Clinton
era but also appealing to Americans ``weary of scandals and
alibis.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in Concord, some- one in the audience played into
his hands, asking Mr. Bush how he would handle the baggage of Mr.
Clinton's behavior if he were in Mr. Gore's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been in his posi- tion,'' Mr. Bush said. ``I
wouldn't have accepted the vice presidency under Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, when he was asked a simi- lar question by a reporter, Mr.
Bush said of Mr. Gore: ``I don't think he can figure out how to
handle his relationship with the president. He distances, he
doesn't distance. He distances, he doesn't distance.''
</P>
<P>
   (NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)
</P>
<P>
   In the semiotics of political cam- paigns, perhaps nothing is as
reveal- ing as the music that plays at a candidate's events. Mr.
Bush's aides have assembled an entire sound-H track, which made its
debut last week, and the song list is almost a synopsis of Mr.
Bush's persona and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Bamba'' is on it, with Spanish lyrics that evoke both Mr.
Bush's ability to speak the language and his outreach to
Hispanic-American vot- ers.
</P>
<P>
   The singer John Fogerty's ``Cen- terfield'' is on it, a reminder
that Mr. Bush loves baseball, was once the managing general partner
of the Texas Rangers and is ``ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of country and western, for that down-home,
folksy feel. There is a bit of mild disco, just to show that Mr.
Bush can groove.
</P>
<P>
   Van Morrison's ``Bright Side of the Road'' telegraphs Mr. Bush's
optimism, while Tom Petty's ``I Won't Back Down'' claims a certain
degree of tenacity, his homesickness notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   And Sting's ``A Brand New Day'' promises precisely that. Never
mind that the song is more romantically than politically inclined.
</P>
<P>
   After a miscue several weeks go, when ``Cat's Cradle,'' about a
son who grows up to be like his aloof father, played at several
campaign appearances, all the lyrics were carefully vetted this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why one aide's sugges- tion, Sheryl Crow's ``A
Change Would Do You Good,'' did not make the cut. Upon closer
examination, a vigilant member of the Bush staff realized that the
song included a reference to, um, self-gratification.

AGASSI BEATS SAMPRAS TO REACH FINAL OF AUSTRALIAN OPEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ It felt more like a 15-rounder than a
five-setter when Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras met on Thursday
night in their Australian Open semifinal, but there were also a few
strokes of tennis artistry worth preserving for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   From Sampras, there were the concussive, career-high 37 aces:
four of them hit with second serves under extreme pressure against
the world's No. 1 player and No. 1 returner. There was the
sprinting, stretching forehand passing shot that Sampras somehow
hit from an acute angle to take a 4-3 lead in the fourth-set
tiebreaker: a lead that would turn out to be his last.
</P>
<P>
   As for Agassi, there was the forehand retort to yet another
excellent serve in the final set, a return that landed smack on the
line, giving him a quick break and a snowballing psychological
edge. And there was the bolt of a backhand winner in the very next
game, a ball hit down the line off a shot sliced low and without a
great deal of force. That winner spoke volumes about Agassi's
rhythm and level of fitness in that it required him to bend deeply
and generate pace and precision all on his own at a very late stage
in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the proceedings lasted 2 hours 55 minutes on a cool and
gusty evening at Melbourne Park. And in the end it was appropriate
that this match between the main attractions in men's tennis was
played in Rod Laver Arena, because Agassi's 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (0), 7-6
(5), 6-1 victory made him the first man since Laver to reach four
consecutive finals in Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amazing run I've had in the Slams, certainly I don't take
for granted the difficulty of it,'' Agassi said. ``By the same
token, you don't really focus on that. You keep focusing on the
next match, and I think one day you look back and take stock on
what you have accomplished. But right now, I don't think is the
time for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver won the four majors in 1969, and though Agassi is a long
way from matching the red-headed Australian's Grand Slam or the one
completed in 1938 by Don Budge, who died in the United States on
Wednesday, Agassi is now in excellent position to win his third
major title in eight months.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the French Open last June, he lost to Sampras in
the Wimbledon final in July and then won the U.S. Open in
September. Now, only the winner of the Yevgeny Kafelnikov-Magnus
Norman semifinal on Friday stands in his way of collecting the
Melbourne major.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the second-seeded Russian, Kafelnikov, the defending
champion here, nor the 12th-seeded Swede, Norman, will be favored
against Agassi: not in light of his victory over Sampras and not in
light of his remarkably concentrated, recession-proof play
throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre doesn't want to look back five years from now and wish
he could do this differently,'' said his coach Brad Gilbert. ``He's
in the prime of his life, and he's not going to get another shot at
that. All that is going to happen in his tennis career is going to
happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi did not head home to Las Vegas for his off-season and
revel idly in his achievements. According to his trainer, Gil
Reyes, he went straight back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't miss a day,'' Reyes said. ``On Christmas Eve, you
could see cars driving by: families going to Christmas parties and
Christmas meals, and Andre was up on the hill running sprints. That
tells you a little bit about a guy who has done so much and has so
much. And I just kept looking at him and saying, `What makes this
man go?' He was up there just running and running: so quiet and all
you could hear were his legs pounding and his lungs screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of Thursday night here, all that could be heard was the
whack of the ball hitting Sampras' strings and the smack of it
ricocheting off the padded walls that surround the court. ``When a
guy has 37 aces, you are not moving around for periods of time out
there,'' Agassi said, ``except your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only four service breaks in the match, and Agassi had
three of them. But there were none in the third and fourth sets,
when the match and mood reached its peak. Sampras took the lead
after rolling through the third-set tiebreaker at love, smacking
two aces and three other winners. And after both players dodged
trouble on their serves throughout the fourth set, it soon came
time for another tiebreaker. The tension built as each player
matched the other: 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5. Agassi edged ahead 6-5
as Sampras' service return hit the tape, then the Las Vegan closed
out the tiebreaker 7-5 with a great return that set up a short
forehand crosscourt past Sampras at the net.
</P>
<P>
   But though Sampras is one of the best pressure players in
history and has a much better record in five-set matches than
Agassi, the rest of this match, surprisingly, was a denouement, as
Sampras' shoulders and standard of play slumped. Agassi broke him
in the second game and again in the sixth game and was soon pumping
a triumphant fist in the direction of Gilbert, Reyes and his
girlfriend Steffi Graf who reached five Australian Open finals of
her own before retiring last year.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had kept his cool and concentration. What about Sampras,
the man who was attempting to break his tie with Roy Emerson and
win a record 13th Grand Slam singles title?
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampras, he injured his hip flexor in the third
game of the match. ``I played the match feeling it, and movement is
obviously a big part of my game, but I am not sitting here with an
excuse why I lost,'' Sampras said. ``He outplayed me, and I had my
chances and certainly a little hip strain doesn't help.''

   NEW YORK _ ``Picturing Guatemala: Images From the Cirma
Photography Archive, 1870-1997'' at the Americas Society is an
exhibition whose power is quietly but insistently felt. It is a
power found in a people who appear to have survived years of
repression and civil war scarred but intact: an eloquence that is
also unveiled in the images of Luis Gonzalez Palma, Guatemala's
foremost photographer, whose work of the last 10 years is at
Throckmorton Fine Art.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so images in ``Picturing Guatemala'' are culled from
the extensive photographic archive of Cirma (Centro de
Investigaciones Regionales de Mesoamerica), a nonprofit
organization founded in 1979 in Antigua, Guatemala. Among the
collection's rarities is one of the few extant albums of Eadweard
Muybridge's trip to Central America in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   Wall texts here are taciturn. The black-and-white images are
neither sensational nor, with the exception of Muybridge, taken by
widely known photographers. The subjects, in fact, lean toward what
would be ordinary in most places (landscapes, studio portraits,
street scenes, politicians campaigning) and what has become
ordinary in many parts of Latin America (a soldier executed,
peasants rounded up, children in a refugee camp). But anyone
prepared to mine the subtle riches on display will find much that
is rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s Tomas Zanotti, an Italian, took some delightfully
off-kilter old-fashioned studio portraits of Mayan families. His
props included fussy Victorian side tables and fancy painted
backdrops, and he often placed realistic-looking plaster-of-Paris
dogs at his clients' feet. In these portraits, Zanotti seemed to
view his less-than-affluent clientele with respect and affection.
The props may be outlandishly foreign, the Mayans may be barefoot
or wear scruffy clothes or adopt too stiff a pose, but the men,
women and children looking at the camera project a lovely,
dignified sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious gentleman posing in front of a European backdrop,
wearing a pith helmet and a Japanese kimono, is identified as
``Juan Jose de Jesus Yas: Self-Portrait 1900.'' According to the
catalog published by Cirma, Yas was the first Japanese to emigrate
to Central America. By the mid-1860s, commercial photography was
thriving in Japan, and Yas' studio portraits in Guatemala at the
turn of the 19th century reflected that tradition. One of his
studio portraits is of three strikingly handsome women. Yas also
made an unusual portrait: a triple exposure in a single negative,
showing the same man in three poses, as though he were part of a
triplet.
</P>
<P>
   Yas' nephew, Jose Domingo Noriega, was the superior portraitist.
He could take a portrait of an elderly couple _ the lines on their
faces mirroring the lines on the gnarled hands resting peaceably on
their laps _ and catch an identically transcendent, slight smile on
their faces. Noriega also took an incandescent picture of a woman
in a butterfly costume, her arms spread wide, a wary look on her
face.
</P>
<P>
   This photograph, as well as the majestic portrait by the
Guatemalan photographer Alberto G. Valdeavellano of a Mayan woman
from Mixco (circa 1895), foreshadows the work at Throckmorton by
Gonzalez Palma, who often puts wings on the people in his images _
people notable for their strong, silent gaze. But it is a pair of
so-called funerary portraits, taken by the Yas-Noriega Studio, that
bring Gonzalez Palma's images vividly to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Here, women are shrouded in black and look on the face of death
without weeping. A girl of perhaps 8 or 9, standing by a dead
infant who appears to be sleeping, gazes at the camera. Her look of
mournful stoicism is also found in Gonzalez Palma's ``Portrait of a
Boy'' (1990) at Throckmorton. On the boy's head is a crown of
thorns.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1957, Gonzalez Palma has lived through his country's 36
years of civil war, the longest in Latin America, which began in
1960 and ended in late 1996. If the Cirma photo collection aims to
be Guatemala's visual memory, Gonzalez Palma's work can be said to
serve as a portrait of his country's tormented soul. Instead of
reworking images of Guatemalans as faceless suffering masses,
Gonzalez Palma has chosen to focus on individual faces, which he
shows with the tenderness Julia Margaret Cameron gave her
portraits. He then superimposes on these faces the raw theater of
suffering, mixing the emotional symbols of Roman Catholicism with
those of Mayan myths familiar to the majority of Guatemalans, who
are Mayan or of Mayan and Spanish descent. (A book of his images,
``Luis Gonzalez Palma: Poems of Sorrow,'' was published last year
by Arena Editions.)
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Palma's pictures, which are sometimes ripped and pasted
together, in the manner of Mike and Doug Starn's early work, have a
rich ocher overlay, which allows him to accentuate his subject's
eyes by leaving the area around the pupil an arresting, bleak
white. Even when a comely and unsmiling young woman is wearing a
crown of roses, as she does in ``The Hidden Rose'' (1995), she
might as well be wearing a crown of thorns.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Picturing Guatemala: Images From the Cirma Photography
Archive, 1870-1997'' is at the Americas Society, 680 Park Ave.
(212) 249-8950, through April 16. ``Decade: Luis Gonzalez Palma''
is at Throckmorton Fine Art, 153 E. 61st St., (212) 223-1059,
through March 18.

 &HT;    Southerner's book gets Big Apple buzz
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It pays to have friends in high places. When Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
native Helen Ellis took a job as secretary to Chanel Inc. chairman
Alain Wertheimer in New York, she persuaded her boss to give her
Fridays off to work on her novel. Then, once ``Eating the Cheshire
Cat'' (Scribner, $23) was sold, Wertheimer asked Chanel president
Arie L. Kopelman to play publicist and send the book to editors at
10 fashion magazines. Anna Wintour of Vogue liked the story of
wacky Southern belles and their obsession with beauty so much, she
plugged it in a recent issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chanel has been great to work for,'' Ellis, 29, said in a
telephone interview while on a ``maternity leave'' to promote the
book. While some reviewers have referred to the novel as a social
satire, Ellis laughs and says that was never her intention. ``I
just wrote about the people I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, she has an interesting set of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Alabama, the novel is a twisted tale of three teen girls
and their domineering mothers, all overly concerned about status
and beauty. One mother is so bothered by her daughter's genetically
deformed fingers that she gets the teenager drunk, smashes them,
and takes her to the hospital to get them reset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to exaggerate much,'' Ellis said. ``One of my
friends does have that recessive trait, with her fingers bent, but
her mother never did that to her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for reports that the South has become less gothic and more
homogenized, Ellis says there are still a lot of Flannery O'Connor
characters around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a brunch when I was back home, and I heard stories
about murders, decapitations, poisoned dogs and other horrific
tales all while we were eating our French toast. So things haven't
changed that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis will sign her book at 7 tonight at Chapter 11 bookstore at
Peachtree Battle Shopping Center, 2345-A Peachtree Road N.E.,
404-237-7199.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From page to screen: There are a number of literary works
playing in theaters _ from ``Angela's Ashes'' to ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'' and ``The End of the Affair'' _ and more are on the way.
Book magazine reports that Bette Midler will produce ``Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' by Rebecca Wells and
``Neurotica'' by Sue Margolis; Matt Damon will star in Cormac
McCarthy's ``All the Pretty Horses''; James Cameron is at work on
Anne Rice's ``The Mummy''; and Barry Sonnenfeld is planning an
adaptation of Don DeLillo's ``White Noise.''

&HT;     BRADLEY ACCUSES GORE OF MISLEADING VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATHAM, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley, spying opportunity in
the fast-moving New Hampshire primary campaign, repeatedly accused
Vice President Al Gore Thursday of misrepresenting his detailed
policy proposals in the hard-fought contest for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator carried his complaint from an
outdoor rally in the state capital of Concord to communities along
the populous Atlantic seacoast, charging that Gore has relied upon
``misrepresentation and misleading statements'' in his effort to
stem Bradley's insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you trust a person to tell the truth if he was the
president of the United States if you don't care enough about the
people to tell the truth in the campaign?'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley echoed a complaint that he first voiced during a
televised debate with Gore on Wednesday night, as supporters urged
a more fiery challenge to the rebounding campaign of the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been running a negative campaign, misrepresenting,
misleading and so forth,'' Bradley told employees of the Timberland
Co. in Stratham. ``After absorbing months of misleading statements
and misrepresentations, last night I decided it was my turn to
throw a little elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments recalled his vaunted days as a professional
basketball player with the New York Knicks. He added: ``One week
before the election I thought it was important for (voters) to
consider the comments that have been made by Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign released a detailed list of alleged
misrepresentations that included claims that the vice president has
distorted Bradley's health care overhaul. The campaign issued a
list citing seven instances in the last debate when Gore misstated
Bradley's record on campaign finance reform, Chechnya, welfare
reform, nursing home standards, Medicaid, Medicare and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said that the accusations
target Gore alone and are not designed to paint the vice president
with questions about character and truthfulness that have dogged
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore left the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Thursday to
return to Washington to sit as president of the Senate during the
president's State of the Union address. The primary election is
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is yearning desperately for a fresh start
and more trust,'' Hauser said. ``Our opposition is Vice President
Gore. But Bill Bradley has talked about the importance about trust
in national leadership for 15 years _ long before anybody outside
of Arkansas had heard of Bill Clinton and long before anybody
outside of Tennessee had heard of Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, faced with latest public opinion polls showing him
starting to fall behind Gore, appealed directly for support. ``I
need you. I need your help. This is a very close primary election
next Tuesday. It could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/USA Today survey published Thursday that took into account
Gore's victory in Iowa on Monday night, showed Gore leading Bradley
53 percent to 44 percent. That represented a five percentage point
jump for Gore from Sunday. The survey had a margin of error of five
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   John Fitzgerald, a Timberland employee for seven years who lives
in Stratham, said he was pleased with the ``leadership skills''
that Bradley displayed during remarks to several hundred workers of
the footwear company that employs 5,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what I heard,'' Fitzgerald, 37, said. But he added
that the debate between Bradley and Gore left him disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both in attack mode,'' Fitzgerald said. ``That
displeased me. I wanted to hear more specifics about what they
would do as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Kinson, 41, of Bow, heard Bradley at the Concord rally.
``What he said is what I wanted to hear but I've got to do more
research. I'll make up my mind by Tuesday,'' said Kinson, who said
she was a registered independent who planned to vote in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Kinson said she was drawn to Gore, as well, because of his
experience in international affairs. ``One of the things that I
have a little bit of uncertainty about is that I feel that Gore has
more experience internationally so for me there's the experience
issue,'' she said.

   Bradley added what aides described as a more impromptu approach
to his campaign, diverting his two-bus motorcade for a quick
meet-and-greet stop at a Dunkin' Donuts and a subsequent stint as a
grocery bagger at a supermarket at Straw's Plaza in Newmarket. He
listened attentively and promised to help small family farmers
after Lisa Aragones, of Newmarket, intercepted him in the plaza
parking lot to ask for government to ``give us a little hand'' to
help small family farms withstand the pressures for commercial or
residential development.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also raided one of Gore's most reliable constituencies,
garnering the endorsement of two prominent environmentalists on the
banks of the Great Bay Estuary in Stratham.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Klein, who donated land for the Heron Point Sanctuary after
fishing Great Bay Estuary for 30 years, said some fishermen shared
Bradley's complaints about Gore. ``Some call it
`misrepresentation.''' Klein said. ``We fisherman call it just
plain old B.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bogen, of New Hampshire's Clean Water Action public
interest organization, said he was endorsing Bradley because the
18-year Senate veteran would fight to close loopholes in the Clean
Air Act that allow older fissile fuel power plants to continue to
emit greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, taking in the picturesque landscape with the
ice-and-snow covered bay as his backdrop, cited the winter majesty
of the setting. ``When you're here even in the deep part of the
winter, the stillness about this place with the wind in the trees,
that allows you to know that there is something very special. It's
a gift given to all people for all time.''

   ``Almost any kind of farm-raised meat is an inefficient use of
resources, but red meat is most wasteful of all,'' said Ryan.
``Have a veggie burrito next time.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's officials say that if customers wanted veggie
burritos, they would gladly serve them, but most people don't want
them. McDonald's already offers chicken, fish, salads, muffins, and
other non-beef alternatives, but ``the hamburger continues to be
the flagship sandwich,'' said McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker. ``We
have to be responsive to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's also faces criticism for its role in ``sprawl,''
those unattractive commercial strips on the outskirts of towns that
critics say drain business from existing downtowns, encourage
people to drive more, and eat up open space. In part because of
McDonald's reputation for shrewd real estate choices, its
restaurants can trigger new sprawl as other retailers try to locate
near the new McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of a huge blindspot with many of the largest
corporations,'' said Constance Beaumont of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation in Washington D.C. ``They don't really look
at the big picture, for example, the `auto-centricity' of their
operations . . . in the middle of nowhere accessible only by car.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, McDonald's doesn't have an anti-sprawl policy, but it
does respond to community demands, such as building a restaurant in
an existing Victorian house in downtown Freeport, Maine, and
building an earth-tone and teal restaurant to blend in with the
mountains in Sedona, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything without official approval,'' said
spokesman Riker, pointing out that it's up to communities to decide
what the ground rules are for commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, some public officials argue that McDonald's
actually helps preserve urban areas by providing entry-level jobs
that keep some people from moving away. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
even held a ``Golden Arches'' day last year, declaring that the 115
McDonald's in the city have ``been a great partner in revitalizing
Chicago's neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, environmental analysts are humbler today about passing
judgment on McDonald's than activists were when the company was
under attack a decade ago. Looking back, they believe that some
issues, such as the industry's links to cattle raised on cleared
rain forest, were overblown, and that assessing the true
environmental impact of any industry, especially one as complex as
fast food, is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, neither authors Leon and Ryan nor even
Environmental Defense's Roberts could finally answer the question
as to whether an environmentalist can eat at McDonald's with a
clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that McDonald's is moving ahead with
more plans to reduce its restaurants' environmental impact,
starting an experiment in California to compost food waste into
fertilizer and, by April, announcing timetables for a 10 percent
cut in energy use across the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do the right thing,'' said McDonald's Langert.

   NEW YORK _ ``Korean Ceramics From the Museum of Oriental
Ceramics, Osaka'' is not, as Yogi Berra might have said, a case of
deja vu all over again. More than 35 of the 48 pieces in this
serenely beautiful show were part of a larger exhibition of
ceramics from the same museum that traveled to Chicago, San
Francisco and the Met in 1992. But it scarcely matters. The
recidivists, like the first-timers, constitute the masterworks of
the Osaka museum's extensive Korean holdings. They account rather
fully for the innovations and high points of Korea's ceramic art,
which occurred with impressive regularity throughout the Koryo
(918-1392) and Choson (1392-1910) dynasties. In addition, seeing
them cloistered in the Met's intimate yet spare, white-on-white
Korean arts gallery, which opened in 1997, is an exceptional
viewing experience.
</P>
<P>
   The objects deserve it. Ceramics are generally considered
Korea's greatest artistic legacy, and have been long appreciated in
the West. But they tend to be overshadowed in most major American
museums by Japanese, and especially Chinese, art. This is certainly
the case at the Met, which seems to be taking advantage of all the
outside loans it can broker to broaden public understanding of
Korean art and contextualize its own holdings. After this
exhibition closes in June, the Gallery of Korean Arts, as it is
formally known, will feature a selection of ceramics on long-term
loan from the Osaka museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Met is right to persist. China, Korea and Japan are linked
geographically, historically and culturally, and while China
exerted the greater influence on its neighbors, the flow was far
from one-directional. Korea sometimes served as a cultural conduit
between the other two, channeling Buddhism from China to Japan in
the sixth century, for example. And where the prestigious,
competitive art of ceramics was concerned, there was a lot of give
and take. Emulating the Chinese, the Koreans equaled them, first on
Chinese terms and then on their own.
</P>
<P>
   During the Koryo period, Koreans took the pale, jade-colored
celadon glaze, which the Chinese began using in very rudimentary
form as early as the Shang dynasty around 1600 B.C., to new levels
of perfection. The Koreans' celadons, the most admired of which was
a kingfisher color, were exquisite in tone and translucence, a
result of a single layer of glaze. To this was often added
intricate inlaid decoration, an entirely Korean invention. By the
12th century, the Chinese considered Korean celadon ``first under
heaven'' and more valuable than gold.
</P>
<P>
   During the early Choson dynasty, the other side of the Korean
sensibility _ a penchant for roughness, asymmetry and the
unexpected that is most visible in Korean punchong ware of the 15th
and 16th centuries _ exerted a profound influence on Japanese
ceramics. This was especially the case in the 1500s after the
introduction of the tea ceremony; the small, rough utilitarian
bowls produced by both government and rural kilns in Korea suddenly
dovetailed with Japan's new ceremonial needs.
</P>
<P>
   It is sometimes hypothesized that the high demand for these
bowls prompted Emperor Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea in 1592 and
1597. In any event, he forcibly transplanted a great number of
Korean potters to Japan, which heralded the demise of punchong in
Korea, stimulated Japanese stoneware and kiln construction and
accelerated the development of porcelain. In 1639 the Japanese
established kilns in southeastern Korean villages. There the two
cultures effectively merged, with Korean potters producing wares
according to Japanese specifications for nearly 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   And a later twist of influence: In early 20th-century Japan,
renewed interest in 16th- and 17th-century Korean ceramics helped
ignite the Mingei (folk art) movement led by the critic and
philosopher Soetsu Yanagi. Yanagi's ideas, in turn, were embraced
and spread beyond Japan by influential 20th-century potters like
Shoji Hamada and Bernard Leach, which brings the influence, at
least indirectly, up to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The history of ceramics is as complex in its
cross-fertilizations as any in the history of art, especially in
eastern Asia, where conventions borrowed from bronze vessels and
lacquerware must be factored in. No New York museum makes this
clearer than the Met.
</P>
<P>
   On your way to the Korean show, peruse the long stretch of
vitrines at the top of the grand staircase. On display are clusters
of sometimes nearly identical blue-and-white and polychrome
porcelains that track the furious stylistic back-and-forth between
Asia and Europe that started heating up in the 17th century. (Until
this assortment was installed two years ago, the Met's ceramics
tended to maintain their national divisions.)
</P>
<P>
   You will also sharpen your appreciation of the show if you
approach it by taking the long way around the Great Hall's balcony.
You will be walking backward through the history of Chinese
ceramics, past the often highly decorated porcelains of the Ming
and Qing dynasties, which are roughly contemporary with the
Choson-dynasty Korean pieces in the show. There's a hothouse
complexity to many of these works that doesn't subside until you
reach the ceramics from the Five Dynasties period, the Tang dynasty
and the Song dynasties, whose integrated shapes and subdued
decorations crucially influenced 9th- and 10th-century Koryo
potters. Finally, just outside the entrance to the exhibition you
are reminded of the greatness and longevity of Chinese ceramics by
an imposing display of large Neolithic earthenware jars, one of the
signal points of origin of the world's ceramic arts.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to enter the Korean show with all this history
buzzing in your head, but it won't buzz for long. Rugged or
refined, the Korean objects aren't quite like anything you've seen
along the way. They cast a spell that is all their own, one that is
grounded in simplicity and directness and a continual sense of the
hand.

   Bill Bradley, declaring he'd ``had it,'' said today he'll stick
with the more confrontational stance he took against Al Gore in the
final debate before the New Hampshire presidential primary, Cox's
Ken Foskett reports. In the debate, Wednesday night, Bradley
accused Gore of campaign dishonesty and flip-flops on abortion.
Gore responded that Bradley was responsible for dragging the
campaign into the mud. Even afterward, in the press room, he
wouldn't back down: ``I think Al will have to go a long way to
demonstrate that what he said tonight was true and that he has not
lied in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   I'M MORE PRO-CHOICE; NO, I AM
</P>
<P>
   Feminist Gloria Steinem couldn't have it any better in the
Democratic presidential race. She says she's happy to see the two
major Democratic candidates debating over who is more pro-choice,
because, she says, ``It proves two facts: First, the huge majority
of Americans believe that the abortion decision should be made by a
woman and her doctor. Second, the Republican presidential
nomination is in the hands of anti-choice extremists who don't
represent the majority of even their own party.'' By the way,
Steinem's for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   TIPTOEING THROUGH THE ABORTION MINEFIELD
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and John McCain tiptoed around the abortion issue
today, with Bush saying that ``good people can disagree on that
issue'' and McCain calling questions about how his family would
handle an unplanned pregnancy ``painful.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN AMMO
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer was campaigning today on a different target _ what he
called the growing threat to Second Amendment rights facing Granite
Staters. He toured a small business in Manchester, N.H., that
produces custom leather firearms products and discussed the growing
threat to gun owners' Second Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   IT COULD BE OVER BY THEN, ANYWAY
</P>
<P>
   The South Caroling Democratic Party canceled its March 9
presidential primary today and instead will hold caucuses that day.
The state reported today that the GOP will still hold its primary
on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and Gary Bauer are the first presidential
candidates to commit to Lifetime cable channel's town hall meeting
to be taped Saturday in Bedford, N.H. CBS News correspondent Sharyl
Attkisson will host the one-hour original special, ``Who Wants to
Be Our President?'' All candidates of both parties have been
invited to address issues of importance to women. The program will
air Sunday at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   KEMP ON BOARD AS BUSH BACKER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush picked up the endorsement today from Jack Kemp,
the former housing secretary and congressman, and losing vice
presidential candidate in 1996. Most of the Republican
establishment already has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   HARD TO COME FROM BEHIND
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire are just two small states, really, but
the voters there love winners and front-runners have always been
tough to beat. A trailing candidate hasn't knocked off a
front-runner of either party since George McGovern lost in Iowa and
New Hampshire but defeated Edmund Muskie for the Democratic
nomination in 1972. Democrat Gary Hart in 1984 and Republican Pat
Buchanan in 1996 defeated front-runners in New Hampshire, but still
failed to win their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   POPULAR TARGET TO SHOOT AT
</P>
<P>
   During the GOP debate, all five candidates agreed that President
Clinton ``committed a felony in the Monica Lewinsky case and should
have been removed from office. Gary Bauer faulted Clinton for
discussing the crisis in Bosnia on the telephone with a member of
Congress ``while in the middle of a disgusting act.'' Alan Keyes
added that Congress ``lacked the guts'' to remove the president
from office.
</P>
<P>
   DOLE REMEMBERS HOW IT WAS
</P>
<P>
   A moderate GOP group is on the air with another ad slamming
Steve Forbes for attacks on front-runner George W. Bush. The
Republican Leadership Council cites a letter from Bob Dole
complaining that Forbes' attacks on him in 1996 helped Democrats
win that November. The TV spot quotes Dole: ``I emerged the
Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke, and a much easier
target for the negative Clinton-Gore fall campaign. I speak up now
only because it could be happening again.'' The TV ad closes with:
``Mr. Forbes: Stop the negative ads. Don't help the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   NO NEED TO PARDON HIS FRENCH
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes didn't miss a beat in New Hampshire when a couple of
questions came at him _ in French. Marcel Calfat of Radio-Canada
had read that Keyes could speak French and wanted to check it out.
So Calfat asked Keyes about NAFTA. In French, Keyes said he isn't
opposed to it in principle, but that it may need to be
re-evaluated. And he answered another in French about his message:
``The message is very simple. I represent moral priorities.'' How
well did Keyes do? ``A lot more articulate, in fact, than some
Canadian politicians,'' Calfat said _ in English.
</P>
<P>
   BRINGING IN THE BIG GUNS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is listing two prominent Democrats among his foreign
policy advisers: Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser
under President Carter, and James Woolsey, a CIA director under
President Clinton. Also on a list of advisers released Wednesday
were Republicans like Henry Kissinger, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Robert
McFarlane and Lawrence Eagleburger.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A HAWK, BE A STRONG HAWK
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day of campaigning in New Hampshire, Steve
Forbes appeared at a defense contractor in Nashua and called for
increased military spending. ``A cheap hawk is a dead hawk,'' he
said, adding: ``The U.S. is the only superpower. If our country
gets in trouble, then the rest of the world gets in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A CLOSE PLAY AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   Even in his home state, John McCain of Arizona is found to be in
a tight race with George W. Bush. A recent Arizona State University
poll determined that Republicans who voted in the past two
presidential primaries support McCain over Bush, 37 percent to 30
percent (4 percentage point margin of error). All the other
Republicans were in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Republicans weren't the largest group of voters
watching Wednesday's double-barreled debates. Nor were Democrats.
Independents are the big bloc in this state's politics, and they
were getting a rare chance to size up both presidential fields at
once. ``It's one-stop shopping,'' said Terry Blair of Manchester,
one of 274,000 registered independents. New Hampshire independents
outnumber the state's 265,000 Republicans and 194,000 Democrats,
and they can vote in either primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   POWER RUN UP THE MIDDLE
</P>
<P>
   Ending weeks of speculation, former Nebraska football coach Tom
Osborne, who led the Cornhuskers to three national championships,
announced today he's running for Congress. Osborne, a Republican,
said he started contemplating a campaign when Republican Rep. Bill
Barrett announced in October that he was retiring at the end of his
fifth term. ``I don't think this is an ego trip,'' Osborne said at
a news conference with his family. ``It would be a lot easier to go
fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF A NEW HAMPSHIRE KIND
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan buddy talk enlivened the second encounter in three
days between George W. Bush and a Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey,
campaigning for Bill Bradley. ``I'm stalking him,'' Kerrey cracked
after bumping into Bush on Wednesday at the Puritan Backroom
Restaurant and Lounge, a blue-plate diner
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, killer,'' said the Texas governor, shaking Kerrey's hand.
Kerrey complimented Bush on his Iowa State University address on
Monday, when they last met. The Puritan is a popular stop: Al Gore
and Gary Bauer ran into each other there several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   SORT OF LIKE THE DO DAH PARADE
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals were familiar _ a flat tax, universal
health care, getting rid of pork-barrel legislation, a ban on
late-term abortions. But the names at this debate didn't ring many
bells. If fact, probably no bells at all. The New Hampshire
Historical Society held a forum in Concord for candidates on the
ballot who weren't invited to Wednesday night's nationally
televised debates. Eight presidential hopefuls _ people like
Heather Harder of Crown Point, Ind., and Vermin Supreme (his legal
name) of Baltimore _ shelled out $1,000 apiece to get a brief time
in the spotlight.

 NEW YORK: the hand. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The objects include tall-necked bottles, bowls, ewers, jars of
different sizes and shapes, water-droppers and brush holders dating
from the early 12th to the early 19th centuries. They are arranged
in chronological order in vitrines that line three walls of the
gallery, regularly spaced, each isolated on a separate mat. This
means that one can take in an impressive seven-century span of
aesthetic development with a turn of the head and then proceed
object by delectable object.
</P>
<P>
   Along the first wall one encounters the pale, understated Koryo
celadons from the 12th century, their golden age. The few blades of
grass incised on a tall-necked ceremonial bottle called a kundika
are so subtle you almost miss them. (A nearly identical
10th-century kundika, in bronze, can be found in the vitrines along
the gallery's fourth wall, which present works from the Met's
collection.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a small celadon plaque whose sparse images of bamboo
and waterbirds seem to have been painted with the tiniest of
brushes. The motifs exemplify the inlay technique, invented in the
early 12th century, in which delicately incised motifs were
infilled with a glazelike paste of black or white, biscuit-fired
and then fired a second time with the celadon glaze. Its relatively
more boisterous neighbor is a rare example of reverse inlay, the
result being a delicately inflected white background against which
a little celadon boy climbs a large celadon vine, like Jack on his
beanstalk.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this wall, a display of five small bowls
illustrates the level of refinement that Korean potters, unburdened
by the large production quotas of their Chinese counterparts,
frequently achieved. In the case of one celadon bowl, this allowed
for the superfine veins on the leaves of a raised floral design;
the mold that formed this design had to last a much shorter time.
In another bowl, the potter returned to the inlaid image of a white
waterbird to incise individual feathers on its wings.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline of the increasingly corrupt Koryo dynasty, its
celadon declined as well, but its coarseness would eventually yield
the wonderful, strikingly modern looseness of punchong ware, the
highest of the high points of the Choson dynasty, which takes up
most of the show's second wall.
</P>
<P>
   Here, celadon green gives way to the light gray punchong glaze.
The punchong potters continued to inlay, but into stamped, almost
textilelike fields of pattern and irregularly repeated motifs
instead of the refined incisions of the Koryo period. They favored
underglaze painting, usually with iron oxide, and, sometimes, a
subtly angular drawing style, as evidenced by the curling vines and
sleeping duck on a tall Choson jar at the center of this wall. The
punchong potters used white slip, or clay dissolved in water,
liberally, brushing it on and then simply incising schematic plant
motifs into it with a boldness that brings to mind Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   They also produced asymmetrical hand-built pieces like the two
extraordinary ritual vessels here. One of these, a boxy volume in a
brown clay whose stepped legs echo Chinese bronzes, is decorated
with a roughly incised labyrinth of lines that has been inlaid with
white and then spattered with thick white slip. The timeless
quality that often makes ceramic objects so appealing abounds in
this exhibition; it is unusually present in this object, which
could be Neolithic, medieval or modern.
</P>
<P>
   To distance themselves from the Koryo dynasty, the Choson
emperors and elite turned to Neo-Confucianism, which may account
for the austere, virtually undecorated surfaces of three stunning
all-white porcelain jars that complete the show's middle wall. One
is round, almost bubblelike, with a glaze of golden cream. Another,
made by joining two thrown bowls together, is tall, slightly
elliptical and pure white. And between them is a shorter
eight-sided jar, cherished for its signs of use and aging; around
its foot, the jar's warmly yellow clay has worn through the glaze,
each patch serendipitously accented by an indolently curving crack.
</P>
<P>
   Along the show's final wall, things turn subtly diverse,
reflecting the loosening of Neo-Confucian strictures in the 17th
and 18th centuries. This resulted in a broader range of shapes, a
freer use of both Chinese and Korean decorative motifs and the
increased use of cobalt-blue underglaze painting as well as
occasional attempts at the more fugitive copper-red underglaze. In
one round jar, a quickly drawn heron and pine are vividly red. But
more engaging is a taller jar where copper-red depictions of lotus
blossoms faded to a gorgeous range of pale browns and lavenders.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing national motif here is a Korean tiger, rendered
in iron-oxide with irresistible calligraphic flair on a
rough-surfaced jar at the center of the gallery. Wide-eyed, almost
comic, he prances forth from a swirl of fungal clouds.
</P>
<P>
   A turn back toward a Chinese aesthetic is evident along the
show's last wall, where nearly every piece uses the cobalt-blue
underglaze painting. But even so, most retain a distinctive Korean
sturdiness and plainness that is quite unlike the blue-and-white
Chinese porcelains on the balcony. The blue decorations are always
discreet, always subsidiary to the expanses of luminous white, and
they never interfere with the assertive shapes of the jars. In
addition, the pieces continue to be animated by slight
irregularities of profile, lip and surface.
</P>
<P>
   Having met the Chinese standards of perfection with their Koryo
celadons, Korean potters of the Choson period defined a new, more
natural and ineffably human kind of perfection, one that is
instantly recognizable today.
</P>

THE GREENING OF MCDONALD'S

 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   City councils banned its styrofoam burger boxes, calling them
``McToxics'' that pollute the environment. Martha's Vineyard and
other places banned the Golden Arches altogether, blaming
McDonald's for everything from litter to traffic congestion. And
there were dark rumors, never substantiated, that tropical rain
forest land was being cleared for its cattle to graze.
</P>
<P>
   To many Americans, McDonald's once symbolized consumer society
run amok. The company was probably no more wasteful than its
rivals, but, as the world's biggest fast food chain, it paid for
the sins of an industry where food was slapped in elaborate
wrappers that were thrown away by hungry customers minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But, in one of the great Houdini acts of modern conservation,
McDonald's has gone from villain to role model in the past 10
years. Turning to professional environmentalists for advice,
McDonald's has reduced its waste by more than 30 percent since
1990, become one of the country's leading buyers of recycled
materials, and cut its energy use to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has been a leader on the environment, not only
for the industry, but also for corporate America as a whole,'' said
Fred Krupp, director of Environmental Defense, a nonprofit group
formerly known as the Environmental Defense Fund, which helped
McDonald's reduce waste. ``They've made a long series of
commitments and they've hit every target.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, environmental analysts are asking whether fast food could
be considered ``environmentally sound'' after all, a notion that is
anathema to many activists. Even if McDonald's and other chains
produced no waste at all, they would still face criticism about
their menus' heavy reliance on beef, one of the most
environmentally damaging foods to produce due to cattles' food
needs and waste.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's ``may have gotten rid of styrofoam cups, but they
haven't gotten rid of styrofoam buildings,'' joked Ronald Lee
Fleming of Cambridge, Mass.'s Townscape Institute, which works with
communities to pressure fast food chains to build restaurants that
blend in with the architecture of surrounding buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But Environmental Defense's ongoing work with McDonald's
reflects the reality that Americans flock to fast food whether or
not their dinner is healthy for the planet (or their arteries).
Burger King sales continued to rise even when activists called for
a boycott of the restaurant in 1988 over the company's alleged
purchase of beef raised on cleared Costa Rican rain forest land.
Indeed, fast food industry sales have risen from one quarter to one
half of all restaurant sales since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Americans spend one-seventh of their food budget on Big
Macs and other fast food, making it the second most important
source of nutrition next to home cooking. And, with 12,500
McDonald's restaurants in the United States, most Americans live
within three miles of one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ironically, the sheer omnipresence of fast food could
actually prove to be an environmental advantage. When McDonald's
insisted on cardboard boxes made of recycled paper, the order was
so large that box companies adopted McDonald's standard as the one
for all of its customers, both in and outside the restaurant
business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the efficiency of fast food restaurants make them less
wasteful than many conventional restaurants, according to Warren
Leon, author of the book ``The Consumer's Guide to Effective
Environmental Choices.'' If McDonald's succeeds in a plan it has to
turn food waste into fertilizer, eating at McDonald's could
generate less waste than eating at many homes.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackie Roberts, one of the Environmental Defense scientists
who has worked with McDonald's since 1990, continues to strive for
greener fast food rather than cursing its shortcomings. Nobody's
perfect, she said, and the point is to try to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like there is anything in my life that I can do
that is guilt-free. Even if I go for a hike . . . I drive a long
way to get there,'' said Roberts, who helps businesses reduce waste
at Environmental Defense's Alliance for Environmental Innovation in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The greening of McDonald's has been perceptible only to the most
observant customers. The change most people noticed was the 1990
disappearance of the controversial polystyrene ``clamshell'' box
that once held the Big Mac _ since replaced by a special
lightweight paper _ but there has been a steady parade of changes
in the dining area since then as well. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Napkins are 1 inch shorter, cutting down on needed paper by 21
percent, and they are now made from recycled newspapers, giving
them a slightly off-white color. Most food is wrapped in paper now,
too, instead of plastic or cardboard, cutting down on materials
needed to make wrappers by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The company has cut back on plastic use as well, making the
straws shorter, the dining trays lighter, and the garbage bags
thinner. Much of the playground equipment is now made of recycled
plastic as well, part of a corporation-wide $3 billion purchase of
recycled materials since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   --McDonald's periodically uses the liners of its food trays to
tell customers about its environmental progress, such as its
commitment to protecting tropical rain forests through financial
support of the group Conservation International.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, McDonald's has avoided asking for any
sacrifices from consumers, largely because it hasn't worked in the
past. When the company introduced bins for recyclable materials,
they found the paper was too contaminated with grease to recycle,
or a bagful of otherwise perfectly recyclable polystyrene boxes had
Coke spilled on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle to recycle in our stores,'' admitted Robert
Langert, McDonald's director of environmental affairs. ``Even if
you've got 99 percent of the people doing a good job, you've still
got a problem with that one percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, scientists from Environmental Defense discovered
early on that the real opportunities were behind the food counter _
in reducing the cardboard boxes, egg shells, coffee grounds, and
other materials that, collectively, account for 80 percent of
McDonald's waste.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a day in a Falls Church, Virginia, McDonald's,
Roberts of Environmental Defense realized that the path to
improvement lay in making waste reduction part of the highly
regimented system that allows McDonald's to feed 40 million people
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the choreography was just amazing,'' she recalled.
``And I was thinking, `anything we do has to fit into this system.'
''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, waste reduction and recycling fit beautifully
into the McDonald's system, in part because it saved money.
Recycling cardboard immediately cut restaurants' waste disposal
bills by 30 percent, while the company saves $5 million a year by
requiring lighter and smaller packaging and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond money, the unusual partnership between McDonald's and
Environmental Defense worked because the two sides trusted each
other. McDonald's officials knew they needed outside help to
restore their battered image, while Environmental Defense braved
criticism from fellow environmentalists for a chance to work inside
a corporate nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, other companies are following McDonald's lead on
environmental issues. Burger King, the number two hamburger chain,
copied McDonald's switch to paper hamburger wrappers in 1991, while
Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken recently shrunk
their napkins as McDonald's did earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, McDonald's has done far less on more complex
environmental issues. Their burger-dominated menu, for instance,
would require a change in their business strategy and the
cooperation of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the bigger, more harmful impacts associated with food
aren't from the packaging of food, but from the production of food
itself,'' said John C. Ryan, author of the book ``Stuff: The Secret
Life of Everyday Things,'' which examines the environmental impact
of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan estimates that a quarter-pound hamburger requires 616
gallons of water to produce, from the water for corn and other
crops fed to the cattle, to the water pollution caused by the
animals' feces. Analyst Leon calculates that the production of beef
does 15 times more damage per serving than poultry because cattle
grazing tends to denude and erode the land.

 &HT;    Bush seeking McCain-Gore linkage
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. - Gov. George W. Bush, honing in on the Republican
he has to beat here next Tuesday and the Democrat he might face in
November, worked to link John McCain and Al Gore to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, running behind McCain in polls here, on Thursday accused
the Arizona senator of playing ``me-tooism'' with Clinton on taxes
and education. And Bush said Vice President Gore can't seem to
figure out if he is on Clinton's team or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can figure out how to handle his relationship
with the president,'' Bush said after a breakfast speech to the
Nashua Chamber of Commerce. ``He distances. He doesn't distance. He
distances. He doesn't distance. I think that is going to send
confusing signals to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who picked up the endorsement of 1996 GOP vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp here on Thursday, campaigned in
Nashua, Jaffrey and Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remains confident he can score a come-from-behind win over
McCain here on Tuesday. Current polls show McCain with a slight
edge over Bush, who won the Iowa caucuses on Monday. McCain did not
compete there. Publisher Steve Forbes, the Iowa runner-up, is in
third place in the New Hampshire GOP polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Thursday attacks on McCain were sparked by the Arizona
senator's comments on taxes during a Wednesday night debate.
McCain, like Clinton, backs a smaller tax-cut plan than the
five-year, $483-billion package pushed by Bush. McCain prefers a
smaller plan in order to reserve more money for debt reduction, as
does Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe President Clinton's looks too much like mine,''
McCain said during the debate when the similarity was noted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush immediately seized on the comment on the campaign trail,
calling it ``one of the telling points of the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to nominate somebody who will be able to debate
the Democrat nominee on key issues, not mimic them,'' Bush said
here.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp joined in by charging that McCain ``is obsessed with debt
reduction and seems to be defending . . . the Clinton tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on board his campaign bus in Portsmouth, retaliated in
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps spinning like Bill Clinton,'' he said of Bush.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's party was fined and
placed under criminal investigation Thursday after the state
comptroller issued a blistering account of what he called
violations of campaign finance laws during the 1999 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, did not implicate Barak
personally but held him accountable for what he described as a
``trampling of the law'' by his One Israel party. Barak's
associates systematically circumvented strict campaign finance
restrictions by channeling illegal contributions into a host of
nonprofit organizations, the comptroller said. The party was fined
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a reserve general who ran his political campaign like a
military operation, said that he welcomed the investigation as a
spur to clarify an unclear campaign funding law. He said he had
advised his associates to operate legally and knew nothing about
the operations of the nonprofit associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not deal with raising money,'' he said. ``I was not
updated on the details and I was not involved specifically in any
of the activities described in the comptroller's report.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a former Supreme Court judge, said he had found no
evidence to contradict Barak's assertion that he was ignorant of
the ``particulars.'' But the comptroller charged that the
``extensive scope'' of the illegal activity should have ``lit a red
warning light for the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming not to know is simply untenable,'' he said in a radio
interview, adding that it was Barak's responsibility to supervise
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One Israel campaign's overall budget was about $22 million; the
allegations involve the funneling of about $1.2 million in illegal
money to the nonprofit organizations, which then directly or
indirectly supported the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising affair has erupted at a delicate moment for
Barak. He is encountering frustrations in his ambitious peacemaking
initiatives with the Palestinians and the Syrians, and he faces an
impatient public waiting for him to make good on his campaign
promises of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of illegal behavior on his behalf clash with the
image that Barak presents as a straightforward, old-fashioned man
of his word. And it makes it harder for him to declare himself
above the political fray that has dragged so many into scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police are already juggling the criminal probes of
several political leaders. Among those under investigation are
President Ezer Weizman, who has been accused of improperly
accepting substantial cash gifts from a French executive, and
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on allegations of bribery
and theft of gifts to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another investigation placed on the shoulder of
the police,'' Police Chief Yehuda Wilk said, sighing. ``And in the
slew of investigations, it becomes a a logistical issue who will
investigate what, when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller report was released Thursday as a rare snowfall
began blanketing the turbulent Holy City in an otherworldly quiet.
Over the airwaves, the political storm broke the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud Party, blasted the
prime minister for breaking his election promise to be trustworthy.
``I hereby declare that the prime minister knew about the existence
of the apparatus and the system'' used to obtain illegal donations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Benizri, a Cabinet minister from the Shas political
party, whose former leader Aryeh Deri, is appealing his conviction
on corruption charges, said, ``After this, the Deri appeal should
go to small claims court!''
</P>
<P>
   One Israel is a reconstituted version of Barak's Labor Party,
which is heavily indebted and will face the financial penalty with
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller also found similar violations on a far lesser
scale by four other parties, and criminal investigations into their
activities were also opened. The parties were: the opposition Likud
Party, the Center Party, the United Torah Judaism faction, and the
Russian immigrants' Yisrael Beteinu.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after the report was issued, Barak noted that other
parties were criticized, too. And he suggested that the problems
lay in the campaign financing laws themselves, and with the murky
way they have been interpreted since the country switched in 1996
to a direct election system for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself am convinced that there is a need for corrections to
the campaign finance law in order to make the picture clear so that
no list, candidate or public body of any kind will find itself
uncertain as to how to act,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israel's strict campaign financing law, political parties
receive state funding for their campaigns based on the number of
Parliament seats they eventually win. Individual citizens are
limited to contributions of about $400 each and corporations and
foreigners cannot give at all.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion arose after the 1996 election because the system
changed but the law didn't. Starting in 1996, the parties'
candidates for Parliament and for prime minister were elected on
separate ballots. The law made no specific mention of restrictions
on the candidates themselves, just their parties.
</P>
<P>
   The state comptroller then, Miriam Ben-Porat, felt that the law
could be applied to the candidates by inference. And she fined the
Likud Party some $600,000 for improperly using nonprofit
organizations in Netanyahu's successful 1996 campaign. One
organization stood out: ``Netanyahu is Good for the Jews,'' which
was backed by Joseph Gutnick, a wealthy Australian who belongs to
the ultra-Orthodox Chabad, or Lubavitch, movement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's Labor Party urged the attorney general, Elyakim
Rubinstein, to prosecute. But Rubinstein said the law as written
applied only to parties and not to candidates, and could not be
``widened by inference.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's critics say that his advisers deliberately took
advantage of this loophole, as decreed by the attorney general in a
private letter, to plot campaign fund-raising strategy based on the
``Gutnick precedent.'' They created nonprofit organizations to
assist the campaign and enlisted existing ones, as described by the
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Barak said he would petition the Supreme Court
to clarify if the law indeed applied to candidates as well as to
parties.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said his investigation would go beyond the campaign
law violations to look at alleged ``violations of the penal law,
false registration, fraud and breach of trust in a corporation, and
acceptance of an object by fraudulent means.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's campaign relied on costly U.S. consultants from the
Democratic Party who had worked for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, the comptroller singled out the activities of Tal
Zilberstein, Barak's campaign manager, and Yitzhak Herzog, Barak's
cabinet secretary, an attorney and son of the late Chaim Herzog, a
former Israeli president and ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report, for instance, said that Herzog had funneled
donations into the campaign from the estate of a dovish Swiss Jew,
Octave Botner.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog had served as a trustee for Botner's charitable accounts
in Israel before his death, the comptroller said. Afterwards,
Herzog handled the estate's Camilla Fund, which was intended to
ease poverty and promote education in Israel, the comptroller said.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, who told the comptroller he had personal discretion to
disburse the money according to general instructions, directed
about $105,000 from the Camilla Fund to the campaign, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the Camilla fund set up several nonprofit
organizations, including one nominally for the ``promotion of taxi
drivers in Israel,'' which provided posters and put on rallies for
the campaign, the report said.

THE FINAL PIECES OF A MAESTRO'S LEGACY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would somehow have been both fitting and a bit grotesque if
Robert Shaw, the great choral conductor who died just over a year
ago at 82, had left behind a recording of a Requiem, to be released
after his own death. And he missed doing so only by weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His last recording, made in late 1998 and recently released by
Telarc, was of Dvorak's Stabat Mater, an expansive setting of a
traditional text of the Roman Catholic Church, reflecting on the
sorrows of the Virgin Mary at the cross of Jesus. ``When my body
shall die,'' runs the last verse, ``Grant that my soul be given/The
glory of Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was also to have recorded Brahms' ``German Requiem'' in a
new English adaptation of his own last February with the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir. The project was carried through by Craig Jessop,
a Shaw disciple and then the choir's associate director, now its
director. Telarc has just released that recording as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, RCA Victor has reissued Shaw's 1960 recording of
Bach's Mass in B minor with the Robert Shaw Chorale, a reminder of
the extraordinary scope of the maestro's career.
</P>
<P>
   It was Shaw's good fortune, and his admirers', that he was able
to remain not only active, apart from a series of late
cancellations, but also mentally engaged until his death. The
Dvorak, in fact, was a work new to his vast repertory. He also
retained his quick, robust and often self-deprecating humor to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   When, in a National Public Radio interview included with the
recording (Telarc 2CD-80506; two CDs), Martin Goldsmith asks why
Shaw didn't come to the Stabat Mater sooner in a career of more
than 60 years, the conductor shoots back: ``I can think of a couple
of reasons, Martin. The first is ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed a rewarding piece, as new listeners will come to
realize in some particularly lilting inner movements. The opening
movements, dark, halting and spare, may yield up their restrained
beauties only with added familiarity and a thorough immersion in
the sound world.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is not so rarely heard as Shaw suggests in the
interview. (If you want a real rarity, try the Dvorak Requiem.) It
has been especially well and idiomatically tended to both in
concert and on records by native Czechs. But for sheer tonal beauty
and refinement, few versions rival this Shaw account, with the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, in typically polished and
wide-ranging sound from Telarc.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal soloists _ Christine Goerke, Marietta Simpson,
Stanford Olsen and Nathan Berg _ are generally fine, and the
occasional operatic touch tending toward Verdi in no way
contradicts the nature of the writing.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Woods, the president of Telarc and the producer of this
recording, reports in the booklet that the sessions, on Oct. 31 and
Nov. 1, 1998, were extraordinarily mellow and free of problems. He
prints Shaw's own review of the sessions, addressed to the chorus
in doggerel matching the cadence and rhyming pattern of the Stabat
Mater poem: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Stabat pater fortunatus
</P>
<P>
   Happy as a hippopatus
</P>
<P>
   Up to here in muck and mire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hearing sounds beyond believing,
</P>
<P>
   Angel voices Halloweaving,
</P>
<P>
   Quel orchestrand WHAT A CHOIR!(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herewith an amen.
</P>
<P>
   The other works represented in this batch of recordings were
Shaw perennials. He conducted the B minor Mass in his last New York
appearance, in April 1998, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chamber Chorus at Carnegie Hall. He
conducted the ``German Requiem'' (in German) with essentially the
same forces in April 1997 at Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   The Englishing of the ``German Requiem'' may strike some as
wrongheaded. To a listener who first learned the work in English,
from a 1963 Musical Heritage Society recording by Edward Gilday and
the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, it seems anything but.
Indeed, to these ears, certain of the English lines complement the
musical contours with a poetic force and eloquence at least equal
to the German.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For one example, ``How lovely is thy dwelling place, O Lord of
Hosts,'' the first line of the slowly, softly soaring fourth
movement, rings as true as ``Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen,
Herr Zebaoth,'' and is happily unchanged from the earlier
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Much is similar in the two translations, in fact, for both the
Shaw adaptation and the unattributed Boston text (virtually
identical to R.H. Benzon's translation for the music publisher C.F.
Peters, as printed in the Eulenburg score) draw heavily on the King
James Version of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time in the past 50 years that I have considered making
an English version of the `German Requiem,' I have concluded that a
`translation' would not work grammatically, aesthetically,
quasi-liturgically, philosophically or `spiritually,''' Shaw
writes, explaining his reliance on King James. ``A version in
English would need roots in language as deep as those in music, and
as exalted in beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessop leads the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Utah Symphony
in a heartfelt rendition of the work (Telarc CD-80501; CD). (
Jessop's father, Telarc's notes reveal, died two days after Shaw,
less than three weeks before the sessions.)
</P>
<P>
   The choir, though 320 strong, almost everywhere avoids
woolliness and conveys the text clearly, with the usual help from
Telarc. Janice Chandler and Nathan Gunn are admirable in the vocal
solos.
</P>
<P>
   The Brahms project is only one indication that Shaw, a son of a
preacher, with a strong evangelical streak of his own, never
relented in his strenuous commitment to the texts as well as the
music of great spiritual works. Another proof was a Shaw
performance of Bach's ``St. Matthew Passion'' in 1996 at Carnegie
Hall, again in Shaw's own English translation. He never recorded
that work, whether in German or English: perhaps the saddest gap in
his discography.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded the B minor Mass several times (three, he says in
the NPR interview, sounding unsure himself). The resurrection of
the 1960 version (RCA Victor 09026-63529-2; CD) will be of interest
primarily to specialists. For its time, Shaw's account is often
lean and lithe. As a performance note from the original release
indicates, he was alert to the nascent early-music movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Bach's custom,'' he writes, ``we have assigned to
soloists, as concertists, those sections of the choral movements
wherein instruments do not double voices, or where a choral sound
might obscure instrumental detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was wading into deep waters here. But whether honoring
Bach's custom, a notion that became increasing problematic in later
decades, or his own instinct, Shaw carried this practice right down
to that New York performance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There are wonderfully lucid moments here, as when the tenors
shift into cantus firmus mode in the ``Confiteor,'' a piquant
compositional gesture brought to the fore with superb choral
balance and subtle emphasis. Still, a certain heaviness persists in
tempos and rhetorical touches. Some movements end with outsize
ritardandos; the Credo slows to a virtual halt at Jesus' burial.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the work of the Robert Shaw Chorale and
Orchestra is mostly excellent. The vocal solos _ by Saramae Endich,
Adele Addison, Florence Kopleff, Mallory Walker and Ara Berberian _
are more uneven. Although it is wonderful to have this document
back, nonspecialist listeners will almost certainly prefer the
latest Shaw B minor, on Telarc: livelier, by current standards, and
more cleanly reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with this wealth of Masses more or less sorted out, there
is nothing left for any of us, specialists and general listeners
alike, to do but dream of the ``St. Matthew Passion'' that got
away.

GRANDMOTHERS

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Far from helping settle the case, the
dramatic reunion of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez with his
grandmothers triggered a new round of angry rhetoric and charges
Thursday, as well as an apparent rift between two key U.S. players
in the on-going saga.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic about-face, the nun who hosted the long-sought
reunion Wednesday at her Miami Beach home said that while she went
into the meeting feeling Elian should go back to Cuba, the fear and
apparent manipulation she saw coming from the Cuban government
convinced her to change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I experienced yesterday about tangible fear gives me real
concern about the future of the child,'' Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin
said on NBC's Today program. ``When I look at the real fear I say
he would grow to greater freedom of manhood here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her opinions on the case are important because she is a personal
friend of U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, a Miami native who has
ultimate authority over the boy and who supports returning him to
Cuba. O'Laughlin, president of Miami's Barry University, is a
widely respected advocate for children and immigrants known in
South Florida for her compassion.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the U.S. Justice Department filed a
300-page motion to dismiss a lawsuit by Elian's Miami relatives
aimed at keeping the boy here, and as Elian's grandmothers and
Miami family lobbied Congress over bills that would make him a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuba's government reacted angrily to the family
reunion, calling the treatment of the grandmothers ``inhumane and
despotic,'' and saying they were subjected to ``deceits, lies,
tricks, betrayals and humiliations.''
</P>
<P>
   Also emerging Thursday were comments from Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who said the boy's Miami relatives assured him in
private telephone conversations that they would bring Elian back to
Cuba, only to change their stories in television interviews because
of pressure from Miami's Cuban exile community.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family also pressured the boy, interrupted his
telephone conversations with his Cuban family and offered millions
to the Cuban relatives if they would move to the United States,
Gonzalez told a U.S. immigration official in an interview included
in the federal court papers filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we call and Elian starts saying, 'Grandma I want to be
with you' or 'Daddy I want to go with you,' they immediately make
him cry, or give him a candy or start tapping on the lines saying
that the lines are getting bad and hang up,'' Gonzalez said. ``In
the background, you can hear them telling Elian to say he wants to
stay in the United States. It's abusive what they are doing to
Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   In other conversations, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales,
offered Juan Gonzalez $2 million and Elian $4 million if the Cuban
family would move to the United States, saying the money would come
from an unidentified church, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez denied the charges in an interview on CNN
International Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did that,'' he said, when asked about promising to
take the boy to Cuba. As for offering Juan Gonzalez money, he said
``we never offered anything to him ... If I had $2 million, I
wouldn't be sitting here.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments were yet more evidence that the two-month-old
saga is likely to drag on for weeks or months, and that the child
is being tugged from both sides in a politicized family feud with
no easy solutions.
</P>
<P>
   As for Elian, he stayed home Thursday from the private school he
is attending in Miami's Little Havana. In an interview with a
Spanish-language radio program Wednesday, the boy said he was going
to be made a U.S. citizen Thursday, an apparent reference to
activities underway in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those bills, however, seemed to be losing steam Thursday, even
as both sides of the family lobbied hard for Congressional support.
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he would refer the
matter to committee instead of allowing it to come up for an
immediate floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   That means any action will likely be delayed for weeks. Hastert
said there was a growing sense on Capitol Hill that the matter
should be resolved in the courts before Congress considers it.
</P>
<P>
   But action in court will be several weeks away. U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler met with attorneys in the case briefly
Thursday and gave the Miami family until Feb. 24 to respond to the
government's motion to dismiss the case. A full hearing on the
motions will not come until after March 6, Hoeveler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the flurry of events, Sister O'Laughlin's dramatic about-face
seemed one of the most intriguing, mainly because she was chosen by
Reno and other federal officials to host the meeting because of her
reputation for integrity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she was struck during the reunion by the
mistrust and fear on both sides, and had to show the separate
branches of the family around her mansion _ donated by a
philanthropist _ to assure them there were no trap doors and
unlocked entrances where kidnappers might be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   But while Elian's Miami relatives quickly relaxed, the
grandmothers remained fearful even as they left after the two-hour
meeting, O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are people with political agendas that take
the child as a pawn, and perhaps the grandmothers also,'' she said,
a clear slap at the Cuban government. ``I think I am a wiser woman
today, and I understand how blessed we are to understand what it is
to be free and not full of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what impact O'Laughlin's comments would have on
her friend Reno, or on the controversy swirling around the boy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she would tell Reno ``the truth as I experienced
it. I don't represent pro-Castro, anti-Castro or INS. I only have
the sense that I felt when I blessed that boy when he was leaving
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Reno appeared critical of the Miami relatives in
comments at her weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the family parading the boy around before television
cameras, Reno said that while she wouldn't comment on Elian's case,
she believes that if something similar happened to her own
great-nephew, who is about Elian's age, ``I sure wouldn't like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, the National Council of Churches, a
Protestant group that arranged the grandmothers' trip to the United
States and has lobbied to return Elian to Cuba, announced it was
withdrawing from the case and turning it over to the Cuban
Interests Section in Washington. The group, which has drawn heavy
fire from Cuban exiles in Miami, feels the case has become too
entangled in politics, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, meanwhile, told interviewers in Washington
they were disturbed by how much their grandson has changed since
they last saw him two months ago, just prior to the ill-fated boat
ride from Cuba on which his mother drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has changed completely,'' said Mariela Quintana, Elian's
paternal grandmother. ``I have to save the child as soon as
possible, to bring him back to his father and his family in Cuba.''

is attending in Miami's Little Havana. In an interview with a
Spanish-language radio program Wednesday, the boy said he was going
to be made a U.S. citizen Thursday, an apparent reference to
activities underway in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those bills, however, seemed to be losing steam Thursday, even
as both sides of the family lobbied hard for Congressional support.
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he would refer the
matter to committee instead of allowing it to come up for an
immediate floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   That means any action will likely be delayed for weeks. Hastert
said there was a growing sense on Capitol Hill that the matter
should be resolved in the courts before Congress considers it.
</P>
<P>
   But action in court will be several weeks away. U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler met with attorneys in the case briefly
Thursday and gave the Miami family until Feb. 24 to respond to the
government's motion to dismiss the case. A full hearing on the
motions will not come until after March 6, Hoeveler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the flurry of events, Sister O'Laughlin's dramatic about-face
seemed one of the most intriguing, mainly because she was chosen by
Reno and other federal officials to host the meeting because of her
reputation for integrity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she was struck during the reunion by the
mistrust and fear on both sides, and had to show the separate
branches of the family around her mansion _ donated by a
philanthropist _ to assure them there were no trap doors and
unlocked entrances where kidnappers might be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   But while Elian's Miami relatives quickly relaxed, the
grandmothers remained fearful even as they left after the two-hour
meeting, O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are people with political agendas that take
the child as a pawn, and perhaps the grandmothers also,'' she said,
a clear slap at the Cuban government. ``I think I am a wiser woman
today, and I understand how blessed we are to understand what it is
to be free and not full of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what impact O'Laughlin's comments would have on
her friend Reno, or on the controversy swirling around the boy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she would tell Reno ``the truth as I experienced
it. I don't represent pro-Castro, anti-Castro or INS. I only have
the sense that I felt when I blessed that boy when he was leaving
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Reno appeared critical of the Miami relatives in
comments at her weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the family parading the boy around before television
cameras, Reno said that while she wouldn't comment on Elian's case,
she believes that if something similar happened to her own
great-nephew, who is about Elian's age, ``I sure wouldn't like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, the National Council of Churches, a
Protestant group that arranged the grandmothers' trip to the United
States and has lobbied to return Elian to Cuba, announced it was
withdrawing from the case and turning it over to the Cuban
Interests Section in Washington. The group, which has drawn heavy
fire from Cuban exiles in Miami, feels the case has become too
entangled in politics, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, meanwhile, told interviewers in Washington
they were disturbed by how much their grandson has changed since
they last saw him two months ago, just prior to the ill-fated boat
ride from Cuba on which his mother drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has changed completely,'' said Mariela Quintana, Elian's
paternal grandmother. ``I have to save the child as soon as
possible, to bring him back to his father and his family in Cuba.''

GIVING UP AN OLD GRUDGE FOR GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Feb. 3.)  
(lh) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I heard about this New Year's party where people sat around and
gave up their grudges. They had a whole night of it, naming names,
telling stories, recounting big and little offenses against them.
</P>
<P>
   The part where they shared the little details sounded almost
like therapy. There's something deliciously righteous about
explaining an old grudge. You can relish the torment of a certain
slight, a major snub and show your wounds. You can be dramatic and
justifiably outraged, which is one reason we hold onto our grudges.
Plus you can always get sympathy that you were right and the other
was wrong, and besides, you are too wonderful a person to ever be
treated that way.
</P>
<P>
   At a Grudge Night, the target of the grudge would not be there
to defend herself or himself. In most cases the object of your
resentment probably wouldn't know what you're talking about anyhow
because grudges seldom break into open conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom are they even mutual. You're walking around with this big
bag of malevolent thoughts that gets heavier as the years go by,
and the other person is acting as if he or she doesn't know and
doesn't care. This only deepens your end of the grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the grudge-holder doesn't even remember the original
reason for it, which is probably why it's a good idea to review
your grudges now and again.
</P>
<P>
   But the purpose of the Grudge Night, as I understand it, is not
to keep the grudge alive but to bid it goodbye. Push it out the
door to shiver alone on the back steps. The people at the grudge
party said they felt so much better after they promised to stop
grudging. I wondered if that meant you had to then go beyond, like
inviting the begrudged out for coffee or sending them a Valentine's
note saying all is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, they said. You don't have to end up liking the person.
You might relax enough to make eye contact after all these years,
but they still did you wrong. In fact, they could again, so it
might be prudent to not let your guard down all the way.
</P>
<P>
   But why give someone else so much power in your life that when
their name is mentioned your neck veins stick out and your face
becomes hard with a look that says, ``I could tell you stories.''
</P>
<P>
   I learned of a grudge against me that is more than 35 years old
when I talked to a woman I first met in grade school. In recent
years we became reacquainted by phone, and one day she admitted
that she was still a little peeved at me.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because, she said, when I was in ninth-grade or something,
I turned into ``such a goody two-shoes.'' She couldn't remember
what I had done to her to make her think that, but she had clearly
resented me, or that loathsome part of my character, for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   I laughed it off, even though I could have turned her slur into
a reverse grudge, but instead sought reassurance from a close
friend who knows my dark side and promised no one would ever think
of me as that today.
</P>
<P>
   I started thinking about people from college, former bosses,
certain family members who have made me seethe. At first I thought
I might be able to come up with two or three really good grudges,
but pretty soon I had a long list.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how far back you can remember those old wounds,
better than you can remember who brought you heart-shaped candies
and complimented you on your spelling. A grudge doesn't even have
to be real. It can be imagined but fed for so long that you finally
believe it. You hear about divided families, where one sibling
won't speak to the other because of a slight she doesn't want to
talk about and then finally it comes out that it was their cousin
Donny who really made off with grandma's crystal.
</P>
<P>
   You can have a grudge against institutions like the Catholic
Church or the DMV or a fashion industry that encourages control-top
pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-grudges, the ones that don't require therapy or
mediation, are another reminder of how all of life is junior high.
You told him first. You invited her instead of me. The teacher
likes you better.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with holding on to grudges is that they eventually
overwhelm the good memories. And they can become deadly in their
own way. Allowed to fester, the grudge you hold can be turned on
you and then there's war in the Balkans again.
</P>
<P>
   What a notion, to clear your mind of old baggage instead of
leaving it in the middle of the room to trip over. I'm thinking of
trying it out. But I am no goody two-shoes.

TEXAS GUARD UNIT TO BE DEPLOYED IN BOSNIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mounting its first massive deployment since
1961, a Texas Army National Guard unit Thursday was making final
preparations for a nine-month peacekeeping assignment in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the deployment, ordered by President Clinton, is
a routine rotation of U.S. troops in Bosnia's American sector,
though the lengthy tour of duty is a reflection of changing times
for Guard members, who used to be known as ``weekend warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   About 700 members of the 49th Armored Division, which is based
in Austin but draws on units throughout the state, will begin
departing for Bosnia from Fort Hood on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   A patriotic sendoff, led by Army officials and Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry, is scheduled from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Feb. 7 at Austin's City
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the soldiers get up to Fort Hood, we'll have the
good-byes over with, and they can do the final touch-ups on the
training. There are still a few people who have to qualify with
certain weapons,'' said Guard spokesman Lt. Col. John Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not see their families again for 270 days,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such extended stays have grown common since Desert Storm in
1990, when 166,000 National Guard members were utilized, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very clear signal what the American military was
going to look like from then on,'' Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that we were going to use the National Guard
and reserve. We started doing that in Desert Storm and we haven't
stopped,'' Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sudden crisis in Bosnia, he said. In fact, it's been
relatively tranquil there for the past two years, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Guard members will be assigned to the U.S.
headquarters in Tuzla of ``Stabilization Force 7,'' and will take
over command from an Army division based in New York. The most
dangerous assignments, such as patrolling in tanks and Bradley
fighting vehicles, will be handled by an Army Cavalry regiment from
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Texas Guard members are male because of the legal
prohibition against females in combat roles, but women will be
handling helicopter operations, communications and other tasks,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the private-sector jobs that the Guard members will
leave behind must be waiting for them when they return. Those with
serious personal or business conflicts weren't required to go
because there were more than enough volunteers to fill the 700
slots, Stanford added.
</P>
<P>
   In its only other full deployment, the 49th Armored Division
spent 11 months at Fort Polk, La., in 1961 due to the Cuban missile
crisis and Berlin Wall tensions.

HIGHER-END WINES LEAD A VINTAGE YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By TED APPEL   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California wineries enjoyed their best year
ever in 1999, ringing up a record $5.4 billion in sales as a strong
economy and the arrival of a new millennium inspired consumers to
celebrate with a hearty twist of the corkscrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this market as the finest we have ever had in
California,'' analyst Jon Fredrikson told a crowd of 3,000 wine
industry leaders Wednesday at the annual Unified Wine &AMP; Grape
Symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Not for every winery, however. Consumers increasingly are
turning their noses up at cheap wines, which still account for the
vast majority of production by California's diverse wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of ``everyday wines,'' priced under $7 a bottle, grew
an anemic 1 percent last year, Fredrikson said. These low-priced
wines account for 75 percent of the state's wine production but
generate less than half of the industry's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of premium wines, priced at $7 a bottle and higher,
jumped 13 percent last year as consumers' tastes continue to move
upward to wines of higher quality. Though they produce just 25
percent of the state's wine, premium wineries have become a cash
cow that generate 54 percent of the industry's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high end of the market is going crazy. Unfortunately, the
low end of the market is not doing well,'' Fredrikson said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, wine shipments from California increased 3 percent in
1999 to a record 442 million gallons, or 184 million cases. But in
a sign of premium wineries' growing economic power, winery revenues
rose three times as fast, jumping almost 9 percent to $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in premium wine sales is a direct result of the surging
U.S. economy, Fredrikson said. ``We're riding this tremendous
increase in disposable incomes. Let's hope it continues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkling wine sales enjoyed a resurgence in 1999 as consumers
stocked up on bubbly for millennium parties, ending a 15-year
decline in champagne sales. Sales of California and imported
sparkling wine jumped 25 percent last year, reaching 15 million
cases, Fredrikson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wine sales also were fueled last year by the release of the
giant 1997 vintage, the largest grape crop in state history. The
bumper harvest alleviated a three-year shortage of California wine
that pushed prices up sharply. Prices for premium wines have not
yet fallen significantly, however, because two subsequent smaller
crops postponed a much-anticipated glut of wine in California.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, premium vintners enjoyed the best of both worlds in
1999: High prices and ample supply.
</P>
<P>
   Varietal wine prices on the bulk market are generally steady in
most parts of California and rising in Napa and Sonoma counties,
said Richard De Los Reyes, a broker with Joseph W. Ciatti Co., a
Mill Valley bulk wine brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Wine and grape prices may fall this year as new vineyards
planted across the state come into production, said Barry Bedwell,
president of Allied Grape Growers, a Fresno trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Bedwell placed the odds of a record-breaking harvest this year
at 60 percent. California is overdue for another bumper crop, and
another 40,000 acres of vineyards will begin producing grapes this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bedwell warned that Mother Nature could prolong the
shortage of premium wine. A lack of rain could hurt the 2000 grape
crop and increase the threat of frost damage if the grapevines
break into buds early. At the same time, growers are increasingly
worried about the spread of Pierce's disease, a deadly and
incurable bacterium carried by insects.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the giant 1997 crop has resupplied California wineries
and allowed them to staunch the flow of imported wines into the
United States. Wineries imported just 4.8 million gallons of bulk
wine from overseas last year, down from 8 million gallons in 1998
and 20.3 million gallons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tougher and tougher for imports to get the growth they
had,'' Fredrikson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, U.S. wineries experienced a slowdown in
exports last year. Exports of U.S. wines grew just 4 percent in
1999 to 18.4 million cases, ending five years of double-digit
growth. Fredrikson called the slowdown ``a danger sign,'' reminding
vintners that foreign markets will become increasingly important if
there is a glut of wine in the United States.

UMASS TUITION TO REMAIN LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The cost of attending the University of Massachusetts
will remain at current levels next year, giving what was in recent
memory one of the nation's most expensive public systems its fifth
straight year of tuition cuts or freezes.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze, which will make tuition and fees on the four
undergraduate campuses an average of $4,680 per year, are all the
more striking in contrast to national trends.
</P>
<P>
   Although California recently announced a tuition freeze for next
fall, no other state has so consistently cut its tuition. In fact,
average tuition has been rising at twice the rate of inflation, or
about 4 percent, at private and public colleges nationwide,
according to the College Board. Average student charges at UMass
will have dropped $289, or 5.8 percent, between 1995-96 and
2000-2001. Inflation during that time is expected to be about 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have steadily worked against any increases in
UMass tuition or fees _ which together make up total mandatory
charges _ for several years, trying to roll back the huge increases
of the late 1980s and early 90s. In those years, many students were
squeezed out of the state university, as state funding declined 22
percent, and tuition more than doubled. By 1994, the tail end of
the state fiscal crisis, UMass was the fourth most expensive public
university in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the trustees requested a slight increase,
Governor Cellucci threatened to withhold state funding if they did
not agree to cut overall charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an era in which many students and many families
fear that top-quality higher education is simply beyond their
means,'' UMass president William M. Bulger said. ``The good news is
that this isn't the case....a student who enters the University of
Massachusetts this fall will be paying less than a brother or
sister who enrolled in 1995 and has already graduated.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's board of higher education has final say over UMass
charges, but a dispute like last year's is not expected. Under the
package approved, undergraduate tuition and fees will be as follows
for the individual campuses: Amherst, $5,212; Boston, $4,222;
Dartmouth, $4,129; Lowell, $4,255.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate rates will be as follows: Amherst, $5,642; Boston,
$5,110; Dartmouth, $4,959; Lowell, $4,984.

</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Shapiros studied at Brandeis, but school
officials said the gift, one of many the couple has given to the
liberal arts college, derives from their long interest in
bolstering Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of wealthy Jews seeking a US university that
didn't use quotas to limit the number of Jews or other groups,
Brandeis opened in 1948 with 107 students. Today, more than 4,200
undergraduates and graduates study at Brandeis, about 60 percent of
them Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shapiros' gift is important because the existing student
center is too small for the current number of students,'' said
Dennis Nealon, a Brandeis spokesman. ``It's filling a critical
need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shapiros have already left their mark on Brandeis, with
money for a new admissions building, a library, and professorships.
</P>
<P>
   They have also left a mark on Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, the couple gave $6 million to help pay for medical
education and research at an institute established jointly by
Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
now called the Carl J. Shapiro Institute for Education and
Research. The Shapiros have also given to The Museum of Fine Arts,
where a gallery is named after them.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Shapiro, the founder and former chairman of Kay Windsor
Inc., a New Bedford, Mass. company that manufactured and imported
knitted apparel, served on Brandeis' Board of Trustees until 1988.
His daughter, Rhonda Zinner, now serves on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The Shapiros' latest gift will go to building a student center
that in 2001 will house a computer library, theater, bookstore,
cafe, and student clubs and offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Carl and Ruth Shapiro Student Center will transform the
campus,'' said Brandeis president Jehuda Reinharz. ``It will be the
signature building and the heart of student life.''

EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT VOTES TO GIVE WOMEN EASIER ACCESS TO DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ After an impassioned debate about Islam, the
family and the role of women, Parliament voted Thursday to give
women the ability to divorce their husbands without having to first
prove to judges that they had been mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak, whose party controls the 454-member
Parliament, had proposed the hotly debated legislation and is
widely expected to sign it in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the change argued that Islam, the dominant
religion, gives only men the right to initiate divorces. They said
extending the right to women, who were described as emotionally
capricious and vengeful in discussions in Parliament and the media,
would lead to a mass breakdown of family life.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents said even the prophet Muhammad had allowed an unhappy
woman to end her marriage against her husband's wishes, although
she was first ordered to return her dowry.
</P>
<P>
   Many leading clerics supported the change, including the
government-appointed mufti and the sheik of Al Azhar University in
Cairo, the oldest Islamic teaching institution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for women who spend years and years of their
lives seeking divorce and never getting it,'' said Hosn Shah, a
writer and one of the newly vocal women who campaigned for the
changes. ``These rules were in the Islamic law 1,400 years ago. But
it is men who do not apply them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, divorce would still be more complicated for a
woman than a man, reflecting the conservative nature of this
male-oriented society. A woman would have two choices. She could
use the current procedure, which requires a wife to have witnesses
to prove to a judge in family court that her husband had behaved
badly enough to justify divorce, perhaps because he beat her or had
failed to provide for her. That process is usually protracted and
usually ends in a ruling against the wife. Still, 1.5 million such
requests are filed each year, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A new option would be to demand a divorce based on simple
incompatibility. But a woman would have to wait six months if she
has children or three months if she does not while a judge tries to
reconcile the partners. If she still wants the divorce, a judge
would have to grant it. But the woman would have to return all
money, property and gifts that she received in the marriage and
forgo alimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will only lead to more and more splits within the
society,'' Ayman Nour, a member of Parliament who opposed the
change, said. ``This law will instigate women to be corrupt. A
woman could just get together with another man and agree to divorce
her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim man in Egypt can now end a marriage by saying, ``I
divorce thee,'' three times or, in a bureaucratic version of the
same ancient Islamic custom, by filing a paper with a government
registrar that declares that he is divorcing his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Under the change, a man would be required to file the divorce
paper. The situation for Christians, estimated to make up 6 percent
of Egypt's population, would remain burdensome, because religious
courts administer family law. Unless they can prove that their
husbands have committed adultery, the church rarely grants
Christian women divorces. Only if a woman converts to Islam would
she be able to take advantage of the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak proposed even broader legislation to benefit married
women that would have also let them obtain passports or travel
abroad without their husbands' permission. But in an apparent
compromise with conservative legislators, Parliament dropped that
provision.

&HT;     PUERTO RICANS, WHITE HOUSE MEET OVER VIEQUES RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHNGTON _ In an attempt to resolve a simmering dispute,
Puerto Rican officials met Thursday with White House and Defense
Department representatives over the fate of a controversial U.S.
Navy bombing range but failed to reach agreement about the future
of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was part of an open dialog that has been ongoing since
last year,'' one administration official said of the high-level
meetings that included Angel Morey, the secretary of state for the
U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said that additional meetings will
take place over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican officials want the bombing range on the small
island of Vieques permanently closed, asserting that the facility
has been a health hazard and economic drain for the island's 9,000
residents. The Navy, meanwhile has argued that the range is needed
to help train its crews and Marines for amphibious combat.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting was getting under way Thursday, Sila Calderon,
the mayor of San Juan, blasted the Navy for its ``appalling'' and
``shameful'' treatment of the island's residents.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the widespread public support from Puerto Ricans at
home and abroad, Calderon said that the Puerto Rican officials were
pressing the Clinton administration for a permanent end to the
Navy's presence on the island, 900 acres of which the Navy has used
as a bombing range for nearly 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean facility is the only location in the eastern
United States where the Navy and Marines practice combined
amphibious landings, aerial attacks and naval gunfire support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans across all social, religious and political lines
have formed an unprecedented consensus and have determined that the
bombing must end and the land occupied by the Navy must be returned
to the people of Vieques,'' Calderon said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon, who is a member of Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello's
task force on the future of Vieques, said Puerto Rican negotiators
were seeking from the White House a specific timetable for the Navy
withdrawal from the base; details on how that Navy would clean up
the range, which is littered with fragments of exploded ordnance;
and guarantees that any Navy withdrawal cannot be revered by a
future administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy has resisted an outright closure. Instead, the
service has proposed that the issue be put forward as a referendum
to residents of Vieques. Under the Navy proposal, the residents
would have a choice: allow the Navy and Marine Corps to resume
training with live ammunition and get $40 million in community aid
as a sweetener; or close the base within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has rejected the Navy offer. However, Calderon left
open the possibility that Puerto Rico might still reach a
compromise with the White House and Navy. She said that some sort
of referendum was possible ``if it's put together in a way that's
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Calderon stressed that Puerto Ricans were unwavering in
their sentiment about bombing. ``There can be no more exercises
with ammunitions of any kind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House imposed a moratorium on live-fire exercises at
the Vieques range after a civilian employee of the Navy was killed
last year in a bombing accident. The moratorium expires on March 1.

RESORT, BEDOIN CLASH IN THE SINAI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the sands of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, the Bedouin tribes
don't settle their conflicts in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   They work it out man-to-man, tribe-to-tribe, according to the
desert code of honor. And often that means violence.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Roger H. Rotondi Jr., 39, the Massachusetts-born
scion of a prominent Bay State political family, found out that
this ancient tribal culture still is very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi, the grandson of three-term Massachusetts governor John
Volpe, says he ended up fleeing for his life from a tourist hotel
he owns in Egypt's Red Sea resort town of Dahab.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I had some romantic notions about the
Bedouin and about living here,'' said Rotondi, speaking Wednesday
on a mobile telephone after having fled to another town nearly 200
miles away. ``But I've learned my lesson. This was just pure
barbarity.''
</P>
<P>
   The story began four years ago when Rotondi invested in a resort
that specialized in diving excursions along the Red Sea's magical
coral reefs. In a play on ``Club Med'' and Red Sea, it was named
``Club Red.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed a management contract with a Bedouin tribal family
headed by Nasser Hamid and leased land and some cottages in
exchange for a percentage of the profits. Recently, however, the
relationship soured _ Rotondi would not go into the details _ and
Hamid began threatening Rotondi and his staff, the American said,
pressuring Rotondi to leave the resort.
</P>
<P>
   It came to a head Monday in a confrontation on the Gulf of
Aqaba, he said, in a scene that sounded straight out of the
Hollywood classic ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   At high noon, the resort was surrounded by about 50 members of
the Bedouin clan dressed in traditional Bedouin ``jalibiyas'' and
``kaffiyehs'' (robes and head scarves) and armed with sticks,
stones, and broken bottles, he said. They took over the hotel,
threatened the staff, and threw his desk and papers out of his
office while startled guests watched.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi said he and the staff were attacked, and two employees
were hospitalized with serious facial cuts and bruises. The Bedouin
then occupied the management offices and cut the phone lines and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi claimed local police came with the tribe and did nothing
to stop the attack. When he sought help from more senior police
officials, he said, he was met with a shrug of the shoulders and a
sense that Bedouin law prevented them from acting. Instead, the
Egyptians pushed him to try and work out a ``sulha,'' or truce,
with the Bedouin ``sheikh,'' an ancestral leader with wide
authority over the families of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi said he has master's degree from the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, but it didn't really come in
handy in this conflict. Fearing for their lives, Rotondi and his
staff holed up in the hotel for most of two days before escaping
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some quaint, traditional Bedouin,'' Rotondi said
of Hamid. ``This is a powerful local guy who uses violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy rides a 1999 Mercedes, not a camel,'' he said, adding
that Hamid travels with an entourage that includes his attorney as
well as menacing toughs from his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   There was no answer Thursday on the phone at the resort. Hamid
could not be reached. David Ballard, the US Embassy spokesman in
Cairo, said the embassy had been contacted by Rotondi and it was
assisting him, but Ballard said he could not comment on the
specifics of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago, Rotondi wrote a letter to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, his government's tourism minister, and other senior
Egyptian officials seeking assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared for myself and my partners and colleagues. We are
alone. The biggest Bedouin family in the area and the police are
against us,'' he wrote, in a letter in which he mentions his
grandfather's political career, his past work for the United
Nations, and his education.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi's grandfather on his mother's side, John Volpe, was a
construction industry magnate who became a fixture in Massachusetts
Republican politics. He was elected governor in 1960 and later
served two more terms. He was named US Secretary of Transportation
in the Nixon White House and later appointed ambassador to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi said that after graduating from the Fletcher Shool at
Tufts University, he went to the Middle East to work with a United
Nations agency assisting Palestinians in the West Bank. He often
took the roughly six-hour drive to the Red Sea resorts in Dahab for
vacation, and fell in love with the place.
</P>
<P>
   It is an internationally known destination for deep sea divers
who prize the unique reefs where the Gulf of Aqaba meets the Red
Sea. It has five-star resorts as well as many small camps
frequented by a young crowd of tie-dye-wearing Americans and
Europeans drawn by the place's reputation for readily available
hashish.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist community rubs elbows with the camps of local
Bedouin, many of whom still live a nomadic existence herding camels
and goats in the desert expanse. Bedouin hospitality is legendary,
and guests are eagerly invited into their tents for tiny cups of
bitter coffee. But they are also not to be crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have my own experience of investing in a local
economy,'' he says. ``And it's turned out to be quite an
experience.''

CANADA TO OPPOSE TIGHTENING OF BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada is vehemently protesting a US plan to tighten
security along the border, even as the Canadian intelligence
service Thursday acknowledged that another suspected terrorist had
been under surveillance in Montreal but managed to flee the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's ambassador to Washington, Raymond Chretien, said Ottawa
will vigorously battle any attempts by the US to beef up security
along the 5,525-mile border, as Congress and the White House are
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight this measure until the threat is removed of
additional controls at our border,'' Chretien told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is supported by at least one New England governor,
Vermont's Howard Dean, who sees a danger to the regional economy in
the proposed crackdown at busy northern border crossings. Dean this
week dismissed Congressional charges that Canada has become a haven
for terrorists as ``political blather.''
</P>
<P>
   But deepening US fears that lax Canadian immigration rules have
turned the northern neighbor into a safe operating base for
international terrorists was reinforced as the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service confirmed reports that an Islamic radical
suspected of plotting bomb attacks against the US was able to slip
surveillance in Montreal and leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohambedou Ould Slahi, who arrived in Canada last fall and was
involved with Algerians in Montreal accused in an alleged terrorist
conspiracy against the US, has been arrested in the African nation
of Senegal, according to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper identified Slahi as the brother-in-law of one of
the top lieutenants of terrorist financier Osama bin Laden. Bin
Laden, whom the US has formally charged with masterminding deadly
bomb attacks against US embassies in East Africa, is also suspected
of complicity in a alleged attempt to smuggle terrorist operatives
and bomb materials into the US from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   That plot was thwarted in a string of arrests in the US and
Canada beginning Dec. 14 when Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian whose last
fixed address had been Montreal, was apprehended crossing into
Washington state driving a car with enough bomb materials to
flatten a building. An Algerian and Canadian woman were arrested in
Vermont a few days later. And two more Algerians are in jail in New
York and Montreal on charges stemming from the same alleged
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the suspects, including the man detained in Senegal, seem
to have connected in Montreal, according to Canadian investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although several of the suspects were in Canada
illegally and had repeated brushes with the law, authorities made
no serious effort to have them arrested or deported. Indeed, most
were on welfare and took advantage of other generous Canadian
social programs. Ressam, at one point, had been under surveillance
by Canadian authorities because of suspected terrorist ties, but
the watch was withdrawn because of security service budget
constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi, believed to be a national of Mauritania, ``worked
closely'' in Montreal with Mokthar Haouri, an Algerian now in
Canadian custody under an extradition request from the US. Haouri
provided the bomb material to Ressam, according to Canadian and US
officials.
</P>
<P>
   US investigators flew to Senegal Thursday to question Slahi.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the latest arrest is sure to stoke outrage against
Canada in US Congress, where hearings are underway on whether to
speed implementation of a 1996 law requiring heavy new controls on
the US-Canada border. The law has been delayed because of lobbying
by New England politicians and the Canadian government, but some
congressional leaders are running out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Immigration
Subcommittee, this week blasted the northern neighbor as ``a Club
Med for terrorists,'' repeating a phrase used by a Canadian
intelligence investigator in an interview with the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly need to have better security on the northern
border,'' Smith said. ``We need to reduce the threat of terrorism,
drug smuggling and alien smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
   But any serious crackdown at the roughly 170 official ports of
entry between the two countries could have dramatic economic
consequences for thousands of businesses on both sides. Canada is
far and away the largest trading partner of the US, with nearly $1
billion in two-way commerce crossing the border every day along
with hundreds of thousands of motor vehicles and airline
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, security at US-Canada border crossings has been
loose, with most individuals who make the crossing not even
required to show any identification. Although volumes of trade and
traffic are much higher than with Mexico, the US keeps only about
1200 Customs agents and 300 Border Patrol agents along the northern
border. On the much shorter southern border, by contrast, the US
keeps 2000 Customs agents and 7200 Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorists... are increasingly using Canada as a transit
countrt enroute to the US,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our laws are terrorist friendly,'' acknowledged David
Harris, former chief of Strategic Planning for the Canadian
Security Intelligence Service, referring to Canada's policy of
granting more or less automatic admission to anyone claiming to be
a ``refugee'' together with a cumbersome bureaucracy that allows
even illegal aliens under deportation orders to remain free during
an appeals process that can stretch over years and even decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Ambassador Chretien defended the Canadian system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our laws are as strict, if not more strict, than American
laws,'' he told Canadian journalists in Washington.

   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The small jungle base of God's Army, the
Burmese rebel band that took hundreds of people hostage at a Thai
hospital this week, was overrun by the army of Myanmar on Thursday,
Thai officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents living outside Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, said
the base was captured early Thursday morning. They said that 50
people had been captured but that the fate of the twin 12-year-old
boys said to lead the group, Johnny and Luther Htoo, was not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Ten gunmen from the group, which is made up of ethnic Karen
separatist fighters, were killed Tuesday after taking hundreds of
people hostage for 22 hours in a hospital in the Thai border town
of Ratchaburi.
</P>
<P>
   Thai human rights groups are demanding an investigation into
reports that the gunmen were summarily executed by security forces
who raided the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thai newspapers quoted unidentified commandos as acknowledging
that they had shot some of the gunmen in the head even when they
were not acting aggressively. They said they had done this in the
heat of a fast-moving pre-dawn attack to protect their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentalist Christian band of no more than 200 fighters
had been under intense attack at their hideout inside Myanmar for
the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen who took over the hospital had sought to stop
Thailand from adding its own artillery attacks, which the Thais
said were intended to prevent them from fleeing across the border.
</P>
<P>
   A Thai intelligence officer told The Associated Press that about
100 of the fighters fled their camp Thursday, with the twin boys
leading one of two groups.
</P>
<P>
   God's Army is a splinter group from the main Karen separatist
group, the Karen National Union, which is one of several ethnic
insurgencies that continue to battle the government despite a
series of peace agreements during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Karen National Union issued a statement Thursday saying that
its longtime leader, Bo Mya, 73, had been removed from command. It
said the decision had been made at a previously scheduled
leadership meeting and had nothing to do with the actions of the
God's Army group.
</P>
<P>
   The larger insurgency claims to have 12,000 fighters along the
1,000-mile border between Thailand and Myanmar. Independent
estimates put the number closer to 3,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the wake of the takeover, police in Ratchaburi said
unidentified callers had made bomb threats against another local
hospital as well as a school and a department store.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said schoolchildren and shoppers had gone out into the
streets as the buildings were searched.
</P>
<P>
   If the Htoo twins are still alive and at liberty, it was not
clear Thursday what their ragtag insurgency might have the strength
to do next. It has little support among other insurgencies or
Burmese dissidents, who depend on Thailand for sanctuary along the
border. The Karen National Union joined a virtually unanimous
condemnation by Burmese dissident groups of the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Already driven to the desperate move of taking over a hospital,
the small, poorly trained band was apparently divided and on the
run Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the larger insurgencies have been on the defensive for
several years. In the early 1990s the Karen fighters lost all their
main bases and now no longer control any significant population
centers.
</P>
<P>
   After the hospital takeover, Thai public sentiment has turned
strongly against the rebel groups and the 100,000 refugees taking
shelter in camps just inside Thailand.  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The Thai government has yet to ask the United
States to accept 1,500 new Burmese student refugees, but a State
Department official said Thursday that the United States ``would be
willing to consider taking more refugees if there is a need.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to resettle 600 of these student
refugees from Thailand this year, twice the number who were
resettled here last year. The students fled Burma after the
military coup in 1988 and have been refugees in Thailand for more
than a decade. The official said the refugees had no connection to
the Burmese guerrilla group that stormed a Thai hospital this week.

LUDICROUS SCRIPT LEADS TO A BLACK `EYE'

Our rating: 2 stars 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' raises a number of interesting
questions, including: Are bathrooms on trains really hermetically
sealed? Can one be charged with leaving the scene of a crime if one
didn't see it happen and had nothing to do with it? If this is
America, why do so many people have European accents and the
buildings all look 200 years old? Unfortunately, these aren't the
sorts of things you should be stopping to question in a slickly
made thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor (young Obi-Wan Kenobi in ``The Phantom Menace'')
and Ashley Judd (``Double Jeopardy'') star in this convoluted tale
of an intelligence agent hired to track a killer, for whom he
quickly develops an obsession. McGregor's character, known as The
Eye, follows Judd's Joanna Eris, a woman of many identities, on a
killing spree across America. Rather than turning her in, he
decides he must protect and marry her.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 1 is that McGregor is simply too young for the role.
The Eye is apparently driven by the loss of his daughter; it's not
entirely clear, but it seems his wife took the child with her and
left the secret agent man because he was too focused on his work
(something one would think a woman would expect, entering into a
union with such a man). The Eye's obsession with Joanna is
supposedly triggered by her similarity to his daughter _ who, when
we see her in fantasy sequences, is about 20 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   The other major problem is the script's many cliches
masquerading as stylistic touches. There are occasional fun twists
_ making singer k.d. lang The Eye's agency contact, and emphasizing
The Eye's role as a low-rent James Bond with cell phones that stop
working and communicators that resemble old TV sets _ but not
enough. A motif of the American flag seems a rather desperate
attempt to make Montreal look like America, and poor Genevieve
Bujold is stuck in the silly role of a tough older woman who taught
(and probably did a lot more than that with) Eris in a juvenile
detention facility years prior to the story's setting.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bergen has a small part as a wealthy blind man whom Eris
seems to genuinely fall in love with, because, as she tells him,
``You can't see who I really am.'' Ex-``90210'' star Jason
Priestley does a nice turn as a Brad Pitt-in-``Fight Club''-like,
bleached-blond psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Beholder'' just has too many ludicrous moments to remain
compelling to the viewer. Marketed as a sexy, stylish romp with two
attractive young stars, the film doesn't even deliver on that
score. Though we see Judd in a couple of sexy lingerie ensembles,
there's really no sex or chemistry ... and she's not even shot in a
flattering light. Even when she's supposed to be attracting
unwitting men like bees to honey, she appears somewhat haggard. She
is well-dressed, though: Valentino is credited with supplying her
wardrobe, lingerie and eyewear. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Eye of the Beholder'' (R; some strong violence,
sexuality, language and brief drug content). &QL;

MOST TREASURY PRICES FALL ON EXPECTATION OF HIGHER RATES  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices, with the exception of the
30-year bond, were lower Thursday after the December durable goods
report showed that factory orders had their largest increase in
five months.
</P>
<P>
   The report reinforced market expectations that the Federal
Reserve would increase short-term interest rates in the coming
months to slow economic expansion and keep inflation from
accelerating _ thus hurting fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the long bond was up 22/32, to 94 28/32,
as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.52
percent, from 6.57 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With shorter maturities down in price Thursday, the long
maturity managed to hang onto the gains made over the last four
days. The long bond was benefiting from optimism among market
participants that the central bank would remain vigilant about
inflation. It was also helped by the dwindling supply of
longer-term securities, after the Treasury cut its sales. The
Treasury will buy back some longer-term debt later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yields of shorter maturities, the most vulnerable of the
Treasuries to expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise
rates, gained after the report showed that durable goods orders
surged 4.1 percent last month. Orders gained 1 percent in November.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected a 1 percent gain
for December.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries were restrained by initial jobless claims of 266,000
last week, which were fewer than the 277,000 expected by
economists, a result that hinted at inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said that bond market participants overwhelmingly expect monetary
policy to be tightened by another 25 basis points at a
policy-setting meeting on Tuesday ``as the Fed continues on its
pre-emptive anti-inflationary course in the face of what it
considers to be excessively strong economic growth amid extremely
low employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other reports are scheduled to be released Friday: the
Employment Cost Index (ECI) for December, and the initial estimates
of real gross domestic product growth and the gross domestic
product price index for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wage pressures have been rather modest up to this point,''
Fine said, ``but part of the reason is that we are currently in a
demand-pull inflation environment as opposed to a cost-pull
situation, which means that wage upticks are likely to lag, rather
than lead, overall increases in inflation. As a result many market
participants will tend to put more emphasis on the expected
continued strength in the broadest measure of economic growth and
its price component, although the ECI will hardly be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is expected to show a 5.2 percent annual growth rate
in the final three months of 1999, according to some economists,
who also expect the Employment Cost Index, which measures wages,
salaries and benefits, to show an increase of 0.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1999, from 0.8 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the inversion in the Treasury yield curve has become
more pronounced, as the 30-year bond continues to gain relative to
the rest of the maturities as a result of the Treasury's announced
buyback program and the anticipated reduction in supply in the
longer maturities in the Treasury market.
</P>
<P>
   After having its worst year on record in 1999, the long bond has
earned investors 2.4 percent in the last week alone, including
reinvested interest payments. Last year it fell almost 13 percent.

BARAK'S PARTY UNDER INVESTIGATION OVER CAMPAIGN FINANCING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a scandal that could weaken Prime Minister Ehud
Barak at a critical juncture in the Middle East peace process,
Israel's attorney general opened a criminal investigation Thursday
into the campaign finance practices used by Barak's political party
during last year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The probe came in response to a report released by State
Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg that accused Barak's One Israel Party
of setting up nonprofit organizations to receive large
contributions, which he said violated Israel's campaign-finance
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that in the weeks leading up to last May's
general election, 12 of Israel's 15 political parties had broken
laws limiting the amount of money that an individual can donate.
But it singled out Barak's party as the worst offender and held the
prime minister responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Barak defeated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud
party in the election, and Barak's coalition formed a parliamentary
government in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I determined clearly that the law was broken,'' said Goldberg
in presenting the report to Israel's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barak denied knowledge of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know most of the non-profit organizations,'' he said
at a hastily called press conference. ``I wasn't involved in fund
raising, and I wasn't kept up to speed about the activities
described in the report.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Israel's campaign-finance laws were vague but added that
he did not have any problem with an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the probe could undermine Barak's ability to move ahead
on an ambitious peacemaking agenda with the Palestinians and the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians broke off peace talks last month and have refused to
set a date for a resumption, and the Palestinians have criticized
the Israelis for what they term a lack of attention to negotiations
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has has set his sights on achieving a peace deal with
Syria by July, and he has expressed hopes to negotiate an outline
of a final peace treaty with the Palestinians by Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said it was too early to
know whether Barak would be questioned about the contributions, but
he added, ``Every relevant person will be investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Goldberg, the state comptroller, blamed Barak for
failing in what he implied was Barak's duty to stop campaign
financing abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough for the prime ministerial candidate to direct
his people to work within the framework of the law,'' Goldberg
wrote. ``Rather, he must concern himself with activity in the field
to ensure his directives are carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The wide-ranging spectrum of activity should have
lit a red warning light for (Barak) and motivated him to check that
the campaign for which he was responsible was run according to
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The One Israel Party raised $1.3 million through nonprofit
organizations, according to the report, and has already been fined
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several other parties that violated campaign-finance laws also
received fines, and four of them _ the opposition Likud Party, a
Russian immigrant party called Israel Beitenu, the Center Party and
the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party _ were also put under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Likud leader Ariel Sharon, glossing over the investigation of
his own party, accused Barak of ``buying his office'' and of
personal involvement in the fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Limor Livnat, a Likud member of Parliament, mocked Barak for
maintaining that he had no knowledge of his campaign finance
practices and said she doubted he could run the country if he
couldn't properly oversee his own election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a prime minister is even more difficult than being a
candidate,`` Livnat said. ``How can he deal with all these
important issues that Israelis facing (if he can't run his
campaign)?''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's report said the One Israel Party had received
contributions from, among others, a Swiss millionaire and a
Canadian charity. It said the money was used by the prime
minister's associates, including his brother-in-law, Doron Cohen,
to cover such expenses as polling voters, printing campaign
materials and recruiting volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Likud officials alleged that some of the money was channeled
through companies set up in Panama, Bermuda and the United States
to avoid detection. Goldberg said that his investigation extended
beyond Israel's borders, but he refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The probe into One Israel comes on the heels of a high-profile
political scandal involving Israeli President Ezer Weizman, accused
of possible tax evasion and failing to report millions of dollars
in cash gifts from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman has admitted accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars
from Edouard Sarousi between 1988 and 1993, the year he became
president, but has denied that the money was a bribe. Despite the
police investigation, Weizman has refused to leave office.

THEY BURIED THE HATCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peace at last for our own little version of ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him up and told him it was Darth Vader calling, and
Bob laughed,'' Bill Parcells said of the first step toward ending
his long-running feud with Patriots owner Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hatchets have been buried,'' said Parcells. ``The border
war is over. In fact, when I called Bob that first night (Tuesday),
I told him I thought it was time to end the border war. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about our relationship right now than I have. I
know from my part there's a good feeling about him, and I think
it's the same way with Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Darth Vader?
</P>
<P>
   That's the nickname the assistant coaches on Pete Carroll's
staff gave Parcells because of the fear/contempt with which he was
held at Foxboro. They kiddingly referred to the Jets as the Evil
Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was amused when he learned of the Darth Vader label,
and used it to open his first conversation with Kraft in nearly
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells decided to reach out to Kraft after Bill Belichick's
bid to gain a temporary restraining order against the Jets, freeing
him to negotiate with other teams, was denied by a federal judge
Tuesday. ``I didn't want to see him out of football, and knowing
that Bob liked him, I thought that Bob didn't want that either,''
Parcells said. ``So I made the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the first 30 minutes mending fences, and then
we talked about Belichick. Bob said he still had interest, but
would like to get something done fast, because if we couldn't, he
had to move on and get something done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few good laughs about some of the things that
happened. I told him that I'd wished things had turned out
differently when I left New England, and I think he felt the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed (compensation) ideas. I told him what I wanted
and he didn't want to do that, so we both agreed to think about it.
The next day, Bob didn't call so I thought it was over, that we
couldn't make a deal. But Bob called back late that night
(Wednesday), and we made the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots gave up their No. 1 pick in this year's draft (16th
overall), a fourth-round choice in 2001, and a seventh-rounder in
2002. New England received the Jets' No. 5 pick in 2001, a
seventh-round pick in 2002 _ and Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation was reversed, I would have done the same
thing,'' Parcells said. ``Belichick is a good man. He'll do a good
job up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday morning I spoke with Belichick twice on the phone. I
told him what was happening. I told him I didn't want to see him
out of football, and he said he appreciated that. We talked again
after the trade was passed by the league, and I wished him well and
told him to go up there and show what he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also said, ``I want to feel good about going back to
New England and be able to sit in that stadium and watch a game. I
loved my time in New England. I left a lot of my blood there. We
were getting very close to doing some special things when I left
there. I wish now it could've ended differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was asked if he thought he'd ever be invited to Kraft's
luxury box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I wanted to, I think I might,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finalization of the deal took some time because of its
unusual features, a coach being exchanged for draft picks. Kraft
and Parcells first put together a letter of agreement to release
Belichick from his Jets contract that had to be approved by NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Then Andy Wasnyczuk, representing New England, and Mike
Tannenbaum of the Jets, each team's salary cap expert, put in
writing the compensation agreement Kraft and Parcells had reached.
Parcells said he pressed for a No. 1 pick because he didn't have
room under the salary cap to sign veterans.
</P>
<P>
   When that was done, Belichick was on his way to Foxboro.

EX-CONSTRUCTION UNION CHIEF TO PLEAD GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
 PLEAD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Arthur A. Coia, former president of one of the nation's
biggest construction unions, has agreed to plead guilty next week
to mail fraud in connection with a scheme to avoid payment of
$100,000 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Coia, a lawyer and former president of the Laborers
International Union of North America, had served as an adviser to
President Clinton, chosen for his fund-raising ability and strong
labor ties.
</P>
<P>
   Coia, of Barrington, R.I., is scheduled to appear Monday before
US District Court Judge George A. O'Toole for sentencing. The
federal judge will determine whether to approve the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Under an arrangement announced Thursday, Coia will be required
to pay a $10,000 fine and $100,000 in restitution for evading taxes
in Rhode Island. The US attorney's office is expected to recommend
Coia serve two years probation.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain also bars Coia from being a member, employee,
or leader of the laborers union or any of its satellites. It
further bars him from being an employee of any other union for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some union members and observers were disappointed that Coia,
56, was not stripped of the title of general president emeritus,
which guarantees a $250,000 annual salary and pension. In January,
Coia resigned as president of the 500,000-member union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is legal for him to be general president emeritus,
it is not ethical,'' said Jim McGough, a member of Local 5 of the
laborers union in Chicago. ``Why? Because he will be paid for doing
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-count information filed in federal court by US Attorney
Donald K. Stern alleges that over six years, Coia bought several
luxury Ferraris valued at $215,000 to $1 million from Viking Inc.,
a major union car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that, from 1991 to 1997, Coia illegally
registered the vehicles to the firm's address in Middletown to
avoid paying taxes. Rhode Island imposes a 7 percent tax on the
purchase of all automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``While holding important leadership positions at LIUNA,
including the office of general president, Mr. Coia engaged in an
extensive scheme to cheat Rhode Island and the town of Barrington
of approximately $100,000 in taxes,'' Stern said in a statement.
``He spent well over a million dollars on Ferrari automobiles, but
repeatedly found ways to shirk his duty to pay his taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges Coia used a fraudulent invoice from
Viking that falsely stated he had purchased a $215,000 GTB4 for
$2,160. The invoice was then presented in Rhode Island, where Coia
allegedly paid $151 in taxes rather than the $15,000 he actually
owed.

BAY STATE TAKES CLEAN-AIR CASE TO SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Opening a new front in a high-stakes legal battle over
the nation's air-pollution problem, Massachusetts Attorney General
Tom Reilly appealed Thursday directly to the US Supreme Court to
clear the way for tough new federal limits on smog and soot to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington last year overturned
the proposed health standards _ generally opposed by Midwestern and
Southern states, but supported in the Northeast _ finding that the
EPA had exceeded its authority to limit pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But Reilly, working with New Jersey Attorney General John J.
Farmer, filed an unusual petition at the Supreme Court to reinstate
the smog and soot limits, claiming they would save 15,000 lives a
year and ease breathing problems for 1.5 million. The American Lung
Association made a similar appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need to implement these stringent federal
clean air standards for Massachusetts residents, especially
children,'' Reilly said. ``We urge the Supreme Court to review the
lower court's decision on this important public health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court rejects the vast majority of petitions to
overturn lower court decisions, but Reilly's office said the
gravity of the health issues and the narrow technical nature of the
lower court decision made them confident the Supreme Court would at
least hear their case.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has been trying for years to adopt stricter limits on
the key ingredient in smog, ozone, as well as fine particles of
soot that can deeply penetrate lung tissues. But Midwestern and
Southern states, allied with a wide array of industries, have
opposed the standards, arguing they weren't based on sound science
and would be too expensive to implement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Court of Appeals rejected the new standards last May,
EPA Administrator Carol Browner has looked for other ways to attack
the problem such as ordering 392 high-polluting power plants and
industrial facilities to reduce emissions. However, Massachusetts
officials said tougher national standards would be more effective
at reducing Midwestern air pollution that travels on the wind to
this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sick of breathing the Midwest's secondhand smoke,''
said Environmental Affairs Secretary Robert Durand.

RESEARCHERS DISCOVER METHOD TO IDENTIFY ORIGIN OF EMERALDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Emeralds, the precious stones sought after for centuries to
grace maharajahs' and sultans' turbans and the crowns of European
kings, have yielded an insight about their origins to a team of
French researchers.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing inherent traces of the water from which the stones
crystallized eons ago, the researchers say they can identify the
country and even the individual mine from which an emerald came.
</P>
<P>
   The French method has helped delineate the routes by which
emeralds were traded in the ancient world, and may also influence
present day prices for the stones, which are often deemed more
valuable if their provenance is known.
</P>
<P>
   The only sources of emeralds before the discovery of the New
World were thought to be Cleopatra's mine in Egypt and a small mine
discovered by the Romans in the Austrian Alps. But analysis of the
emerald in a Roman earring found in France showed it must have come
from a mine in Pakistan, perhaps from the ancient kingdom of
Gandhara, and would have reached Europe along the Silk Road, the
French scientists say in a report in Thursday's Science.
</P>
<P>
   The emerald analysis method was developed by Dr. Gaston Giuliani
of the Center for Petrographical and Geochemical Research in
Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy and colleagues elsewhere. It depends on
vaporizing a small sample from the surface of the stone so as to
measure the ratio of oxygen isotopes. The oxygen is derived from
the hot waters out of which the emeralds crystallized, and each of
the few known mines in the world seems to have had water with
different isotope ratios. Isotopes are atoms of the same element
that differ in the number of neutrons they contain.
</P>
<P>
   The vaporization leaves a minute pit in the emerald's surface.
Even though the pit is invisible to the naked eye, the method is to
that extent destructive. Giuliani said the director of the Museum
of Natural History in Paris let him experiment first on two
emeralds owned by the Abbe Hauy, the founder of mineralogy, which
turned out to come from the old Roman mine in the Austrian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's team was then allowed to test a precious relic, the
emerald set on the central jewel lily of the Holy Crown of France
by Louis IX. St. Louis' emerald too proved to come from the
Austrian mine.
</P>
<P>
   A new source of emeralds was opened up when the Spanish, after
much torture and protracted fighting, discovered the Columbian
mines that were the source of the emeralds found in Mexico and
Peru. Giuliani tested a smuggled emerald _ it was not listed on the
manifest _ salvaged recently from the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a
Spanish treasure galleon that foundered off Key West in 1622. The
oxygen isotope test showed the emerald came from the Tequendama
mine of the Muzo district of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Columbian mines were in their possession, the Spanish
started to develop buyers for the emeralds and found considerable
interest among the rulers of India, Persia and Turkey. ``So
sultans, shahs and maharajahs were the principal market,'' said
Fred Ward, a gemologist and author of the book ``Emeralds.'' Gem
Book Publishers, 1996 The Spanish at first shipped the emeralds
from Spain, then sent them via the Philippines. In India, the
Philippines was long believed to be their source of origin, Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's team tested four emeralds from the treasure of the
Nizam of Hyderabad. He reports that three of the emeralds came from
Columbia, each from a different mine, and the fourth probably from
the Pansher valley of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Ward described the French method as a ``dramatic innovation''
which could affect the emerald market because of owners' interest
in the stones' provenance. ``If someone can say definitively an
emerald is from a certain mine it may cause the emeralds to be more
pricey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds at present are sourced by a battery of visual and
spectroscopic tests which are indicative rather than definitive.
``We regard origin as a professional opinion rather than a
scientific fact,'' said Dr. Kenneth Scarratt, director of the
testing laboratory at the American Gem Trade Association in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Scarratt praised the French team's study but said more samples
would be needed to validate the method. Even if it proved reliable,
the fact that even a minuscule part of the stone was destroyed
might deter clients who did not want to take the risk, he said.

   Who you gonna believe? Me or your lying eyes?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to oil prices, that classic Richard Pryor query
ought to be the refrain of the experts, who have been in agreement
for months that oil prices will not _ no, cannot _ long remain
anywhere close to their current level. But prices keep rising
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The experts probably are right, in the long run. But it may be
months or even years before they are vindicated _ and that
vindication is likely to come only after people begin to wonder
whether the experts might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, oil supplies are tight and becoming tighter.
Because refiners were sure that prices had to fall, they tried to
avoid being caught with excess inventories. Now with the weather
cold, prices have soared, particularly for home heating oil.
Consumers will soon be screaming.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a great example of global gamesmanship. As
Frederick P. Leuffer, Bear, Stearns' oil watcher, notes, Saudi
Arabia has two goals. The first is to make money from its oil. The
second is to retain its position as the dominant global supplier.
High oil prices bring in money, but run the risk of stimulating
exploration for more oil, which would damage the second goal.
</P>
<P>
   So it is in the Saudi interest to keep the world guessing. The
major oil companies, which were caught off guard when prices
plunged in 1998, still have not raised their exploration budgets
back to 1997 levels. ``If people think the price will stay above
$25 a barrel, they will significantly increase their investment in
exploration and production and in another two or three years, we
will be facing another crisis,'' said Thierry Demarest, chairman of
TotalFina, as he insisted this week that his company would only
make investments that promise profits with oil at $13.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the industry thinks like that, it is quite possible
that Saudi Arabia will be willing to exercise the restraint needed
to keep oil prices firm. While the crude quote slipped 52 cents, to
$27.32 a barrel, Thursday after the Saudi and Norwegian oil
ministers agreed that the world oil market had reached
``equilibrium,'' whatever that means, it remains far above the 1998
low of $10.35.
</P>
<P>
   That low price reminded members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries that the Saudis could flood the market to
punish others for cheating on OPEC quotas. One reason that everyone
has forecast lower prices was the assumption that such cheating
would soon resume. It hasn't, and it may not while the memory
remains fresh.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the world is back where it thought it was in 1980, at the
mercy of the Saudis. The Saudis don't want to bring on world
recession or reduce the sales of gas-guzzling sport utility
vehicles, but they did run up a lot of debts when oil was cheap,
and they could use the money.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the energy used in this country comes from
oil. As we spend more for gasoline, home heating and plane tickets,
less will be left to pay for discretionary expenses, and the
economy will be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the availability of excess OPEC production
capacity probably will lower oil prices. There is a good chance
that OPEC production quotas will rise in March. But it is doubtful
that the current market forecast, which says that oil for delivery
a year from now will cost 23 percent less than oil does now, will
prove accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, the world's experts were terrorized by the
prospect of ever-rising oil prices. Now they see nothing to fear
from that source, and are sure oil prices will soon fall. Could
they be as wrong now as they were then?

AS HE PURSUES THE WHITE HOUSE, BUSH PINES FOR THE GOVERNOR'S
MANSION  
 MORE DEGREES OF SEPARATION 
WORDS COUNT IN A CAMPAIGN _ EVEN IN SONG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.H. _ Anyone who attended George W. Bush's campaign
events over the last few days heard a number of familiar themes,
from tax cuts to defense spending, education to tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he or she perhaps picked up on something less predictable as
well: Bush is homesick.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech on Tuesday night, the Texas governor lapsed into
a reverie about the morning rituals he misses and how long it had
been since he visited the swath of land in Texas where he and his
wife, Laura, are building a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   At other times he talked about his cats. He pined for his dog.
</P>
<P>
   He was off his game on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday, and
again Thursday. He sniffled through speeches. At one point,
characterizing the relationship between the United States and
Israel, Bush mused, ``They're our buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, visiting an elementary school in Nashua that was
celebrating what it called Perseverance Month, he told the gathered
schoolchildren: ``This is Preservation Month. I appreciate
preservation. This is what you do when you run for president.
You've got to preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   And the most difficult part of that endeavor, he said, was being
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   It all made for an interesting contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore comes off as one of the most ardent,
ambitious aspirants to the Oval Office in quite some time, a man
who would crawl across broken glass to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush comes off as a man who wants it, but not at any price, and
sometimes not as much as he wants to wake up in his own bed at the
governor's mansion in Austin, Texas, wander downstairs to make a
pot of coffee, let out the pets, and fetch the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, that is one of the reasons why many
Americans like him.
</P>
<P>
   More Degrees of Separation
</P>
<P>
   Bush is happy to separate himself from both Gore and President
Clinton, and has been more aggressive about it lately.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new line appeared in his speeches, and that does
not happen too often. To rally Republican voters in Iowa, Bush
began talking about what this election really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the end of the Clinton era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a freighted statement, because one of the signals it sent
to Republican voters was that if they wanted the White House back,
as they surely did, it was time to unite around the front-runner
and send him into the general election as unscathed and unbowed as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   It also made a tacit claim to morality at the same time that
Bush was facing questions about abortion and giving answers that
might not be wholly satisfying to religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's victory speech after the Iowa caucuses on Monday
night, he went a step further, not only referring to the Clinton
era but also appealing to Americans ``weary of scandals and
alibis.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in Concord, someone in the audience played into
his hands, asking Bush how he would handle the baggage of Clinton's
behavior if he were in Gore's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been in his position,'' Bush said. ``I
wouldn't have accepted the vice presidency under Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, when he was asked a similar question by a reporter,
Bush said of Gore: ``I don't think he can figure out how to handle
his relationship with the president. He distances, he doesn't
distance. He distances, he doesn't distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Words Count In a Campaign _ Even in Song
</P>
<P>
   In the semiotics of political campaigns, perhaps nothing is as
revealing as the music that plays at a candidate's events. Bush's
aides have assembled an entire soundtrack, which made its debut
last week, and the song list is almost a synopsis of Bush's persona
and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Bamba'' is on it, with Spanish lyrics that evoke both
Bush's ability to speak the language and his outreach to
Hispanic-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   The singer John Fogerty's ``Centerfield'' is on it, a reminder
that Bush loves baseball, was once the managing general partner of
the Texas Rangers and is ``ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of country and western, for that down-home,
folksy feel. There is a bit of mild disco, just to show that Bush
can groove.
</P>
<P>
   Van Morrison's ``Bright Side of the Road'' telegraphs Bush's
optimism, while Tom Petty's ``I Won't Back Down'' claims a certain
degree of tenacity, his homesickness notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   And Sting's ``A Brand New Day'' promises precisely that. Never
mind that the song is more romantically than politically inclined.
</P>
<P>
   After a miscue several weeks go, when ``Cat's Cradle,'' about a
son who grows up to be like his aloof father, played at several
campaign appearances, all the lyrics were carefully vetted this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why one aide's suggestion, Sheryl Crow's ``A Change
Would Do You Good,'' did not make the cut. Upon closer examination,
a vigilant member of the Bush staff realized that the song included
a reference to, um, self-gratification.

COMMENTARY: DIGNITY, ALWAYS DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ We have finally had a moment in the 2000
presidential race that you are going to be sorry you missed,
people. I am speaking, of course, about this week's Republican
debate, when the social conservative Gary Bauer turned on the
ultra-social-conservative Alan Keyes and said, ``I was a little
surprised this week to see you fall into a mosh pit while a band
called Rage Against the Machine played.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bauer's first stab at the name was ``The Machine Rages
On.'' But sooner or later a Republican primary always gets down to
funk hip-hop, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the filmmaker Michael Moore, who specializes in
making light of politicians in their natural habitat, had been
roaming around Iowa with a ``portable mosh pit'' _ 100 tightly
packed college students on a flatbed truck. Moore promised the
endorsement of his program, ``The Awful Truth,'' to the first
candidate willing to fling himself into the crowd. You may have
seen Keyes on TV, borne aloft and being passed from hand to hand to
the tune of ``Guerrilla Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Keyes is a fringe candidate, he is normally permitted to
do anything he feels like without drawing anyone's attention. But
lately he has been threatening Bauer, who regards himself as the
only legitimate heir to the role of underfinanced right-wing
Republican spoiler. Keyes, with his full-throated rants about the
``howling moral void,'' stole the show in Iowa, coming in a
surprise third while Bauer, despite the important support of the
McCaughey septuplets, was relegated to the fringe of the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly I was willing to fall into the mosh pit,'' Keyes
said, in yet another statement that you never really expected to
hear coming from the lips of a presidential candidate. ``You know
why I did that? Because I think that exemplifies the kind of trust
in people that is the heart and soul of the Keyes campaign.''
Amplifying on his theme of Mosh Pit as Metaphor for Democracy,
Keyes suggested that his performance was a demonstration of how the
American people will ``in fact hold you up, whether it's in terms
of giving help to you when you're falling down or caring for their
own children.''
</P>
<P>
   This opens up entire new avenues of presidential campaigning for
the youth vote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly I was willing to serve as guest referee at the
World Wrestling Federation Crushfest. Making decisions is what my
candidacy is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did indeed spend last Saturday slam-dancing with Alanis
Morissette, but only as a symbolic expression of my commitment to
ballot access reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am the mystery donor-father of Melissa Etheridge's
children. Choose life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, believe it or not, a larger issue at work here. All
the candidates for president have been promising to bring decorum
back to the White House. But they're campaigning in an age when
politicians are forced to compete with entertainment celebrities
for TV time and magazine covers, and the temptation to do something
peculiar to get attention keeps expanding. The Democrats are about
to say goodbye to a president who discussed his underwear
preferences on MTV, and the Republicans are looking for a successor
to the guy now starring in TV ads about erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The longer you campaign, and the more tenuous your hold on
success, the harder it is to resist the siren call of a Playboy
interview or a gig as host of ``Saturday Night Live.'' Bill
Bradley, who has been trying to expand the ever-shrinking privacy
rights of a presidential candidate, was reduced this week to
answering a question about whether he had ever cried after losing a
basketball game. (No, but he cried after talking to a woman whose
family didn't have any medical insurance.) John McCain came under
attack from Keyes (pre-mosh-pit immersion) for having joked that
Nine Inch Nails, of ``God is dead and no one cares'' fame, was his
favorite band. Unmoved, McCain later added that he had ``noticed at
the MTV Awards that Busta Rhymes was wearing a dress. And I'd like
to know if I can borrow that for the swearing-in ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the dress thing worked for Rudy Giuliani OK. Only time
will tell if the public can come to regard plummeting into a mosh
pit as acceptable behavior for a presidential candidate _ although
actually, you could kind of imagine Theodore Roosevelt doing it.

   What's more deadly for a TV programmer than having to go up
against ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''? Having to schedule
something opposite the Super Bowl, which regularly attracts more
than 60 percent of the total viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those kinds of numbers, networks that compete with
ABC _ which airs the Super Bowl this year _ have two choices. They
can throw up their hands, or put on counter-programming.
</P>
<P>
   That means lots of chick flicks, reruns and goofy stunts. If you
want to see women being clairvoyant (``The Butcher's Wife''), going
crazy (``Frances''), nearly drowning (``Titanic'') or just being
bitchy (``Jezebel''), today's your day. Ditto if you've been pining
for the return of the short-lived ``Brady Bunch'' spin-off ``The
Brady Brides.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stunts department, MTV continues its tradition of
claymation tastelessness with back-to-back episodes of ``Celebrity
Deathmatch'' _ including a stop-motion face-off between Joe Namath
and O.J. Simpson _ and Cartoon Network delivers its now-traditional
cartoon marathon (this year, Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote) with
``color commentary'' by John Madden and Pat Summerall.
</P>
<P>
   And in possibly the ultimate combination of chick viewing,
reruns and stunts, CBS airs a 2 1/2-hour marathon of ``Martha
Stewart Living.'' How come guys get to prove their manhood by
sitting around in their undershirts eating chips, while the gals
feel compelled to create elaborate centerpieces out of birch twigs,
French ribbon and wildflowers?

FOREIGN AFFAIRS: ONE COUNTRY, TWO WORLDS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ I just had an interesting experience. I did an
author's tour of Egypt, meeting with students at Cairo University,
journalists at Egyptian newspapers and the Chambers of Commerce of
Cairo and Alexandria to talk about the Arabic edition of a book I
did on globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Two images stand out from this trip. The first was riding the
train from Cairo to Alexandria in a car full of middle- and
upper-class Egyptians. So many of them had cell phones that kept
ringing with different piercing melodies during the two-hour trip
that at one point I felt like getting up, taking out a baton and
conducting a cell-phone symphony. I was so rattled from ringing
phones, I couldn't wait to get off the train. Yet, while all these
phones were chirping inside the train, outside we were passing
along the Nile, where barefoot Egyptian villagers were tilling
their fields with the same tools and water buffalo that their
ancestors used in Pharaoh's day. I couldn't imagine a wider
technology gap within one country. Inside the train it was A.D.
2000, outside it was 2000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The other image was visiting Yousef Boutrous-Ghali, Egypt's
M.I.T.-trained minister of economy. When I arrived at his building
the elevator operator, an Egyptian peasant, was waiting for me at
the elevator, which he operated with a key. Before he turned it on,
though, to take me up to the minister's office, he whispered the
Koranic verse ``In the name of God, the Merciful, the
Compassionate.'' To a Westerner, it is unnerving to hear your
elevator operator utter a prayer before he closes the door, but for
him this was a cultural habit, rooted deep in his tradition. Again,
the contrast: Boutros-Ghali is the most creative, high-tech driver
of globalization in Egypt, but his elevator man says a prayer
before taking you up to his office.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes captured the dichotomy I found throughout Egypt:
While its small, cell-phone-armed, globalizing elites are
definitely pushing to get online and onto the global economic
train, most others fear they will be left behind or lose their
identity trying to catch it. Indeed I was struck, after a week of
discussing both the costs and benefits of globalization, by how
most Egyptians, including many intellectuals, could see only the
costs. The more I explained globalization, the more they expressed
unease about it. It eventually hit me that I was encountering what
anthropologists call ``systemic misunderstanding.'' Systemic
misunderstanding arises when your framework and the other person's
framework are so fundamentally different that it cannot be
corrected by providing more information.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians' unease about globalization is rooted partly in a
justifiable fear that they lack the technological base to compete.
But it's also rooted in something cultural _ and not just the
professor at Cairo University who asked me: ``Does globalization
mean we all have to become Americans?'' It goes deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans can easily identify with modernization,
technology and the Internet because one of the most important
things these do is increase individual choices. At their best, they
empower and emancipate the individual. But for traditional
societies, such as Egypt's, the collective, the group, is much more
important than the individual, and empowering the individual is
equated with dividing the society. So ``globalizing'' for them not
only means being forced to eat more Big Macs, it means changing the
relationship of the individual to his state and community in a way
that they feel is socially disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does globalization mean we just leave the poor to fend for
themselves?'' one educated Egyptian woman asked me. ``How do we
privatize when we have no safety nets?'' asked a professor. When
the government here says it is ``privatizing'' an industry, the
instinctive reaction of Egyptians is that something is being stolen
from the state, says an official.
</P>
<P>
   After enough such conversations I realized that most Egyptians _
understandably _ were approaching globalization out of a
combination of despair and necessity, not out of any sense of
opportunity. Globalization meant adapting to a threat coming from
the outside, not increasing their own freedoms. I also realized
that their previous ideologies _ Arab nationalism, Socialism,
Fascism or Communism _ while they may have made no economic sense,
had a certain inspirational power. But globalism totally lacks
this. When you tell a traditional society it has to streamline,
downsize and get with the Internet, it is a challenge that is
devoid of any redemptive or inspirational force.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, for all of globalization's obvious power to
elevate living standards, it is going to be a tough, tough sell to
all those millions who still say a prayer before they ride the
elevator.

 &HT;    Vermeil a champ in the crying game
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLABTA _It can happen almost any time. A quarterback wrecks his
knee, a big game is won, a sentimental notion flutters across his
frontal lobe, heck, a bird sings or a baby coos _ and Dick Vermeil
springs a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Did Vince Lombardi cry? Or Knute Rockne? Don Shula was granite
from the chin up.
</P>
<P>
   But Vermeil is a different kind of coach, and you can read that
in the tracks of his tears.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose Sunday, the St. Louis Waterworks probably will be
open. He hasn't been afraid to cry to date; no reason he'll hold
back come the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an emotional person, regardless of whether it
applies to football or not,'' the Rams' sensitive guy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just me. Sometimes I've evaluated that as a weakness.
It's embarrassing sometimes. I can't help myself sometimes. I have
prepared myself emotionally and mentally not to do it, and I still
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All healthy, a resident expert says. ``He seems like a man who
is confident and sure of who he is,'' said Carole Kant, assistant
professor in Emory's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crying used to be thought of as the woman's privilege,'' Kant
said, ``But as we are becoming more astute, we are becoming more
accepting of a man's ability to show emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Let it out, guys. If the NFL sack leader can get misty, who are
we to stay all stoic? ``I'm a crier. I watch `Forrest Gump' or
`Green Mile' and its, `Waaaa!''' Rams defensive end Kevin Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   His buddy on the line teetered on the brink. ``I got choked up
last week at the thought of going to the Super Bowl, but it was
very brief,'' Grant Wistrom said. A couple of more years with
Vermeil, and he'll loosen up. The coach could make Barbara Walters
cry.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing no lame ducts, Vermeil is football's undisputed
champion of the constricted throat and dewy eyes. Although, this
week, he has held tight rein on the impulse. I had considered
trying to prompt an outburst, asking something like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, what did you think about the ending to `Old Yeller?'''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Dick, any thoughts on motherhood?'' But football questions
kept getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, he'll show the soft side in a victory speech, or
during a team meeting or reading some syrupy note from a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was very difficult for the players to get used
to,'' Rams cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``I remember we had the
first team meeting, and he was talking about some of his past
players and the emotional ties he had to them. When he got
emotional, guys were a little bit disturbed, because they didn't
know how to react. But after you get to know Dick as a person, you
get to know he's like that, and you just let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when he starts getting choked up, guys
will be like, ``Hold on, coach, don't let it go.' Teasing him a
little bit. So, he gives it his best effort not to let it bother
him too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just talking about a guy who's really passionate about
people,'' linebacker Todd Collins said. ``It's a shame people make
a big deal out of it. It shouldn't have to be an odd thing. We live
in such a cynical world that people take that as a sign of
weakness. I think it's a sign of strength.'' ``I don't see it as
any sign other than that's who I am,'' Vermeil said. ``That's just
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Any eminent Emory psychiatrist will tell you that a little
crying can be good for you. There is one other benefit that might
persuade even the most leathery tough guy to give the sensitive man
thing a try.
</P>
<P>
   Kant said, ``That's the kind of man women like.''

MCCAIN'S FREEWHEELING CAMPAIGN STRIKES A CHORD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ Rolling down the highway aboard his bus, the
``Straight Talk Express,'' Sen. John McCain is on his way to yet
another town meeting, 104 so far in New Hampshire and counting.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sits with his wife, Cindy, telling jokes about his
``second or third grade'' proficiency at the computer and arguing
that George W. Bush's tax cut plan ``doesn't provide one penny'' to
pay down the national debt. He makes a gutteral exploding bomb
sound when asked to describe the reaction last summer when House
Republicans took a $793 billion tax cut proposal to the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs won't eat it,'' McCain said, likening the tax plan to a
much-promoted pet food that gathers dust on grocery store shelves.
McCain doesn't mention that he cast a reluctant vote for the tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy pilot and Vietnam POW has brought a breezy,
wing-it style to the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And here on the snow-packed streets of New Hampshire, his
``Straight Talk Express'' is threatening to run Bush off the easy
road to the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain with a lead over the Texas governor, but
McCain shrugs it off. ``Whether it's enough, whether it'll last, I
don't know,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In this retail phase of the presidential race, thousands of New
Hampshire voters get to meet, question and take the measure of the
candidates. They are showing up in crowds of 400 to 500 to hear
McCain. In the old Navy phrase, many like the cut of his jib.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made his own way, not like that whippersnapper (Bush),''
said Bill Fellows, a cab driver. ``Even in his family, he had to
work his way up. He proved himself.'' (McCain is the son and
grandson of Navy admirals.) An independent who once backed Bill
Clinton, Fellows plans to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's town meetings have a breezy spontaniety lacking in an
era of sound bites and bland stump speeches. Audiences do not get
canned answers. The candidate often disagrees with questioners. The
questioners are invited to speak their minds.
</P>
<P>
   As freezing rain fell outside, putting an icy layer atop the
day's snowfall, a Londonderry retiree named Bob Kaszynski
reflected: ``People really struggled to get here. And I don't hear
anybody saying, `I wish this was over, I want to watch the
ballgame'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the framers of the Constitution intend the separation of
God and the state?'' a pipe organ builder named James Stewart asked
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they did,'' the Arizona senator replied.
</P>
<P>
   He added that America's founders intended that Judeo-Christian
values play an integral part in how the government functioned, and
noted that the Senate begins each day's business with a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a typical shaft of McCain wit. ``It's very hard
to do the Lord's work in the city of Satan,'' he pointed out,
referring to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   McCain concluded by saying that he would never force anyone to
say a prayer, or put anyone unwillingly in a room where prayers
were being said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart disagreed with McCain but was impressed at the
completeness of his answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to choose between this man, who impresses me greatly,
and Alan Keyes whose position on God in the nation I agree with.
I'm not sure,'' he said. Keyes is a former diplomat and radio host
running on a platform of restoring morality in America.
</P>
<P>
   Frontrunners Bush and McCain present a contrast in themes and
styles. The Texas governor gives the impression that every word he
speaks has been carefully vetted, such as an oft-stated promise to
``rally the armies of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is sounding themes usually heard from a candidate who
has wrapped up his party's nomination. ``I will be a uniter, not a
divider,'' he tells audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at President Clinton, Bush promises that once
inaugurated he will ``uphold the honor and dignity of the office to
which I have been elected.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Straight Talk Express, by contrast, the conversation
swings around to who in a McCain administration would be
responsible for firing underperforming officials. ``Cindy,''' joked
McCain. ``She's a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush takes a limited number of questions, trying to keep
attention on his theme of the day. McCain talks freely and for
hours on his bus. GOP consultant Mike Murphy carries a kazoo, which
he threatens to sound if anybody asks the same ``gotcha question''
seven times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   There also are serious differences, $200 billion worth of them,
between the GOP frontrunners. Bush promises that a $483 billion
across-the-board tax cut will be the centerpiece of his presidency.
He jabs at McCain with TV ads about ``Washington, D.C.,
politicians'' who want to keep the money in the capital and spend
it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would use the federal budget surplus differently. About
$260 billion would go to a tax cut targeted to the middle class.
``I want to move the 15 percent tax bracket up to $70,000 a year; I
want to eliminate the marriage penalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under McCain's plan, a big chunk of the federal surplus would be
used to guarantee the longterm viability of Medicare and Social
Security. McCain would also rapidly pay down the national debt.
McCain also is talking about areas of federal responsibility that
have been neglected, such as the $6 billion repair backlog in
America's national parks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain remains proudly conservative. ``I support overturning Roe
v. Wade,'' he said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that
legalized abortion. McCain would permit abortion in cases of rape,
incest or threat to the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Although he proclaims Teddy Roosevelt a hero, and helped write
two Arizona wilderness bills, McCain takes strong exception to
Clinton's recent proclamation of two new national monuments in
Arizona. Nor does he like how the Clinton administration is moving
to protect 50 million acres of roadless, undeveloped national
forest land.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a conservative, I believe in consultation with local
people,'' he said. ``If you want to rule by edict, fine, but that's
not the way government should work. What he (Clinton) did was
alienate large numbers of citizens who live, work and recreate (in
the monuments). We would have put a lot of that land into
preservation status. We were working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also pounding at the need for campaign finance reform
and special interests. He has managed to make the issue resonate
among voters by delivering a litany of special interest efforts in
Washington, D.C., including some from members of his own party. A
few are sweethearts of Senate Majority leader Trent Lott. Last
year, McCain also mentioned Washington Sen. Slade Gorton's
amendment on behalf of a proposed gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign themes are being heard elsewhere. McCain
opposes any tax on Internet commerce; Bush has come out for
extending the moratorium now in place. Speaking last week on
``Larry King Live,'' Bush talked of Americans devoting themselves
to ``causes greater than their own self-interest.'' The phrase is a
mainstay of McCain's stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of cases where he (Bush) has taken a position
similar to mine, but I attribute it to enlightenment rather than
mimicry,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond New Hampshire, McCain remains an underdog. Bush is
massively funded and organized. And Republicans have a reputation
as royalists when it comes to picking nominees. No insurgent
candidate has gained the nomination since another outspoken
Arizonan, Barry Goldwater, in 1964. Hence, McCain must put together
a string of victories starting in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain makes light of the daunting challenge, noting that
Arizona had produced Goldwater as well as Democrats Morris Udall
and Bruce Babbitt _ all admired but unsuccessful presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona may be the one state in the nation where mothers can't
tell their children that they may grow up to be president of the
United States,'' he quipped.

   Making the grade: It'll be pass or fail
</P>
<P>
   By Curtis Bunn
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Isaac Bruce smiled, which was an accomplishment in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there were always boos,'' he said. ``I thought
they were saying, `Bruuuce.'''
</P>
<P>
   Usually stoic, Bruce amused himself with that line and flashed a
grin, however brief. He was referring to the old days in St. Louis
when the disgruntled fans let the Rams know their displeasure. He
was about the only thing the franchise had going for it then, an
outstanding receiver with not enough help to elevate the team from
the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Those boos certainly are ``Bruuuuce!'' now. He remains the
biggest passing threat on what has become a potent Rams offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce maintains the look of a prize fighters right before
the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``People misinterpret me,'' he said. ``They say I don't smile. I
smile a lot. They say I always look mean and that I'm hard to
approach. But how would you know unless you approach me? The reason
I'm quiet is that I like to see what a person is about before I
start opening up. I withhold. And I watch. The least said is the
best said.''
</P>
<P>
   When he does speak, people listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn from Isaac every day,'' young receiver Az-Zahir
Hakim said. ``You know what he's saying is beneficial because he's
done it at a high level in this league. You respect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And day in and and day out, he comes to play,'' Hakim said.
``You see how he handles himself on the field, and it's carried
over to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, chosen for the Pro Bowl, carried the Rams' passing
offense with 77 receptions for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns in the
regular season. In the two playoff games that pushed the Rams to
the Georgia Dome, Bruce had seven catches for 155 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous receiver in every aspect,'' Tampa Bay
Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said. ``He has the speed to get deep
and he runs so well after the catch. He's a complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his demeanor, Bruce is excited about how far the Rams
have come. He had been the shining light of a franchise going
nowhere. Now, he has ample assistance in a passing game that
produced record numbers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many weapons, I'm like a kid in a candy store,''
Bruce said. ``We can beat you from anywhere on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bruce is not the choice for Kurt Warner, the quarterback also
has Torry Holt, who had 52 catches for 788 yards and six touchdowns
in the regular season. ``We feed off each other,'' Holt said. ``The
way we see it, you can't possibly cover all of us. Somebody's going
to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Hakim, the fifth receiver on passing downs who
found his way to the end zone eight times. ``Attack, attack,
attack,'' Hakim said. ``We feel like we can get open against
anybody because we have an aggressive approach. We have the speed
to beat you deep and we're willing to go underneath. So what do you
give up?''
</P>
<P>
   A lot. If Warner gets pressure and has to give up the ball in
the flat, he has running back Marshall Faulk. Faulk led the team in
regular-season receptions with 87 for 1,048 yards. That total also
was the most by an NFL back. ``I'm used as a receiver as much as a
runner,'' Faulk said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said: ``The defense is well aware of what we have done,
and their main thing is to take away the long ball. ``I didn't know
if we'd get to this point,'' he said. ``I had my doubts. When
you're 4-12, 3-13, you don't see much light. But we've kind of just
been holding our serve.''

 &HT;    Old players didn't want helmets
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day back in 1912, the same year a touchdown was increased
from five points to six, somebody showed legendary football coach
Glenn ``Pop'' Warner the latest contraption.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether it was called a head harness or a helmet,
but this much is certain: Warner hated the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing without helmets gives players more confidence, saves
their heads from many hard jolts, and keeps their ears from
becoming torn or sore,'' he said. ``I do not encourage their use.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner believed that headgear gave players a sense of
invincibility that caused them leading with their heads while
tackling, increasing the risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was able to prevent the helmet from becoming standard,
but not so long ago it was in danger of going extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, at least 18 companies were manufacturing
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   But a rash of liability lawsuits in the 1970s and a paralyzing
injury to former Detroit Lion Mike Utley put the maker of his
helmet, ATI, out of business in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   By a few years ago, just two companies made NFL helmets _
Riddell, of Chicago, and Athletic Helmet Inc., a division of the
Schutt Sports Group, of Litchfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   No protective gear was enough in 1974 to prevent the Texas
Supreme Court from ordering Rawlings to pay $1.5 million in damages
to a former Texas high school player injured in practice while
wearing a Rawlings helmet.
</P>
<P>
   By 1979, at least 13 trials had involved helmet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, maker of the helmet that Hall of Fame quarterback
Terry Bradshaw wore while playing for the Steelers, and others,
including Wilson and Spalding, got out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Dick Kazmaier, who won the Heisman Trophy while playing
at Princeton in 1951, bought Bike from Colgate-Palmolive, but he
soon sold the helmet company to Schutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very economic business when you have to have 45
percent to potentially 85 percent of sales just to pay insurance
costs,'' Kazmaier said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If each (helmet manufacturer) lost a major product liability
in the same year, it come mean the end of helmet manufacturing. And
football,'' said Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt. ``We have to
stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, doctors became more willing to testify that helmets
were good at their designed purpose _ protecting skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Warning labels on helmets have for several years made it clear
that wearing one doesn't make a player immune from injury.
</P>
<P>
   Juries began taking a middle ground in cases against helmet
makers, less frequently finding for plaintiffs. Also, coaches have
done a better job at all levels of teaching players not to lead
with their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Bike Athletic Co., based in Stroudsburg, Pa., has gotten back
into the business with an ultra-light model worn by a handful of
NFL players, including Darren Woodson of the Cowboys and Trace
Armstrong of the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward comfort is likely to continue, as different
foams are tried inside shoulder pads, and the air bladders in
helmets are adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they're trying to make things lighter and more
comfortable,'' Falcons equipment manager Brian Boigne said.
``Ventilation is a big thing. Shoulder pads, you can almost say the
same thing.'' Helmets could change in the way the equipment works.
</P>
<P>
   Visors have become more common inside face masks, to prevent
finger pokes, and players have experimented with foam-rubber caps
on top of helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think that air-bag technology could make its way
into headgear, or even shoulder pads, and some have predicted that
helmets will one day fit into a housing on shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   `` Everything now is air-management,'' Boigner said. ``I feel
that it's like trying to re-invent the wheel, if you're trying to
change the look.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Pop think now?

 &HT;    Have players outgrown safety?
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be easy to assume that professional football is more
dangerous than ever. Just look at the NFL's list of devastating
injuries this season and couple it with what seems like an endless
list of smaller injuries every week.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the collisions get more violent as the size
of the players and the speed of the game increase.
</P>
<P>
   And the equipment that players wear isn't evolving as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the evidence does not support the notion that the
NFL has more injuries _ even if the players are much, much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bishop, the Falcons' team orthopedist, said the fuss
about bigger and faster players causing more injuries doesn't make
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the guys are bigger and faster, but they're all bigger
and faster,'' Bishop said. ``It's not just the guys hitting; the
guys getting hit are bigger and faster, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Chargers offensive tackle Ron Mix, a Hall of Famer who
weighed about 260 pounds when he played in the 1960s, can hardly
believe the size of the modern-day player. Just a handful of
offensive linemen weigh less than 300 pounds. Offensive tackles
average about 320.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen an evolution with such a gigantic leap in
the shape of a person?'' Mix asked an interview with the San Diego
Union-Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 20-year period, you just don't have that kind of
evolutionary leap, where suddenly the human race has gotten bigger.
Well, it hasn't. It is only a segment of the human race: the
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who doubt the effects of increased size and speed on
injury rates, face sizable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the list of big-name players who missed most of
the season: Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde, Falcons running back
Jamal Anderson, Broncos running back Terrell Davis, 49ers
quarterback Steve Young, Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin and
Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, Falcons and Broncos were three of the last four teams
left standing at the end of the 1998 season. None of them had
winning records in 1999, and they all had many more significant
injuries than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, on Sunday, the Tennessee Titans lost free safety
Marcus Robertson to a broken leg. Titans wide receiver Yancy
Thigpen is doubtful because of a fractured foot.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Falcons who had postseason surgery is impressive:
cornerback Ray Buchanan (debris/left shoulder); linebacker Henri
Crockett (debris/left knee); running back Gary Downs
(screw/surgically repaired right knee); defensive tackle Travis
Hall (debris/right shoulder); running back Byron Hanspard (debris,
scar tissue/surgically repaired left knee); tackle Jose Portilla
(debris/right shoulder); tackle Ephraim Salaam (torn
cartilage/right knee); linebacker Craig Sauer (debris/right knee)
and linebacker Jessie Tuggle (debris/left shoulder)
</P>
<P>
   ``Players are getting faster, stronger, bigger, so you're going
to get bigger collisions,'' said Steve Young, who suffered a
concussion early in the season. ``But I don't know that that's
going to correlate to significant changes in (the number of)
injuries.'' Other than concussions, protective football equipment
is not designed to prevent the types of injuries that sidelined
many of the big-name players.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Davis tore knee ligaments, Anderson without
contact. Testaverde tore an Achilles tendon without being hit.
Irvin suffered an injury to his spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for seven years, and I really don't think
(injuries have increased),'' Bishop said. ``I don't have numbers in
front of me, but . . . helmets and shoulder pads protect from
direct blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have nothing to do with quad pulls. Your knee injuries,
quad pulls, ankle turns and things like that have nothing to do
with protective equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that the game is getting more dangerous would
have a hard time debating a recent Los Angeles Times survey showing
that NFL players missed considerably less playing time this season
than last because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 season, 364 injured NFL players missed 1,061 games,
a decrease from 398 players sidelined for 1,340 games. In 1997, 335
players missed 937 games. Only in the last 20 years or so has the
NFL made it mandatory that teams keep up-to-the-day injury reports.
Part of the reason was to reduce the amount of ``inside
information'' that bettors could use to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole bunch of what's now classified as injuries
that we didn't worry about when I played (at SMU in the 1960s),''
Falcons general manager Harold Richardson said. ``If we pulled a
groin, heck, we kept playing. There's a lot more reporting of
injuries today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said, ``They didn't keep injury records back in the `50s,
so it's hard to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Players weren't necessarily tougher in the old days, despite
such defensive starts as Ray Nitschke and Dick Butkus.
</P>
<P>
   But today, doctors and trainers realize that injuries are more
likely to linger, and affect performance longer, if they're not
given time _ and treatment _ to heal.
</P>
<P>
   And protective equipment has done a pretty good job of keeping
pace with the increased size and speed of the game and its players.
</P>
<P>
   According to the L.A. Times survey, damage to knees, ankles,
hamstrings and shoulders have ranked as the four most common
injuries each season since 1997, with twice as many injuries to
knees as ankles.
</P>
<P>
   But Rams defensive tackle Ray Agnew, a 10-year veteran, says he
doesn't see a big difference in injury rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has always been violent,'' Agnew said. ``I don't see
much difference, at least nothing that you could base on science. I
don't think shoulder pads and helmets are lagging behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of concussions doubled this season, from five in both
1997 and 1998 to 11 in 1999. But it might not be the players or the
helmets that are responsible.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of concussions seem to result, not from
direct contact from one players equipment to another's helmet, but
from helmets pounding into artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial surfaces, especially the one in Veterans Stadium
where Irvin was injured, can be very hard.
</P>
<P>
   As for the knees and ankles, human joints haven't been evolving
with the size of the players' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Some training methods can strengthen the area around joints to
reduce the likelihood of injuries, but only to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and speed of players is definitely increasing, and
they're staying in shape year round, which helps that,'' said Fox
analyst Jackie Slater, who played tackle for the Rams 1976-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that works both ways,'' Slater said. ``The fact the
offseason workout programs are there means guys are better
conditioned to withstand many injuries.''

 &HT;    Titan's owner still walks tall in Texas
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yes, these are happy days for Tennessee Titans owner
Bud Adams. Heck, things are going so well, he hasn't moved his team
anywhere all week.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Bud Adams insists that the people of Houston do not
liken him to a cockroach for moving the Oilers to Tennessee,
slapping some almost-Columbia blue on their shoulders and calling
them the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   It probably is more wishful thinking by Adams than fact. But the
owner, whose non-football business remains based in Houston, says,
``I'm not afraid to walk around anywhere in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' transplanted team, which could never get past an AFC
title game in Houston, finally made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. When
the Oilers were a lame-duck franchise in Houston, after the
announcement of plans to leave for Tennessee, Astrodome crowds
steadily dwindled. Those were not days when Adams did a whole lot
of walking around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say this -- we had great support in Houston,'' Adams
said. ``I can't complain about the support we had in Houston. It
was a good football town, and I'd like to see them get a franchise
(which is happening in 2002). . . . I tried to get a new stadium
built down there. We just never could get it done. If I'd have
stayed, I think I'd still be working on getting a new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams rambled for 50 minutes Thursday at the news conference at
the Hyatt Regency. He was just in town from Houston and bundled up
in overcoat and scarf.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this excitement,'' he said, ``I must have picked up one of
those Houston viruses, and you know what that's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams noted that:
</P>
<P>
   _ He wants to sign head coach Jeff Fisherto a contract extension
as soon after the Super Bowl as possible. Fisher has a year left on
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have it right here, the new contract,'' Adams said,
kiddingly, reaching into his coat pocket. ``If I could just get him
to sign, I'd feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, Adams added, ``I don't think it's the proper
time to do it, when we're going down to the wire for the final
playoff game, but I don't want him to go into his last year without
a new contract.

   _ Although he referred to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones as
``a very smart guy who understands the game better than most owners
do,'' he was critical of the Cowboys' independent sponsorship
deals.

   ``I don't like the ambush marketing he's done,'' Adams said.

   _ After Adams sued the city of Houston and the Astrodome and
eventually was given the right to move, he called the mayor of
Nashville, Phil Bredesen, and said, ``I'm Bud Adams, the owner of
the Houston Oilers, and I'll move my team down there if you'll
build a stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the mayor replied, ``This isn't Bud Adams, and I'd
appreciate it if you wouldn't pull these pranks on me,'' and hung
up on him.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Mayor Bredesen called back 30 minutes later,
apologized and said, ``Yes, we are interested in talking to you.''

 &HT;    Snow place like here for chaos on thin ice
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look, we're sorry. You think we planned this? We hate
winter. Absence of winter is why we all moved here. First thing we
imports do when we cross the state line is throw away our ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody got an extra ice scraper?
</P>
<P>
   Look, we're sorry. Ordinarily we get one dusting every three
years, and we freak out then. Now we're about to get two wintry
mixes in a week, which means we've all turned into bigger freaks
than Jevon Kearse. Four inches of snow? Better cancel the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   We're buying enough supplies to last through Y3K. On Wednesday
night, one of our weather guys said to prepare for four days
inside. Four days? We can't do four minutes. We're outdoor people,
if you count being gridlocked inside an SUV on the Downtown
Connector as being outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you're not happy because you brought your golf clubs and
are using your 9-iron as a clothes hanger. Think we're happy? At
least you tourists are in your nice downtown hotels equipped with
coffee shops and backup generators. We're in our hilly subdivisions
with the trees just waiting to fall over the driveways and the
power waiting to cut off. We wish this wasn't happening Super Bowl
week. We wish this wouldn't happen any week.
</P>
<P>
   You're downtown. Worst case scenario, you can slog to the Dome.
We have to drive. Only we can't drive in snow. We can't drive in
rain. We can't drive, period. Our idea of winter automotive safety
is to slow down to 95 on the Perimeter and maybe close the sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   We're hopeless. All of us who came from up North and who knew
how to drive when it's slippery have forgotten. We left the
steer-in-the-direction-of-the-skid lesson at the border along with
the ice scraper. Put cinder blocks in the trunk? There's no room.
The tennis rackets and water skis take up all the space.
</P>
<P>
   Look, we're sorry. We know we're getting hammered in the
national media for the crummy weather, and we're hypersensitive
about what the national media thinks. Tom Wolfe wrote a sneering
book about Atlanta, and we all spent six months in group therapy to
restore our self-esteem. Just when we thought we were feeling
better, along comes John Rocker. Now this. It's enough to make us
cast envious glances at Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Look, we're sorry. You think we planned this?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we did.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that this week's weather will doom our chances to
stage another Super Bowl. We don't care. Super Bowls are $100
million a dozen. Our eyes are on a bigger prize. Remember how we
got ripped worldwide for the way we handled our Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   We want to try again.
</P>
<P>
   We want the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   This week is our audition. We didn't advertise it, but we've
been scheming all along. See the facilities already in place? Stone
Mountain can be our ski jump. Spaghetti Junction looks like a
bobsled run. Lake Lanier makes for a lovely skating rink. We hope
our good pals in the IOC will be duly impressed and grant us a
Winter Olympiad. And we hope they won't take it the wrong way when
we start firing snowballs at the most exceptional Mr. Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as we've come to think of him, ol' Frosty.

 &HT;    Taking a job in Houston, the former High Museum director says
companies must boost bucks for Atlanta to keep pace
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ned Rifkin says he wasn't job hunting when Houston's
Menil Collection and Foundation came calling. In fact, the recently
divorced director of the High Museum of Art had just bought a house
not far from the home of his ex-wife and 17-year-old son, Amos. (An
older son, Moses, is off at Brown University.)
</P>
<P>
   But Rifkin, a curator at heart, couldn't pass up the offer to
run one of America's most extraordinary private collections,
located in what he calls a ``magical, unique'' setting, a placid
artistic enclave known, apart from its collection, for its
buildings designed by Renzo Piano and Philip Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin, 50, left the High on Dec. 31. A ``For Sale'' sign sits
on his front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house one recent morning, sitting beneath a
contemplative photograph of John Lennon and George Harrison taken
during the Beatles' Hamburg days, Rifkin talked about the Atlanta
arts scene, his days at the High and the city's potential,
specifically when it comes to arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy is worth highlighting. During the 1990s, museum
membership rose from 13,500 to 40,000. Since arriving in 1991, his
tenure has included the Olympic ``Rings'' show and blockbuster
exhibits of impressionism, Matisse, Picasso and Norman Rockwell. He
was integral in getting Piano involved in designing an expansion
for the museum, which evolved into the Italian architect being
recruited to design a master plan for the Woodruff Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   But a litany of his achievements, he stressed, wasn't the point
of this meeting. Speaking out was.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What did you want to say about the arts and the city before
leaving town?
</P>
<P>
   A: I felt that I had an obligation to my peers, friends and
leaders of other cultural institutions to send a message to the
larger community about what it's going to take to really bring
Atlanta to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's it going to take?
</P>
<P>
   A: Atlanta needs to raise the bar in corporate giving. That is
what separates the great cultural cities from the next level down.
You look at Chicago, some company like Sara Lee, and they're not
shy of giving a million dollars in support of a major impressionist
show at the Art Institute. In most major cities, with a major
exhibition that costs millions of dollars to present, there is a
sponsorship level of $1 million or more. I am concerned that the
level of corporate giving within Atlanta is considerably lower than
comparable sponsorships in Chicago, New York, L.A. and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What was fund-raising like here?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm not saying we weren't successful. I'd say relative to
where we started, the fund-raising really took off. But it is the
corporate community that needs to reinvest much of their resources
back into the cultural community for this to happen. If Atlanta is
going to take off and go to the next level, those enlightened
leaders of businesses are going to have to double and triple their
efforts to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give an example of Atlanta businesses not stepping
up?
</P>
<P>
   A: When we had this Picasso show a couple years ago, we had 13
sponsors and thanked them all. The minimum gift was $50,000, I
believe. I seem to recall that the largest was $150,000. To get to
the needed $1.5 million that we had budgeted, it meant that we had
to work extremely hard to identify these 13 sponsors. But there
should have been somebody, one corporate community leader, who
said, ``This is mine. I want this. And I'm going to give a million
dollars, and you raise the other half-million.'' That's what I'm
talking about. It may sound like sour grapes, but the truth is,
somebody has got to say it when the emperor's only half-clad.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you asked for larger donations, what was the reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, actually, in the case of one major, major corporation,
I got no response. I never even was told ``no.'' And that's the
level at which the dialogues ... exist or don't exist. There is a
sense (in the corporate world) that these (arts) organizations are
sort of needy and always asking for money. ``Why are they always
asking?'' Well, we're always asking because we're always providing.
It's not like we're pests. In fact, what we are is providers. And
we're nurturers. And we're offering wonderfully rich, powerfully
compelling experiences of art in all forms. And I say art, and I
include the zoo and the botanical garden. These aren't add-ons;
these are essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about individual giving?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have something at the museum we started in 1991 called the
Director's Circle, the people at the highest level of annual
individual giving. When I got here, before that was created, there
were eight people, I believe, giving $5,000 a year, which is a
substantial amount of money _ I'm not in any way trying to
castigate them for giving that much. But they weren't asked for
more. We ratcheted it up to ask for $10,000 a year. We now have
over 100 members of the Director's Circle, some of them giving
$40,000 to $50,000 a year annually. That's a major gift. And that,
to me, is
</P>
<P>
   paradigmatic of the individual support that does exist in this
community for things that are exciting and enlivening and vital in
terms of our culture, at least in terms of visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the financial status of the High now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know that the museum is in a substantially better position
than it was when I arrived on Aug. 1, 1991. It does have hopes and
aspirations to expand. I believe that the challenge before the
museum will be not just individual support, but also how and when
the corporations understand that this is also going to accrue to
the entire community, to have more than twice as large an
institution that can service many more people comfortably in a
building that is going to be designed for that purpose. We now
bring hundreds of thousands of people to the fourth floor in an
elevator designed to carry, I believe, 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would you call the high points of your tenure here?
</P>
<P>
   A: There have been many. Certainly ``Rings'' (the Cultural
Olympiad exhibit that brought in masterworks from around the
world). That experience stays with me. Seeing non-art lovers come
to the museum and be visibly moved to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Low points?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first two years were really challenging and difficult.
Feeling the burden of responsibility of an institution that had
acquired significant debt. It was daunting, really daunting. Having
to fire people. Letting people go is a very grown-up thing you're
not trained for in art history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the structure of the Woodruff Arts
Center and its four divisions (the High, the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra, the Alliance Theatre, the Atlanta College of Art)?
</P>
<P>
   A: There have been times when the partnership has been
extraordinarily right in terms of spirit, and times when it
misfunctioned. I don't think any of the business people sitting on
the (Woodruff) board would want to run their businesses the way
they were run when they were originally founded. To revisit the
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff's governance periodically and look at internal
operations on a regular basis is just good business. And that's
consistent with things I've said to them as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would some Woodruff divisions be better off not being part of
the center?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think a study would have to be done. Certain divisions
could manage independently, others could not. But only if the
Woodruff Foundation would support them to some degree. That's a
tremendous reserve of wealth, and without its direct support, it
would be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you feel about the cultural tourism initiative
sponsored by the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been very effective for the museum. The smaller
organizations probably feel they don't get out of it what they
need. They're trying to create a cultural consciousness in a
regional way, to get people to come to Atlanta. Art exhibits are
uniquely qualified to do that, more so than a concert. The pandas
(at Zoo Atlanta) are something comparable. But museums have proven
it can happen. And that's a second good reason for corporations to
make an investment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you feel about your new home, Houston?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a major cultural center. It's got a great opera. Great
ballet. It's a thriving, culturally ambitious city.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will you miss about Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: The people, friends, the kindness. There's a benevolence in
Atlanta that's foreign to a lot of cities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you'll still be working with the High on the Elton John
photo show this fall. Talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm curating the show, and I'll be here for the festivities.
It's a real pleasure; my background is curatorial, and it will be
nice to exit the High as a curator. The show will be a real
revelation to people. This is a very thoughtful and very important
collection of photography that very few people have ever seen. It's
going to keep me connected to the High in a way that's poignant and
meaningful to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think when you hear Atlanta call itself an
``international city''?
</P>
<P>
   A: This moniker is one of those buzzy concepts that sounds more
meaningful than it might truly be. Atlanta has enormous ambitions,
and I say that's great. The problems set in when people become
satisfied with the language and the concepts but perhaps do not
even know what the reality looks like. Paris is an international
city. New York is the most international of all American cities.
(Atlanta) will become one only when its art and cultural life
approaches that of these cities. While it is unlikely this will
occur during our lifetimes, it is imaginable that Atlanta will be
taken more seriously over the years ahead by the international
cultural community if, and only if, it is able to sustain the
growth and development of its cultural resources. In my opinion,
this will only happen with powerful and enlightened leadership in
the corporate sector.

possible side effects since she was first diagnosed with cancer 17

some things you don't always hear about: Getting fired. Call them
the unwritten side effects, the collateral damage of serious
illness that no one mentions _ friends who disappear because your
mortality reminds them of their own. Jobs that vanish without

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big. The sheer size of the latest Imax
offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience. Otherwise,
this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest state is
just one of those languid Discovery Channel-style nature flicks.
The film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about
Alaskan life. (Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   A finely made adaptation of Frank McCourt's popular memoir of
growing up in poverty and death in Ireland that's almost too
stately for its own good. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their
favorite parts re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the
memory of McCourt's lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might
wonder what the fuss is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness. (SM) 2 hours, 20
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
``Man'' moves swiftly for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down
to become a disappointingly conventional love story that isn't
really persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse.
(SM) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradle Will Rock'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria, Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Ruben Blades.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't. Tim Robbins' ambitious and energetic ensemble movie
is, on the whole, overdone, over-cluttered and overly didactic. The
movie presents the collision of art and politics in '30s New York,
especially as it applied to a famous to-hell-with-the-censors
staging of Marc Blitzstein's pro-labor musical, ``The Cradle Will
Rock.'' For all its ambition and good intentions, this is more a
rant than a movie. (ERG)2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
Considering the difficulty of conveying religious faith in film,
he's surprisingly successful in depicting both kinds of passion.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM) 1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' R (language, sex, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What begins
as a hypnotic riff on the old surveillance classic, ``The
Conversation,'' ultimately veers off into nowhere. Too bad because
the picture is as stylishly acted as it is directed. An isolated
British surveillance agent (Ewan McGregor) becomes more involved
than he intends in the case of a diplomat's son and a mysterious
femme fatale (Ashley Judd). (ERG) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and content relating
</P>
<P>
   to drugs, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent in the '60s at a
mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent
of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' As Susanna, Winona Ryder
steadies the movie and gives it its emotional center, but Angelina
Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath. (ERG)2
hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Grizzly Falls'' PG (wilderness adventure
</P>
<P>
   violence and some mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bryan Brown,
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Clark, Tom Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harry (Richard Harris) scares his grandkids with a campfire
tale of a hungry bear, but makes amends by telling them a
remarkable adventure he had at their age and that's the start of
``Grizzly Falls.'' It's a sweet, but action-packed tale about a
boy, a bear, and the bond between parent and child _ even if not of
the same species. ``Grizzly Falls'' becomes a message on the value
of family bonds that comes through without the sort of sentimental
overstatement that mars many family films. (SM)1 hour, 34 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington delivers his best performance in years as
pugilist Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender
wrongly imprisoned for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though
ably directed, the film contains some fabrications _ and invents
one key character, a Javert-like detective _ to tell this otherwise
compelling true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' R (language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane and Stockard Channing.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't great. Or even good. Bette Midler plays ``Valley of the
Dolls'' author Jacqueline Susann, but the movie is neither
biography nor burlesque. It can't decide if its main character is
great, or a gargoyle. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 35 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Robards Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families, love and
forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with small
miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of movie you
live through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. Among
the stellar acting talents: Tom Cruise, Jason Robards Jr. and
Julianne Moore. (SM) 2 hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM)1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yacking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' R (violence, sexuality, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas,
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson
</P>
<P>
   and Lolita Davidovich.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining take on boxing. Antonio Banderas' Cesar, a
Madrid-born boxer, now lives in Los Angeles and has become best
pals with Woody Harrelson's Vince, a Texas-born fighter. The first
half of the film is a road movie, with Grace (Lolita Davidovich),
Vince's former girlfriend and Cesar's current lady, driving them to
Las Vegas; it soon becomes a love story. (Kevin Thomas, From Los
Angeles Times.) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' PG-13 (profanity, disturbing images,
</P>
<P>
   sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,Youki Kudoh
</P>
<P>
   and Max von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty but chilly. Based on the best seller, Ethan Hawke plays a
newspaperman looking into slaying charges against a
Japanese-American. The case rekindles memories of internment during
World War II and Hawke's youthful romance with the suspect's wife.
Beautifully photographed to mask its thin plot, ``Cedars''
generates little passion and, frankly, is flatline drama. (SM)2
hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG)1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' R (for a scene of risque nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas
to enjoy ``Topsy-Turvy.'' But a love of the theater can help you
appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century. The ensemble is superb, but it's
Jim Broadbent who turns in a monumental performance as the pompous
William Gilbert. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 39 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of Tom Hanks,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A

 &HT;    `Starting all over again': It's smooth sailing for TLC as often
stormy trio rolls in for hometown tour stop
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand.
</P>
<P>
   Left-Eye means every word she's been screeching.
</P>
<P>
   She still insists that she's the creative force in TLC, the
best-selling female group of any genre in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge still stands for fellow members Tionne ``T-Boz''
Watkins and Rozonda ``Chilli'' Thomas to record solo albums and let
sales determine who has the most talent.
</P>
<P>
   And Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes only has exclamation points to add
to the statement she made last February when the Atlanta pop trio's
``Fanmail'' album was released: ``I'm not really feeling TLC.''
</P>
<P>
   But things, they all say, are better between them.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta gets to bask in this rare moment, as TLC, that spiciest
of girl groups, brings its ``Fanmail'' tour to Philips Arena on
Saturday, after 30 dates on the road. Despite the ebb and flow of
its troubles, TLC's touch is still undeniable. As the three
approach this concert, everyone is talking about their past, their
future and their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a group like TLC, who has broken records saleswise
_ had insurmountable sales in fact _ but you don't simply see a
female singing group,'' says Asondra Hunter, the new editor in
chief of Honey, a burgeoning women's lifestyle magazine. ``What you
have is a group that young white girls in the suburbs want to be.
There's the black girls in the city who are TLC. They just don't
know how to sing. And then you have the guys who want to date girls
like TLC.''
</P>
<P>
   Then and now
</P>
<P>
   Quoting inspirational author Iyanla Vanzant and responding
playfully to inquiries about the status of the group, as if asked
in a foreign language _ ``Huh? Us, mad? _ TLC is the oft-changing
face of harmony. It's almost as if this is 1992, when the threesome
released its multimillion-selling debut, ``Ooooooohhh ... On the
TLC Tip,'' and the most talked-about thing they did was wear
condoms on their clothing to promote safe sex. No chatter about
discord then.
</P>
<P>
   But the calendar says 2000, and we're backstage at the Rose
Garden in Portland, Ore., where Lopes is rushing her assistants to
complete her elongated hair and magazine cover makeup so she can do
a photo op with Mayor Vera Katz. Quite a change from the start of
the ``Fanmail'' tour in October, when Lopes not only refused to do
meet-and-greets, but spoke to no one as she moved from dressing
room to stage in the midst of an entourage.
</P>
<P>
   This second leg of this national tour has done much better
saleswise than the first. In October and November, stops in markets
as small as Dayton, Ohio, and Greenville, S.C., drew crowds that
filled only half to 75 percent of the venues. But with a new
opening lineup and new promotional help _ from MTV, cosmetics
retailer Sephora and TLC's Atlanta-based record company, LaFace
Records, the tour has come close to, if not selling out, recent
dates in Oakland, Calif., Seattle and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to seven Grammy nominations this month _ including
record, song and album of the year _ and Lopes says, ``It feels
like a renewal right now. Like we're starting all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it was only a month ago that rumormongers were
whispering that this, TLC's first headlining tour, could be its
last. The group's record is spotty. It took TLC five years to get
back into the studio to record ``Fanmail,'' a span that included
one $1.3 million house burning down (Left-Eye was convicted of
arson), one life-threatening bout with sickle cell anemia (T-Boz),
one baby boy (Chilli) and one bankruptcy filing (all three).
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 29, was wondering aloud recently about how much more
the group could take: ``TLC is like the never-ending soap opera,''
she sighed during the December press storm that Lopes helped kick
up in the magazines Entertainment Weekly and Sister 2 Sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want it to end,'' she says. ``But everything you
read, everything you hear, even some of the things you feel deep
down make it seem like it's headed off the cliff. At full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   But they finished the first leg of the ``Fanmail'' tour by
Thanksgiving. Watkins, who toured against doctors' advice, took
time to recuperate in her Dunwoody home. Thomas, 28, took to her
Stone Mountain kitchen, where she baked sweet potato pies with son
Tron, 2. And Lopes, 28, who also lives in Stone Mountain, took off
to the Honduras, a favorite getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we got back (Jan. 3), everybody was past all of
the headlines and `TLC Breaking Up' and all that we were venting
back then,'' Lopes says. ``We're looking forward.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means though, depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   The future
</P>
<P>
   The group's focus isn't on a follow-up to ``Fanmail.'' Or on any
post-tour activities as TLC. Lopes has her sights on a solo
project, a casual clothing line due in stores this August, and
television, where she debuted in fall 1998 as a host on the MTV
talent show ``The Cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, appearing in print ads for leather goods retailer Coach,
continues to receive movie scripts. She's looking for one she can
be funny in. ``Let me act a fool!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And Watkins is working on a script that she and TLC producer
Dallas Austin have come up with about the group's start in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``TLC is already like the best movie, because they always have
drama,'' offers Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid, LaFace co-president. (TLC
still has a contract for three more albums with the label.)
</P>
<P>
   Says Thomas: ``Even with all the drama we as a group and
individuals go through, we know that when we get together _ no
matter how long we are apart _ magic happens.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why many in and around the music industry believe TLC
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   TLC appeal
</P>
<P>
   TLC has exemplified ``girl power'' before, during and after the
Spice Girls reign, says multi-million-selling teen vocalist
Christina Aguilera (``Genie in a Bottle''), an opening act on this
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal is in the marketing and the imaging,'' adds Honey
magazine's Hunter. ``They are very cutting edge. You see them at
award shows and people look to see what they have on, and are like:
`I want to wear that outfit. I want to wear my hair that way.' And
it's not necessarily mimicking, it's just taking ideas. Feeling
inspired to express your own individuality. The singing and
production are there, but that's almost like a given when you've
got Babyface and Dallas Austin with you on every album.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, we love TLC because we always love someone we
can live life wildly and vicariously through, be it the growth and
changes T-Boz wrote about in her book (``Thoughts''). Left-Eye
conquering substance abuse. Or Chilli raising a child as a single
parent. They've overcome a lot of things in their lives and that
strength is very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayla Charping, a Greenville 12-year-old, doesn't articulate
TLC's appeal quite that way. But as she walks to the seat of her
first concert ever, she knows exactly what she likes about them.
``They look cool, they sing cool, and I think they'd be cool to be
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beyond every girl group that comes out every day,''
offered David Roncinski, 22, on his feet for most of the show.
``You know them and their music. And I like them. I hope they never
stop doing what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no chance of that, right, Lisa?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, things are cool,'' Lopes says with a suspicious giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Um, Lisa?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep the suspense,'' she says, smirking. ``We need
that kind of attention. Even though the fire was a terrible thing,
we needed that. That helped us sell a couple of million records.
And that's good. We like the hype that controversy and drama
generate.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Don't misunderstand this moment of calm as
anything other than a moment.
</P>

BUSH ALREADY LOOKING TO ARIZONA, MICHIGAN, SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Governor George W. Bush still vows that he will
win the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night. But as the contest
draws closer, and as polls show him trailing Senator John S.
McCain, it sometimes seems like Bush's mind is already someplace
else.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the comfort of $74 million in campaign funds, Bush is
running TV ads in South Carolina. He has a bustling campaign office
in Arizona. He has a trip to Michigan planned for next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He even has a ready answer for what he would do if he lost the
first primary in the nation. ``Go to Delaware,'' Bush said in an
interview Thursday, without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Bush is running a campaign that hopes for the best in
New Hampshire but does not depend on it, one that allows him to
shrug off the daily questions about whether he is troubled by the
polls. Having spread its reach across the country over the last 14
months, the Bush campaign is already looking ahead not only to
other primaries but to the final election in November. In his
public appearances, the Texas Governor often bypasses McCain to
directly attack the potential Democratic candidate, Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is careful not to sound presumptuous about winning the
nomination, refusing to discuss the topic of a runningmate. He
often ends his speeches with a caveat about his winning the White
House, saying it will happen only if he is ``fortunate to earn the
respect and trust of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   And he remains adamant about his focus on the New Hampshire
race. ``I hope people don't think I'm taking anything for
granted,'' Bush said. ``I'm certainly working. I recognize I'm in a
tough race.''
</P>
<P>
   But at an organizational level, Bush has steeled himself for a
New Hampshire race that is not only tough but may well wind up an
early defeat. He is already gearing up to fly to South Carolina the
day after the New Hampshire primary, to a state where he has spent
months campaigning. Bush has at least 13 campaign offices
nationwide. He has TV ads running in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to compete in every state,'' Bush said. ``I've got
great organizations laid out in states down the road. We're working
hard in Delaware and South Carolina, Virginia and Michigan,
California. . .On March the 14th, Texas and Florida loom out there.
I'm in pretty good shape in those huge electoral states. This is a
marathon as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not in marathon shape at the moment, as he contends with
a slight cold and a sudden spike the number of his daily campaign
activities. During an interview Thursday, held on his bus trip
between the Sanders Lockheed Martin company and the Fairgrounds
Elementary School in Nashua, he seemed distracted. During his
speeches, Bush frequently tells supporters how much he misses home.
</P>
<P>
   But he appears fully relaxed about the outcome Tuesday. When
asked what he thought he was doing wrong in New Hampshire, Bush
joked, ``You mean, what are the pollsters doing wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer stopped short of dismissing the
importance of the New Hampshire primary. But he did say Bush had
``done something unprecedented in primary politics, in that he has
built a national organization that gives him a tremendous advantage
and head start in helping Republicans take back the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' he said. ``Senator McCain must win
New Hampshire. If he doesn't, it's hard to see how he can go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took on McCain Thursday, again challenging his tax cut
proposal and taking advantage of a comment the Arizona senator made
during Wednesday's GOP debate linking his tax plan to President
Clinton. Bush said that ``one of the telling moments from the
debate last night is when John said his tax plan is like Clinton's
tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to nominate somebody who will debate the
Democrat on key issues, not mimic them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush went after Gore, too. Responding to a question about
whether the Vice President appeared to be cozying up to President
Clinton after months of distancing himself, Bush said Gore might be
sending ``confusing signals'' to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush also received the endorsement of former Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp, as well as that of Nashua Mayor Bernard A.
Streeter.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp tried to make his position clear. ``I am not here against
John McCain, and I am certainly not here against Steve Forbes, who
is a good friend and who I think would make a great secretary of
the treasury. I would make a great chairman of the Fed,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, hinting at a future ambassadorship for Kemp, replied
wryly: ``Have you ever heard of Chad?''

 &HT;    TLC: The highs and lows
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  1991: TLC is formed when R&AMP;B recording artist Pebbles
(``Mercedes Boy'') puts her backup dancer, Rozonda ``Chilli''
Thomas, together with Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins and Lisa
``Left-Eye'' Lopes. Watkins and Lopes were already in a trio called
Second Nature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1992: ``Ooooooohhh ... On the TLC Tip'' is released with the
hits ``Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg'' and ``Baby, Baby, Baby,'' eventually
selling more than 4 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  June 9, 1994: After a fight between Lopes and former Atlanta
Falcon Andre Rison, Lopes places sneakers in a bathtub and sets
fire to them, burning down the $1.3 million Alpharetta, Ga., home
the couple shared. She later pleaded guilty to one count of
first-degree arson, and was ordered to spend several months in a
halfway house, pay a $10,000 fine and complete counseling for
alcoholism and battered women. She was also given five years'
probation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 1994: ``CrazySexyCool'' is released with Atlanta
producers Dallas Austin (``Creep'') and Jermaine Dupri (``Kick Your
Game'') recording with the group again. But its biggest single,
``Waterfalls,'' is from new Atlanta producers Organized Noize. The
album goes on to sell more than 11 million copies, making TLC the
best-selling female group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  July 1995: TLC files for bankruptcy protection citing $1
million in assets and $3.5 million in debts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 1996: TLC settles with its creditors in an agreement
approved by a bankruptcy judge. A confidentiality clause bars the
parties from disclosing the financial details, but TLC signs a new
contract with Atlanta-based LaFace Records. Former manager and
producer Pebbles, who owns the TLC name, is paid more than $1
million, she says. Lopes agrees to pay $527,000 to Lloyd's of
London, which insured the house she admitted torching.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  February 1999: ``Fanmail'' is released and debuts at the top
of Billboard's pop and R&AMP;B charts with help from its first single,
``No Scrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oct. 22, 1999: TLC starts its first tour as headliners in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 1999: The Recording Industry Association of America
names ``CrazySexyCool'' the best-selling hip-hop album of the 20th
century, though, strangely enough, none of the songs is composed
mostly of rap.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jan. 4, 2000: The two-time Grammy winners receive seven 1999
Grammy nominations _ record of the year and R&AMP;B performance by a
duo/group with vocal for ``No Scrubs''; album of the year and R&AMP;B
album for ``Fanmail''; song of the year, pop performance by
duo/group with vocals and short form music video for ``Unpretty.''

 &HT;    What the critics are saying
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although TLC isn't even a decade old and has put out only three
albums, its 90-minute ``Fanmail'' concert feels like a
greatest-hits show. Here's what reviewers across the country are
saying:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The high point: Chilli, mother of a 2-year-old, has a
chiseled body and sincere smile. Most pathetic moment: Left-Eye,
whom the audience adored, dropping the balls she was juggling.''
</P>
<P>
   _Toronto Star, in October
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Strutting and singing their way through a truckload of hits
in front of a backdrop straight out of a cyber-fantasy, they
displayed versatility, edginess and theatrical flair that the
average female group can't touch.''
</P>
<P>
   _USA Today, in November
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A thoroughly 21st-century pop concert, with all the
razzle-dazzle and sense of fun you'd expect from a group whose
kinetic videos are as memorable as its records.''
</P>
<P>
   _Los Angeles Times, Jan. 10
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Onstage TLC was revealed as a studio concoction; it makes
Janet Jackson sound like a coloratura.''

 &HT;    Deep South in a deep freeze
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When stores run out of canned meat, zoo animals get blankets and
people snow ski on beaches, you know the Deep South is in a Deep
Freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The South's second winter storm in less than a week blew through
northern parts of Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and western
Tennessee Thursday with a mix of snow, ice and sleet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, forecasters predict, the snow and ice will glaze more of
the South from Birmingham to metro Atlanta as the system barrels
east. Thousands in Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina face the
fresh front still without power, knocked out by snow and ice
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of the Mississippi Delta, Greenville accumulated a
half foot of snow by Thursday evening. New Mississippi Gov. Ronnie
Musgrove placed the National Guard on alert. The Legislature shut
down for a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any measurable snow in the last four or five
years,'' said Capt. Doyle Barrett of the Washington County
Sheriff's Department near Greenville. ``We're working one wreck
behind the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A disheveled Dixie bundled up for this latest blast.
</P>
<P>
   For two days at Lucky's Supermarket on Sand Mountain in
northeastern Alabama, Vienna sausage sales have nearly doubled,
said grocer Diaz Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenient. You can pop it open and you don't even have
to heat it,'' Frost said during in a telephone interview Thursday.
Among other nicknames, locals have called the 50-year-old
storeowner ``Defrost.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running to the Bi-Lo, Food World or Winn Dixie, loyal
customers have come to Diaz's 12,000-square-foot store in Henagar
and bought up his ration of lamp oil and bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll worry about myself after I've taken care of everybody
else,'' said Frost, who woke up Thursday with no water at his
house.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm grips Alabama, officials estimate as many as
2,000 people near Sand Mountain who lost electricity in weekend ice
storms still may be without power. Weather forecasters warn that
severe icing could kill electricity in Montgomery and Auburn and
turn roads into bobsled runs.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman authorized state offices to close
today if roadways are too hazardous. ``We could be downright
paralyzed,'' said Brian Peters, who coordinates weather service
warnings in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The same storm system that dropped more than 9 inches of snow in
Oklahoma and Texas Thursday could coat Birmingham with up to 6
inches of snow today. Trucks in Birmingham are loaded with 400 tons
of sand. They're ready to de-ice slickened roads such as
``malfunction-junction,'' the I-20 ramp near the
Birmingham-Jefferson County Civic Center and the Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Orangutans Oliver and Chelli _ among the 800 animals at the
Birmingham zoo _ broke in blue blankets donated to them Thursday.
``This is the first time we've done it, so they're dragging them
around,'' said zoo marketer Patty Pendleton. The zoo made sure heat
lamps and heating pads for their tortoises were working.
</P>
<P>
   To the probable delight of University of Alabama sports fans,
seven zoo alligators swam under the iced-over tops of their zoo
pond. ``They come up every now and again and poke their heads
through,'' Pendleton said. The gator habitat is sponsored by a
local University of Florida booster club.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in South Carolina, temperatures reached just into the
upper 30s at Myrtle Beach. By this evening, a mix of frozen
precipitation may hit the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The beach had 4 inches of snow on Tuesday. Cross-country snow
skiers swooshed across places normally populated by snowbirds
craving Southern sunshine. Snowmen popped up everywhere, and a
local television station aired the best ones on its nightly
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unique,'' Sunset Inn owner James Dean _ and
former Pittsburgh resident _ said by telephone Thursday. ``At
first, it was real nostalgic. After three hours, we were tired of
it.'' The former accountant moved to Myrtle Beach 10 years ago to
escape cold, miserable business trips from Pittsburgh to
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Raleigh-Durham International Airport opened
its longest runway at 4 p.m. Thursday. The first plane to depart
was an Atlanta-bound AirTran 717 that became airborne at 4:06 p.m.
Delta and U.S. Airways also began flying Thursday. Thousands of
travelers have been stranded at the airport since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After clearing 20.3 inches of snow _ the most from a single
storm since 1927 _ Raleigh airport crews Thursday discovered a
3-inch layer of ice, which took all day to scrape off with heavy
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But with just one runway open, today ``will be sporadic at
best,'' airport spokesman Mike Blanton said. Midway, which holds
nearly one-quarter of Raleigh-Durham's air market, plans to restart
its operations there today. American Airlines, however, hampered by
snowstorms in Dallas, has canceled flights to and from Raleigh
today, Blanton said. The prospect of ice and sleet this weekend
will more than frost the spirit of passengers and airport
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Not many trees are left standing in Erect, one of several rural
communities in central North Carolina covered by record snowfalls
of nearly 2 feet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Snow collapsed the roof of Lynn Deaton's chicken house. The cold
froze Bill Caviness's tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everybody has had enough,'' June Cox, 78, said Thursday.
He reached back to 1927, when he was 6, to remember snow as deep as
this week's surprise blizzard. He measured 14 inches in the yard of
his Erect home_10 inches less than surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   In Asheboro, the American Red Cross set up an emergency shelter
in First Baptist Church. Wednesday night, 13 people sought safety
from the cold. Pastor John Rogers said the shelter would remain
open through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Bowman, a 36-year-old shelter resident, woke up Tuesday
morning at home ``so cold I like to froze.''
</P>
<P>
   He called 911, and a sheriff's deputy transported him to First
Baptist Church, where he keeps track of forecasts for more snow on
a TV in the dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it turns and goes away,'' Bowman said. ``I've had
enough winter and enough snow.''

NOW WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's done. So now what?
</P>
<P>
   That is what Robert Redford once had to ask himself in the
movies when he was unexpectedly transformed from The Candidate to
The Senator and had no idea what to do once the election was over
and it was time to stop running and start doing the job he'd been
hired for.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bill Belichick finds himself in the same position, and so
does Bob Kraft. They made the deal. They gave up the No. 1 pick
Kraft said he never would surrender to the hated Jets and the
fourth- and seventh-round choices in 2001 in exchange for a
face-saving fifth in 2001 and seventh in 2002 that will be heading
up the New Jersey Turnpike to New England, probably to no good end.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft paid the ransom you knew he would and got what he wanted
all along, despite running that dog and pony show of interviewing
non-candidates for jobs that were already filled. Got what he
wanted, so now what do they do?
</P>
<P>
   For Kraft, the job is simpler than it is for Belichick. He sits
and waits. He watches. He puts on a prayer shawl and hits his knees
from time to time. He does all he can to help Bill Belichick
succeed, but he thought he was doing the same thing for Pete
Carroll and failed miserably in almost every way possible, turning
an above-average team into a mediocre one with thin talent because
of three years of stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   Now Belichick must cope with the mess Kraft, Carroll, and Bobby
Grier created. He must come in and transform a team of
underachievers who think they are more talented than they are into
something bigger than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He must come into a team that has had two straight lousy drafts,
now has no No. 1 pick this year, is $10 million over the salary cap
with nearly a half-dozen starting players eligible for free agency
next month, and rebuild it while competing against the Colts,
Dolphins, Bills, and most of all the Jets without sliding backward
even for a year.
</P>
<P>
   How Belichick will do this is his problem, and so is how well he
handles the pressures that will mount from it because when your new
employer pays a ransom to free you _ as the Jets did four years ago
to extricate Bill Parcells from a Patriots contract _ there is no
grace period. There is no slow improvement from, say, 1-15 to 7-9
to 12-4 as there was for Parcells in both Foxborough and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Belichick, there must be rebuilding without losing.
There must be winning now, winning in a difficult circumstance
because for that to happen he has to transform a moribund offense
soon to be under the leadership of Charlie Weis and alter an
attitude that allows someone such as Shawn Jefferson to guarantee a
division title if Belichick arrived when he would have been wiser
to have just worried about winning a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final half of the year, that was the Patriots' problem.
Not winning division titles. Winning a game. Winning two games in a
row was impossible in the final two months under Carroll. The fact
that Jefferson could so assuredly promise a division title if
Belichick was hired was not an endorsement of his coaching
abilities, it was symptomatic of the skewered expectations he
faces.
</P>
<P>
   They do not know who they are in New England any more. They
haven't known since Bill Parcells left. Somebody has to teach them
that before anything else will change. That job will fall to
Belichick and it will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Parcells's evil twin, his young offspring, his alter ego,
has come to try and teach them who they are. If he is to be
successful, the first thing Belichick has to make clear to
Jefferson and Kraft and everyone else in New England is that what
he learned from Parcells years ago still holds true.
</P>
<P>
   You are what you are, Parcells always cautioned. If you're 8-8
and out of the playoffs and on a three-year skid, hiring Belichick
won't make you a division champion. You've got problems that cannot
be solved by one coach or by simple changes.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bill Belichick is the new head coach of a team that
finished last in the division. He is not the new head coach of a
division champion or of a team that has any right to be
guaranteeing such things because of his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick can get that point across when he first meets with
his new team, the rest of his job will be easier.
</P>
<P>
   Not easy mind you, but easier.

   ST. LOUIS _ In the star-crossed, luxury box revenue chasing
world of professional sports, there is nothing so fitting as this
football season's grandest spectacle, Super Bowl XXXIV, which is
not sponsored by U-Haul, but ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams vying for the NFL championship, the Tennessee Titans
and St. Louis Rams, have relocated three times, leaving rankled
fans and civic leaders in their wake in the pursuit of a
publicly-funded stadium. Each has an owner who could be described,
charitably, as colorful.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' Georgia Frontiere, the only woman to be the principal
owner of an American professional sports franchise, is a former
lounge singer who inherited the team when the sixth of her seven
husbands, Carroll Rosenbloom, died in a mysterious drowning. Asked
recently if she felt badly for fans of the old Los Angeles Rams
abandoned in Southern California, Frontiere replied: ``The fans
there are still able to watch on television. They watched on TV and
didn't come to games anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans owner Bud Adams, a Texas oilman and a charter owner of
the renegade American Football League, once won three division
titles in four years with three different coaches and ended a
stalled negotiation with a prized lineman by throwing in a herd of
cattle as a signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get them cattle, girls, whatever it took,'' Adams said
Thursday. ``Back then, you didn't need a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, by way of Cleveland and Los Angeles, and the Titans,
via Houston and Memphis, meet Sunday in Atlanta's Georgia Dome. If
this is the Relocation Bowl I, it will be a benchmark occasion of
sorts, the crowning of a Super Bowl champion who is the paragon of
the modern, vagabond sports enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rams and Titans have shown, the curious economics of
today's pro football make it possible, even likely, a franchise
will flourish by choosing a smaller market, like Nashville or St.
Louis, over bigger ones, like Houston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While small market teams in Major League Baseball have sagged
and now find it nearly impossible to compete, in the NFL, smaller
may be better. A smaller city like Nashville was hungry for the
status a professional team can convey and happily built a $292
million stadium for Adams with taxpayers money. They also let Adams
dictate the key revenue-generating terms of his lease.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Adelphia Coliseum has 144 luxury suites, the most
precious commodity for a sports franchise owner. With billions of
dollars in national television money shared equally by NFL teams
and with a rigid salary cap restricting every team's payroll, the
rules of the game make small markets equal to their big market
brethren. With newer, more favorable lease agreements they are even
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike a baseball team, which is trying to fill its ballpark
and parking lots 81 times a year, the small market NFL team only
needs area fans and corporations to take an interest in eight home
games a year. Given the daylong carnival atmosphere that envelops
most NFL games these days, that is not asking too much.
</P>
<P>
   This model of the new commerce in sports, where NFL franchises
sell for more than $600 million, was on exhibit last weekend when
Frontiere's Rams earned their Super Bowl berth. They did so with a
victory before a sellout crowd inside the Trans World Dome, a $280
million facility built to lure a NFL franchise back to St. Louis,
which had lost its Cardinals to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking Georgia to Georgia,'' the Rams coach Dick Vermeil
shouted to the crowd in an on-the-field ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere, honored in St. Louis for bringing pro football back
to the area and active in a variety of philanthropic ventures, was
cheered by the Rams fans in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta this week, Frontiere has kept a low profile and not
appeared with the team or during the many press conferences
orchestrated by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil has occasionally spoken for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been a wonderful owner, wonderful to me and my staff
and our families,'' the coach said. ``She has done whatever it took
to make this franchise a winner and she deserves credit for that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere, whose exact age is not known although she is believed
to be in her early 70s, has been vilified for leaving Los Angeles
in the Southern California newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Frontiere owned the Rams, they had established a
standard for the carpetbagging sports franchise. In 1946, as league
champions, they deserted Cleveland and relocated to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Years before baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers or basketball's
Minneapolis Lakers went west, the Rams became a Hollywood
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their running back star Elroy ``Crazy Legs'' Hirsch was
recruited by movie directors and a linebacker, Mike Henry, played
Tarzan. Their T-formation quarterback Bob Waterfield married the
starlet Jane Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team flights were events by themselves,'' said Rams
quarterback Roman Gabriel of the Rams' Hollywood halcyon days.
``You would just wait to see if Jane was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams became such a hot property that Rosenbloom, who owned
the storied Baltimore Colts, swapped his Colts for the Rams in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   On Apr. 2, 1979, the Rams were nine months away from their first
Super Bowl appearance when Rosenbloom drowned swimming in the ocean
by himself. Because Rosenbloom was known as a strong swimmer, there
were rumors of foul play and a series of celebrated investigations,
but the case has remained officially an accidental drowning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams moved from Los Angeles' Memorial Coliseum to Anaheim
Stadium 35 miles away and had several winning playoff seasons. But
Frontiere had fired most of her former husband's football
executives and her management style was erratic. She once told a
gathering of fans that she consulted an astrologer on player
trades.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Rams had lost 10 or more games for five consecutive
years. Although there was a ``Save the Rams'' movement in the Los
Angeles area, Frontiere took her team home to St. Louis, where a
new domed stadium awaited with a sweetheart lease.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams then lost every season in St. Louis far more than they
won, until this season's magical ride to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lesson in perseverance,'' Vermeil said of the Rams
saga.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the result in St. Louis is a misplaced mix of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Trans World Dome, they have a sort of Football Hall
of Fame. But it is half St. Louis and half Rams, so Hirsch, who
played in Los Angeles, is next to Larry Wilson, the Cardinals
safety who played in St. Louis. Before last Sunday's playoff game,
Lawrence McCutcheon, the former Los Angeles Rams star, was a
ceremonial captain on the field with Dan Dierdorf, the ex-Cardinals
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Whose team is this anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That's today's NFL, you can't know your franchise's history
without an atlas.
</P>
<P>
   Adams knows as much. Thursday, he talked about his 40 years in
pro football and made no apologies for turning his players into
gypsies who jumped from Houston to Memphis in 1997, then to
Nashville's Vanderbilt University football stadium in 1998 before
settling into Adelphia Coliseum this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we had to do, I didn't want to leave Houston,''
Adams said. ``But we couldn't get the revenue we could with a new
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   While the move has been prosperous and the Titans have made it
to the Super Bowl _ something the Oilers never did _ Adams Thursday
almost seemed to bemoan the loss of innocence in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   He told a story of how he negotiated with players, baiting them
with stacks of money in his desk. He would place $100 bills on the
top of several piles of $1 bills to coax players to sign. Adams,
who like Yankees owner George Steinbrenner attended Culver Military
Academy, also used to take media relations into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bashed a reporter in the jaw back in '62,'' he said. ``You
can't do that these days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams did watch one of his assistant coaches, Buddy Ryan,
throw a punch at another assistant coach, Kevin Gilbride, during a
game. And he had a head coach, Jerry Glanville, who left Oilers
tickets at will call for Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've seen a lot in 40 years,'' Adams said Thursday.
``I've seen the game change. I can't say it's changed for the
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I know where we were. And look where we are now.''

 &HT;    Will your snacks win Most Valuable Party Food?
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Super Bowl party without dips is
simply second-string. Dips and beer and a football game are a team,
no question.
</P>
<P>
   Hot or cold, savory or sweet, dips are a snap to put together.
</P>
<P>
   They are made from the most adaptable and forgiving of recipes,
too, so if you find a basic one you like, you can change it to fit
the tastes of your crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Update some of your old ones. Still
</P>
<P>
   serving that tired onion-soup dip? Use
</P>
<P>
   a head of roasted garlic instead. Guacamole a bit ho-hum? Try
broccomole _ the name alone
</P>
<P>
   should elicit laughs. The surprise
</P>
<P>
   is, it's tasty!
</P>
<P>
   We've got a few more dip tricks
</P>
<P>
   and new dips in our playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Give them a try to win over your
</P>
<P>
   party team.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   Chips and raw fruits and veggies are the norm for dipping, but
try these other dip-sters:
</P>
<P>
   _ Flatbreads or bagel chips, flavored or plain
</P>
<P>
   _ Soft pretzels (buy them frozen, or make your own out of bread
dough)
</P>
<P>
   _ Homemade sweet potato chips
</P>
<P>
   _ Ice cream cones, especially for sweet fruit dips
</P>
<P>
   _ Pizza crust wedges
</P>
<P>
   _ Shredded wheat biscuits
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiny doughnuts, in a sweet dip
</P>
<P>
   _ Dried fruit chips, such as banana and plaintain rounds
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYING FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Glass bowls are nice, but consider serving from these
``natural'' containers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hollowed-out coconut shells, papaya or melon shells for fruit
dips
</P>
<P>
   _ Hollowed-out cabbages, green and red peppers, giant mushroom
caps or ``bloomed'' onions
</P>
<P>
   _ Round or rectangular bread loaves
</P>
<P>
   _ Giant tortilla shells. Make your own by overlapping several
small corn tortillas in a deep-frying basket or metal colander;
lower into hot oil and fry until crisp. Set aside, upside-down, to
cool and drain. Support it in a bowl for best results.
</P>
<P>
   THE RULES
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep hot dips hot, and cold dips cold. Use a punch bowl filled
with ice in which to nestle a smaller bowl or bowls of dips to keep
them at safe temperatures. Keep hot dips in a crockpot or over a
low burner, especially those containing seafood or meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide a spoon or small canape knives in each dip to
discourage the ``direct dippers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clearly label dips if you have anyone attending who has food
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hot pepper dips are great if you can handle the heat. Many
diners can't, so make some of the dip without the hot peppers.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional enthusiasm for getting involved in
the family fight over the fate of 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian
Gonzalez appeared to cool Thursday, even as relatives on both sides
of the issue lobbied sympathetic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert emerged from a meeting with fellow
GOP House members Thursday and said ``there's a difference of
opinion'' over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who supports a bill to grant Elian U.S. citizenship in
a bid to force the case into a Florida custody court, said he would
not rush the bill to the floor but would require it to go through
the often-interminable committee process.
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, ``politicians need to step back,'' Hastert told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the immigration
subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, has expressed
reservations about the bill. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the
senior Democrat on that panel, is one of its most outspoken foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally appalled. This is not a political matter, this
is a family matter,'' Jackson-Lee said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a co-sponsor of the
citizenship bill who once vowed to rush it to the Senate floor this
week, is now undecided about a timetable, said his spokesman, John
Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know right now. There is still a lot of talking
going on. He's taking the temperature of members,'' Czwartacki
said, adding that it could still come up sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the boy from Cuba has blurred political lines with
some of Congress' most conservative members, such as Rep. Steve
Largent, R-Okla., joining forces with some of its most liberal,
such as Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., in saying Elian belongs with
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of the most liberal members, including Rep.
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I. and Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., are
supporting a bill to grant Elian temporary residency status which
would thwart efforts to return him quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With lawmakers assembling in the capital for Thursday night's
State of the Union message, two groups of Elian's relatives prowled
congressional hallways meeting with sympathetic legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives told lawmakers that the child was upset
by his meeting with his grandmothers in Miami on Wednesday and that
he feared being forced to return to Cuba. But his grandmothers said
the boy expressed the desire to go back and worried that he was
being harmed by remaining in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers complained to the members of the Congressional
Black Caucus about a lack of privacy at the meeting with their
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's maternal grandmother, said she wanted
the meeting to be a normal visit, but when they arrived, ``there
was a lot of press and people with posters shouting at us.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the grandmothers, Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., said
``justice would be sending the child back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, showing signs of exhaustion after their
whirlwind visit which has taken them to New York, and twice to
Washington and Miami during the past week, are expected to meet
Friday with Rangel and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the
third-highest ranking Democrat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile a group of Elian's Miami relatives and survivors of
the shipwreck that ultimately killed 11 refugees including Elian's
mother _ met with lawmakers sympathetic to allowing him to remain
in the United States pending a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Among those was Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who was particularly
interested in learning about the wishes of Elian's mother just
before she died. Survivors Nivaldo Fernandez and Arriane Horta told
Graham her wish was that Elian touch American soil, where he would
be safe from being forced to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez rolled up his pants leg to show Graham the deep bites
he suffered from fish while in the water for three days after the
shipwreck. Donato Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who rescued Elian
on Thanksgiving Day, told Graham the boy ``looked like a flower,''
when plucked from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Graham asked about Elian's reaction to his meeting with his
grandmothers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, the 21-year-old cousin who has been
Elian's primary caregiver, told Graham that he rushed into her arms
after the meeting and asked to ``go home.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Georgina Cid, another cousin, said the group
felt ``very positive'' from the meetings with lawmakers.

FORBES TRIES TO SHRUG OFF KEMP ENDORSEMENT OF BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ This was going to be Steve Forbes' moment
four years ago. He was on the cover of Time and Newsweek, he was on
the verge of being endorsed by Jack Kemp and he was the talk of New
Hampshire _ but still he plummeted into fourth-place in the New
Hampshire primary and, before the first day of spring, had dropped
out of the nomination race.
</P>
<P>
   Now Forbes again is seeking his moment, but it is one filled
with wild uncertainty and worrisome trends. Forbes' political hero,
Kemp, endorsed his political rival, George W. Bush, Thursday.
Forbes complained he was ignored in Wednesday's Republican debate
focus on Bush and Senator John McCain, who are tied at the top of
the polls. The latest Boston Globe poll shows the millionaire
Forbes is in danger of another fourth-place finish, with Alan Keyes
running stronger in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as his campaign bus idled in the parking lot of a
Manchester restaurant, Forbes insisted in an interview with Boston
Globe reporters that his campaign was catching on. Asked about
Kemp, he issued a curt dismissal of his longtime close friend,
saying the one-time NFL quarterback and ex-congressman ``is part of
the political establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, Jack was on the cutting edge of tax cuts and
junking the tax code,'' Forbes said. ``Obviously he has gone back
on that. The establishment is rallying around Bush; they know now
that Bush is in danger. I think we will see more and more evidence
that the establishment has met its match in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his tough talk, it was clearly a painful day for Forbes,
who in 1995 spent months urging Kemp to run for president. When
Kemp decided not to run, Forbes decided to run himself, carrying
the supply-side banner for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, appearing with Bush in Nashua, called Forbes an
``outstanding human being'' who was best qualified to be Treasury
Secretary, not president. ``I really believe Governor Bush is the
one that can inspire the Congress, inspire the nation and win a
mandate for bringing down the tax rates,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said Kemp made the
endorsement partly because his son-in-law, Scott Andrews, is a
business partner of Bush's brother, Marvin Bush. ``That is a big
part of the reason,'' Dal Col said. ``It is sure not philosophy or
ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer confirmed the relationship but said
the endorsement was purely ``ideological.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Forbes touted his endorsement of the Manchester
Union-Leader, which he called more powerful than ``50 Jack Kemps''
and prepared to dig once again into his personal wealth to finance
a new advertising campaign. There is good reason to think he could
heavily influence the outcome of the primary, whether he falters or
not. Forbes said that his strategy will rely on taking
anti-abortion voters away from Keyes and Bush, and drawing away
anti-tax voters from McCain and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This is markedly different from Forbes' last presidential run.
In 1996, Forbes rarely mentioned abortion in speeches and usually
talked about the subject only if asked. This time around, Forbes is
running a graphic anti-abortion ad that shows a sonogram of a
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has five daughters, was asked in the interview what
would he do if one of them became pregnant while a minor _ the same
question posed to John McCain Wednesday. Forbes responded that if
his daughter was under 18 years and a minor under the law, ``we
will have that child brought to term.'' If his daughter was over
18, ``You're an adult. We would urge her to bring the baby to
term.''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for Forbes is that what worked well for him in Iowa
may be a hindrance in New Hampshire. He collected 31 percent of the
caucus vote with a heavy appeal to religious conservatives and a
strong anti-abortion pitch. But in New Hampshire, the Christian
Coalition has little influence and polls show that most voters
favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Forbes has reason to hope for a surprise. In Iowa, he was
at 20 percent in the polls on Sunday, but got 31 percent on Monday
as many Iowans embraced his claim that he is the ``conservative
alternative'' to Bush with the money to last through a long primary
fight. And, on economics at least, the anti-tax state of New
Hampshire should provide a receptive audience for Forbes' flat-tax
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes may be being hurt by a lasting image of the 1996
primary _ a series of devastating ``attack'' ads that Forbes ran
against Bob Dole, which helped Patrick Buchanan emerge from the
pack to win the primary. Dole is now featured in an ad sponsored by
the moderate Republican Leadership Council in which he says that
Forbes' attack ads left him ``bruised and broke'' as he headed
toward the general election. Voters are being reminded of a darker
side of Forbes' image, and his four-year-old ads have been turned
against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes campaign is not nearly as negative as four years ago.
In one ad that might be considered an attack, he accuses Bush of
reneging on a no-tax pledge. But most of Forbes' ads have focused
on his issues and beliefs. In recent days, Forbes has begun running
anti-abortion ads, primarily a pre-emptive effort to prevent
supporters from drifting to Keyes or Gary Bauer, who have abortion
their top issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how enthusiastically Forbes' message is being
received. So far in New Hampshire, Forbes' crowds have been smaller
and more subdued than those in Iowa. In part, that may reflect a
strategy that is emphasizing radio and television appearances above
in-the-flesh campaigning; since returning from Iowa, Forbes has
been averaging only about two public appearances a day.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the lunch crowd at the Puritan Backroom
Restaurant in Manchester seemed underwhelmed as Forbes visited
their tables, making awkward small talk and asking for votes.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pawloski, a Manchester retiree who has been a Republican
all his life said he liked some things about Forbes _ but not the
flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself don't see how a flat tax is going to work,'' Pawloski
said over lunch at the Backroom restaurant. ``It's going to know
the stuffing out of the working man.'' Pawloski, who said he is
supporting Bush, added that Forbes is ``funny-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Susan, disagreed.``He's a handsome man,'' she
said. ``He looks much better in person that he does on TV. He's got
a nice suit on.''

 &HT;    Coke raises doubts, and the stock falls
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thou shalt not surprise Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Coca-Cola shareholders are discovering in the wake
of what normally would have been favorable news for investors: a
respected company's management taking stern measures to correct its
problems.
</P>
<P>
   While two days isn't a trend, Coca-Cola's share price has taken
a big hit, falling almost 10 percent _ including nearly 6 percent
Thursday _ since Chairman-elect Doug Daft and other top executives
announced a massive restructuring of the world's best-known, but
recently troubled, company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the market saying we don't like Coca-Cola and we
don't like what they're doing, but it is saying we think its shares
are too pricey and we're going to wait this one out on the
sidelines for awhile,'' said Alfred Goldman, strategist for A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, some analysts have been supportive of the company.
Four reiterated positive ratings on Coca-Cola shares on Wednesday
and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Goldman of Banc of America Securities, Marc Greenberg
at PaineWebber and Douglas M. Lane of Merrill Lynch reiterated
``buy'' ratings, and Christopher Wilkens of Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown awarded a ``market perform'' rating, meaning he thinks the
stock will do at least as well as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, none of that cut any ice with the market. The
stock, which that fell $2.81 1/4 on Wednesday, dropped another
$3.56 1/4 to $59.50 on Thursday. Trading volume was heavy again,
with almost 8.8 million shares trading hands. That's almost the
double average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and money managers cite three reasons in particular why
the stock price has fallen and is likely to fall further:
</P>
<P>
   _ The layoff of 21 percent of its global work force was much
bigger than expected. As the week began, Wall Street speculated
that about 4,000 would lose their jobs. Coca-Cola instead announced
layoffs totaling 6,200.
</P>
<P>
   _ The inventory buildup of syrup _ the product Coca-Cola sells
to its bottlers who make the drinks _ was excessive in key markets
such as Japan, Germany and Eastern Europe. This will curb syrup
shipments in the first half of 2000. As a result, the company
trimmed its per-share earnings outlook for that period by 11 cents
to 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some analysts have protested that the company's goals for
profit and sales growth announced on Wednesday by Daft are too high
to be attainable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another reason offered by Goldman is what he called an
excessively high price multiple for Coca-Cola shares, a situation
he said leaves no margin for error in dealing with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even at $59.50, the stock is still trading at about 45 times
earnings. That's a reflection of investor demand for the company's
stock. But analysts also say that the company's earnings
historically justify multiples of about half that.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the share price spiked upward by almost 20 percent in the
first three weeks of January, before this week's announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is saying the company's solutions (announced by
Daft) are probably going to work, but when the shares are selling
at 45 times earnings, the outlook is pretty uncertain,'' said
Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some analysts believe the market hasn't had
time to hear all the details of Coca-Cola's recovery strategy. That
should become clearer today , when Daft and other top company
executives meet in New York with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market has been impressed with some of the opening
scenes of the Daft era,'' said Mark Godfrey, a senior analyst with
the Invesco Equity Income Fund. ``He has moved more quickly than
the market thought he would. It is obvious that he is hitting the
ground running and has a lot of ideas about where the company
should go.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Godfrey, the company's executives ``are setting
themselves up for good growth in the second half of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's plan to cut bottler syrup inventories from
a 45-days' supply to 34 days will free up considerable cash for the
bottlers to use in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is trying to work with its bottlers to help lower their
working capital needs. You don't need that much inventory in the
back room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in Coca-Cola's stocks continues a pattern of the last
year, during which the shares have reflected the company's many
problems with volatile swings.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest decline, from a May high of $70.50 to an October low
of $47.56 1/4, tracked the company's problems with the
health-related product recalls in Belgium and France, and the
subsequent impact on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Then the shares dropped 14 percent Dec. 6-7 when Chairman and
Chief Executive Douglas Ivester stunned the market by announcing he
would retire early this year after only 25 months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The shares traded within about an $8 range until the end of
1999, from which the price took its sharp upward spike to this
year's high of $66.87 1/2 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it take for the shares to get back to Tuesday's
close of $65.87 1/2? If history is any guide, it could take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 27, 1992, IBM announced a $3 billion charge against
earnings and job cuts of 20,000 in its restructuring. The share
price fell about 30 percent over the next two weeks. It was another
year and 10 months before the share price got back where it was
before that announcement. &QC;

 &HT;    Judge to decide is displaced workers can join suit
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge is being asked to prohibit Coca-Cola
Co. from requiring laid-off workers to stay out of a racial
discrimination lawsuit if they want enhanced severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is requiring workers to sign waivers promising they will
not join the suit, which seeks class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   The planned 6,000 job cuts, or 21 percent of the company's
global work force, are already a ``tremendously painful event for
many employees,'' and the company is seizing on that ``to impose a
special burden on its African-American employees,'' lawyers said in
the motion filed Thursday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola is taking advantage of the economic vulnerability of
African-American employees affected by the widespread layoffs to
coerce those employees into giving up their rights to participate
in this suit,'' the motion added.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said waiver forms targeting
future litigation are common in job reductions. He said the company
specifically included the race discrimination case in its release
form to make sure workers know exactly what rights they may be
forgoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what the plaintiffs' counsel are saying, because
of the pending litigation we went above and beyond what is required
by law to make prospective class members aware of the situation and
to encourage them to talk to plaintiffs' counsel before signing the
release,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Our goal is to treat everyone who is affected by
this realignment fairly and equally.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is using a combination of measures to trim jobs:
early retirement, outsourcing and outright elimination of other
jobs.The positions run the gamut, including vice presidents,
attorneys, engineers, project managers and staff assistants.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, four current and four former employees contend
Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations. The lawsuit seeks to expand
the case to class-action status and represent more than 2,000 black
employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has strongly denied allegations in the complaint. It
also opposes the plaintiffs' attempts to make it a class-action
lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   Employees in the job reduction announced Wednesday are being
given 45 days to sign the waiver forms if they want to receive
``enhanced severance payments.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the waivers, employees must agree not to file
claims against Coca-Cola under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Age Discrimination Act
and other discrimination laws. The forms require employees to agree
to ``no longer participate in or benefit from'' the race
discrimination lawsuit ``in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Lamar Mixson, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs,
said prior court orders prohibit the company from communicating
with prospective class members about agreeing not to participate in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this is,'' Mixson said of the waiver form. ``To
us, it's shocking and extremely troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola apparently attempted to cure this problem by advising
affected employees to consult an attorney before signing the form.
The form names the two local firms _ Bondurant, Mixson &AMP; Elmore and
Deville, Milhollin &AMP; Voyles _ and provides their phone numbers as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But Mixson said the plaintiffs legal team is concerned employees
who sign the forms also may be barred from testifying or providing
evidence in support of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kaminshine, a Georgia State University professor
specializing in employment law, said Coca-Cola's waiver form raises
interesting, and unusual, legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledges it is common for companies to offer
waivers as part of severance packages, Kaminshine said, ``I don't
think it's common for those waivers to specifically refer to a
pending discrimination suit of the kind involved here.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Coke's waiver is particularly unusual because the
discrimination lawsuit appears to be unrelated to the events giving
rise to the job reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument in support of the validity of the waiver is that
the laid-off employees are being offered a benefit they were not
entitled to and that Coke is simply asking the employees to give
something in return _ namely the relinquishment of all claims,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apparent problem here, though, is that Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act prohibits an employer from providing a benefit in
a discriminatory manner,'' Kaminshine added. ``And it's arguably
discriminatory for Coke to deny severance to black employees who
wish to participate in the pending race discrimination case, while
white employees face no such dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixson said plaintiffs want a quick hearing on the issue before
U.S. District Judge Richard Story.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also are engaged in intensive fact-finding to
determine whether the company's restructuring is having a disparate
impact on African-American employees, Mixson said.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Thursday, a federal magistrate has
ordered Coca-Cola to release three documents to plaintiffs that the
company had contended were privileged.
</P>
<P>
   Among those documents is a 1995 analysis of Coke's employment
practices with respect to African-American employees. The analysis
was authored by Carl Ware, Coke's highest-ranking black executive.
Ware was recently promoted from heading the company's Africa
operations to overseeing a newly created global public affairs and
administration division.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate E. Clayton Scofield III rejected Coke's
arguments that plaintiffs should not see the document. But Scofield
also ruled that dozens of other documents do not have to be turned
over to plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed with Coke's arguments that those documents are
protected by attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrines.

 &HT;    Exhibit will showcase casts of largest skeletons ever found
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Fernbank Museum of Natural History announced plans
Thursday to open a $1.25 million exhibit later this year featuring
casts of the two largest dinosaur skeletons ever found. One of the
dinosaurs weighed 100 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The casts are being made now in Argentina, where fossils of the
two giant dinosaurs were excavated in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One cast is of the bones of a female Argentinosaurus, a 100-ton
plant eater; the other, a male Giganotosaurus, a 10-ton meat-eater,
said Susan Neugent, president and chief executive officer of the
Fernbank Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The casts will be assembled here, and the model of the smaller
male will go on display in the museum's Great Hall in June, she
said. It'll take a little longer to put the huge female together,
but it should go on display by December.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs, unique to Argentina, became extinct about 85
million years ago, almost 20 million years before the last of the
dinosaurs died out, said Richard A. Hengst, a Purdue University
paleophysiologist working with Fernbank on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fossilized bones of the Argentinosaurus are on
display in the Museum Municipal de Carman Funes in Plaza Huincul, a
town in Argentina's Patagonia region.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time a cast of the Argen-
</P>
<P>
   tinosaurus has been made, Neugent said. Because the fossils of
the Argentinosaurus have never been fully put together, no one has
ever seen what a complete skeleton looks like.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are super-saurs,'' Neugent laughed, ``as in Super Bowl.
They're going to be great, breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fernbank display will depict the meat-eating Giganotosaurus
trying to get its claws on about 20 eggs of the much-bigger female
dinosaur, she said. The display also will include a cast of a
flying dinosaur called a Pterasaur, also unique to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of all this will be unlike anything ever done
before,'' said Neugent. ``These dinosaurs are so huge. If I were to
stand up beside a single vertebrae, it would come up to my ears.''
Neugent stands about 5 feet, 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The male dinosaur, Hengst said, was ``much bigger than a T. rex,
had a bigger head and a much larger bite. It's a longer animal
overall by 5 feet than the biggest T. rex known to this point. But
it's more lightly built, and its legs seem to be a little lighter.
I think it was probably a faster animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the male was a shrimp compared to the female. The
Argentinosaurus female was 120 feet long, and the male
Giganotosaurus 47 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen dinosaurs all over the world, and I've never seen
one anything as big as this,'' Hengst said, referring to the
Argentinosaurus. ``It's absolutely stunning to stand next to one of
those vertebrae, especially when you've looked at as many as I
have.''

YES, THERE IS A LIGHTER SIDE TO STEVE FORBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too many, he is the ultimate straight man. A blend of wealth and
nerdiness to rival Bill Gates. In his own words, he is a
``charismatically challenged'' man.
</P>
<P>
   But, believe it or not, there is a lighter side to Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly Jay Leno. But to judge by crowd response on the
campaign trail, Forbes' cornball sense of humor helps to soften the
image of a man whose biggest obstacle to the 2000 Republican
nomination may be his famously awkward persona.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nothing delights a crowd of Forbes supporters more than
his zinger about ``the infernal, I mean Internal Revenue Service,''
or his tireless lampooning of the Washington political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes likes to describe the tax code's mind-numbing complexity
with an expression seemingly more suited to Buffy the Vampire
Slayer than a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the kids say, `Hel-lo?''' he will say with a delighted
smile, before launching off into a pitch for the simplicity of his
17 percent flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes will often marvel at how the idea that Americans
want more health care coverage is often presented as an insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use another kids' word on that: `Du-uhhh!'' Forbes says,
grinning behind his wire-rimmed glasses as his audience cracks up _
possibly at the mere fact that the publishing mogul has used such a
word.
</P>
<P>
   But while many of Forbes' jokes are perfectly scripted and
repeated several times a day, he can improvise virtually any topic
into a riposte against his opponents and the dreaded Washington
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   After thanking an audience for fighting through ``inclement''
weather the other morning, Forbes added: ``That sounds like a word
that came out of Washington. Why can't they just say the weather's
lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   When a microphone went out on him at a Nashua warehouse this
week, Forbes didn't miss a beat: ``This is Al Gore technology,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes even put a political spin on a Super Bowl prediction made
on his campaign flight to New Hampshire from Iowa Monday night.
Forbes said the St. Louis Rams would beat the Tennesse Titans
Sunday, noting that the Titans recently relocated from Texas _ home
state of his chief rival, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hopefully there's a trend there,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Since his strong second-place showing in Iowa, the air of levity
around the Forbes campaign has been particularly pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Iowa Monday night Forbes' aides guzzled beer on his
campaign jet and blared rock music from a giant speaker carried
down the plane's aisles.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the night was Queen's defiant ``We Will Rock You.''
But even the night's playlist had an obvious political connotation,
as the campaign dedicated a song to George Bush: ``The Great
Petender.''

 &HT;    Tale of battle for free expression crackles with energy, good
intentions
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Presented as ``a (mostly) true story,'' ``Cradle
Will Rock'' raucously explores a little-known chapter of American
history in which U.S. soldiers closed down a stage play directed by
Orson Welles on the eve of its opening.
</P>
<P>
   The government action came at the height of the Great
Depression, when American workers began turning to unions. Marc
Blitzstein's pro-labor musical, ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' was
banned because of growing fear of communism in America.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins' film account wears its politics on its sleeve,
pitting artists against their wealthy patrons in a battle over free
expression. It's a war that's still being waged today, as evidenced
by the Brookyn Museum of Art's controversial ``Sensation'' exhibit,
which Mayor Rudolph Guiliani attempted to shut down by withholding
the museum's funding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its didactic tone, the complex and poignant comedy is
one of the year's most entertaining films. The National Board of
Review named it one of the 10 best films of 1999 and honored
writer-director-producer Robbins (``Dead Man Walking'') for Special
Achievement in Filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in the boisterous style of 1930s motion pictures,
``Cradle Will Rock'' is set amid New York City's art and theater
world, where fictional characters intermingle with larger-than-life
historical figures such as Nelson Rockefeller, William Randolph
Hearst and Welles.
</P>
<P>
   They are portrayed by a stellar ensemble cast that includes Hank
Azaria, Ruben Blades, Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Cary Elwes, Angus
Macfadyen, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, John
Turturro and Emily Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The head-swimming array of characters and stories is unwieldy at
times, particularly as the film builds to its feverish climax, but
Robbins pulls it together with an assured hand.
</P>
<P>
   His exhaustively researched screenplay is tragic, funny and
uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins sets the political scene with newsreel footage from the
era, which we view from behind a movie theater screen, where
aspiring actress Olive Stanton (Watson) sleeps. The camera follows
the homeless waif in one continuous tracking shot as she is chased
out into the street, introducing several key characters before
taking us through a third-floor apartment window, where Blitzstein
(Azaria) composes at his piano.
</P>
<P>
   The passionate, 22-year-old Welles (Macfadyen) mounts a
production of ``The Cradle Will Rock'' with his Federal Theater
company, which includes combative producer John Houseman (Elwes)
and Italian immigrant actor Aldo Silvano (Turturro).
</P>
<P>
   Headed by Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), the Federal Theater is
a Works Progress Administration project that brings lost-cost
theater to millions of Americans while providing work for
unemployed actors. A congressional committee in Washington conducts
hearings over the supposed ``un-American'' themes of Federal
Theater plays.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to testify are Hazel Huffman (Joan Cusack), a lowly WPA
clerk concerned about content, and Tommy Crickshaw (Murray), a
boozy ventriloquist embittered about the decline of vaudeville.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzstein's musical becomes a political powder keg.
</P>
<P>
   Paralleling the struggle of Welles' theater group is the
conflict between Rockefeller (John Cusack) and Mexican artist Diego
Rivera (Blades), whose class-conscious mural for Rockefeller Center
affronts the tycoon's aesthetic taste. Mediating their dispute is
Margherita Sarfatti (Sarandon), a fascist sympathizer and former
mistress of Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   The stylish, tightly woven tapestry features marvelous
performances and many wonderful scenes. John Cusack, Macfadyen,
Elwes and Murray give especially sharp turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists are whores like the rest of us,'' says publishing
magnate Hearst (John Carpenter), wearing a powdered wig at a
costume ball, as Robbins juxtaposes the decadent rich against the
embattled painter and performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradle Will Rock'' portrays them as quite the opposite.

MCCAIN SPEAKS OUT ABOUT PLIGHT OF NATIVE AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, N.H. _ Though he campaigned as a ``proud conservative
Republican'' along the New Hampshire seacoast Thursday, Sen. John
McCain departed again from his party's mainstream by empathizing
with the plight of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that McCain embraced early in his congressional
career when he took up Indian causes that other Republicans
ignored, and McCain said he regretted that he was rarely asked
about the issue as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   His chance to discuss Indian affairs came in response to a
question at a Hampton town meeting. McCain responded by calling the
treatment of Indians ``one of the darker chapters of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He described a Lakota (Sioux) reservation in South Dakota
``where people live in the worst conditions of grinding poverty,''
and he assailed the Bureau of Indian Affairs for losing account of
$2.5 billion in oil and gas royalties due to tribes holding land in
the West. ``They have been literally ripped off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain criticized some of the tribes for
imposing their own rigid bureaucratic rules, ``stifling free
enterprise'' on the reservations. In some cases, entrepreneurs are
forced to wait two or three years to start businesses, he said.
``They need to get rid of these socialist aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in his campaign bus afterwards, McCain was asked to
elaborate on his interest in Indian issues. He described a lonely
battle in the ranks of congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Congress in 1983, McCain said, he was
recruited for a Republican slot on an Indian affairs subcommittee
by Rep. Morris K. Udall, the Democratic chairman of the House
Interior Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I got it was that nobody else wanted it,'' McCain
said. ``When I talked to a lot of Republicans'' about taking the
Indian affairs post ``they said: `They don't vote and when they
vote, they vote for Democrats. Don't get involved.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was persuaded to take the job anyway after an
``eloquent speech'' by Udall, a fellow Arizonan who was a champion
of Indian causes. Though a Democrat, Udall became one of McCain's
mentors.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the position, McCain said, he was approached by
another Democrat, Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, on behalf of
``this little tribe up in Connecticut that had been having trouble
getting recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he looked into the case and discovered ``the
Republicans had been the ones blocking it.'' He determined that the
Indians' plea was legitimate and won recognition for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know which tribe?'' McCain asked, then answered his own
question. ``The Pequot, now the proud owners of the largest casino
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's work on behalf of a cause unpopular among Republicans
was praised Thursday by Bob Neuman, a former spokesman for the
Democratic National Committee and longtime aide to the late Udall.
``John McCain has been absolutely spectacular on Indian issues,''
Neuman said.
</P>
<P>
   While discussing his break with Republican doctrine, McCain had
kind words for Bill Bradley -- considered something of a renegade
among the Senate Democrats. ``From time to time Bradley took on
issues that didn't make him popular. For example, he was an Eastern
senator who got involved on water issues in the West, on some land
issues, on issues where some of his colleagues said: `This guy
ought to stay out of it, it's my state.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he admired Bradley for his unorthodox positions.

 &HT;    No more Mr. Nice Guy in Bradley-Gore race
 &HT;    By Ken Fosket and Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Democrat Bill Bradley dumped the laid-back
style that has characterized his insurgent campaign for president
Thursday and lashed out at ``months of misleading statements'' from
rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And for Gore's part, he learned a hard lesson of what happens
when you portray yourself as a ``fighter'' in politics: Your
opponent, even one who professes to disdain bare-knuckle brawls,
might hit back.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, pounding away at the chord he struck during Wednesday
night's debate, told crowds of New Hampshire voters that Gore
couldn't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't trust the people to tell them the truth in the
campaign, how can the people trust that you are going to tell them
the truth when you are president of the United States?'' Bradley
asked a crowd of supporters in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Timberland Co., the boot and clothing maker, Bradley
turned to a basketball metaphor to explain his new line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been negative, has been misleading,'' Bradley
said. ``Last night, I decided it was my turn, and I threw a little
elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Washington for President Clinton's final
State of the Union address, Gore gave an interview on New Hampshire
Public Radio and toured a software company in Manchester, touting
the Clinton administration's record on the economy. Then he turned
his attention to Bradley's continuing accusations and said, ``I
don't quite understand how someone can condemn so-called negative
attacks while in the next breath launch real negative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Bradley's new aggressive style
of campaigning was ``an act of desperation'' and ``a crass
political decision by someone who is supposed to be apolitical.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, said Bradley's
frustration with Gore's assaults on his health care proposals and
domestic agenda had been building for some time. But Berman said
Bradley waited until Wednesday's debate to confront Gore ``face to
face.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Bradley's new assertiveness can
translate into a win for him in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
Some analysts believed Bradley's criticisms in the debate fell
flat. But raising questions about Gore's trustworthiness might be
more effective, said Dartmouth political scientist Richard Winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to the issue of Gore as the professional politician,''
Winters said. During the public radio interview, a caller
criticized Gore's record on abortion in terms similar to those used
by Bradley in their debate Wednesday night. She noted that Gore, as
a congressman in the early 1980s, had not supported federal funding
for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always supported Roe v. Wade,'' Gore insisted,
referring to the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. He
acknowledged, however, that early in his career he did not support
federal funding of abortions. ``But over the years, I've come to
the view that federal funding ought to be available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The more-assertive rhetoric by Bradley also translated into a
more assertive campaign style on the road Thursday. He staged
several impromptu stops between his scheduled events. Seeking to
counter the perception that Bradley might be finished if he fails
to win Tuesday, his aides announced Bradley will appear in
Hartford, Conn., and Brooklyn, N.Y., the day after the primary.
Both states are central to Bradley's strategy for winning the
nomination.

FORBES ATTEMPTS PAINT BUSH WITH TEXAS EDUCATION WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After Steve Forbes zinged him with a flurry of
charges about Texas state spending, education and taxes at
Wednesday night's debate, Governor George W. Bush replied in
defense, ``So many half-stories. So little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with five candidates swinging freely in a 90-minute
debate, the truth often gets battered about like a badminton
shuttlecock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a review of the exchange between Bush and Forbes shows that
the magazine publisher did not employ any outright fibs in
challenging the Texas governor. Forbes zeroed in on demonstrable
flaws in Bush's record with accurate, albeit highly selective,
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign continued to press the attack on Bush's
record Thursday and was planning a news conference Friday in New
Hampshire with members of the Texas board of education who are
critical of the governor's performance.
</P>
<P>
   But credit should also be given to Bush, who accurately
characterized his opponent's attacks as relaying only half the
story. The real achievements of Bush's governorship are more subtle
than Forbes's selective use of statistics. Here is a look at the
issues raised during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   --SAT SCORES. The issue of SAT scores is illustrative and took
up much of the exchange between the candidates. Forbes noted
accurately that while Bush was governor his state's ranking for the
college board scores dropped to 46th from 40th among the states, in
the years from 1994 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush talks that he is the education governor. But by this
measure, a measure of what is really going on, which parents look
at, it's not there,'' Forbes' campaign manager, William Dal Col,
said Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Though Texas SAT scores dropped when compared with other states,
numerically they stayed about the same. And the Forbes campaign had
to switch to different years _ 1995 to 1998 _ to back up its
assertion that the SAT scores for Texas minority students have
slipped as well. When 1994 is used as the base year, then Bush is
right and Forbes is wrong: minority scores have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   And all the talk about SAT scores may be irrelevant. Voters in
New Hampshire, which traditionally is at or near the top of the
national rankings, know what high SAT scores signify, and it isn't
necessarily the quality of a state's schools, much less the
performance of a governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is mixing up a lot of stuff and being intellectually
dishonest,'' said Nicholas Lemann, the author of ``The Big Test:
The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,'' a new book on the
SATs. ``But Bush, you know, doesn't think well on his feet or have
the policy mastery to give the answer he could have given.''
</P>
<P>
   The SATs, in fact, were never designed to measure a school
system's performance, but rather to gauge students' ``academic
ability irrespective of their high school education,'' said Lemann.
</P>
<P>
   And the SATs, as Bush noted during the debate, generally are
given to a privileged, self-selected group: students who hope to go
to college. States with lots of white, middle-class high school
students and small urban or minority populations usually do quite
well.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Bush has done as governor is to challenge more
minority students to consider college and take the SATs. In Bush's
years in office, the number of students taking the SATs increased
overall by 22 percent, and by 24 percent among Hispanics and 29
percent among African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike many states, we make sure as many kids can take the SAT
as possible. We include all kinds of children,'' said Bush at the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board Web site notes, ``In general, the higher the
percentage of students taking the test, the lower the average
scores.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dal Col dismissed Bush's policy and said Texas is cruelly
raising the expectations of minority students. ``Encouraging them
without giving them the tools to succeed is providing false hope at
best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --EDUCATION. Forbes also made sport of a Texas education
accountability program _ the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills _
for having ``dumbed down'' standards. In one case, said Forbes,
students were given pictures of four insects an asked to choose
which one was the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Ballard, a member of the Texas board of education, said
the test question about insects does exist, and she supported
Forbes' claim that the TASS tests have been simplified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been dumbed down substantially every year,'' said
Ballard, who is expected to appear at the Forbes news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But during Wednesday's debate Bush parried by citing his state's
ratings on a federal exam, the National Assessment of Educational
Progress.
</P>
<P>
   Texas fourth-graders led the nation in elementary math skills in
the 1996 federal tests and were 14th in reading skills when tested
last year. And black students in Texas were first among
African-Americans nationwide on the math exams. ``The NAEP test,
which compares state to state, showed dramatic improvement,'' Bush
said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAEP is a really good measure,'' said Lemann. ``It gives a
pretty good picture of how a state is doing, and Texas has gone up.
It is wrong to give Bush sole credit, because this is an ongoing
effort that started well before he became governor, but Bush has
been very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   --TAXES. There is no difference between the candidates on the
size of the two tax cut bills that Bush signed as governor; the
debate is over how many Texans actually benefitted.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 tax cut, Bush signed legislation shifting $1 billion
in state funds to the local school districts, so they could cut
their property taxes. Many taxpayers didn't get the tax break,
however, because the assessed value of their property was rising
quickly in the booming economy, or because local officials raised
their own rate. To a lesser extent, a similar phenomenon diluted
the impact of the $2 billion tax cut in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --SPENDING. As Forbes noted, Bush criticized former Governor Ann
Richards in the 1994 campaign for having 13,000 more state
employees than New York. And indeed, during the Bush years, that
gap has in fact widened as New York reduced the size of its
government and the Texas state government grew. According to the
Dallas Morning News, aggregate state spending under Bush did rise
by 36 percent, as Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign argues, however, that the growth of the Texas
population is what drove spending and state employment higher. When
measured in per capita terms, the Texas state government has been
relatively stingy, Bush says, growing by less than 3 percent.

   COMIC-GENIUSES-FILMS (Undated) _ Humankind used to produce two
or three geniuses per century. Now, it gives us a couple of dozen
per month. Last November's Genius issue of Esquire showcased those
men and women ``transforming our civilization,'' including the NBA
point guard Allen Iverson and the brilliant Leonardo _ not Da
Vinci, but DiCaprio. Today, everyone and his dog is a genius.
Nowhere is this inflation more evident than in current comic

   MARSALIS-JAZZ (Undated) _ Sometime during the last year, those
of us who were on the mailing list of Columbia Records ran for
cover. It was raining CDs by Wynton Marsalis. By the end of 1999,
Marsalis had released some 20 hours of music on 15 CDs, a heroic
effort called ``Swinging Into the 21st'' that still has not emptied
Columbia's vaults of his material. There has never been anything
like that sort of effusion in the history of jazz, and to achieve
it Marsalis cut his earnings per album from $1 million to $100,000.

   HOLLYWOOD-ROYALS (Undated) _ Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, the
wastrel heir to a shipping fortune in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
is the purest example of an upper-class American golden boy to
appear in the movies in a long time. His female counterpart in
Anthony Minghella's portrait of rich young Americans abroad in the
late 1950s is Cate Blanchett's Meredith Logue, a textile heiress
bouncing around from one swell European hotel to another.
Hollywood's fondness for casting British actors as upper-class

   EUROPE-FILMS (Paris) _ For all the ardent nationalists battling
American cultural and capitalist incursions, a new generation of
Europeans is living and working across the 15 borders of the
European Union, using the Internet, speaking ``American'' to their
children the way the Russian aristocracy used to speak French _
global citizens whose lives take place, at least some of the time,
in English. There is a struggle going on to create a cultural
identity for this united Europe, and one of its arenas is the
European film. If defining that identity now is more elusive

Brooklyn College's Whitman Hall in 1993 and 1998, returns Tuesday
night for a week at the Joyce Theater, marking its Manhattan debut

   BLAIR-BROWN-THEATER (Undated) _ With the slow decline of the
Broadway play, and the dearth of musical roles for women over 50, a
middle-aged actress expecting to find steady, varying work on
Broadway might be a candidate for some sort of professional
intervention. So what is to be made of the unconventional
trajectory of Blair Brown, the erstwhile star of television sitcoms
(``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'') and of movies (``Altered
States'') who has reinvented herself as, a Broadway actress? Last
year, she scored a critical triumph in ``Cabaret,'' replacing Mary
Louise Wilson as the dowdy landlady, Fraulein Schneider, and
surprising audiences with the suppleness of her voice. This month,
she moved back to Broadway in another singing role as Gretta
Conroy, the nostalgic wife in Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey's
musical adaptation of ``The Dead,'' the story by James Joyce. By

   ROBERT-SHAW-MUSIC (Undated) _ It would somehow have been both
fitting and a bit grotesque if Robert Shaw, the great choral
conductor who died just over a year ago at 82, had left behind a
recording of a Requiem, to be released after his own death. And he
missed doing so only by weeks. His last recording, made in late
1998 and recently released by Telarc, was of Dvorak's Stabat Mater,
an expansive setting of a traditional text of the Roman Catholic
Church, reflecting on the sorrows of the Virgin Mary at the cross
of Jesus. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FINALES (Berlin) _ For their New Year's Eve concert here
at the Philharmonie, the Berlin Philharmonic and its conductor,
Claudio Abbado, came up with an extraordinary program that worked
extraordinarily well: seven finales in a row, to mark the passing
of the year and, depending on how you count, the century. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONG-OPERAS (Undated) _ Many operas, including great ones, are
routinely criticized for being too long. Puccini's ``Tosca,'' a
miracle of dramatic streamlining, is conceded to be just right, but
``Madama Butterfly,'' which is not that much longer, is thought to
have dead spots. Wagner's ``Siegfried'' is way too long, detractors
say, and even many partisans concede as much, not to mention tenors
who take on the exhausting title role, the most demanding in opera.
Yet ``Gotterdammerung,'' an even longer work, is generally felt to
be gripping theater. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   MUSIC-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Dvorak: Symphony No. 7, `The Wild Dove'

   DENNY-DOHERTY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The moment the surviving members
of the Mamas and the Papas came onstage two years ago to sing an
old hit song and accept induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, a certain group of mothers and fathers in the television
audience surely did a double take. For there on the screen, now
getting on in years, were the rock band's founder and chief
songwriter, John Phillips; the singer (and Papa John's ex-wife)
Michelle Phillips, and, belting out the lead vocals ... the Harbor
Master. Rock music fans with long memories may have known him as
Denny Doherty, once the buoyant tenor for one of the most popular,
tuneful and harmonically sophisticated bands of the '60s. By

   AFRICAN-SLAVE-POTTER (Winterthur, Del.) _ The robust
eight-gallon jar was both impressive and puzzling: slightly larger
than a basketball and richly glazed in greens and browns, it bore
the neat signature of Dave, a slave who was a poet and master
potter in Edgefield, S.C., in the 19th century, the first
African-American to sign his ceramics. A traveling exhibition of
his work began at the McKissick Museum of the University of South
Carolina in 1998. The show's title quotes a line from a poem on a
pot by Dave in the Smithsonian: ```I made this jar...' The Life and
Works of the Enslaved African-American Potter, Dave.'' It will open
here next weekend at the Henry Francis duPont Winterthur Museum and
remain through June 25. By Rita Reif. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   CORNELIA-PARKER-ART (Boston) _ Like a slightly daft forensic
detective, the British artist Cornelia Parker gathers evidence from
moldering cultural artifacts. Tarnish from Davy Crockett's knife, a

   EISENMAN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ For years, one of the burning
questions in American architecture has been: Will Peter Eisenman
find himself before the world finds Peter Eisenman? By himself, I
don't mean Eisenman's personality. I mean his attitude toward his
medium. Can he finally place architecture above the external
sources _ linguistics; semiotics; structuralist philosophy _ he has
relied on over the years? By the world, I don't mean popular
acclaim, of the kind that Frank Gehry has achieved in recent years.
I mean curiosity on the part of a public that has been slow to
recognize its stake in Eisenman's ideas. By Herbert Muschamp.

LOVE OF FERRARIS LEADS TO FORMER UNION CHIEF'S GUILTY PLEA

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Coia's love of Ferraris, including one that cost more
than $1 million, proved his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the president of the national laborers' union,
representing workers at the bottom of the construction pecking
order, Coia has agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges for failing
to pay about $100,000 in taxes on the purchase of not just one
Ferrari, but three.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Donald K. Stern, said
Thursday that Coia would plead guilty to several schemes to cheat
his home state, Rhode Island, and the town of Barrington, R.I., out
of sales taxes in the purchase of the Ferraris. Coia owns a large
seaside house in Barrington.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the government would recommend a sentence of two
years of probation, payment of the back taxes and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Coia, 56, retired as president of the Laborers' International
Union of North America on Jan. 1. His plea agreement with the
government bars him from any decision-making role in the union, but
it does allow him to remain as the union's president emeritus, a
ceremonial position giving him a salary of $250,000 a year, the
same he earned as president.
</P>
<P>
   In one scheme admitted by Coia, he bought a 1972 Ferrari Daytona
for $1.05 million in 1990 and fraudulently registered it in
Middletown, Conn., which has lower taxes on car purchases than
Barrington. In that way, prosecutors say, he defrauded Barrington
out of $57,865.01 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In another scheme that Coia admitted, he bought a 1973 Ferrari
365 GTB/4 for $215,000 and obtained a fraudulent invoice from a
dealer who leased cars to his union, indicating that the Ferrari
cost only $2,160. In that way, he paid Rhode Island just $151.20 in
taxes for the car, rather than the $15,050 he properly owed.
</P>
<P>
   In the third scheme, Coia bought a 1991 Ferrari F-40 for
$450,000, keeping the title in the name of a friendly auto dealer.
Two years later, he repurchased it for $275,000, but he paid Rhode
Island none of the 7 percent tax due on it, thus defrauding the
state out of $19,250.
</P>
<P>
   Coia was so fond of these Italian sports cars that in his office
three blocks from the White House, he used a Ferrari coffee mug,
had Ferrari toy cars and displayed Ferrari posters. Former union
officials said that when union officials who disdained such high
living visited his office, he would temporarily replace his Ferrari
pictures with posters by Ralph Fasanella, a painter famous for his
loving depictions of factories.
</P>
<P>
   When Coia announced his retirement, he said he wanted to spend
more time with his family and was tired of being hounded by
investigators. He denied that his retirement had anything to do
with the investigation of his Ferrari dealings, although several
government and union officials said he was stepping down because of
government pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Coia's defenders said that whatever his faults, he left the
750,000-member union in far better shape than when he took it over
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When the Justice Department threatened in 1995 to file a civil
racketeering lawsuit to take over the union, Coia persuaded the
department to forgo the suit by agreeing to set up the most
sweeping in-house cleanup any union had undertaken. An in-house
prosecutor and in-house judge kicked out 220 corrupt union
officials, including 127 found to be members or associates of
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Coia's father, who prosecutors say was a close associate of
Raymond A. Patriarca Jr., the longtime New England crime boss, once
served as the union's secretary-treasurer and helped pave the way
for his son's ascension to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The union's in-house prosecutors spent four years investigating
whether the younger Coia had ties to organized crime, but he was
cleared. The prosecutors did, however, uncover Coia's tax-avoidance
schemes for the Ferraris.

 &HT;    Abernathy awaits sentence in scheme to pocket taxpayer's money
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former State Sen. Ralph David Abernathy III says he
has turned his life over to God. But his immediate future rests in
the hands of Fulton County Superior Court Judge L.A. McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell is scheduled to sentence the son and namesake of
Atlanta's famed civil rights leader today. A jury found Abernathy
guilty last month of a scheme to pocket taxpayer funds. Although
his first trial ended in a mistrial, he was convicted by the second
jury on 18 counts _ five of theft by taking involving $5,700, five
of false swearing, five of violating his oath of office, two of
forgery and one count of influencing a witness. A decision to
appeal is being weighed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thurbert Baker has indicated that his office
will seek incarceration. Abernathy's lawyer, Theodore Lackland,
plans to ask the judge to spare his client prison time. ``We may
well make an argument that perhaps incarceration is not
appropriate,'' Lackland said.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy, who is free on $25,000 bond, is preaching part-time
at West Hunter Street Baptist Street, where his father was pastor
for many years. He also owns a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith in God hasn't wavered,'' said Abernathy, who was
unable to seek Senate re-election because his check for the
election qualifying bounced. ``I'm looking forward to whatever
happens in the future. I'm still doing my business and studying to
become an ordained minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy will learn today whether his business and studies will
be interrupted. It may be fortunate for him that he is being
sentenced in a state court, instead of in federal court, where
judges have less discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the potential maximum sentence is significantly higher
in state court _ Abernathy faces up to 150 years _ state sentences
vary more widely than federal ones. Legal experts say he won't
serve anything close to the maximum _ if he even sees the inside of
a jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that all judges look at,'' said criminal
defense attorney Jerry Froelich. ``They look at the good that an
official has done. They look at ... whether there was minor or
large harm to community; if it was a minuscule amount of money,''
said Froelich, who defended businessman Mack Wilburn in the
Hartsfield International Airport kickbacks trial. Wilburn was
acquitted in the federal case that sent former Atlanta City
Councilman D.L. ``Buddy'' Fowlkes, former Airport Commissioner Ira
Jackson and businessman Dan Paradies to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was found guilty on 83 counts of mail fraud in
connection with a scheme through which he received more than $1
million in illegal payments; 43 counts of accepting bribes; and
four counts of tax evasion. He was sentenced to 42 months in
federal prison. For one count of accepting a bribe and three counts
of tax evasion, Fowlkes got 41 months.
</P>
<P>
   Paradies, who owned an airport gift shop, was convicted on 83
counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy for his role in a
scheme to bribe as many as five members of the Atlanta City
Council. He was sentenced to 33 months.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta attorney Larry Thompson, who defended Paradies in the
airport case, said judges tend to weigh practical aspects such as
the nature of the offense and whether there were aggravating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In Abernathy's case, there were no serious aggravating aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Also, judges tend to take into consideration the public scrutiny
and notoriety brought to bear in cases involving public officials,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that would probably count toward a sentence that would not
be a severe sentence,'' said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   William Boone, associate professor of political science at Clark
Atlanta University, agrees. ``I think most folks probably would
argue that ... he was judged guilty and that would suffice. Jail
time is probably not necessary,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, society wants a system of justice that is stable and
even-handed, Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're really trying to do in this instance is send a
message to a certain population that this kind of behavior won't be
tolerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta), an Abernathy family friend, said
he is amazed the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't understand why the attorney general would want
to prosecute such a case of low value in terms of money. You're
talking about a conviction based on $5,000 over a 10-year period.
I've looked at all the evidence the state brought to trial and,
from my knowledge, I'm convinced he's innocent. I'm convinced he's
not stolen a penny,'' said Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks thinks it would be unfair for Abernathy to serve prison
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the Legislature over 10 years and I've seen $10
million dollars stolen and embezzled, and people get probation,''
said Brooks.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lockheed Martin Corp.'s latest restructuring includes
mixed news for its Marietta, Ga., plant.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing defense giant said Thursday it will consolidate
management of all aircraft business in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That will eliminate a division headquarters and another 830 or
so jobs at the Marietta plant, which is already undergoing a
2,000-job cutback announced last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan leaves the plant's assembly lines and other
programs intact, for now quelling speculation that the entire
facility might be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means more layoffs, but that beats a shutdown,'' said
Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant at Teal Group in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Aeronautical Systems division based in
Marietta will be folded into a new Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co.
based at Lockheed Martin's Fort Worth plant.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the new unit will manage operations at all three of
the company's primary aircraft facilities in Fort Worth, Marietta
and Palmdale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been made on changes in any assembly work
right now,'' said Sam Grizzle, a spokesman at the Marietta plant.
``The company is still evaluating a variety of approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin, the nation's biggest
defense contractor, has been beset by troubles in various programs
and the slowdown in defense spending. Analysts also blame poor
management for the slide, which has depressed profits and cut
Lockheed Martin's stock price by more than half since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year the company disclosed it would consider shedding
or reorganizing core assets, including aircraft plants, as part of
its turnaround effort.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft management consolidation announced Thursday will
result in about 2,500 job cuts, to be spread equally among Fort
Worth, Marietta and Palmdale, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The new, streamlined Fort Worth unit will be led by Dain
Hancock, a corporate executive vice president in Bethesda. All
positions below him have yet to be filled, leaving the fate of the
Marietta top management team unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be making a final disposition on job changes for 30
days,'' Lockheed Martin spokesman Jim Fetig said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin said it expects the consolidation to generate
$175 million in annual savings. It said the savings will come from
a leaner management structure and centralized administrative
functions. It also said certain ``engineering, production
operations and material management'' functions will be
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   But details of the job cuts in Marietta are still being worked
out, Grizzle said. The cuts will take place over the next 18
months, with most finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of short-term impact, the job loss is not that
significant, but what you have to worry about is the quality of
jobs and when the top management goes, there is less incentive to
maintain the local operation here,'' said Roger Tutterow, an
economist at Kennesaw State University.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia said Lockheed's plan strikes a balance between shaking
up the status quo and preserving the company's basic capabilities.
The aviation analyst said the current setup, in which separate
business units at Marietta, Fort Worth and Palmdale answer to
corporate headquarters, contributed to poor strategic oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had developed into a rather feudal organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth plant, where Lockheed Martin makes the F-16
fighter and a portion of the F-22 fighter, was a logical choice as
the new management base, Aboulafia added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most commercially focused of the plants and also the
most successful at cost-cutting,'' he said. In addition, the plant
is expected to head up Lockheed Martin's work on the Joint Strike
Fighter if it wins a competition to build the planned multi-service
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia also contends keeping the Marietta plant's assembly
lines open is wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get rid of Marietta as a plant, you're cutting muscle
and bone,'' he said. ``If there's any kind of upturn in the defense
market they're going to need the capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's main product is the C-130J cargo plane, which has
suffered from development delays and poor initial sales. But the
outlook seems to be improving. In the past two months the company
bagged a handful of new foreign orders and persuaded the Air Force
to accelerate its future purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   The plant also does final assembly and testing on the F-22
fighter program, which survived a funding dogfight in Congress last
year and could face more attacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet, of JSA Research, contends
Lockheed Martin would save more money in the long run by moving
those programs to Fort Worth and abandoning Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would make sense economically, but not politically,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Georgia has lost clout on defense matters since the
departures of former Sen. Sam Nunn and House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
Nisbet believes Lockheed Martin is reluctant to narrow its base of
political support by closing plants. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), whose
district includes the Marietta plant, called Thursday's
announcement ``disappointing to all of us who have worked hard to
represent the workers of Lockheed's Marietta plant.'' But, he
added, ``our top goal of assuring the plant's survival has been
achieved for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing the Georgia delegation can do is stay focused
on the goal of ensuring adequate funding for the F-22 and C-130J
programs,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell said: ``I have been reassured that the F-22
and C-130J production lines in Marietta will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this decision is best for business,'' the Georgia
Republican added, arguing the cost of shutting down the Marietta
plant and moving its operations to Fort Worth is prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Illinois) is
scheduled to tour the Marietta plant and the F-22 assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's restructuring includes a management
consolidation of its space systems business in Denver. That move,
which will result in another 300 to 400 job cuts and projected
annual savings of up to $40 million, has no direct impact on the
Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions are the direct result of our continuing drive to
improve our customer focus, flatten our management structure and
enhance our financial performance,'' said Lockheed Martin Chairman
Vance Coffman.

 &HT;    Texas official calls removing battle flag `a slippery slope'
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Rick Perry says he understands why some
Texans might be offended by the Confederate battle flag, but he
believes it ``represents the heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, the Confederacy is part of history, is part of
our heritage,'' Perry told reporters Thursday regarding the flag, a
subject of recent protests nationally and locally. ``We're going to
have this debate, and that's fine. The point is I'm not going to
get my efforts and my energy pulled into that. I'm going to work
with ... the folks who want to be constructive and positive about
how we bring Texans of the 21st century together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and other presidential candidates repeatedly
have been asked whether South Carolina should stop flying the
battle flag. The use of the flag also has been an issue in Hays
County, where Hays High School flies it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said South Carolina voters and local Texas voters
should decide whether to display the flag. But the governor has not
said what he believes the flag represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognizes that it evokes different emotions in different
people,'' spokeswoman Linda Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he can see how the flag could be used as a symbol of
hatred, but added that he believes it's a symbol of Texas heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas branch of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People this month asked Bush to support efforts to
remove the battle flag from a plaque at the Texas Supreme Court
building, which was built in the 1950s with money from a
long-unused Texas Confederate veterans fund. Edwards said the
governor will respond soon to the request.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said removing the plaque would lead to calls to remove
other monuments and displays that offend other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you see the slippery slope you get on,'' Perry said.

story. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Egg: The Arts Show'' is one of those programs on the arts
that, by trying so darned hard to be preciously artsy in its own
sense, ends up not conveying much information very coherently.
Tonight's debut episode ``Art _ Who Needs It?'' doesn't
particularly address that question but takes a scattershot look at
populist art, including art in public places and a group that
brings members of a community into a theater production.
</P>
<P>
   There's one interesting sequence _ about works of art shoehorned
into every nook and cranny of a Brooklyn hardware store _ that in
the right hands would be a smart, funny little documentary, but
it's given a superficial once-over here.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's episode on dance _ ``Working Dancers'' _ is more
successful and shows the potential this series has. It has a more
vividly imagined visual sensibility _ there's a cool piece of
choreography staged at New York's Grand Central Terminal _ and its
quick-hit portrayals of dancers, both established and struggling,
are delivered almost interactively. As the camera circles a group
of dancers, it pauses on one and then another just long enough for
them to give a fairly incisive autobiographical sketch. In a short
time, they're able to convey their passion for their art.
</P>
<P>
   Not so of those featured in week three, focusing on ``The
Body,'' which again delves into hodgepodge territory. It opens with
Steven Wright telling a nearly irrelevant joke, before offering
such dubious observations as, ``The source of our fascination with
the body is the source of our fascination with ourselves'' _ huh? _
and a suggestion that an artist ``wants to eat the paint'' of his
own rendering of a nude. In 30 minutes, the show rambles from
classical nude paintings to contemporary photography to, oddly,
mummification and body manipulation such as tattoos and piercings.
</P>
<P>
   This, again, is occasion for blowhard observations: It's
referred to as ``the marking's of today's modern man,'' (as opposed
to, say, a ``fad'') and is given a historical and cultural context

<P>
   Whether or not Super Bowl XXXIV is remembered for the game that
the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans play on Sunday, it will
certainly enter the annals of advertising as Dot-Com Bowl I.
</P>
<P>
   But will consumers recall the commercial assault as a dot-comedy
of errors or as a turning point for dot-coms on the road to
respectability? That's the $135 million question _ the approximate
cost of all the commercials to run during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the 30-plus companies spending record sums to buy
commercial time during the game to generate attention and awareness
will be Web sites and electronic commerce entrepreneurs with
unfamiliar names like Computer.com, Epidemic.com, Healtheon/WebMD,
Lifeminders.com, Netpliance.com, OurBeginning.com, Oxygen Media and
Pets.com. Many have never advertised anywhere before, much less on
a Super Bowl, the premier event on the Madison Avenue calendar.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, only three dot-coms advertised on the Super Bowl
last year. The goal of the newcomers is to duplicate the success
enjoyed by the dot-coms in 1999; two, Hotjobs.com and the
Monster.com unit of TMP Worldwide, are returning to see if
lightning can strike twice.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have never been higher for companies gambling that
the value of the impressions they make by exposing themselves to
the 130 million or so Americans watching the game _ typically the
largest audience of the year for any television program _ will
justify the high cost of commercial time. The biggest threat is
that consumers will be unable to distinguish one dot-com from
another, turning what was intended as a shrewd strategy to get
noticed into a marketing blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms could negate each other and have a hard time
cutting through,'' said Robert Lachky, vice president for brand
management at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, the only beer advertiser
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the leader in our industry, coming off a record year,
the Super Bowl is money well spent,'' he added. ``For the dot-coms,
the issue is who will have a distinctly branded message.''
Anheuser-Busch is paying an estimated $17 million to run
commercials in every quarter for Budweiser and Bud Light beers _
almost $30 million if production, agency and other costs are
included.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is a tough place to stand out, period,'' said
Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative officer at the BBDO
New York unit of BBDO Worldwide, the Omnicom Group agency that is
creating Super Sunday spots for Federal Express, PepsiCo and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Sann continued: ``I was in San Francisco a month ago, driving up
101, and there was a billboard every two feet for a dot-com. It was
a blur. If it's a blur on the Super Bowl, you're going to be
throwing your money away.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers, dot-coms or not-coms, are spending an average of
about $2.2 million for each 30-second spot _ a heart-stopping
$73,333 a second. That's 37.5 percent more than a 30-second
commercial cost during Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999 and is believed to
be the largest year-to-year increase ever.
</P>
<P>
   The demand from dot-coms, amplified by the booming economy, led
ABC to charge the record rates; some spots sold for as much as $3
million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the advertising industry see the dot-com stampede as the
logical extension of the race into traditional media by Internet
marketers, a phenomenon that anyone who watched television,
listened to the radio or read a newspaper between Halloween and
Christmas could not help but notice.
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic demand for commercial time in the fourth quarter of
the Super Bowl game was initially perceived as ``a one-trick
pony,'' said Marv Goldsmith, president for sales and marketing at
the ABC Television Network in New York, part of the ABC unit of
Walt Disney Co. ``But now we're going to have the highest gross in
the history of our company for a first quarter,'' fueled by the
superior Super Bowl ad sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms are coming in as strong as they are for the same
reason as our basic, bedrock advertisers,'' Goldsmith said, ``to
build brand awareness, to introduce new campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a Super Bowl once a month,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the advertising industry worry that the dot-com
mania is a sign of outlandish excess in the way that wild gyrations
in the prices of mediocre stocks are a sign of a market top. They
wonder whether this might signal the beginning of the end of the
widespread presence of Internet marketers in mass-media
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies we haven't heard a lot about,'' said
Norm Rickeman, partner in the media and entertainment group at
Andersen Consulting in Minneapolis. ``They want to get their names
out there, make a big splash.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the wisdom of this strategy for some dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the commercial drives someone to a site and the
experience is not what it should be?'' Rickeman asked. ``If you
don't deliver, maybe you would have been better off spending the $3
million'' on improving the computer user's experience at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs indicate that some players in Dot-Com Bowl I might
not be ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, executives at Lifeminders.com, which offers a
personalized e-mail service, decided to buy Super Bowl time in late
November. But their agency refused to create a spot, complaining
that there wasn't enough time to produce anything worth running on
such a big event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to say you can't do things fast, but we didn't feel
comfortable that we could deliver our best product,'' said David
Lubars, co-president and creative director at Fallon McElligott in
Minneapolis, the Lifeminders.com agency. ``It was not in our best
interest, or the client's.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lifeminders.com executives made a low-budget spot on
their own. Crude type on screen proclaims, ``This is the worst
commercial on the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dot-coms may be vying for that dubious distinction, and not
on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're putting a disproportionate amount of your ad
spending behind a Super Bowl commercial, and you're just putting
your name out there without saying what kind of company you are,
it's not enough,'' said G. Michael Sievert, vice president for
marketing at the Etrade Group, the online brokerage firm, which
will run three commercials during the game and be the first dot-com
to sponsor a Super Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people focus on dot-coms, it plays to our advantage,''
Sievert asserted, ``because we've been pounding away at our
message, the value of taking charge of your own financial future,
for a long time'' _ well, a long time in Internet time, since
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of these companies, the Super Bowl might work,'' he
added, ``and it might not.'' The Etrade spots, part of an offbeat
campaign by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco, an
Omnicom agency, include one mocking the expectations for Super Bowl
commercials. The deliberately amateurish spot, featuring a monkey,
ends with this cheeky rejoinder: ``Well, we just wasted two million
bucks. What are you doing with your money?''
</P>
<P>
   One dot-com, Computer.com, is spending more than half the $5.8
million that is raised during its initial round of venture capital
financing to run three commercials before and during the game to
promote the startup of its Web site, which is aimed at novice
computer users. The spots were created by Merkley Newman Harty in
New York, part of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to write the check, so I took a big, deep breath,'' said
Mike Ford, president at Computer.com in Maynard, Mass., ``but it's
the only day of the year when everybody watches the commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Zapolin, chief executive at Computer.com, chimed in:
``Since our idea is to make computing easy for the 80 percent of
the people who say they don't feel comfortable with technology,
we're talking to a huge number of people. And the Super Bowl gives
you 100 million-plus people watching your commercial in a positive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   That appealed even to dot-coms that, unlike Computer.com, are
seeking more sophisticated consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly the largest audience we've ever reached,'' said
Randy Kilgore, executive director for marketing and sales at The
Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition in New York, a unit of Dow
Jones &AMP; Co. that will run a commercial for WSJ.com by Arnold
Communications in Boston, part of Snyder Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of many dot-com advertisers, said Neil Budde, editor
and publisher at WSJ.com, ``actually helps show the brand is part
of the dot-com world, a big player in the dot-com space.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional advertisers appear to be comfortable with so much
dot-company. ``We've got to stand out regardless of who else is
advertising,'' said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy
and marketing at Pepsi-Cola Co. in Purchase, N.Y. The company will
run two spots for Mountain Dew by BBDO New York during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms, like any packaged-goods marketer, have to be
remembered and give the broad audience an idea of what their brands
are about,'' she said. ``The only difference is the consumer isn't
bumping into them in the supermarket, so the better dot-com
commercials will give viewers a feeling of what the site experience
is.''

IRAQIS SEEM LESS HOSTILE TO NEW WEAPONS INSPECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraqi officials commented guardedly Thursday on
the choice of Hans Blix as the new chief weapons inspector to
finish disarming President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to Blix, who was approved on Wednesday by the
Security Council and formally appointed Thursday by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, has been markedly different from the
fever-pitch name-calling that greeted the nomination on Jan. 17 of
Rolf Ekeus, which was blocked in the Security Council. Both men,
Swedish diplomats and disarmament experts, had worked in Iraq in
the past, but it was apparent in Iraqi remarks Thursday that Blix
may be someone the Iraqis might accept, assuming the newly created
inspection commission, charged with overseeing the elimination of
any weapons of mass destruction still in Iraq, is allowed to
operate at all.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the Iraqis have said that they will not cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Nizar Hamdoon, a deputy
foreign minister and former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations,
said that ``the matter is more complicated than the issue of Blix
or the naming of a new commission.'' The real bar to cooperation,
he said, was the level of mistrust between the Security Council and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Babel, a newspaper run by Hussein's older son, Uday, seemed
Thursday to be gloating over the appointment of Blix. It ``surely
disappointed the hopes of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright,'' the paper said, adding that Blix owed his nomination to
Russia, France and China _ the three countries that opposed Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, Babel said, ``that the United States was
upset by the dumping of their employee, Rolf Ekeus'' whom it
characterized as a spy for Washington and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus was the executive chairman from 1991 to 1997 of the U. N.
Special Commission, Unscom, which destroyed biological, chemical
and missile stocks after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

`PRACTICE' TIME AFTER THE SUPER BOWL

<TEXT>
<P>
   So many appalling TV series have debuted after the Super Bowl
and promptly disappeared that it's apparent ABC has made a wise
move by giving its money slot to an established show that could
always use a larger audience, David E. Kelley's Emmy winner ``The
Practice.'' (On the West Coast, of course, the show will air in its
usual time period, a few hours after the game.)
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode is the first of a compelling two-part
whodunit. Lindsay (Kelli Williams) comes to Los Angeles at the
behest of an acquaintance accused of murdering a woman he claims he
never met. Discovering that the suspect's attorney has overlooked
the poor guy in favor of another deep-pocketed client, Lindsay
beckons boyfriend Bobby (Dylan McDermott), fellow partners Jimmy
(Michael Badalucco) and Ellenor (Camryn Manheim), and ditsy
assistant Lucy (Marla Sokoloff) to assist her in the pretrial
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Which will be harder than they figure _ the judge they've drawn
for this assignment, Harvey Cooper (Anthony Heald), is a fiercely
callous and conservative jurist who has no use for Bobby's smug,
confrontational demeanor and who has nothing but contempt for these
out-of-towners. Cooper fairly spits out the word ``Massachusetts,''
every time he mention's their home turf. The police and district
attorney are likewise immune to the firm's strongarm tactics _ to
Bobby and his partners, Southern California is simply a sunny
environment masking a sinister paramilitary legal operation. And
the requisite trickle of revelations are handily dispersed
throughout the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing ``The Practice'' to Los Angeles _ originally intended
as a cross-over with Kelley's since-canceled series ``Snoops'' _
accomplishes little dramatically in the end: Simply replace the
stock shots of Boston with ones of L.A. It's a bit of a stretch
that Lindsay would drag her partners all the way to L.A. _ or, at
least, that her partners would allow themselves to be dragged _
based simply on her hunch that a guy is innocent. And by placing
this episode in L.A., Kelley has inadvertently shot himself in the
foot. He has created a pretty compelling antagonist for Bobby and
his crew in Heald's Judge Cooper, but it would take some
questionable plot convolutions to reunite them for future clashes.
</P>
<P>
   But those are concerns to be worried over later. Tonight's
episode is all set-up, and all pretty effective. The resolution,
scheduled for Feb. 6, promises to be wildly explosive. &QL;

KUROSAWA, THE MAN AND HIS FILMS

<P>
   Alex Cox, whose own film career stalled after the initial
promise of the 1984 cult film ``Repo Man,'' essays the life of a
cinematic genius in tonight's ``Kurosawa: The Last Emperor.'' Cox
mixes the usual blend of clips from Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces _
``Roshomon,'' which introduced Japanese film to the West, as well
as ``Yojimbo,'' ``Seven Samurai,'' ``Throne of Blood,''
``Kagemusha'' and ``Ran'' _ with thoughts from colleagues and
industry heavy-hitters Francis Ford Coppola, John Woo, Bernardo
Bertolucci and Paul Verhoeven. The result is a serviceable
once-over for fans and the uninitiated alike, though a more
thoughtful, more thorough rumination would have been more
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Cox does some quick armchair psychology, matching moments from
the filmmaker's life to scenes they inspired in his films:
Kurosawa's brother's suicide becomes a moment in ``Kagemusha,''
while the bodies strewn across such films as ``Seven Samurai''
reflect the filmmaker's memory of a devastating earthquake in his
youth. Kurosawa's obsession with detail was such that he worked all
day with an actor to perfect the strut of a samurai for one simple
shot. The breathtaking hailstorm of arrows that rained upon Toshiro
Mifune in ``Throne of Blood'' is amusingly recalled _ the obviously
worried actor couldn't sleep the night before the sequence was
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   His mule-headedness is recalled as Russian filmmaker Andrei
Konchalovsky recalls that Kurosawa was insulted when he tried to
debate the virtues, or lack thereof, of Lenin _ he would not brook
disagreement with his pronouncements. Cox also touches on his
despairing suicide attempt after the filmmaker's disastrous
flirtation with Hollywood, on ``Tora Tora Tora.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa was about film, and virtually nothing else _ if he
didn't have a project in the works, he had nothing to talk about,
one friend tells us. Another puts it, ``If he didn't work, there
wasn't any Kurosawa around.'' He made movies, one colleague recalls
him saying, because if he could make straightforward statements,
``I would have written it on a placard and held it up instead.''
And Verhoeven underscores that Kurosawa was also that rarity, an
artist: He returns to his films to see ``why I wanted to become a
filmmaker,'' and, he adds regretfully, ``and look what I'm doing
now _ special effects.'' &QL; 
____ &QL;

GAY HISTORY EXPLORED IN `COMMON GROUND'

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Common Ground,'' premiering tonight on Showtime, is a
sometimes clumsy, sometimes pedantic anthology film essaying the
gay experience from 1954 to the present, all set in a sleepy New
England town. (HBO's upcoming ``If These Walls Could Talk 2'' will
offer roughly the same structure, but limits the drama to lesbian
stories).
</P>
<P>
   Its first story, ``A Friend of Dorothy,'' is both its oddest and
its least subtle, actually intimating in a strange way that old
bigoted saw, that gays in fact do try to recruit fresh blood. In
it, a gay Naval officer (Jason Priestley) assumes that a young
woman (Brittany Murphy) in the Navy is interested in him, a gay
man, because she herself is gay. He leads her to a gay bar that is
subsequently raided; she loses her commission and is rejected in
her hometown, except by a lesbian who suggests she head to
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The second segment, written by playwright Terrence McNally, is
the strongest, concerning a gay '70s-era high-school teacher
(Steven Weber) who allows his fear of being outed to prevent him
from helping a student (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) seeking his
counsel. Both Weber and Thomas do strong work, and the issues
tackled are both thornier and more realistically depicted than
elsewhere in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, a present-day vignette written by Harvey Fierstein is a
jokey, slight piece about a gay guy who gets cold feet on his
wedding day, and his mildly homophobic father (Ed Asner) who talks
him out of it. If this section is any indication, gay people
apparently can't spout three lines of conversation without
mentioning their homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   A heterosexual character played by Eric Stoltz narrates all
three vignettes, continually making a sane plea for understanding;
he's conveniently on hand when things wrap up too tidily with a
treacly conclusion cribbed directly from the movie ``Places in the
Heart.'' &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Common Ground.'' &QL;

 &HT;    McCain, Bush trade fire over tax cut proposal
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain brushed off
criticism from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Thursday that his
tax plan is too much like a Democrat's.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a line he first used in Wednesday's debate, McCain
said Bush ``keeps spinning like Bill Clinton.'' McCain has proposed
a $237 billion tax cut plan, but would devote more than 60 percent
of anticipated budget surpluses to Social Security and paying down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting his campaign's growing confidence in advance of
Tuesday's primary, McCain also urged Bush to refrain from negative
campaigning. ``I'd hope we discuss the issues and debate them,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Nashua, made an appeal to core Republican
voters. ``It's important to nominate somebody who will be able to
debate the Democrat nominee, not mimic them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also picked up the endorsement of Jack Kemp, the 1996
Republican vice presidential nominee. Kemp criticized McCain as
being ``obsessed with debt reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp called another Bush rival Steve Forbes a ``good friend''
but said, ``Governor Bush is the one who can inspire the Congress,
who can inspire the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Large, enthusiastic crowds greeted McCain in eastern New
Hampshire, where he called his time in the Granite State ``the
greatest experience of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his proposal to ban soft money, unlimited and
unregulated donations to political parties, makes him better able
to hammer Vice President Al Gore on Democratic fund-raising abuses
in 1996. ``It's much easier for me to attack Clinton and Gore
because I have the high ground,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has called McCain's plan harmful to the GOP, but McCain has
vowed to fight for campaign finance reform ``to my last breath.''
He will begin airing an ad today that appeals to New Hampshire's
independent streak. The ad says voters ``can send a powerful

NUN SAYS REFUGEE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE US

<P>
   MIAMI _ The curious case of Elian Gonzalez took another
surprising twist Thursday when the nun who had provided her house
as a neutral meeting site for the 6-year-old and his grandmothers
declared that she thought Elian should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a fear she sensed from the grandmothers, Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin said, ``I do not think that this child will be able to
live without fear if he goes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the grandmothers revisted Capitol Hill Thursday and
again asked members of Congress to oppose legislation that would
grant US citizenship to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The case is also playing out in federal court in Miami, where
district Judge William Hoeveler Thursday said he will rule in
mid-March on whether he has jurisdiction in a lawsuit by Elian's
Miami relatives seeking political asylum for the boy. Because
Attorney General Janet Reno has said the case should be allowed to
proceed in court, Elian appears likely to remain in this country
for at least another six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of O'Laughlin, one of the most respected people in
South Florida, is yet another factor that could prolong the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant development because of her credibility
in Florida,'' said Dario Moreno, a political science professor at
Florida International University. ``The more time this takes to
develop, the higher the stakes become for each side.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, is one of the
first civic leaders outside the traditional anti-Castro activists
to say that Elian, who was rescued from the sea on Thanksgiving Day
after his mother and 10 others drowned, should stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most Miami leaders, including Catholic Church officials, have
stayed out of the controversy or issued measured statements
declaring that the case should be decided in court.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin comments were especially surprising because she was
asked to host the meeting by Reno, a longtime friend from Miami who
is urging Elian's return to Cuba. O'Laughlin plans to meet in
Washington Friday with Reno and Florida's two US senators, Connie
Mack and Bob Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in federal court here Thursday, the US Immigration
and Naturalization Service filed a massive brief urging the court
to dismiss the suit by Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents released were transcripts of the agency's
interview in Cuba with Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The
father said Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, had first said he
would return Elian immediately, but later said he could not do so
because it would look bad.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez also said his relatives had offered him $2
million, a house, and a car if he would leave Elian in the United
States, or come here to join his child.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying that I am being coerced by the Cuban
government,'' he said. ``However, you can see that they are the
ones being coerced by the Cuban community in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, in a television interview, denied that he had
ever said any of those things.
</P>
<P>
   The INS interviewed Juan Miguel Gonzalez twice, Dec. 13 at his
home in Cardenas and Dec. 31 at the home of a UNICEF representative
in Havana. ``Based on his demeanor, I had no reason to believe he
was being coerced,'' wrote Silma L. Dimmel, who heads the INS
office at the US mission in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have neither my consent nor my permission to be taking
the child here or there,'' Gonzalez said in the interview.
``Imagine their insensitivity, in taking that child to Disney World
and putting him on a boat ride when he had already suffered such an
ordeal. They forced him on the ride while he was crying and
screaming, not wanting to do so. It's abusive what they are doing
to Elian. The boy needs me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Washington, the grandmothers met with lawmakers and
recounted their meeting with Elian in Miami the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandson is a whole different boy. He has changed
completely. We have to save this boy as soon as possible,'' said
Mariela Quintana de Gonzalez, the paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Rodriquez, the maternal grandmother, said the longer
Elian is forced to remain in Miami, ``the more he is going to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But a group of the boy's Florida relatives also visited the
nation's capital, urging support for the citizenship bill. ``He
doesn't want to go back,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin of
Elian. ``I saw him approach his grandmothers and had the
opportunity to see his face, and it was still the face of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers disagreed. ``We told him we wanted to bring him
back to Cuba. He nodded his head yes,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of
Churches, which is sponsoring the grandmothers' trip to the US,
said that barring any new developments, the women would return to
Cuba Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said support for the citzenship bill seemed
to have lessened in recent days. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an
Illinois Republican, would not predict the outcome of the measure,
but said it would follow normal legislative procedures. Some
lawmakers now are lining up behind a bill that would confer
permanent residency on Elian.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference Thursday, Reno said the Justice
Department had not taken a position on the constitutionality of the
pending bills.
</P>
<P>
   But she continued to say that the boy should be returned to
Cuba. ``If we got into a situation where, if American children
ended up abroad, and American parents wanted them returned, and a
foreign country made them a citizen so they did not return,'' she
said. ``I don't think people in the United States would be very
happy about that.''

CONSUMER GOODS COMPANIES FALL OFF THE FAST TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growth companies find it hard to stay on the fast track forever.
</P>
<P>
   That truism was made clear this week by Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP;
Gamble, two of the world's pre-eminent makers of consumer goods.
Coca-Cola announced sweeping layoffs, and P&AMP;G tried to make a deal
for American Home Products and Warner-Lambert. Both moves had one
goal: restoring the rapid growth in profits that investors once
took for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, shares of packaged-goods companies were on top of
the world. Profits were rising a predictable 15 percent a year, and
shares in companies like P&AMP;G, H.J. Heinz, Kimberly-Clark and
Coca-Cola were outpacing the overall market's gains by 3-1. Brand
names on products like Tide detergent, Clorox bleach and Colgate
toothpaste were as good as money in the bank. And consumer goods
companies soon became the subjects of big, frenzied takeovers by
other concerns eager for the fat profit margins and rapid growth
that soaps and cereals had long generated.
</P>
<P>
   Hot has now turned to ho-hum at many of these companies. Once
predictable profits are under pressure. Revenue growth has fallen
to the single digits for many.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods companies have become the victims of their own
past success and of significant shifts in consumer buying patterns.
Perhaps most ignominious, these masters of brand image have been
beaten at their own highly sophisticated game by retailers, the
very companies that used to be at their beck and call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the momentum of success carried them so they
didn't have to face the hard decisions,'' said Patrick R. Fallon,
chairman of the advertising company Fallon McElligott. ``They have
to get faster and more accountable. They are in an in-between
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a nice place to be. Procter &AMP; Gamble's sales in its recently
completed second quarter, for example, rose 7 percent. But expenses
increased at twice that rate, because of the high cost of marketing
and selling new products. And the company told stock analysts that
only a big cut in its tax rate, from 34.4 percent to 29 percent
over the next several years, will help it meet the high end of its
earnings growth target of 13 percent to 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, P&AMP;G shares, as well as other consumer goods
stocks, still command lofty prices when compared to their earnings
growth rates. P&AMP;G shares trade at 34 times trailing profits, 2.4
times the earnings growth rate. Colgate's stock trades at an even
bigger premium: Its price-earnings ratio of 42 is almost 3.2 times
its annual earnings growth rate. In the past, investors have been
unwilling to pay much more than 1.5 times a company's growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola faces some similar problems. Its management said on
Wednesday that it would have to lower the company's long-term
growth targets for both sales and earnings. Jennifer F. Solomon, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimates that the company's
earnings growth target of 15 percent to 20 percent a year will be
reduced to 12 percent to 14 percent. But Coca-Cola's stock trades
at 45 times trailing earnings, 3.5 times the lower growth rate.
Volume growth in the most recent quarter rose only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Growth has slowed at these companies for a variety of reasons,
both internal and external. For one, the U.S. population is growing
just 1.5 percent annually. Moreover, several years of low inflation
have left these companies unable to raise prices as they had in
years past.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding into overseas markets helped these companies'
performance in the 1980s and 1990s, but growth from foreign
operations has now leveled off as well. And the strong dollar is
hurting them, since they calculate foreign profits in U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies have to find profit growth some other way
_ by cutting costs, as Coca-Cola is doing with layoffs, or by
acquiring faster-growing companies, as P&AMP;G hoped to do by combining
with American Home and Warner-Lambert.

 UNDATED: and Warner-Lambert. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Managements of P&AMP;G and Coca-Cola get high ratings from some
quarters for addressing the issue of slower growth. ``It is the
real penalty of leadership,'' said Laurel Cutler, who has been a
consultant to both of these companies and is a former top
advertising executive. ``When you're that good and that successful,
your methods, your training, your code and culture have worked so
well for so long it is virtually impossible in the absence of a
major threat or some deep peril to force change.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies with stables of famous consumer brands face formidable
competition today from companies like Wal-Mart and Dayton Hudson's
Target unit that had once been thought of as customers. So-called
private-label merchandise from these retailers is giving shoppers
lower-cost alternatives to name brands in almost every consumer
product category.
</P>
<P>
   House brands are, as a result, an increasingly powerful force in
supermarkets, drug chains and mass merchandisers across the nation.
In 1998, the most recent period for which data are available, store
brands accounted for 51 percent of the unit growth seen at these
retailers, according to the Private Label Manufacturers
Association. In supermarkets, store brands accounted for almost 20
percent of unit sales in 1998, up from 18.4 percent five years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has been especially aggressive in developing its house
brands. It recently bought the White Cloud name from P&AMP;G to put on
its own brand of toilet tissue and introduced its own laundry
detergent to compete with Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers like house brands because they produce considerably
more profit than name-brand goods. Consumers find the brands
comparable to name brands in quality and usually lower in price.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation has also given retailers more influence with
manufacturers. The top 10 supermarket chains account for nearly 40
percent of stores in the United States today; a few years ago the
top 10 accounted for roughly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a shift in power to the retailers,'' said Mary
S. Pollack, editor of Supermarket Strategic Alert newsletter.
``Retailers control the shelf space, and as retailers have
consolidated, they are using their buying clout with manufacturers.
That's put pressures on manufacturers not to raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the retailers were building their own brands,
manufacturers were cheapening theirs with heavy promotions like
discount coupons. Although coupons helped make name-brand products
more affordable, they encouraged consumers to switch among brands.
This helped destroy brand loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants also say that many large-company brand managers are
risk averse and make decisions based on data that reflect the past.
``They are being whipped by the entrepreneurial companies, where
you are dealing with people who know why they got into the business
and know what's different or better about what they're offering,''
Ms. Cutler said. ``They're beating the rear-view people all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods companies may also be finding it hard to compete
for talent with the siren song of the Internet start-up. Marketing
jobs with packaged- goods giants used to attract top business
school graduates. Now such old-economy jobs may pale next to the
chance to blaze a trail in the new economy. According to the
Harvard Business School, 18 percent of its 1999 graduates took jobs
with high-technology companies, double the portion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is counting Procter &AMP; Gamble, Coca-Cola or other big
consumer brand companies out of the game. But reinventing
themselves is not going to be easy. ``They've woken up,'' Fallon
said, ``and understand they have to make some pretty dramatic
moves.''

MIRRORING HEATING OIL JUMP, DIESEL PRICES ROAR UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Driven by the same forces affecting heating oil, diesel fuel
prices have soared in New England over the last week, prompting
brokers and trucking companies to slap surcharges on the cost of
shipping everything from food to furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has yet to show up on supermarket shelves in the form
of higher consumer prices. ``But it will . . . if it lasts long
enough,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey of diesel prices in New England, conducted
Monday, found prices at the pump averaging $1.84 a gallon. By
Thursday, the price at stations on the Massachusetts Turnpike had
reached $1.91 a gallon. Drivers and trucking companies were
reporting prices of $2.00 and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can remember, it hasn't been this high in 10
years,'' said Joseph Pendergast, supply analyst for the state
Division of Energy Resources. He said the rapid rate of the hike
was particularily alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, the average price in New England was $1.44 a
gallon. On Jan. 10, freight operators in Massachusetts say, it was
as low as $1.31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's skyrocketing,'' said Ted Parker, chief operating officer
of Parker Express Inc., an Avon freight carrier. ``No one ever
expected it to go this high this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said his firm, which operates a fleet of 68 long-haul
trucks, was forced this week to add a 3 percent to 5 percent ``fuel
surcharge'' on loads it ships, depending on the load and the
contract. He said he delayed the action longer than many trucking
firms, gambling that rising rates would level off. ``I lost,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the surcharges, Parker and other freight operators say
they are having to stretch for credit to cover the fuel bills while
waiting for payment on shipping contracts. ``We just bought 10,000
gallons Thursday,'' Parker said. ``You have to front a lot of money
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of diesel is highest in the Northeast, government
officials say, but the price of the fuel is approaching record
levels nationally too. John Cook, head of the petroleum information
unit in the US Department of Energy, said the current national
average diesel price _ $1.42 a gallon _ is the highest since the
Gulf War in 1990 when it topped out at $1.50 a gallon. ``That's
pretty pricey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel prices are mirroring the runup in home heating oil
because both are so-called ``distillate'' from number two crude
oil. Petroleum specialists say the only difference is a lower
sulfur content in diesel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the demand on heating oil that is driving up the price
of diesel,'' said Jack Sullivan, chief operating officer for the
New England Fuel Institute in Cambridge, Mass. But the root cause
for the spike in the cost of both, he said, is a sudden surge of
cold in the Northeast and a shortage of oil stock due to a
production cap set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said his organization is lobbying Washington to have
OPEC remove the cap. In the meantime, he noted, up to 10 oil ships
are en route to New York, which should ease the immediate crisis
and result in lower prices in a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some really good signs that relief is coming,'' he
said.

TITANS OR RAMS? TWO OPPOSING PREDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE TITANS WILL WIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE FREEMAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Williams, Tennessee's defensive coordinator, was asked how
difficult it is for an offense to play the week following a game
against Tampa Bay's hard-hitting defense. A smile went across
Williams' face.
</P>
<P>
   After St. Louis had beaten Tampa Bay in the National Football
Conference championship game, Rams players were limping around as
if they had just played two games instead of one. That is why
Williams was smiling. He knows that this season, teams did not fare
well the week after having faced Tampa Bay. They usually start
slowly because the Bucs' physical play would still be having an
effect. Tennessee coaches talked about this fact in their meetings
this past week, and Williams plans to be aggressive with his calls
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys like it when I tell them, `We're not holding back,'''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Said cornerback Dalnon Sidney: ``When you take it to the Rams
early, you can unsettle them. That's our approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee defense has not received its due for just how
daring, and good, it is. The Titans may not have the speed at
linebacker that the Buccaneers do, but over all, they still have
good quickness. And because of Williams and coach Jeff Fisher, they
have solid defensive schemes to match.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be the Tennessee's secondary _ and the beginning of
the game. St. Louis has scored 123 first-quarter points, most in
the NFL, and mainly through the air. Tennessee likes to play a lot
of man to man, a scheme that worked when the Titans defeated the
Rams earlier this season. In that game, St. Louis had 25 snaps with
four wide receivers and 20 snaps with three receivers. While other
teams have crumbled when St. Louis went to those receiver packages,
the Titans stayed firm. They will again. Titans, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE RAMS WILL WIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS GEORGE &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The glamour offense in this Super Bowl belongs to St. Louis,
which in the regular season scored 526 points, the third-most in
National Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kurt Warner threw 41 touchdown passes, 12 of them to
receiver Isaac Bruce, 8 to receiver Az-Zahir Hakin and 5 to running
back Marshall Faulk. No Titan caught more than 4 touchdown passes.
Faulk rushed for 1,381 yards, 77 more than Tennessee's Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
   Offense is the staple of today's pro game, but for those who
believe that defense is essential to winning championships, the
Rams defense is the front-runner there, too. It allowed an average
5.37 yards per pass attempt, the Titans 6.05. The Rams allowed 33.8
percent in third-down conversion percentage, the Titans 35 percent.
It gained 57 sacks, the Titans 54.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are balanced, but the Rams have more balance. And
their ability to strike deep from any spot on the field makes them
more suited to jump ahead or to climb from behind. St. Louis is
simply more dangerous and capable of coloring the complexion of
this game on both sides of the ball, even in its special teams,
masterfully coached by Frank Gansz. Expect the Rams to play with
more flash, with more flair. Rams, 27-23.

   CLINTON-UNION (Washington) _ President Clinton will propose a
$350 billion tax cut in his final State of the Union address,
urging relief from the marriage penalty and a new program of
retirement savings accounts. By GREG McDONALD. (State of Union
address begins at 9 p.m. EST.)CLINTON-SPEECH (Washington) _ What a
difference a year makes. When President Clinton last addressed

HANCOCK IPO A TOUGH SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Financial Services Inc. met a chilly
reception on Wall Street Thursday, as the venerable Boston life
insurer entered a new era of public ownership amid a grim climate
for stocks in financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Hancock, now owned by investors after 138 years in
policyholders' hands, gained little on their first day of trading
after the company raised $1.73 billion in an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball legend Hank Aaron stood next to Hancock leaders at the
New York Stock Exchange, where the insurer's chief executive,
Stephen Brown, rang the opening bell. Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy
Sosa failed to show up for a scheduled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock shares, which opened at 17 3/4, rose nearly 8 percent
above their initial offering price of 17 before slumping to close
at 17 5/8. The final gain is a mere 3.6 percent above Hancock's
initial price.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy, with nearly one-third of the company's 102
million shares changing hands in the morning. The activity, which
pushed Hancock to an early high of 18 5/16, made the Boston insurer
the second most active stock on US exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite temporary bragging rights to being the insurance
industry's second-largest initial stock sale _ an honor it will
soon lose to bigger competitors preparing for Wall Street listings
_ Hancock was a tough sell to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't exactly a dot-com,'' said Ira Zuckerman, an
industry analyst at Nutmeg Securities, referring to the sky-high
returns of Internet and other technology stocks. Many such stocks
skyrocket on their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of sex appeal to this story,'' added
Zuckerman. ``It's a value stock in a market where value has not
been too hot. But it's a good value _ if they can continue to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the nation's 13th largest life insurer has an
enviable brand name, highly regarded management, and a relatively
high return on equity of 12 percent. Banc of America Securities and
Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods both rated Hancock a ``buy,'' with 12-month
target prices of $23 and $22, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the near-term prospects for Hancock shares, Brown
said, ``I don't worry a lot about the short-term. We think we have
the best story (among insurers) to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a depressed environment for shares in banks, brokerages,
and especially insurers made the timing of Hancock's debut tough.
</P>
<P>
   Fears over the effect of rising interest rates on profits
depressed stocks of property and casualty insurers by 23.9 percent
last year and pushed down life and health insurers 9.6 percent,
according to SNL Securities. By contrast, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stock index rose 19.5 percent, and the technology heavy Nasdaq
soared 85.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With stock markets buoyant, ``it's a question of where IPO
investors want to put their money _ in a life insurer or in a tech
company,'' said Elizabeth Malone, an analyst at Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance analyst at Waddell &AMP; Reed, a Kansas mutual fund
firm that bought an unspecified number shares in Hancock, said that
while Hancock had attracted lots of smaller investors, big
institutional investors seemed wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical portfolio manager has a weighting in financial
services,'' said the analyst, Kenneth McQuade. ``He has to ask
himself whether to add to it by selling maybe some technology
stocks, or by getting rid of depressed insurance stocks he already
holds for what is basically another depressed stock.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuade said demand for Hancock shares initially outstripped
supply by three to one. ``There was enough demand for them to get
the deal done,'' added one analyst who declined to be identified.
``The real question is to what extent this interest is going to be
sustained in weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   A raft of giant insurers, including Metropolitan Life, are
expected to convert to shareholder-owned companies in coming
months, potentially glutting the market for life insurance stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock must also consider whether its plan to encourage some of
its 660,000 policyholders who are now stock owners, generally of
small lots, to sell their shares could hurt its share price. The
project, to be carried out in coming months, is designed to help
the insurer save on administrative costs. But it could backfire if
Hancock's share price languishes, prompting too many
policyholder-investors to cash out, depressing the stock price even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.,
Hancock went public to gain a currency for growth and acquisitions.
With lead underwriter Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Hancock went out
at 1.1 times book value _ a first for a mutual insurer, Brown said.
The company now has a market capitalization of $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock calmed some investors earlier this week by announcing a
$134 million after-tax charge for the last quarter to cover losses
on controversial reinsurance contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer initially faced around $1 billion in gross exposure
before reaching settlements with reinsurance participants.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hancock must convince investors that it can prosper and
expand. The company has given itself two years to prove it can
boost earnings by 15 percent a year.

 &HT;    Knicks may still have Hawk's number
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been eight months and four days since the New
York Knicks completed their sweep of the Atlanta Hawks in the
second round of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks exposed an Atlanta squad that was stripped _ by
injury, fatigue and advanced age _ of its will to win and ability
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The new-look Hawks that will take the court tonight at Philips
Arena against the Knicks can look at the squad at the opposite end
and know that the Knicks are, in part, the reason so much has
happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Knicks did was make all our problems painfully
apparent to everyone,'' general manager Pete Babcock said Thursday.
``But the truth is, we all knew long before that series that we
would have to do some things to become younger, deeper and more
athletic.
</P>
<P>
   In successive losses, the Hawks scored 92, 70, 78 and 66 points
against the Knicks in the second round series; it was a record for
futility. And it is no coincidence that only Dikembe Mutombo and
Alan Henderson, who was injured for all but four minutes in the
series, return as the only starters from that team. Seven of the
current 13 Hawks are newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   To Atlanta's chagrin, change has not improved the Hawks
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Knicks, they are bolstered by the return of center
Patrick Ewing. They are comfortably winning 60 percent of their
games and are within a game of Atlantic
</P>
<P>
   Division-leader Miami, two victories behind Indiana for best
record in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks might be no closer to their goal of winning a title _
they were crushed again by the league champion San Antonio last
week _ but they remain in the upper echelon of their conference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hawks, even though recast in the Knicks' image of
speed and explosives with Jim Jackson at small forward and Isaiah
Rider at shooting guard, will have to fight merely to advance to a
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks being the Knicks, simply playing and winning a large
share of its games is not sufficient. New Yorkers must wrestle with
nuances of gesture, phrase, demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, coach Jeff Van Gundy indicated that he had been
told to smile more often and express more optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Some people wondered about the wisdom of retaining Ewing, the
team's center since 1985. Ewing, an 11-time all-star is six points
away from 23,000 for his career and is 36th all-time in minutes
played with more than 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others wondered about Ewing's impact on the Knicks' speed game,
his intimidation of smaller, quicker teammates who want to play
more freely and his willingness to accept a lesser role in the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was the big name in FBI reports that claimed NBA players
have frequented the Atlanta Gold Club. The Charleston Post-Courier
reported that dancers from that club were sent to Charleston, S.C.,
in April 1997 to entertain certain Knicks while they were preparing
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Van Gundy was pressed on matters of his
players' deportment before they arrived Thursday amid the social
whirl attendant to the Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked why the Knicks took a train back to New York on
Wednesday rather than fly directly here after Tuesday night's
Washington postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy told reporters that he is viewing this trip as he does
any other. ``You can find trouble if you want to find it,'' he
said. ``If you have the right guys, the priority will stay on
winning. And if you don't have the right guys, it doesn't matter
where you go; the priority won't be on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Charlie Ward acknowledged the situation of NBA
players. ``We always have time on our hands, and we always have to
be disciplined,'' Ward said. ``Some guys take advantage of it, and
some guys don't and make mistakes.''

OFFICIALS EXPECT RECORD PRIMARY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As Bill Bradley continued to assail Al Gore,
and George W. Bush criticized John McCain, the New Hampshire
Secretary of State Thursday predicted that the heated contests in
both party primaries would produce a record turnout at the polls
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   William Gardner, the Secretary of State, estimated that 191,000
Republican ballots and 160,000 Democratic ballots will be cast next
week, more votes than in any previous New Hampshire primary.
Gardner based his figures on absentee ballots, conversations with
town clerks and a bit of guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when the economy is good, people don't vote,'' Gardner
said. But the closeness of the races in both parties is likely to
counter that truism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tension between the Democratic candidates continued
to mark their primary as the more disagreeable of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was Day 2 of the newly combative Bradley as he
continued to portray Gore as unfit for the presidency because Gore
has violated the public trust with a dishonest campaign against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't care enough about people to tell the truth in a
campaign, how do they know you're going to care enough about them
to push for health care or good education in this country,''
Bradley said on the shore of Great Bay in Stratham after receiving
the endorsement of numerous New Hampshire environmental leaders.
``That's a fundamental question of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley denied that he abruptly forsook his kid-gloves approach
to the campaign in an effort to shore up his fragile political
fortunes. He suffered a decisive loss in the Iowa primaries and had
recently slipped in the New Hampshire polls.
</P>
<P>
   New Globe/WBZ tracking figures showed the vice president
maintaining his lead over Bradley, , following their acrimonious
debate Wednesday night. Bradley and Gore are scheduled for what may
be their last face-to-face meeting before the primary Friday night
at a state party fund-raiser in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   Of his counterattack against Gore, Bradley said, ``I waited a
long while to make it. . . .But I felt it was important to do. I
had built up the credibility in New Hampshire over the last year,
and I thought as the voters went in to make their decision in the
last week of the campaign they needed to know they had been subject
to misrepresentations and misleading statements by my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said he had resisted appeals from some of his
advisers and supporters to make a face-to-face attack on Gore. But
they said he decided to make his stand in New Hampshire rather than
wait until the five-week interlude before the March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was a way of saying, `Enough is enough,' '' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, dismissed Bradley's accusations and said it is
Bradley who is the negative campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how someone can condemn negative attacks
while in the same breath can make negative attacks,'' Gore told
reporters after speaking to workers at Silk Net, a high-tech firm
here.
</P>
<P>
   With multiple candidates in the Republican race, the tone was
far less bruising Thursday as Bush picked up a plum endorsement,
McCain continued his town hall tours and Steve Forbes visited a
Nashua restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bush brought Jack Kemp, the 1996 vice presidential nominee, with
him to the Sanders plant in Nashua, where Kemp praised Bush and
Bush took a whack at McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when the Republicans go into the booths in New
Hampshire and around the country, it's important to nominate
somebody who will be able to debate the Democratic nominee on key
issues, not mimic them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a McCain remark in the Wednesday night debate made his
point. ``When he said his tax plan was similar to President
Clinton's tax plan, it made it real clear the difference of opinion
on taxes,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   What McCain actually said, however, was that Clinton had moved
toward a plan like his, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   During a long day of campaigning, McCain took his own jab at
Bush. ``I was surprised he took the day off today,'' he said. Bush
actually had three public campaign events before retreating from
sight during the afternoon.
</P>

 &HT;    Rocker's family not racist
 &HT;    By Doris Staton English
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a writer, I stand in awe of the power of the pen.
But the furor generated by the Sports Illustrated story on John
Rocker, my nephew, astounds me.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if any members of the media care about the pain and
suffering they have caused John's parents, Jake and Judy Rocker,
who have not a racist bone in their bodies? They have to endure
vulgar parodies on late-night television and on local radio
portraying them as racist trash.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta television station interviewed a psychiatrist who
suggested John's attitudes and words might stem from growing up in
a racist environment. Nothing could be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion with Macon Mayor Jack Ellis, Judy _ my sister _
said that racism or the lack of it is not defined by lip service
and flattery, but rather by whom you are willing to invite into
your home. Judy and Jake Rocker have quietly backed up their words
with actions.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they have opened their homes at no charge for room
and board to struggling Braves players (long before these players
were famous) regardless of color or nationality. These players had
limited means and no place to stay. Among those who have stayed for
brief periods and longer are Bruce Chen, Andruw Jones, Odalis
Perez, George Lombard, Glen Williams and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers opened their hearts as well as their homes to them.
Chen said they treated him like a son, and he meant it. Numerous
times, Jake would leave his work to go home and pick up Andruw, who
had overslept, and take him to the ballpark for practice.
</P>
<P>
   One year, when the Braves organization needed a place for their
young foreign pitchers to stay during pitching school that takes
place in Atlanta prior to spring training, they called Jake and
Judy and asked them to house them. Isn't it strange that none of
the so-called civil rights activists volunteered their Atlanta
homes, which would have been so much more convenient? No, the
Braves office said they would rely on John and the Rocker family to
assure the young men had transportation along with food and lodging
for the duration of the school. Why not ask these young men what
kind of reception they received from this so-called racist family?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, an upper-middle income family, are not privileged
with servants, chauffeur or cook. It was Judy who cooked, cleaned
and did linens without the help of maid service. Neither do they
have unlimited space. When John called and asked if Andruw Jones
could come live with them, she gave up her home office (she runs a
small advertising agency in her home) so Andruw would have a place
to stay. Another player was already staying in the guest room.
</P>
<P>
   I included these illustrations, not to exonerate John's
thoughtless remarks, nor to paint Judy and Jake as martyrs, but to
reveal to you something of the hearts of two wonderfully
compassionate people who are being maligned and parodied by a
merciless media that refuse to search for the truth.

 &HT;    Braves flippant in response to Rocker
 &HT;    By Joseph Lowery, Timothy McDonald and Michael Langford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   An Open Letter to Ted Turner:
</P>
<P>
   We would like to express our deep disappointment that you, in
particular, and the Braves organization in general, seem to have
taken the racist and bigoted remarks by pitcher John Rocker too
lightly. You have taken no disciplinary action, and your remarks
that he is ``just a kid'' and that it would be easier to do
something ``if he were not such a good pitcher'' reflect a cavalier
if not supercilious posture.
</P>
<P>
   We consider the scurrilous and bigoted remarks to be serious and
potentially dangerous. As pastors and community workers, we have
seen what at first appears to be innocuous intolerance degenerate
into more than verbal violence.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation with two of your associates, we urged prompt and
definitive action that would send a clear message that the Braves
organization has zero tolerance for this kind of behavior.
Regardless of what the commissioner of baseball may or may not do,
you and the Braves have a responsibility to the players, the fans
and to the community to take the kind of action that leaves no
doubt about where you stand. When we spoke to your colleagues, we
suggested that there were those in the community who would work
with you to find ways and means to help this confused young man in
the process of forgiveness and redemption. We were expecting
no-nonsense disciplinary action by the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we hear you saying there may be no disciplinary action and
he deserves a second chance. Most of us do not wish to deny him a
second chance. However, be not deceived. There must be no mocking
of the grave and solemn process of forgiveness and redemption. We
agree with those who opt for forgiveness, but we are stunned by
what appears to be a flippant disregard for the vile offenses
against teammates, fans and almost everybody else. Our
understanding of forgiveness and redemption is that they embrace a
divinely inspired process that involves repentance, contrition and
penitence. You have dispatched a negative message that this
reprehensible behavior is inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot pretend nor assume that Rocker's remarks were simply a
``slip of the tongue'' when they resonate more as a ``spilling of
the gut.'' He did not speak to the reporter ``off the top of his
head.'' It was a planned interview, and he seems to have spoken
``from the bottom of his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   We cling to the belief that Rocker can be forgiven and the hope
he can be redeemed. This does not exempt the sinner from
accountability. David, sinner and saint of the Old Testament, was
forgiven his transgression, but he paid a heavy toll and was not
allowed to build the Temple. The likelihood of Rocker's change and
growth is enhanced when he experiences the travail of remorse and
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Your statement about no accountability has sent a wave of
negative feelings across the community. We remember, Ted, that you
hired an African-American as Braves general manager long ago.
However, it was long ago, and we must move ahead to a brighter
future. We urge you to do the right thing. When we communicated
concern at your merging into the Time Warner conglomerate, you
assured us that the expanded structure would not dilute your social
sensitivity. Remember?
</P>
<P>
   This unfortunate affair can provide the opportunity to lift the
discussion about race and ethnicity and diversity in the new
millennium to new levels of meaning and helpfulness.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be good for Rocker, it will not be good for
baseball, it will not be good for your organization, it will not be
good for the community for such behavior to be whitewashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery is former president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. The Rev. Timothy McDonald is
president of Concerned Black Clergy and Michael Langford is
president of the United Youth Adult Conference. Several other
prominent African-American activists also signed the letter.

 &HT;    Rocker's family not racist
 &HT;    By Doris Staton English
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a writer, I stand in awe of the power of the pen.
But the furor generated by the Sports Illustrated story on John
Rocker, my nephew, astounds me.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if any members of the media care about the pain and
suffering they have caused John's parents, Jake and Judy Rocker,
who have not a racist bone in their bodies? They have to endure
vulgar parodies on late-night television and on local radio
portraying them as racist trash.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta television station interviewed a psychiatrist who
suggested John's attitudes and words might stem from growing up in
a racist environment. Nothing could be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion with Macon Mayor Jack Ellis, Judy _ my sister _
said that racism or the lack of it is not defined by lip service
and flattery, but rather by whom you are willing to invite into
your home. Judy and Jake Rocker have quietly backed up their words
with actions.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they have opened their homes at no charge for room
and board to struggling Braves players (long before these players
were famous) regardless of color or nationality. These players had
limited means and no place to stay. Among those who have stayed for
brief periods and longer are Bruce Chen, Andruw Jones, Odalis
Perez, George Lombard, Glen Williams and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers opened their hearts as well as their homes to them.
Chen said they treated him like a son, and he meant it. Numerous
times, Jake would leave his work to go home and pick up Andruw, who
had overslept, and take him to the ballpark for practice.
</P>
<P>
   One year, when the Braves organization needed a place for their
young foreign pitchers to stay during pitching school that takes
place in Atlanta prior to spring training, they called Jake and
Judy and asked them to house them. Isn't it strange that none of
the so-called civil rights activists volunteered their Atlanta
homes, which would have been so much more convenient? No, the
Braves office said they would rely on John and the Rocker family to
assure the young men had transportation along with food and lodging
for the duration of the school. Why not ask these young men what
kind of reception they received from this so-called racist family?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, an upper-middle income family, are not privileged
with servants, chauffeur or cook. It was Judy who cooked, cleaned
and did linens without the help of maid service. Neither do they
have unlimited space. When John called and asked if Andruw Jones
could come live with them, she gave up her home office (she runs a
small advertising agency in her home) so Andruw would have a place
to stay. Another player was already staying in the guest room.
</P>
<P>
   I included these illustrations, not to exonerate John's
thoughtless remarks, nor to paint Judy and Jake as martyrs, but to
reveal to you something of the hearts of two wonderfully
compassionate people who are being maligned and parodied by a
merciless media that refuse to search for the truth.

FRANCE SHOCKED BY BOOK DETAILING CONDITIONS IN LA SANTE PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When Dr. Veronique Vasseur began working at La Sante
prison in Paris, the experience was so shocking that she started
keeping a diary.
</P>
<P>
   Within days she had met inmates so deranged or depressed that
they had swallowed rat poison, forks or drain cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Skin diseases were rampant because showers were only available
twice a week, though temperatures sometimes soared to more than 100
degrees in cramped cells holding four prisoners each.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates stuffed their clothes in the cracks in their cells to
keep the rats out, and most of the mattresses were full of lice and
other insects. Some of the weaker prisoners, Dr. Vasseur came to
understand, had been turned into slaves by their cellmates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vasseur's account of her work at La Sante over the last
seven years has just hit the bookstands, and it has caused an
uproar, prompting even the justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou to
admit that France's prison system is not something it can be proud
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in a lot of our prisons is not worthy of a
country such as ours,'' Ms. Guigou said, shortly after the first
excerpts from Dr. Vasseur's book, ``Chief Doctor at La Sante
Prison,'' began appearing in the press.
</P>
<P>
   While the French pride themselves on being standard bearers for
human rights, Dr. Vasseur's book has brought home some hard truths
</P>
<P>
   To start with, nearly half of the country's 55,000 prisoners
have never been convicted, a fact that has repeatedly drawn
criticism from the European Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 124 inmates committed suicide in 1999, giving French
prisons one of the highest suicide rates among European
penitentiaries. By comparison, California, with a state inmate
population of about 160,000, had 24 suicides in 1999, according to
the Department of Corrections. (American prison experts point out,
however, that a large proportion of such suicides in the United
States occur in local jails and thus are not reflected in state
figures.)
</P>
<P>
   While the presumption of innocence is a benchmark of most
democratic states, the law here allows investigating magistrates to
put suspects in jail indefinitely without trial or bail. On
average, inmates who have not yet been tried spend four months in
jail. But some have spent far longer, and then been freed when the
magistrate has decided that there is not enough evidence to bring
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any effort to keep those awaiting trial from
sharing cells with those serving long sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot work and see the things I saw and not speak out,''
said Dr. Vasseur, who seems completely overwhelmed by the attention
she is getting. ``If I said nothing, I would be an accomplice to
all this, and that I cannot tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, some of France's most famous former prisoners _
including former ministers, top business people and the political
activist Jose Bove, who went to jail for vandalizing a McDonald's
restaurant _ signed a petition deploring prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Foul cells, systematic rape, humiliation of visiting families,
crude health care, drug dealing by guards and detention of young
offenders in cells with seasoned criminals has turned the country's
prisons into factories of crime and misery, the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   One former mayor who signed the petition, Jean-Michel Boucheron,
said that when he was jailed for corruption, his cell at La Sante
was just above the punishment blocks. ``My eyes stung regularly
from the tear gas thrown into isolation cells by guards,'' he said.
In another prison, he said, he had to ``paddle'' through ``blood
left by a prisoner who committed suicide after banging on his cell
door all night without getting help.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding last week to a mountain of inquiries, French
officials allowed journalists a rare look inside the walls of La
Sante, a penitentiary that has in its 133-year history housed such
famous prisoners as the poets Paul Verlaine and Guillaume
Apollinaire and, more recently, the convicted assassin known as
Carlos. Public guillotinings used to take place just outside its
gates. During World War II, Resistance fighters were executed
there.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials contend that Dr. Vasseur's book fails to take
into account the improvements that have been made in recent years,
including a fresh coat of paint and an increase in educational and
entertainment activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an element of generalization that gives a very wrong
impression,'' said Alain Jego, the warden of La Sante, before
offering a two-hour tour of the building. ``I'd be an idiot if I
said there was no violence, no rape. But the book gives the
impression it's 10 a day, and that is not so.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was built in the 1860s, La Sante was considered a model
of reform and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But little has changed there since. Inmates, often grouped in
threes and fours, spend all but four hours a day in their cells,
which are usually about 30 feet square, with solid metal doors and
tiny peepholes. Even those with prison jobs like sorting pamphlets
or assembling gadgets often do the jobs in their cells. And what
goes on behind the doors is impossible to see.
</P>
<P>
   Among other horrors, Dr. Vasseur describes rapes, bizarre
self-mutilations, attempted suicides and the practice of turning
the weakest cellmates into slaves.
</P>
<P>
   When prisoners want something, they can activate lights outside
their cells. But during the tour, many lights were on, and it was
clear that responding to them was not a priority. At the moment,
the prison holds 1,236 inmates, only 36 more than it was built for.
But over the last seven years, the count has sometimes exceeded
1,800.
</P>
<P>
   In Cellblock C, which has yet to receive the new coat of paint
visible in other areas, inmates said they had been cleaning since
early in the morning in preparation for visitors. They said the
chicken being handed around for lunch that day was rare treat.
</P>
<P>
   In some cells, inmates had managed to cover their flaking walls
with posters, bits of magazines and even shopping bags. But they
said bug infestations and rodents were still common. At one point
during the tour, a mouse scuttled down a hallway undeterred by the
crowd of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates said that Dr. Vasseur's descriptions could not be
faulted: violence, disgusting food, overcrowding and beatings from
guards are all a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old prison,'' said one man, who had been arrested on
drug charges three months earlier and who shared a tiny cell with
two other inmates. ``We can't move in here. It is disgusting, but
nothing is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inmate said it was easy to get a pill for psychiatric
disorders. ``But if you need a dentist or you are in pain forget it
_ you wait a month.''

</P>
<P>
   Jego said France spends about $20,000 a year per prisoner,
compared with $29,000 in New York state, for example.
</P>
<P>
   France is actually in the midst of trying to revamp its justice
system, which has been under attack on many fronts. One measure
meant to end political meddling in the appointment of judges died
recently when President Jacques Chirac could not get his party to
back it.
</P>
<P>
   But a bill meant to strengthen the presumption of innocence is
working its way through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new measures would shift the right to put a suspect in
custody from the investigating magistrate to an independent judge.
It would also allow preventive detention only for crimes carrying
at least a three-year prison term, instead of the current two. And
a defendant would have the right to see a lawyer from the moment of
detention, instead of after 20 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In Dr. Vasseur, who wrote her book in diary form, described a
system filled with abuse. Some entries are pages long, others just
a few paragraphs. One day she discovers dozens of prisoners with a
skin disease related to eating the prison's rotting food. It is a
disease that most doctors had not seen in France since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Another day she watches eight guards trying to hold down an
inmate, so they can give him a shot. He hurts several guards and is
thrown in the punishment block. Fifteen days later she finds him
severely dehydrated. She realizes the guards have shut off the
pipes delivering water to his cell.
</P>
<P>
   One guard systematically puts inmates with lung diseases in a
cell next to the laundry room, where the walls sweat from the
humidity, which aggravates their condition. There are empty cells
elsewhere, but he refuses to move them.
</P>
<P>
   Another guard forces prisoners working in the laundry to have
sex with him. But the prisoners are too terrified to testify
against him. A 21-year-old man is put in a cell with two older,
hardened criminals who rape him the first night. One of the older
men has AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Dr. Vasseur, who began her career working for
France's Social Security Administration, still works at La Sante,
though she is not sure that she will be able to continue to do so.
As a doctor, she does not report to the warden. But she said that
the atmosphere could become so poisoned that she would lose her
effectiveness. Still, she said, she has been amazed by the
outpouring of support she has received.
</P>
<P>
   Some guards signed a petition calling her a liar, but many, she
said, have applauded her courage. ``They say keep it up when I walk
by,'' she said. ``It has been very heartening.''

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
When Art Howe managed the Astros from 1989-93, he gained a
well-deserved reputation for his patience with young players.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Howe gets ready for his fifth season as manager of the
Oakland Athletics, the main strength cited again is his steady hand
with a developing team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, Howe is running out of patience. Not with his
players, of course, but after nine seasons as a manager, Howe wants
to shed the notion that he's merely someone who is adept with a
young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of this building stuff,'' said Howe. ``I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the breakthrough year for Howe and the Athletics.
After going 87-75 in 1999 and challenging Boston for the American
League wild-card berth down the stretch, Oakland is being mentioned
as a contender for the AL West title.
</P>
<P>
   Howe, who has made his home in Houston for more than 20 years,
dating to his time as an Astros player, will be honored tonight at
the R.B.I. Foundation's annual banquet at the Adams Mark Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Howe, Astros manager Larry Dierker and Astros pitcher Jose Lima
will be roasted and toasted as R.B.I.'s Sportsmen of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three seasons, Howe has guided the Athletics from 65
wins to 74 to 87. Oakland has one of the top farm systems in
baseball and in the last three seasons has put into the majors such
talented young stars as outfielder Ben Grieve, the 1998 AL Rookie
of the Year; third baseman Eric Chavez; and shortstop Miguel
Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment to developing players is one of the keys for a
small-market team,'' said Howe. ``In my first three years, whatever
our (payroll) budget was, we always had to save $3 million for the
scouting department. We suffered a little on the major-league
level, but you can see it's paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   The big difference this year is that team owners Stephen Schott
and Ken Hoffman allowed general manager Billy Beane to increase the
payroll by $10 million, to about $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Beane re-signed potential free-agent
pitcher Omar Olivares, who was 7-2 for the Athletics after coming
from Anaheim in a deal July 29.
</P>
<P>
   With more money available, the Athletics were able to keep
potential free agents John Jaha and Randy Velarde and to re-sign
pitchers Kevin Appier, Doug Jones, Gil Heredia and T.J. Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround began last July, when the Athletics pulled off a
series of surprise moves by acquiring Appier from Kansas City,
Olivares and Velarde from Anaheim and pitcher Jason Isringhausen
from the New York Mets in a three-day period before the trade
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals came a week after the Athletics had traded pitcher
Kenny Rogers to the Mets. After that deal, it appeared Oakland was
selling out on the season, though the A's were still in the
wild-card hunt. Instead, the Rogers trade freed up enough money for
Beane to make the other acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For about four or five days, everyone was on our case,'' said
Howe. ``But that (Rogers) deal was more like a matter of getting
the stone out of your shoe. Once we made that deal, it freed up
some money to get players like Olivares and Velarde and Appier.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then this winter, we were able to keep them all. I think
they liked what they saw here last season, they liked the direction
the team was headed and how we run things. That was a nice
compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, Howe will go to spring training without numerous
questions about his lineup and starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``We've got a good club,
but we still don't have the finances other clubs have. Our depth
will be limited, but we're going to make it miserable for people.
And if things break right, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best club I've had here on paper going into the
season, hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   From a personal standpoint, Howe is rightfully proud the
Athletics decided to retain him beyond the rebuilding stage,
something that didn't happen in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1998 season, when the Athletics went 74-88, it
appeared Howe's job might be in jeopardy. First baseman Jason
Giambi, now an established four-year player, led a group of players
who went to Beane and strongly recommended the Athletics keep Howe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason and a few others went upstairs and spoke on my behalf,''
said Howe. ``I didn't ask them to, of course, but it meant a lot to
me. I think the decision was made that continuity was going to be
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe was given a one-year contract for 1999 with an option for
the 2000 season. The Athletics picked up that option midway through
last season; Howe currently is negotiating a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   Beane also mentioned the continuity factor when asked about Howe
this week. Beane, too, brought up the patience and steady hand his
manager has demonstrated with teams that had no chance to contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this situation is that when Art started here,
there wasn't much of anything in the way of talent either in the
farm system or on the major-league team,'' said Beane. ``Patience
is one of his greatest virtues. Through that patience, he's been
here as we've developed a good major-league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've brought along a lot of good young players and signed
some selective free agents that have helped. Art got here on the
ground floor, and he's been a big part of it. Right now, we've got
some continuity in terms of guys like Giambi and (Matt) Stairs, and
we're adding to our talent base both from within the system and
from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Howe might be able to lead the Athletics into
the postseason for the first time since the late 1980s and early
1990s when Tony La Russa was the manager and Mark McGwire, Dave
Stewart, Dennis Eckersley, Rickey Henderson and Jose Canseco were
among the best players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Howe is due a trip to baseball's October. He was fired
by the Astros after the 1993 season despite an 85-77 record. Howe
was instrumental in the development of players such as Jeff
Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Darryl Kile and Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Drayton McLane Jr., however, decided after one season of owning
the club that he needed ``a more dynamic leader.'' He fired Howe
and hired Terry Collins, who failed to deliver a championship team
in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who is more like Howe than Collins in the way he treats
players, got the Astros into the playoffs in 1997, starting a
three-year run of National League Central titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that team in Houston was going to win some titles,''
said Howe. ``Every year, you could see the improvement. We went
from something like 65 wins to 85 wins in three years (1991-93), so
it was obvious the talent was there, that something good was going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While Howe takes satisfaction in seeing his ex-players succeed,
he listens to the sports talk shows in Houston and is appalled by
fans who deride the players for their lack of production in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the makeup of those players, and I know how much they
want to win, and it makes me sick to my stomach to hear people
criticize those players,'' said Howe. ``These guys are winners.
Bagwell and Biggio are two of the best in the game. They're giving
their all to win, and to hear people say they're choking, that
sticks in my craw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: There are 29 other teams that would be
happy to take those guys right now if the people here are tired of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe had those players during their formative years, much as he
now has Grieve, Tejada and Chavez in Oakland. He is quick to point
out, however, that McGwire has said several times that among the
happiest times he spent in baseball was the 1996 season and half of
1997 in Oakland, when Howe was manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can manage the veterans as well as the young guys,'' said
Howe. ``It's really just a matter of never having that many
veterans. I think one of the key things with any player _ young or
old _ is giving them their space. The clubhouse is their domain; I
don't bother them too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I'm behind them 100 percent, and my coaches are that
way, too. We're a team. We're going to make mistakes, they're going
to make mistakes, but we're all going to work on improving and
getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more improvement by the Athletics, and Howe's legendary
patience won't be as much of a story this season.

COURT ALLOWS LAWSUIT BASED ON GOLFER INJURED BY WAYWARD
`MULLIGAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you try sneaking in an extra shot on the golf
course, be aware that if you shank your ball into somebody, you
will likely be held liable for any injuries, at least in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court in the Garden State has ruled that a golfer can
be held responsible for injuries caused by an unannounced shot if
other players are not given ample warning.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even bellowing ``Fore!'' when you hit what is
known as a mulligan _ a supplementary shot usually from the tee
that magically leaves no trace on the scorecard _ would not
automatically spare you from the courts if your ball goes amok.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in Newark Monday by the Appellate Division of the
Superior Court of New Jersey stems from a July 27, 1994 incident.
(There is an argument of course, whether the shot was actually a
mulligan.)
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Jeffrey Schick and his father,
Wolfgang, of Livingston, N.J., where the family runs a factory that
makes airplane parts, were playing on the public course. As is
often the case on crowded public courses, on the 10th hole they
spontaneously joined Tom Gonella and John Ferolito, a founder of
the company that makes Arizona Iced Tea.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat inexperienced foursome _ all said they had been
playing for a year or less _ golfed together without problems until
the 16th tee.
</P>
<P>
   There, Schick, and his father hit their balls, followed by
Gonella. Those three then stood behind Ferolito while they claim he
sliced his ball into the woods on the right of the course. At that
point, the court papers say, the two Schick men moved their golf
cart about 10 to 16 feet in front of the tee, about 45 degrees off
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   They say at that point Ferolito took a mulligan, but the heel of
the golf club hit the ball and it hooked left, hitting Schick
between the eyes. A plastic surgeon reconstructed his nose and some
of his facial bones. Chisholm said his client, now almost 30, faces
over $30,000 in medical bills and suffers from repeated nightmares
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Ferolito, 49, denies that his shot was a
mulligan. (The term comes from the name of a Canadian hotelier,
David Mulligan, who apparently started the practice of extra,
uncounted shots.)
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Ferolito told the people that he was about to take his
tee shot and gave them a waving gesture like here I go, but this
was not a mulligan,'' said James M. DeMarzo, the lawyer for the ice
tea magnate who whacked the errant ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it is a bad day for duffers, but I do think
it is a bad decision for duffers,'' said DeMarzo. ``Whenever you
take to a playing field, whether it is a baseball field or a
football field or the golf links, you are subject to certain risks
inherent to the sport itself,'' he said. ``We don't want to have
the door open to litigation every time someone gets hit on the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard M. Chisholm, the lawyer for the man hit by a golf
ball on the East Orange Golf Course, a public course in Millburn,
N.J., disagrees that the case will have such a far reach. He thinks
only demonic individual playing style might lead to damage cases,
not randomly crowning someone on the next fairway with an wayward
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anticipating that someone is going to hit a mulligan at
point-blank range is not a standard part of the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers involved said that since sports injury cases are
generally decided under state law, it is impossible to assess what
impact the case might have on golfers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But to take at least one infamous golfer who has been know to
take his fair share (at least on a presidential scale) of
mulligans, there was no sense that the ruling will affect President
Clinton's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``His use of mulligans has been exaggerated in the press, but he
certainly reserves the right to use one from time to time,'' said
Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman. ``The president is pretty
vocal, so when he makes a bad shot he usually lets people know. I
don't think he would surprise everyone if he decided to take
another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Ferolito, 49, denies that his shot was a
mulligan. (The term comes from the name of a Canadian hotelier,
David Mulligan, who apparently started the practice of extra,
uncounted shots.)
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Ferolito told the people that he was about to take his
tee shot and gave them a waving gesture like here I go, but this
was not a mulligan,'' said DeMarzo.
</P>
<P>
   Judge F. Michael Caruso of the Superior Court of New Jersey in
Essex County had thrown out the case in a 1998 summary judgment on
the grounds that the accident was part of the game. The higher
court reversed that decision, but ruled that the shot was not so
wantonly reckless that Schick could sue for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear at this point whether the defendant will get the
New Jersey Supreme Court to review the decision or whether the
lawsuit will proceed in the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers said there are plenty of legal precedents when it
comes to sports injuries, although not for golf which in its ideal
form doesn't involve contact. The usual standard for lawsuits has
been that players involved assume a certain amount of risk, unless
the others in the game seem deliberately and recklessly trying to
wound them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly everyone feels bad whenever anyone gets hurt,''
DeMarzo said, before adding a quote from an unidentified sports
writer, ``But if you knew where the ball was going to go every time
you hit it, it wouldn't be much of a sport.''

SURPRISE SNOWSTORM STOPS N.C. IN ITS TRACKS 
</HEADLINE>

 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ A return to normalcy seemed to take forever
after Hurricane Floyd flooded this state four months ago, and it's
beginning to feel that way again.
</P>
<P>
   Most state offices and schools here in North Carolina's capital
and the surrounding area were closed for a third day Thursday
because of a snowstorm that had taken just about everybody by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The snow, which began falling late Monday and continued into
Tuesday afternoon, left an accumulation of 20 inches, a Raleigh
record for any 24-hour period. And an additional accumulation, of
ice or snow, is expected from a storm due this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For some students, this was the sixth school day called off by
snow in the last two weeks, a stretch of cancellations that has
forced districts to consider holding classes on Saturdays and on
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Power had been restored by Thursday to most of the 150,000
people who lost service in the Raleigh area. But it had been slow
going, and more than 300 people spent the night in one or another
of 15 emergency shelters that the state opened in the city or
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh-Durham International Airport resumed service late
Thursday after being closed for 60 hours, but only a few flights
were available: American Airlines, Delta, Northwest and US Airways
all chose to wait until Friday morning before resuming service.
</P>
<P>
   It was first prolonged shutdown in the airport's 61-year
history, and it snarled travel plans for thousands of people who
had been ready to fly on the 900 daily flights into and out of the
Raleigh-Durham area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been incredible,'' said an airport spokesman, Mike
Blanton. ``We removed over 20 inches of snow from a 10,000-foot
runway, and then we found a 3-inch layer of ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Two snowstorms hit the Raleigh area a week ago, but unlike
those, Blanton said, this one found the airport unprepared. State
troopers were also surprised, and many became stuck in the snow
early on. And the state Transportation Department quickly ran out
of salt and lost valuable road-clearing time waiting for more.
Remarkably enough, only one storm-related fatality was reported, in
a traffic accident about 20 miles south of Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters had predicted a light snowfall, and those who were
caught off guard responded angrily. ``The weather reporting on this
storm was an abysmal failure,'' said Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As with Hurricane Floyd, Hunt has spent most of the week urging
people to stay home, unless they are checking on elderly neighbors
or using their four-wheel-drive vehicles to assist hospitals.
Medical centers issued desperate pleas for vehicles, to reach
either staff members or patients needing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Raleigh area was hit hardest, other locales around
the state also struggled. Several inches fell in Charlotte, far to
the west, where Union County lost power to its water plant and had
to request bottled water from state emergency officials.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors at the area's hotels were stranded by the snow, but not
all of them lamented it. At the Sheraton Imperial in Research
Triangle Park, guests held an impromptu dance in one of the
ballrooms. And at the Radisson Governors Inn in Durham, Gelinda
Sorrell, assistant manager, said: ``We're just having fun with it.
The guests are so bored they've even filled out our comment
cards.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With snow forcing the cancellation of just about everything,
Elaine Marshall, North Carolina's secretary of state, was not
surprised that she had to postpone both the filing of her
re-election papers on Tuesday and a political fund-raiser that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an undeterred Ms. Marshall showed up to file at
the state elections office and was greeted by the sole employee
there. Ms. Marshall had considered a further delay, but thought the
three-block walk from her office through the snow might be a good
way to start her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a group of hale, hardy farm folks,'' she said.
``Who am I to wimp out?''

GERMANS DEDICATE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL SITE IN BERLIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Germany on Thursday ended a decade of turbulent debate
over how to commemorate the Holocaust in its new capital by
formally dedicating a site beside the Brandenburg Gate for a
memorial designed by a New York architect.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the German government stood in icy winds beneath newly
unveiled billboards announcing the ``Memorial to the Murdered Jews
of Europe'' as Wolfgang Thierse, the president of the lower house
of Parliament, explained that honor had to be accorded to the 6
million Jewish dead ``in the heart of our capital city.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the project, designed by Peter Eisenman, will
begin next year on the 4.9-acre site. A field of over 2,000 stone
pillars of varying dimensions will be flanked by a ``documentation
center'' whose precise role remains unclear. Resistant to the last,
Eberhard Diepgen, Berlin's Christian Democratic mayor, snubbed the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen has been a leader of the large, often silent, body of
German opinion that believes the memorial is too big, too central
and perhaps redundant in a city that commemorates the Jewish dead
in many other smaller ways and in a country that thirsts to look
forward even as it is obliged to look back.
</P>
<P>
   His absence was a discordant note on the 55th anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz _ a day Germany has marked as ``Holocaust
Remembrance Day'' since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Germany chose to mark its formal remembrance of the Holocaust by
inviting Elie Wiesel, the author and Nobel Peace Laureate, to
address the lower house of Parliament. He brought an extraordinary
hush to the chamber in the refurbished Reichstag building with the
urgency of his memories and his pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is one to comprehend the hate that flourished in this
country?'' asked Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz. ``If I were to
begin naming all the Jewish children who were killed _ 1.5 million
children _ I would be in this room for months and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel concluded his speech by urging Parliament to pass a
resolution formally requesting, in the name of Germany, the
forgiveness of the Jewish people for the crimes of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it publicly,'' he said. ``Ask the Jewish people to forgive
Germany for what the Third Reich had done in Germany's name. Do it,
and the significance of this day will acquire a higher level. Do
it, for we desperately want to have hope for this new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at a private ceremony in Berlin marking an agreement
on compensation for victims of Nazi forced labor, Johannes Rau, the
German president, said, ``I pay tribute to all those who were
subjected to slave and forced labor under German rule and, in the
name of the German people, beg forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   While Germany has expressed remorse for Hitler's crimes in
countless forms since World War II _ perhaps most memorably in
Willy Brandt's unscripted genuflection at the Warsaw Ghetto _ its
president had not previously requested forgiveness in this way.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Wiesel asked Thursday that this remark by Rau at a
private ceremony be given the public resonance and gravity of a
parliamentary declaration. There was no immediate response _ only a
respectful silence.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the ceremony at the memorial site, Wiesel watched
Thierse explain that Germany had decided in the end to commemorate
the attempted annihilation of European Jewry in central Berlin
because modern German identity was inextricably tied to the
recognition of the horror of what Hitler perpetrated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point that Wiesel had made in slightly different form
earlier as he explained the inextricable bond of Jews and Germans.
``No people,'' he said, ``ever inflicted such suffering as your
people on mine in such a short period. Until the end of time,
Auschwitz is part of your history and mine.''

 &HT;    ABC inks four-year extension with BCS
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans screaming for a Division I football playoff are going to
have to scream a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ABC announced Thursday a four-year extension to televise the
Bowl Championship Series through the 2005 season.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS features four bowls _ Sugar, Orange, Rose, Fiesta _ that
rotate as host for the designated national championship game. Last
season's game between Florida State and Virginia Tech was held in
the Sugar Bowl. Next season's game will be in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the BCS want college football to adopt a 16-team
playoff. But the six major conferences guaranteed slots in the BCS
_ ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10, SEC _ have found the BCS
format better to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   TV ratings for the four BCS games were up 4 percent this season
and 9 percent over the past two years, BCS chairman and SEC
commissioner Roy Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Sugar Bowl) did a rating of 17.5 compared to a 17.2 for
the (basketball) Final Four last spring,'' Kramer said. ``We were
very pleased with that and felt it was time to move forward with
ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   The conferences recently signed off on a three-year option to
extend the contract. ABC added another year so that all four bowls
would host the championship twice during the contract. The Fiesta
and Sugar have hosted once.
</P>
<P>
   The extension also will bring more dollars to the BCS schools.
Under the old agreement, ABC paid approximately $78 million per
year to televise the four games. The new agreement raises that
figure to about $100 million. The per-team payout of those four
bowls is expected to jump from $12.5 million to more than $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   The contract goes through the 2005 season. The Rose Bowl
contract, with the Pac-10 and Big Ten champions, also is set to
expire after that season. Only then could football contemplate some
kind of postseason playoffs, according to several athletics
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ``solidifies postseason football at the Division I
level until 2006, at which time we can evaluate where we are and
either continue in the current format or go in a different
direction,'' ACC commissioner John Swofford said. ``I think it's
fair to say the BCS has been very successful the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Critics of the BCS say that focusing all
the attention on one championship bowl detracts from, and lowers
attendance at, the other bowls. They also say that a playoff would
generate more overall money than the current bowl system, which
returns about $150 million a year back to the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ISL, a Swiss-based marketing firm, continues to peddle to
college administrators a playoff proposal, but a majority of the
university presidents have been against it.

 &HT;    NFL: Cold won't cost Atlanta
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and a few league
owners said Thursday that this week's frigid weather should not
damage Atlanta's efforts at hosting future Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always understood that Atlanta was part-Southern,
part-Northern,'' Tagliabue said. ``The key thing is having a great
stadium and a domed stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Titans and Rams have complained about practicing
outside in near-freezing temperatures the past two days. The teams
will move inside the Georgia Dome for today's practice and have
one-hour, walk-through sessions on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa, New Orleans and San Diego have been awarded the next
three Super Bowls, respectively. Houston, with a new franchise
beginning play in 2002, is the favorite to host the game in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which also hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994, is bidding
for the 2005 game. Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa also could compete
for the game when the NFL's 32 owners vote in March on the 2004-06
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Three NFL owners contacted on Thursday said this week's bad
weather would not affect their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a nor'easter, as they like to call it, or when
you get cold weather coming up into the east, it's cold
everywhere,'' Steelers owner Daniel M. Rooney said. ``I've got two
brothers living in Florida and they say it's cold down there,
comparably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do? Start playing the game in the
Caribbean and Hawaii? I think we should continue moving the game.
... I think Atlanta is fine. I spoke for Atlanta to get it when
they were awarded (this year's) game. It's just one of those things
where it's cold everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengals owner Mike Brown and Colts owner Jim Irsay agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be playing indoors, so I don't know why the
teams would be concerned,'' Brown said. ``The kind of weather you
get is going to impact what people are going to do when they get
there, like playing golf. But I don't think it's going to affect
the parties and the game, which is what it's supposed to be
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steeg, the NFL's senior vice president for special events,
said no Super Bowl-related activities were canceled through
Thursday. A golf tournament in Alpharetta went off fine Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that can happen,'' Irsay said. ``We can't
control the weather. We knew when we came to Atlanta something can
happen. When you go to Tampa and Miami, you can have a lot of rain,
and New Orleans doesn't always have the best weather.''
</P>
<P>
   But Titans owner Bud Adams, whose team is playing its first
Super Bowl in the 40-year history of the franchise, says the league
needs to look closer at its criteria for hosting the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, these are all things the NFL must take under
consideration,'' Adams said. ``I don't think you normally have this
kind of bad weather (in Atlanta), but I think you may have to weigh
this strongly. ... It's a big factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big factor in Atlanta getting the Super Bowl twice was
late Falcons founder Rankin Smith Sr. He was instrumental in
bringing the game here in 1994, two years after the Dome opened.
Many league owners voted for it as a tribute of sorts to the man
who brought the NFL to the South in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, before his death in 1997, Smith was invaluable in
winning the 2000 game for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the weather probably won't hurt Atlanta, but it
might thwart bids by other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have some impact on some Northern cities that
wanted to hold the game in open-air stadiums,'' he said. ``This
shows that winter is still winter in the U.S.''

 &HT;    Shed no tears for Dick Vermeil
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The forecast calls for 4 inches of snow today ... or
10 inches if Dick Vermeil starts crying.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the NFL's most famous tear ducts are backed up. Vermeil
didn't shed a single drop after the Rams pulled out a victory in
the NFC title game last weekend. And he has made it through every
media session this week without even a moist eye. So you know what
that means ...
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams win Sunday, the Georgia Dome could look like the set
of Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to say Vermeil sheds a lot of tears, but if you
locked him in a room with Barbara Walters, you would have to keep a
lifeguard stationed nearby just to make sure nobody drowned in the
undertow.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when a water main broke and flooded the Trans World
Dome a few years ago? Well, that was the ``official'' story. My
sources say that Vermeil had just finished watching ``Old Yeller.''
</P>
<P>
   (OK, never mind that he wasn't the team's coach yet. Work with
me here).
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it seems fitting that at games in St. Louis, Rams' fans
wave hankies.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil makes Jana Novotna seem icy.
</P>
<P>
   He makes Sally Field look stoic.
</P>
<P>
   And I love it.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that NFL coaches fell into two molds.
Tom Landry or Vince Lombardi. Statue or Screamer.
</P>
<P>
   And you pulled for the statue, because when a screamer
succeeded, the ripple effects were scary. Suddenly, youth coaches
across America decided that they needed to be like Mike Ditka or
Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   This season gives us hope. Look at the NFL's final four. Throw
out Jacksonville's Tom Coughlin and you have a group of head
coaches _ Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy, Tennessee's Jeff Fisher and
Vermeil _ that actually illustrated that you can mix traditional
staples, like discipline and hard work, with once-rare NFL traits.
Like sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of the Titans can picture their coach getting
weepy. Not even if they win Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' linebacker Barron Wortham said Thursday. ``Jeff's
more an IBM type. He's one of the guys that's on time every day.
Briefcase. Very conservative. That's just his style. He's not
wishy-washy like Dick Vermeil.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about wishy. But washy, yes. To recap this soggy
season, he cried when starting quarterback Trent Green got hurt. He
cried when Green was declared out for the season. He cried when the
Rams won their first game with Kurt Warner was quarterback. He
cried at San Francisco. He cried a season-high five times _ once in
the locker room and four times in the press conference _ when the
Rams clinched the divisional title at Carolina. He cried when
Warner won the MVP. He cried when his players were voted to the Pro
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just me,'' Vermeil explained earlier this week. ``It's
embarrassing sometimes. ... I can't help myself sometimes. I have
prepared myself emotionally mentally not to do it, and I still do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil's players have become accustomed to the tears through
the years. Herman Edwards, who played for Vermeil in Philadelphia,
recalls that on Saturdays the defensive linemen would have a little
pool _ the prize was pie a la mode _ on how long it would take for
Vermeil to break down. The typical over-under was 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And although Vermeil was out of the game for 14 years, some
things haven't changed. Rams linebacker Mike Jones laughs when
asked if he remembers the first time he saw Vermeil get choked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I was here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones recalls that after finishing signing his contract, Vermeil
got up from behind the desk and walked around to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, 'He's not going to hug me, is he?''' Jones said.
``Sure, enough he hugs me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jones wasn't sure what to make of Vermeil. With
time, though, he has grown to appreciate him. He says those who
think he is fake have it all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's genuine,'' he said. ``That's why it works, because he's
just being himself. He's sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a special year for Vermeil. It began with
win-or-else threats from management. And when Green went down, it
looked like it would be the or-else. But the Rams went 13-3 in the
regular season, and Vermeil was named Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk that if the Rams win Sunday, he will call it
quits. There's no way you can top a season like this. So why not
walk away and do something more sane? Relax, maybe do a few
commercials. (''Hi, I'm Dick Vermeil and I use No More Tears'
shampoo'').
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this could be his going-away party.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, he'll cry if he wants to.

 &HT;    Horan keeps Columbine in his thoughts
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He can see the high school from his front porch.
</P>
<P>
   The high school he drives past almost every day when he's home
and on the way to the gym for a workout or on the way to his
off-season job as a mortgage company's loan officer or on the way
to almost anywhere doing almost any errand.
</P>
<P>
   His three children of grade-school age probably will never
attend the high school St. Louis Rams punter Mike Horan sees every
day from the family's front porch, because it's located across a
county line and therefore not in the assigned district for their
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't change things.
</P>
<P>
   That won't ever change things.
</P>
<P>
   That won't ever change how Horan thinks about that day last
April, or why he thinks about it.
</P>
<P>
   That horrible day is the reason Horan _ during a Thursday
morning media session in advance of his team's Sunday date in Super
Bowl XXXIV _ was wearing a white baseball cap with a high school's
name stitched across the front.
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBINE
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to bring a sense of pride and enjoyment to anyone
at Columbine who might see me,'' Horan said. ``I just want them to
know somebody's thinking of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Horan was working at a buddy's mortage company on April 20,
1999, when the news spread across Littleton, Colo., and then across
the country and globe that there had been a shooting at Columbine
High School. He wasn't worried for his own children's safety _ no,
it wasn't that _ but he raced to them anyway to where they were
locked down in their own classrooms and hallways until word came
that the rampage was only at one place.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve students and a teacher. Shot. Dead. And then the two
murderers killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go through that without feeling violated in some
manner,'' Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   His message was that the devastation, though obviously deepest
at Columbine, melted through the community. One of his own
children, in fact, chose not to return to her school when given the
option to stay home when classes resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you tell them?'' Horan said. ``You tell them you love
them and want always to be part of their lives and know what
they're doing. And you want them to be able to tell you things.
Parents need to be more invovled in their kids' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   How could the parents of the perpetrators of the massacre not
have known is what Horan was thinking but not exactly saying.
</P>
<P>
   Horan's connection to Columbine _ beyond the view from his front
porch, that is _ was that he had been working with Rebels punter
Doug Brace in informal practice sessions. Someone who knew Horan,
who once punted for the Denver Broncos, had arranged the contact.
</P>
<P>
   Horan's involvement at the school these days has to do with
raising money for a project to demolish the library where the
shootings occurred and erect in its place a two-story atrium
opening to the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He is 40 years old now, Horan is, and will be 41two days after
he plays in his fourth Super Bowl (he's winless in three previous
appearances with Denver and the New York Giants). His football life
has taken many turns to failure and resurrection, and one of the
things that bothers him most in quiet moments months removed from
the Columbine tragedy is that so many young people died before ever
getting real chances at recovery from disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids, he mourns, will miss out on so much of what the
Columbine atrium project is named for and hopes to symbolize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope,'' Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   He should know.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time long ago in 1982, Horan was drafted in the
ninth round by the Atlanta Falcons. He was released, signed the
next year with Green Bay and failed a physical. He went to camp in
Buffalo, but was released. He punted for Philadelphia for a couple
of years, latched on in Denver late in 1986 and stayed with the
Broncos until injurying a knee in 1992. He went to the Giants the
next year and stayed through 1996. He was with the Rams after they
cut a punter in 1997 and with the Bears in '98 when a punter got
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with St. Louis again this season on Nov. 10, 1999,
when punter Rick Tuten was placed on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   How's all that for hope?
</P>
<P>
   How's all that for a circuitous route back to another Super
Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a victory, finally, would be memorable for
Horan. But he might not appreciate it any more than he appreciated
a football title earned elsewhere last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the road in Charlotte when I called home and found
out Columbine had beaten Cherry Creek for the state championship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get lost in the Roman numeral madness and excess of
these pro football extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, a guy with a baseball cap, a front porch and
hope has himself a pretty good map.

U.S. WARNS PAKISTAN AGAINST CONTINUED SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORIST
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration issued a public warning
to Pakistan on Thursday that it could be branded a state sponsor of
terrorism _ ending any hope for a resumption of large-scale
American aid _ if the Pakistani army continued to support
terrorists blamed for the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also denounced the decision by Pakistan's new
military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to require all higher court
judges to swear an oath that would bar them from challenging the
army. The country's chief justice refused to take the pledge
earlier this week and was immediately replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's chief spokesman, James P. Rubin, said
that a possible connection between Pakistan's military and the
group tied to the hijacking, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, ``is a matter of
extreme concern to us _ this is an organization that we have
declared a terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference to explain the implications of a
link, Rubin said that ``if the secretary of state determines that a
government has repeatedly provided support of international
terrorism directly, then she would be prepared to designate that
country as a state sponsor of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any country in the world should know that if we determine that
they have provided support to international terrorism on a repeated
basis, that they are subject to this designation,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks make official what senior administration officials
have been saying privately in recent days _ that Pakistan's ties to
the terrorists threaten the already turbulent relationship with the
United States, a once close ally, and could produce new American
sanctions. Musharraf took power in a coup last October.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting last week in Pakistan with a delegation of senior
Clinton administration officials, Musharraf refused their request
that he ban Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, a radical group seeking
independence for Muslims in the disputed Indian state of Kashmir,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the United States to add Pakistan to its official
list of nations that support terrorism _ a list that includes Iran,
Iraq and Syria _ would end any lingering hope in Pakistan for the
resumption of what had once been a large package of American aid.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which totaled hundreds of millions of dollars a
year in the late 1980s, was cut off in 1990 as a result of fears
over a Pakistan program to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now provides Pakistan with only about $6
million in aid each year _ half of it for counternarcotics
assistance, half of it for health programs for women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have also said that the United States
could use its leverage in the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund to cut off loans to Pakistan, although they said the
administration would be reluctant to take any move that might push
already impoverished Pakistan into near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that without some quick move by Pakistan
to clamp down on the terrorists or to push for democratic reform,
President Clinton will bypass Pakistan during a planned trip to the
region at the end of March that is scheduled to include India and
Bangladesh. It will be the first presidential trip to the Indian
subcontinent in more than two decades.

 &HT;    Thigpen holds out hope
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yancey Thigpen can accept a broken foot but not a
broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   He still hopes to lineup as a wide receiver for the Titans in
the Super Bowl despite fracturing the fifth metatarsal in his right
foot in the AFC Championship Game victory against the Jacksonville
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the biggest game of my life, and, if I can't
play, it's going to be the biggest letdown of my career,'' Thigpen
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Super Bowl XXX with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1996
and has yearned for another chance since that 27-17 loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The decision about playing Thigpen, still listed as the starter,
could be made as late as Sunday afternoon, when Titans coaches and
trainers run him through his paces. They are in no rush to decide
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel like I can play, I'll tell them,'' said Thigpen, who
also is valued as a team leader. ``And I think, by me telling them
that I feel like I can play, they will let me play because they
trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's any uncertainty, he said, he probably will sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that will be the best decision for the team,'' said
Thigpen, who has spent two of his eight pro years in Nashville.
``I'm here to win a Super Bowl, not just to play in one.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Jack Youngblood of the Los Angeles Rams once
played in an NFC Championship Game with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen said he hopes adrenaline will block any pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yancey wants to play in the worst way, and we've all got our
fingers crossed for him, hoping that he can,'' wide receivers coach
Steve Walters said. ``The fact of the matter is, can you perform?
Right now, we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen said the swelling has subsided. He's wearing a walking
cast, and his shoe will be fitted with a plate to take pressure off
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for me to play and be productive, I gotta have my
wheels,'' Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he missed six games because of a hamstring injury
and an ankle sprain so severe that it tore the cartilage. On a team
that throws sparingly, he still tied for the lead in touchdown
receptions and was second in receiving yards. In one quarter
Sunday, he caught two passes for 16 yards, one a 9-yard touchdown
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, a lot of guys wouldn't even have been playing with
that (ankle injury),'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   If Thigpen can't play, Isaac Byrd will step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing the biggest game of the year,'' Byrd said,
``you're going to have to be put in a wheelchair not to want to go
out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said Thigpen might play a limited role, such as coming in
on third downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can give us anything, it's going to give a boost to the
team,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't play, Thigpen won't suit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need all the bodies we can get,'' he said, ``and me
standing on the sideline in a uniform is not going to help us.''

   SUPER-ADS -- The whole world will be watching, the nation's best
will be on display, and they all know the entire year is riding on
the Super Bowl this Sunday. And that's just the advertisers. With
the biggest game of the season also being the biggest TV show of
any year, business people know the Super Bowl can be their shot to
launch a new product, or an entirely new company. That gives them
good reason to fork over $2.2 million to ABC for a 30-second spot.

KEMP ENDORSES BUSH, AND FORBES CALLS IT `POLITICS AS USUAL' 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The Bush campaign Thursday unveiled its
latest prominent supporter, Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican
vice-presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp's endorsement, announced at a news conference in Nashua,
underscored the degree to which members of the Republican
establishment, no matter what their divergent views, have coalesced
around Bush in the party's desire to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was also an embarrassment for Bush's rival Steve Forbes, who
had won Kemp's endorsement in the 1996 primary campaign before Bob
Dole picked Kemp to be his running mate. Kemp had been one of the
early advocates of the flat income tax, which is central to the
Forbes campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was not endorsing Forbes this year, Kemp said
Thursday: ``I did briefly support Steve Forbes in 1996. He is a
friend. He is an outstanding human being. He has terrific ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here against John McCain,'' Kemp continued. ``I'm
certainly not here against Steve Forbes, a dear friend, who I think
would make a great secretary of the treasury,'' and he added, with
tongue firmly in cheek, ``and I'd make a great chairman of the
Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, humorously suggesting an ambassadorship, interjected,
``Have you ever heard of Chad?''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign had been passing out copies of a book
written by Kemp and Forbes' national campaign manager, Kenneth
Blackwell, at campaign stops. And one of Forbes' top strategists,
William Dal Col, is a longtime Kemp associate, having worked for
Kemp both at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and at
Kemp's private organization, Empower America.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their past ties, Forbes said Kemp's endorsement Thursday
was an example of ``politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack is a nice fellow,'' Forbes said at a news conference at
the Puritan Back Room Restaurant here. ``And we worked together.
But he is part of the party establishment. So it is no surprise
that they are rallying around their own. It shows that we are
mounting a real challenge to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he's endorsed the principle of the flat tax, why does he
go with the weak compromise?'' Forbes continued, referring to
Bush's tax cut plan. ``If you start watering things down, it will
lead to nothing at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In his endorsement Kemp said: ``I am not here suggesting that we
can pass a flat tax immediately. I really believe that Governor
Bush is the one who can inspire the Congress, inspire the nation
and win a mandate for bringing down the Clinton tax rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, referring to Republican defeats in the 1992 and 1996
presidential elections, said: ``What cost us was having a muffled
message, no clear agenda. With no message, there is no victory.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Forbes portrayed himself as the lone Republican
candidate with a strong message. ``I'm the only candidate with the
true pro-life, anti-tax message,'' he said. ``With an inspired
message, we will win. If not, we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bush's message would lead to defeat in November,
Forbes replied: ``Clearly, that's the direction that he's headed.
You see he's putting out muffled messages on the tax code, the life
issue, on Social Security. It's tempting to say as little as
possible and hope that the poll lead stays and eke out a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has run for no office other than the presidency, has
been at odds with the Republican Party establishment since he used
his considerable personal fortune in 1996 to run harsh
advertisements in the primary race attacking Dole. Party officials
believed that the advertisements damaged Dole in his general
campaign against President Clinton.

 &HT;    Too short, too slow, also too valuable
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first time Titans defensive coordinator Gregg
Williams saw Blaine Bishop, he couldn't figure out why the team had
drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw him in drills, I couldn't believe we'd taken
him,'' Williams said. ``He couldn't backpedal, he was stiff and
couldn't turn his hips (and run).''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't anything Bishop hadn't heard before. A 5-foot-9,
203-pound safety, he always had been told that he was too small to
play football.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, 29, was a first-team all-state player at Cathedral High
School in Indianapolis. He dreamed of playing at Notre Dame or
Michigan, but his best offers came from Purdue and Indiana, which
said he could walk-on to their teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody thought I was too small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bishop accepted a scholarship from St. Joseph's
College, a Division II school in Rensselaer, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   After one season at St. Joseph's, Bishop walked-on at Ball
State, a Division I school in Muncie, Ind. He was selected an
honorable mention All-American as a senior, but he still fell to
the eighth round of the 1993 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even have an eighth round anymore,'' Bishop said.
``We have a lot of talented young players, and I tell those guys
that I'd be a free agent if I came out right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was taken with the 214th pick in the draft by the former
Houston Oilers. He played in all 16 games as a rookie, mostly on
special teams but had two starts at strong safety in place of
injured Bubba McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop started 13 games the next season and has been in the
starting lineup since then. He was voted to three Pro Bowls in a
row, 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blaine's my all-time favorite guy that I've coached,'' said
Williams, who was the Oilers' special-teams coach when Bishop
entered the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone _ coaches, the media, everybody _ has told him that
he couldn't play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a seven-year pro, has excelled in the NFL. He averaged
103 tackles over the past five seasons, including 115 this season,
when he tied linebacker Eddie Robinson for the team lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop also is the field general in the Titans' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blaine is a guy who is going to let you know how he feels,''
said free safety Anthony Dorsett, who will start Sunday in place of
injured Marcus Robertson. ``He's not a guy who's worried about your
feelings. If he doesn't think you're getting the job done, he will
let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is doing his job in the postseason, tying for the team
lead with 23 tackles. Two weeks ago in the divisional playoffs, he
had a team-high 11 tackles in the Titans' 19-16 victory against the
Colts in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out (of college) as a cornerback and they said I wasn't
fast enough,'' Bishop said. ``They said I was too short to play
safety. They didn't realize I'm a football player.''

KEYES BRINGS MORALITY MESSAGE TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Alan Keyes brought religion back into at least
one public school Thursday, as part of his civics lesson to fifth
graders at the Peter Woodbury School.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Republican presidential candidate did not use the
word ``abortion'' with the children, his message was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now tell me something,'' said Keyes, a talk show host and
former United Nations ambassador. ``If I were to lose my mind right
now and pick one of you up and dash your head against the floor and
kill you, would that be right?''
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong to kill children, isn't it? At what age is it right
to kill children?...How old are you, son?'' Keyes said to one
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven,'' the boy answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think it was okay to kill you when you were six?'' The child
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you?'' he asked another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think it was OK to kill you when you were six months? You
sure? Becuase we live in a country right now where according to
some of our courts and some of our politicians, it is OK,'' Keyes
said. ``Our rights come from God. We human beings don't have the
right to take away that right from any human being, including the
human beings who haven't quite got here yet...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have denied freedom to the children in the womb who
haven't yet gotten to this world, freedom will be denied to you and
to your brothers and to your sisters and to your children,'' Keyes
said. ``And this is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   As Keyes tries to build momentum from his third-place finish in
the Iowa caucuses on Monday, he has continued to emphasize morality
and his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia Hogan, a parent volunteer who attended the event in
Bedford, said, ``I think it would upset some parents in the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Thornton, a fifth-grade teacher, said, ``I'm not quite
sure that was appropriate for this age level. I think the
administration would have breathed a little easier if he hadn't
brought it up.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a reporter's question about the appropriateness
of his comments, Keyes was unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A matter of fact, we should talk about abortion, because
abortion happens to be an issue that is vitally important to our
freedom,'' Keyes said. ``We should talk about it with them from the
earliest possible age...The day when it's inappropriate to talk to
our children about the fact that their rights come from God, and
that therefore we do not have the right to take the life of
children in the womb, I think that's absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think is inappropriate?'' Keyes continued.
``If Al Gore came in here and were talking to these children about
Bill Clinton, nobody would suggest that was inappropriate. And yet
if our children think too hard or look too much into Bill Clinton,
they'll get into some real inappropriate areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth graders in Bedford have been researching presidential
politics, and this being New Hampshire, they have met most of the
men who would be president. Gary Bauer, Texas Governor George W.
Bush and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch have all visited. The students
also went on a field trip to meet Arizona Senator John McCain.
Former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley offered to send a pro
basketball player in his stead, but the school turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes asked the assembled students _ who recited for him in
turn, the Declaration of Independence -- where their rights come
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bill of Rights?'' one young man asked. No, said Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us?'' No.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government?'' No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luthur King?'' No, ``but he understood where our rights
came from,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution?'' No.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a blond-haired girl raised her hand, sat up straight,
and said ``The rights come from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes had his answer.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech before the New Hampshire house of representatives,
Keyes spoke about slavery and abortion and applauded New
Hampshire's ``healthy distrust'' of the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   He told the New Hampshire House members that some people might
think his strong anti-abortion stance is politically ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feel that way,'' Keyes said, ``then you ought to be
ashamed to be from New Hampshire.''

GILLETTE PROFITS SINK 22% IN 4TH; SEES REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Again insisting that better days are just ahead,
Gillette Co. said Thursday fourth quarter profits fell 22 percent
to $339 million on sales of $3.03 billion, a 4 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based maker of such products as Mach3 razor blades,
Duracell batteries, and Parker pens said it should see a sales gain
in ``the high single digits'' for the year 2000 and added that it
expects to meet earnings forecasts for the first and second quarter
as well as for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our global business fundamentals in all core categories are
very strong, and our market shares are at record levels,'' said
Michael C. Hawley, Gillette's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter results were in line with reduced expectations.
In the fall, Gillette warned investors that results would be hurt
by a reduction in razor blade shipments.
</P>
<P>
   As retailers in Europe and South America consolidate and upgrade
their inventory systems, they are cutting back on the amount of
razor blades they stockpile, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last decade, Gillette was a Wall Street darling,
but more recently, economic problems in key foreign markets,
unfavorable exchange rates, and disappointing results for the
company's stationery and some of its Braun small appliance lines
have been a drag on overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even before reports surfaced this week that Gillette had
rebuffed an acquisition overture from Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. _
something Gillette again declined to discuss Thursday _ Gillette
has been under pressure to unload its subpar product lines and
concentrate on the highly profitable businesses of making razor
blades and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Gillette, less equals more, and less would equal more
focus,'' said Fredric E. Russell of Fredric E. Russell Management
Co. in Tulsa, Okla., a Gillette shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Gillette said it would consider selling or
discontinuing product lines that failed to meet performance
targets, though it has hinted it plans to hang on to the Braun part
of its oral care business.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Gillette said it continued to vigorously pursue these
options but added it had nothing more to say at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement on the subject should come ``sooner than later''
this year, said Eric A. Kraus, Gillette's vice president of
corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette announced its fourth-quarter results after the market
closed. Gillette shares rose 11/16 to close at 40 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

REPUBLICANS ASSAIL PRESIDENT'S SPENDING PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-SPEECH; will be updated after State of Union, set for
9 p.m. EST) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on Thursday assailed the agenda
President Clinton outlined for his last year in office as
spendthrift, and heralded the GOP as the true steward of fiscal
responsibility, guardian of the elderly and champion of millions of
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton delivered his last State of the Union
address on Thursday evening, Republicans seized on details that
seeped out during the day to warn voters that Democrats could not
be trusted to oversee the nation's prosperity and the federal
budget surpluses that have accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that if you listen carefully, what you'll hear is a
litany of spending,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential front-runner, told a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in
Nashua, N.H. ``If the past is any judge of today, it is going to be
spending after spending after spending, which proves my point. If
there is money left in Washington, it is going to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, expressing amazement
at a litany of proposed initiatives, from a $50 million plan to
clean up the Great Lakes to a $20 million proposal to fight
infectious diseases, said before the speech: ``If we enacted all
the new programs the president has talked about, we'd spend just
about the entire surplus on bigger and more expensive government.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's reaction from Republicans previewed the
year-long battle between the two parties over how best to use the
trillions of dollars in projected surpluses _ already a core theme
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have vowed to protect Social Security and pay down
the $3.6 trillion national debt, but Democrats would use much of
the non-Social Security surplus to boost spending on domestic
programs, while Republicans are eager to plow much of that money
into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For the televised Republican response to Clinton, however, party
leaders picked Sens. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Susan Collins of
Maine, experts on health care and education, issues usually
associated with Democrats. The choice underscored Republicans'
desire to show a moderate face on two issues that have emerged as
immensely popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators took dramatically different approaches. Collins
never even mentioned Clinton or the more than $3 billion in
education spending increases he proposed. She indirectly criticized
the administration for ``dictating to communities how they should
run their schools,'' advocating instead pushing more control over
education decisions to local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans want what all parents want for their children's
schools: more federal help but less federal interference,'' Collins
said in remarks prepared for her response.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Frist, a physician, repeatedly attacked Clinton's
health-care proposals, including a $110 billion health-care package
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time he proposed a health plan was seven years ago,''
Frist said in remarks prepared for his response, referring to the
ill-fated effort headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``And then it
amounted to a federal government takeover of our entire health
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frist also edged closer to embracing a version of two
Democratic health-care proposals _ a patients' bill of rights that
allows patients to sue their health-care plan under certain
conditions, and expanding Medicare to include prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep doctors first, lawyers second,'' Frist
said of the Republican plan to regulate health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers in tough re-election fights were quick to
embrace Clinton's education and health-care aims, while distancing
themselves from domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am in agreement with many of his goals _ for example,
improving the quality of education for our children and creating
some kind of prescription drug benefit for America's seniors _
generally it is important that we restrict increases in spending,
lest we seriously slow our economic growth,'' said Sen. William V.
Roth Jr. of Delaware, who heads the Finance Committee and is facing
a bruising campaign this fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Virtually absent from Thursday night's Republican reaction was
any mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which dominated
discussion outside the chamber at the last two State of the Union
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   And while Republicans were not ready to give Clinton a hearty
send-off, some lawmakers held out a symbolic olive branch, partly
perhaps to avoid being labeled a ``do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, including Representative David Dreier of
California, cheered Clinton's support for bringing China into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said Dreier, who heads the House Rules
Committee. ``Republicans will work in good faith with this
president and every Democrat in Congress who puts ideas ahead of
politics.''

EDWARD J. LOGUE, URBAN PLANNER WHO REMADE BOSTON, AT 78 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDGAR J. DRISCOLL JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Edward J. Logue, an urban planner who remade the face
of Boston in the 1960s as director of the city's redevelopment
authority, died at his West Tisbury home Thursday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Logue was recruited by the late Boston Mayor John F. Collins
to build on programs initiated in the Hynes administration of the
1950s and create a comprehensive development program for a ``New
Boston,'' and then make it happen. Which he did, with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were Government Center, the Prudential Center, and
a revitalization of the waterfront region, an overhaul of key city
neighborhoods that gave Boston a new image, for itself and for the
wider world beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Walkway to the Sea'' _ the Faneuil Hall-Quincy Market
restoration _ was another project conceived, approved, and funded
under his aegis. It became one of the best-known and most-imitated
community development projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other Logue-led projects included the razing of the elevated
portion of the `T' in Charlestown and the rebuilding of Washington
Park in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   Of medium height and stocky of frame, Mr. Logue, who lived on
West Cedar Street, Beacon Hill, was a lightning rod for criticism
in his heyday, considered brash and confrontational by those who
opposed his plans. But in the larger framework of urban planning,
he was widely praised as a master strategist and builder whose
enduring vision helped give a proud old city a distinct and
attractive new vitality.
</P>
<P>
   His admirers cited his ability to recruit top-quality
professionals from many different disciplines and mold them into an
effective, productive team; his ability to relate sensitively to
the concerns of the community (``planning with people,'' he called
it); his role as one of the first public officials to stress
rehabilitation and adaptive re-use of old buildings; and his
administrative creativity in getting difficult projects done, or as
one observer put it: ``He was a master of the ins and outs of
everyday politics and was particularly successful in dealing with
agencies of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Logue resigned his post with the Boston Redevelopment
Authority in 1967 to run for mayor, a bid that fell short. In
January 1968, he became one of the first research associates at the
Institute of Politics, founded two years before at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He also was
Maxwell Visiting Professor of Government at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Mr. Logue left Boston for New York to head
Nelson Rockefeller's newly formed New York State Urban Development
Corp. There he presided over the creation of 33,000 housing units
in the state, including 2,000 units of mixed-income housing on
Roosevelt Island in New York City's East River. He was president
and chief executive officer of the corporation from 1968 to 1975,
when the job ended in a cloud of criticism about financial
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Then he formed his own company, Logue Development Company, Inc.,
a consultant firm, and took on the gargantuan task of rebuilding
New York's South Bronx, a project funded in part by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development. He was appointed director of the
South Bronx Development Office by New York Mayor Ed Koch in 1978,
and in 1981 became president of the organization. But the days of
massive infusions of federal money, which he had been so adept at
channeling to Boston, were over. And in 1985 the Bronx project was
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Coyle, one of Mr. Logue's successors as head of the BRA,
recalled encountering him in 1983 on a field visit to the South
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was evolving,'' said Coyle, an admirer of his
predecessor's bold vision for Boston, ``was a reflective and
extraordinarily thoughtful man who was seeing first-hand the
failure of urban planning in the South Bronx. You had a sense of a
promethean figure doing penance _ the master builder surrounded by
urban decay, with the federal government abandoning him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Mr. Logue's accomplishments in Boston, Mr. Coyle said: He was
``the best of his generation. The replacement of old Scollay Square
with Government Center has to be placed at the top of the list of
plans that succeeded around the country. A different generation of
planners might have done it with more preservation in mind. But as
a stimulus for the economy, the Government Center plan worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle also noted that Mr. Logue was often criticized for the
wholesale razing of the West End _ even though he had nothing to do
with it. That neighborhood was cleared for renewal before Mr. Logue
arrived in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Logue returned to Boston in 1985 as a lecturer at MIT's
School of Architecture and Planning. Then he became president of
Logue Boston, a firm he started with two longtime Boston friends,
the realtor John Ryan and the lawyer John Bok. Among the projects
they took on were the proposed relocation of Suffolk University to
two monumental state facilities, the Hurley Building and the
Lindemann Center in the Government Center area, and, in turn, the
development of Suffolk's seven Beacon Hill buildings into luxury
housing. Another project was the building of a 126-unit condominium
known as ``Savin Hill Green,'' in the Savin Hill section of
Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Logue was born in Philadelphia on February 7, 1921, the son
of Edward J. and Resina (Fay) Logue. He was a graduate of Yale
College in 1942 and Yale Law School in 1947. During World War II,
he served as an Air Force bombardier and was awarded the Air Medal
with clusters, eight Battle Stars, and a Presidential Unit Citation
for his service in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from law school he was legal secretary to
Connecticut Governor Chester Bowles from 1949 to 1951 and later a
staff aide to the Senate majority in the 1951 session of
Connecticut's General Assembly. In 1952-53, he served as chief of
staff to Mr. Bowles when he was US Ambassador to India. On
returning to this country in 1954, he became development
administrator of the city of New Haven, where he worked until John
Collins called him to Boston in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Mr. Logue summered at Chilmark, Martha's
Vineyard, where he was active in conservation and rehabilitation
efforts. In 1971 he founded the Vineyard Open Land Foundation,
which he served as a longtime trustee. In addition he was a trustee
of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Design and Pratt
Institute, New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The author of numerous essays, articles and reports on housing,
planning, community development, government organization and
related matters, Mr. Logue also was a visiting professor at New
York University Law School, the University of Pennsylvania, the
University of Rhode Island, and the University of Cincinnati; and
visiting lecturer at Yale Law School, Princetown University, and
Cleveland State University.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Margaret (DeVane) Logue; a son, William
Devane Logue of West Hartford, Conn.; a daughter, Katherine of West
Tisbury; and four grandchildren.

<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley was a candidate
transformed Thursday, stumping with renewed vigor across snowy New
Hampshire and planning to begin a sharp new attack against Vice
President Al Gore on one his most vulnerable areas, campaign
finance.
</P>
<P>
   At almost every stop Thursday, Bradley hammered at the theme he
unveiled at the final New Hampshire debate with Gore on Wednesday
night: that the vice president is a dishonest candidate who could
not be trusted to honor campaign pledges if elected. And in
comments to reporters, Bradley made clear that his performance on
Wednesday was a signal that he was coming out fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't care about the people enough to tell them the
truth in a campaign, then how are they going to trust that you're
going to care about them enough to fight for health care reform?''
Bradley told several dozen shivering supporters outside his
campaign headquarters in Concord Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bradley said he would step up that attack on Friday,
when he was expected to criticize Gore's role in the aggressive
fund raising for the Clinton-Gore campaign of 1996. Gore made phone
calls from the White House to solicit contributions and appeared at
a fund-raiser at Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles during that
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley has chastised the administration's 1996
fund-raising tactics before, he had avoided attacking Gore on the
issue. But his advisers said Thursday that they expected Bradley to
take on Gore directly on Friday, at an event in which Bradley will
be endorsed by former Gov. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers described his new line of attack as part of a
carefully calculated strategy developed in the past two weeks. They
said it was born partly out of Bradley's anger with what he
perceived as Gore's unrelentingly distortions of his record and
positions. But it was also the result of their growing concern that
Bradley's support in New Hampshire was slipping away, and with it,
his chances of upsetting Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley had decided to be more aggressive before the Iowa
caucuses on Monday, he waited until reaching New Hampshire to begin
because his advisers feared that it would not receive much
attention in Iowa, where Bradley was trailing badly in the polls.
He lost to Gore in the caucuses by 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bradley himself acknowledged that the timing of his
new attack was carefully planned. Asked why he had waited so long
to criticize Gore's integrity, Bradley replied, ``I felt it had to
be made in the last week of the primary, so people would know.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, referring to Wednesday's debate, ``Last night was a
way of saying, enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In his meticulous way, Bradley avoided blasting Gore in the
hours just before the debate, even though a radio talk show host
had repeatedly offered him opportunities on Wednesday morning.
Bradley's aides said he wanted to hold fire until the nationally
televised debate, to ensure his remarks received the largest
possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign called Bradley's new remarks a sign of
desperation. ``After 12 months of above-it-all politics, he's
clearly started listening to his pollsters and consultants and
decided to wage a negative campaign,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments Wednesday night and Thursday seemed aimed not
just at winning over wavering voters, but also at bolstering his
core supporters, many of whom have been saying that they wanted
Bradley to show that he is willing to fight fiercely for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he did it,'' said Patricia Lorio of New Hyde Park,
N.Y., 65, who showed up at Bradley's rally in Concord. ``If you're
just sweet and nice, you're not going to get their passions up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Taylor, 76, a supporter of Bradley's who shook his hand
in a parking lot in Exeter, said, ``I was glad to see he had a
little life.''
</P>
<P>
   But having tried to cast himself as a ``new kind of politician''
who abhors attack politics, Bradley runs the risk of appearing
inconsistent, or of alienating undecided voters, in slashing at
Gore now.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Laura Davies, a 37-year-old independent voter from
Exeter, said she was somewhat turned-off by Wednesday's contentious
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the confrontational stuff,'' she said after
shaking Bradley's hand in a grocery store. ``I want to hear what
they have to say on issues rather than their bickering.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Attacking Gore on campaign finance could also infuriate
Democratic primary voters, many of whom think that the Clinton-Gore
campaign's aggressive fund raising in 1996 was done in the good
cause of defeating conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With an energy reminiscent of Bill Clinton during his underdog
New Hampshire campaign of 1992, Bradley made repeated impromptu
stops Thursday, bounding out of his bus to grab hands and chat up
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a supermarket in Exeter, Bradley, trailed by hustling
photographers and television camera crews walked up and down
aisles, checking out produce and potential voters. In a bar in
Portsmouth, he shook hands with the beer-drinking college crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At an event with environmental activists on the shores of a
frozen bay, and later in a speech before more than 400 employees at
a Timberland shoe factory in Hampton, Bradley spiced his stump
speech with blasts at Gore's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you conduct a campaign is very important,'' he said at the
Timberland event. ``That's the point I tried to make last night at
the debate. After absorbing months of misleading statements and
misrepresentations, last night I threw him an elbow.''

 &HT;    Success won't make Rams' Timmerman forget his roots
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a year that the NFL's image has taken an
old-fashioned whipping, a heart-warming story comes from the
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa farm boy has turned Super Bowl offensive lineman, three
times over. Because of notorious players like Rae Carruth and Cecil
Collins, the timing couldn't have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Timmerman made two Super Bowl trips with the Packers and
he's back again. This time he's with the Rams, his favorite team as
a child, which fits with his version of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Timmerman grew up on a 1,000-acre bean and corn farm in
northwest Iowa and played on a partial scholarship at Division II
South Dakota State. Only by some urging did he stick around for his
last season of eligibility, instead of returning to his family farm
with his degree in agricultural business. He was rewarded as the
top Division II lineman in the country.
</P>
<P>
   That got him a call from the Packers, seven rounds and 40
linemen into the 1995 draft. He played 17 games in his rookie
season and when left guard Aaron Taylor got hurt in a wild-card
game against the Falcons, and Timmerman hasn't come out of the
starting lineup since. The Rams signed him as a free agent last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   With his first signing bonus, which he estimated to be $15,000
after taxes, he bought farm equipment. With his second signing
bonus of $5 million, to go along with his $19 million package for
five years, he did more of the same. He traded in his tractor for a
better version and bought a new field cultivator. He still heads
back to Iowa on breaks and during the offseason, for little rest
and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many people within a square mile out there,
so you get some time to yourself,'' Timmerman said. ``For me, too,
it makes you realize how hard it is to make a buck out there.
Sometimes you lose track of that. In professional sports, you see
all these people making all this money. You get a game check, and
that's more than some people make all year. You kind of lose sight
of that, so for me to go back there and see that corn's a buck and
a half and beans are four bucks, it brings a lot of things back to
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When football is over, this 29-year-old knows where he's headed
_ the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd like to return,'' Timmerman said. ``My brother's
like, `What are you waiting for?' He's like, `You can't buy more
equipment. You've got to have a guy to go along with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Timmermans' neighbors will be watching over their farm this
weekend, while the family makes the trek to the Georgia Dome to
support the player they and the Rams know was a key to St. Louis'
turnaround from 4-12 to 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really liked him for his pass-protection ability, but we
really didn't know the guy,'' offensive line coach Jim Hanifan
said. ``As soon as he arrived, we knew we had something special.
... Adam is a very genuine individual.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-4, 300-pound lineman with the crew cut, he does have
some heartbreak in his story. Four months after his second trip to
the Super Bowl with the Packers in 1998, his father died from head
injuries suffered in an accident on an all-terrain vehicle on the
family's farm. Timmerman was home at the time, and it's a place he
goes back to, to draw strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to be there at first,'' Timmerman said. ``You're
out there, and you expect to see him pulling up with a fresh load
of beans to go plant. We were always out there working together,
that's what made it fun. You really miss him. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to look at things in life a little differently. You
stop complaining about things that don't matter. I have a son of my
own now, and there are some father-son things it would have been
nice to talk to him about. You value things, differently, family
and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   No mention of football. No need. After three trips to the Super
Bowl, Timmerman still talks as if he's never been far from the
farm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Congessional Budget Office, well known for its caution on
fiscal matters, has predicted a federal budget surplus of as much
as $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. The announcement has
heated up debate about how to use the surplus _ in tax cuts,
additional spending, or paying down the national debt. Before
euphoria sweeps through the political world, certain important
factors ought to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these is uncertainty. The CBO estimates are based
on a number of reasonable assumptions about economic growth,
inflation, interest rates, world conditions, and so on. While the
assumptions may be reasonable, they cannot be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The number itself, though large, is well below the national debt
of $5.6 trillion. It is small compared with federal budgets over
the 10 years that will probably total around $20 trillion and gross
domestic product of more that $80 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts are politically attractive but should be targeted where
they will do the most good. Increases in personal exemptions
deserve high priority because they provide the greatest
proportional benefit to lower- and middle-income taxpayers and
because they have tended to lag behind inflation. Cutting basic
percentage rates locks the system into lower revenues that may be
politically difficult to recover in some future restructuring of
the overall system _ trading slightly higher income tax rates for
lower payroll tax rates, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Spending to stabilize Social Security or Medicare makes sense,
but starting costly new initiatives that cannot be sustained would
create more hardship in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the national debt helps by lowering federal interest
costs, allowing support for other programs. Perhaps more important,
it makes future deficit spending to stimulate the economy in
sluggish times more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The choices are not simple, and politicians may treat them like
a buffet by sampling a bit from each dish. The most important
consideration is to avoid overeating.

CLINTON PROPOSES FAR-REACHING PLAN ON DRUGS AND THE UNINSURED 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: With CLINTON-SPEECH; will be updated after State of Union.) 
(nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday night proposed an
ambitious, multifaceted health care agenda, calling on Congress to
provide prescription drugs to the elderly, new government subsidies
to help people buy health insurance, new tax breaks for long-term
care and a new federal law to define the rights of people in health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton touched on a
half-dozen other health care proposals, including his desire for a
new tax credit to reward pharmaceutical companies for developing
vaccines and drugs to treat AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other
diseases that afflict millions of people in the third world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also highlighted his request to spend more on mental
health care, as recommended by Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice
President Al Gore. And without giving details, Clinton stressed his
desire for government action to prevent medical errors that harm
tens of thousands of people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said Clinton would ask Congress to dedicate nearly $400
billion of the expected budget surplus over the next decade to
shore up the finances of Medicare and to pay some of the cost of
new outpatient drug benefits under that program.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the White House disclosed many of the
president's health care proposals. But Wednesday night, Clinton
discussed the package as a whole for the first time and wrapped it
together with a common theme.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. When Clinton unveiled his pharmaceutical plan
in June, he said it would cost $118 billion over 10 years. But the
Congressional Budget Office said the cost would exceed $165
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that all Medicare beneficiaries should have access
to an affordable option for insurance coverage of prescription drug
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern
medicine,'' Clinton declared, in excerpts of the speech released
beforehand by the White House. ``No one creating a Medicare program
today would even consider excluding coverage for prescription
drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors now lack dependable drug
coverage, which can lengthen and enrich their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In good conscience, Clinton said, ``we cannot let another year
pass without extending to all seniors the lifeline of affordable
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests invited by the White House to the congressional
session Wednesday night was Pat Brown of Johnson City, Tenn., a
retiree who spends $4,000 of her savings each year on prescription
drugs for heart and thyroid ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's health care proposals will set the tone this year for
campaign debates and will influence the agenda of Congress.
Republicans, while favoring different approaches, said Wednesday
night that they wanted to address many of the problems cataloged by
Clinton: the growing number of Americans without health insurance,
the frustrations of HMO patients and the desperation of elderly
people seeking affordable prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already laid some groundwork for legislation on
these issues, and many of the president's proposals have some
election-year appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican response to Clinton's speech, Sen. Bill Frist
of Tennessee endorsed many of the president's goals, but said
Clinton's approach was too costly and heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Frist recalled Clinton's plan in his first year as president to
guarantee health insurance for all Americans, which Congress
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now tonight, 84 months later,'' Frist said, in the text of
remarks made available Wednesday afternoon, ``the president has
unveiled a similar plan just as bad as the first. It makes
government even bigger and more bloated because each new program we
heard about tonight _ and there were about 11 of them in health
care alone _ comes with its own massive bureaucracy. And each will
cost you, the taxpayer, billions more of your tax dollars, more
than $1,000 for every man, woman, and child.''
</P>
<P>
   One new item in Clinton's package was a proposal for a tax
credit to accelerate the development of vaccines for malaria,
tuberculosis and AIDS. Jennings said the tax credit would create an
incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in development
of vaccines for poor countries, which often cannot afford to buy
the vaccines they need.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and the House passed different versions of
legislation defining patients' rights last year. But only the House
version, which would make it easier for patients to sue HMOs for
injuries, is acceptable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Wednesday night that any legislation on
this issue must include ``an enforcement mechanism, to ensure
recourse for patients who have been harmed as a result of a health
plan's actions.''

GROUP SUES TO HALT LOW-LEVEL TRAINING FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of environmentalists, outdoorsmen and
rural landowners sued the Air Force Thursday, seeking suspension of
low-level training flights that they say have gravely disrupted
wildlife, livestock and recreation, especially in the wild deserts,
canyons and forests of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, is the most
serious legal challenge so far to the Air Force's training program,
which has been beset by political and legal attacks around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   From cattle ranchers in Texas and American Indians in Idaho to
hikers in New Hampshire's White Mountains, complaints about fighter
jets and bombers roaring overhead have steadily increased in recent
years, forcing the Air Force to scramble to keep its training
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every Air Force proposal to find new places to train
or to expand the use of existing spaces has faced increasingly
vehement local opposition, but the coalition's challenge is the
first to try to suspend all low-level training.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition hopes to force the Air Force to complete a broad
environmental study of the impact of its training flights on
wildlife, as well as on tourism and other economic activities, in
areas under or near its training areas. While the Air Force has
conducted limited studies for individual areas, the lawsuit accuses
it of violating the National Environmental Policy Act by not
studying the cumulative effects of training flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence has been mounting for years that these flights
are not compatible with a lot of land uses,'' said Peter J. Galvin,
a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, a
conservation group in Tucson, Ariz., that is one of the plaintiffs
in the suit. ``And the Air Force has never studied the cumulative
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The case underscores the difficulties the Air Force and the
other services have had competing for the nation's increasingly
crowded airspace _ as well as for public lands for bombing runs and
firing other weapons _ as commercial airline traffic has increased
and areas that were once remote have become more populated.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges have intensified since the end of the Cold War.
Citing national security has proved less persuasive than it once
was when it comes to sonic disruptions caused by jets and other
military activity.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawsuit's prospects are not clear, a suspension of all
training is remote. But the lawsuit could force the service to
conduct the broad environmental impact study, which the coalition's
leaders said was their main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least then, we would have a public process we can interact
in,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force did not respond directly to the lawsuit, saying it
would not comment on pending litigation. But officials released a
statement saying that the service regularly analyzed the impact of
low-level flights and that a suspension is not warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistic training is essential for the United States Air
Force,'' the statement said. ``It provides the combat edge that
enables victory in battle and reduces American casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is not alone among the services in facing these
challenges, nor is the United States the only place where citizens
have taken issue with the noise _ and potential danger _ of such
training.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, the Navy has become mired in a political dispute
over using the island of Vieques as a bombing range. In Germany,
public outrage over NATO training flights forced German pilots to
train at a range in New Mexico, prompting new legal challenges from
residents there.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force began a broad study of the environmental impact of
low-level flights in 1988, but abandoned it and never made the
results public, Galvin said. An internal Air Force memo, obtained
by the coalition under the Freedom of Information Act, concluded
that the study's preliminary finding ``does not put the Air Force
in a favorable light.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force pilots fly roughly 2 million hours a year around the
world. In the United States, aviation regulations restrict military
aircraft flying faster than 250 miles an hour to proscribed routes
and operating areas, forcing them to stay away from cities, for
example. Some of those areas are set aside exclusively for military
use, but in most, military aircraft mix with commercial airliners,
though at different altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force defines ``low level'' as below 500 feet, and
officials said that only 5 percent of its training flights dip
below that. But the coalition is seeking to suspend training
flights below 2,000 feet, the voluntary standard for all flights
that the Federal Aviation Administration recently established for
national parks and other wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that low-level flights ``are having
cumulative and synergistic environmental impacts on many facets of
the nation's environment.'' The shock of jets soaring overhead has
disrupted protected species of birds and mammals, as well as
livestock, causing herds to stampede and female cattle to abort
calves, it says.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also cites reports by the National Park Service and
the Fish and Wildlife Service that raise concerns about the
disruption flights cause to hikers, hunters and others in parks and
wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sudden, violent aural and visual intrusions of all these
low-level training flights is eroding the ability of visitors to
use these sensitive public lands for the purposes for which they
were set aside,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force spokesmen disputed the impact on wildlife or
livestock. They said scientific studies had shown that animals
adjusted to the noise of jets, and they noted that many of the
nation's bombing ranges had attracted abundant wildlife escaping
human development.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore continued his drumbeat
against former Sen. Bill Bradley Thursday, accusing him of using
negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign seemed stung at Wednesday night's debate when
Bradley accused Gore of lying and distorting Bradley's record.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp was fighting assertions not only by Bradley but by
the debate moderator that Gore has been distorting Bradley's record
and his health care proposal. During the debate, Bradley compared
Gore to former President Richard M. Nixon, the emblem of dishonesty
in high office.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 25 employees at Silknet, a software company
here, Gore lashed out at Bradley. ``Regrettably, I'm not sure that
Senator Bradley wants a real debate on the substance of the
issues,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bradley of contradictory behavior, of attacking
while complaining of attacks. But Gore got in his own digs at
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore referred to Bradley's statement last week
before the Iowa caucuses that Iowa ``rewards entrenched power,'' a
reference to Gore's lock on organized labor. Gore Thursday
interpreted that statement in words that Bradley never used.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Iowa,'' Gore said, ``he attacked the voters by saying that
they were puppets of entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``Now in the closing days of this contest, he has
raised another phony issue, condemning negative attacks while
launching negative attacks himself. I don't quite understand how
someone can condemn so-called negative attacks while in the next
breath launching real negative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   And he continued to hammer at Bradley's proposals for Medicaid.
``I am going to fight to protect Medicaid,'' Gore said, adding:
``Senator Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid and replace it
with an inadequate substitute. That's a fact, not a negative
attack.'' Bradley has proposed replacing Medicaid with a larger
health insurance program that would cover more people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put on the defensive himself Thursday during an
interview with New Hampshire Public Radio. The first caller, who
identified herself as Sarah in Nashua, questioned his credibility:
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the debate last night and I heard you say you have
always supported a woman's right to choose,'' the caller said. ``I
understand if you've changed your position during your career, but
I'm just having a hard _ I don't know how I can support your
candidacy if you're dishonest about such an important subject and
especially on national television.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who declared in the debate that he had ``always been for a
woman's right to choose,'' said that he has always supported Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. But
he acknowledged that he had wrestled with the question of whether
public money should be used to pay for abortions for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always supported keeping abortion legal, and it's true
that earlier in my career I voted to restrict the use of federal
funding in some circumstances, but over the years I have come to
the very strong view that federal funding should also be available,
and that has been my position for quite a long time,'' Gore
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the radio interview, Gore was asked about his apparent
shift away from Clinton earlier and his shift toward him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we're friends, and that friendship is genuine,''
Gore said of the president. ``Secondly, I have been critical of the
personal mistake that the president made, which I've been asked
about from time to time in this campaign. Third, I have fought
alongside the president for this strong economy and for the other
improvements that we've seen during the Clinton-Gore
administration. And fourth, I have to win this race on my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he continued, ``depending upon the question that's
asked or the perspective of the questioner, they may focus on one
of those four aspects of the relationship and not really hear the
complexity of it with all four, and if they hear only that I'm
running on my own, they may say, `Oh, he's distancing himself.' If
they hear I fought with President Clinton for a strong economy,
they may say, `Oh, he's embracing President Clinton.' Well, all of
those things are true, but it's not true that I'm either distancing
myself from him or that I am trying to run as a derivative
candidate. So it's a complex relationship, just as most human
relationships are.''

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Shortly after dawn, Cesar Robaina pulls into the lot
outside a two-story brick building a couple of miles off the Strip
and enters his office.
</P>
<P>
   The door reads: Las Vegas Sports Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a half dozen desks, topped with computer terminals, are
crowded into what he describes as the ``war room.'' The neon lights
and hulking Vegas hotels are visible in the distance. Robaina flips
on the bank of five TV sets lining the front wall. The Jacksonville
Jaguars and Tennessee Titans will tee up for the AFC championship
in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Office hands begin to trickle in. The most important on this
Sunday morning are Robaina, trailed by Scott Kaminsky and Jason
Been. They are the oddsmakers, the ``dream team'' of sporting
prognosticators. Before the day is done, they will create the
official betting line for Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   These are serious people; there is serious money at stake. The
Super Bowl game is in Atlanta but the Super Bowl action starts in
Las Vegas. Last year, $76 million was wagered legally here on the
Atlanta Falcons-Denver Broncos game. At least as much is thought to
be wagered illegally around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Only March Madness, the college basketball tournament, draws
anywhere near as much betting action, and it is spread over most of
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Robaina, 35, a Las Vegas native, ranks as the odds manager. He
studied drafting at a technical school after high school but has
been in the gambling business since hiring on with a tout service
when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   Does he bet? ``Only when the line moves considerably, and it's
out of whack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky, 46, migrated to the desert from Pittsburgh in 1982 to
``make some money'' and was the first employee hired by Las Vegas
Sports Consultants. He had kicked around as a bartender, sold
lithographs on the street and played poker to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Been, 26, is the greenhorn, a UNLV graduate and oddsmaker here
for just a year. The Milwaukee native majored in hotel and gaming
management, working part-time as a ticket writer for Vegas sports
books to help pay his way through college.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Las Vegas sports book _ and there are more than 90
_ works off the opening line posted by Las Vegas Sports
Consultants. It's the same for the nearly 200 Internet wagering
sites, all of which sit outside U.S. borders. Many are clients of
the consulting company, paying contracted fees for its oddsmaking
expertise and its reputation for setting a good line. The cue from
Las Vegas Sports Consultants is also taken by neighborhood bookies
from California to New York.
</P>
<P>
   For seven solid hours of doubleheader football, from the opening
kickoff to the final whistle of the St. Louis Rams-Tampa Bay Bucs
game for the NFC title, the oddsmakers are perched in front of the
TV sets, breaking only to munch on pizza and chicken fingers. They
kibitz back and forth, weighing strengths and deficiencies of the
aspiring Super Bowl teams, much like stock analysts toss around PE
ratios and earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis isn't showing me much,'' Robaina said just before
the Rams eke out an 11-6 win in the NFC title game. ``No offense,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers up and down the Strip agonize with indecision over
St. Louis. While the Rams mean greater wagering volume than if
Tampa Bay had survived, Vegas sports books have significant dollars
tied to futures that come due if the Rams win the Super Bowl. St.
Louis was a preseason 200-to-1 choice and even as high as 150-to-1
two weeks into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted St. Louis out for that reason,'' Robaina said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Robina and his guys play with potential
Super Bowl lines, at one point having the Rams as much as 10
1/2-point favorites. The team's sour performance is reflected in
the number opening at 8. The early action from the professional
bettors, however, is mostly on the Titans and the line drops to St.
Louis minus-7 at most Vegas sports books. (That means that for a
bettor wagering on St. Louis to win, the Rams must beat the Titans
by more than 7 points.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl tends to bring in more of the general public,
plus we have to still play against the wise guys, the professional
gamblers,'' Robaina said. ``So we put out a number that we hope
will balance the action on both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cluttered 10-by-10-foot office behind the sports book at
the Excalibur Hotel and Casino, Eric St. Clair is in front of his
computer when the official line flashes across his screen. St.
Clair is race and sports-book director for the Excalibur and six
other Nevada properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not so much line makers as line adjusters,''
acknowledged St. Clair, mindful of the science that went into
making the line. ``But the guys making the line don't have quite
the same pressure as somebody who runs a sports book. They don't
have somebody over them saying, `How'd we lose $50,000 on this
game, $40,000 on this game?'''
</P>
<P>
   To protect themselves, St. Clair and other Vegas sports bosses
might tweak the opening line slightly and then let the action move
it. But for the Super Bowl, sports books also put their personal
touch on so-called proposition bets. ``Props'' range from the
intriguing to the ridiculous, everything from which player will
score the game's first points to who will win the coin toss.
</P>
<P>
   Intertops.com, an Internet sports book operating out of Antigua,
does Vegas one better on proposition bets, posting 10/11 odds _ win
$10 for every $11 bet _ on whether the Super Bowl national
television audience will exceed 40 percent of American households.
It usually does, but that level is in question for Sunday because
of the small-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   The sports books operate to minimize potential losses, and often
they adjust the line in a defensive manner. Up to the kickoff
around supper-time Sunday, the Super Bowl line will be constantly
monitored and inched ahead or pulled back. The goal is to have an
equal amount of money wagered on St. Louis and Tennessee, to
balance the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there starts to be an imbalance of money on the Rams, we'll
move the line in order to draw money in on the other side,'' said
Robert Walker, race and sports book director at the Mirage Hotel &AMP;
Casino. ``There are a lot of factors, including the possibility
that it was a single bettor. Your screen will tell you how many
bets and what the total amount bet is. So if you go from 13 bets at
$20,000 (total) to 14 at $120,000, you know real quick what just
happened. You don't want a knee- jerk reaction to anything, but it
is constantly monitored.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is turning away business, though.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down glitzy Las Vegas Boulevard, Super Bowl Week is
filling most of the hotel properties and luring the sports players
and high-rollers into the casinos. More than 225,000 people are
expected to take up temporary residence this weekend, making it the
city's third busiest weekend behind New Year's and the Chinese New
Year.
</P>
<P>
   People attracted to the Vegas action plan vacations around Super
Bowl weekend. The hotels invite VIP guests. Two days before the
game, hotel vacancies along the Strip are as hard to find as
tickets for Siegfried &AMP; Roy.
</P>
<P>
   The non-gambling economic impact alone probably will exceed $65
million, according to the local convention and visitors authority.
For those who didn't finagle a ticket to hear the snap count in the
Georgia Dome, Vegas sells itself as the place for the serious fan
to catch the action. It has more parties than Atlanta could ever
imagine. And you can bet the game, hassle-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is a great city, but it's a little different than
coming to Las Vegas for the weekend,'' said Allan Feldman, a Mirage
vice president. ``You can buy show tickets, go to the restaurants _
bet the game. You can watch the game in the sports books and work
yourself into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need an invitation to the parties, either,'' Feldman
said. ``Here, things are more democratic. You can buy a ticket for
the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Super Bowl crowd isn't afraid to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down to the executive side at McCarran''
International Airport in Las Vegas, said Ray Koon, president of
Associated Gaming Consultants, ``you will see any number of
corporate and executive jets in there this weekend. Some of the
major hotels have their own airplanes, like the MGM and Imperial
Palace, and they will use them to go pick up key players and bring
them in.''
</P>
<P>
   They're the risk-takers the betting houses love, and this
weekend is what they play for.
</P>
<P>
   All this is bad news to the support groups that deal with
compulsive gamblers. The Super Bowl is both the biggest one-day
sporting event and a nightmare for the down-and-out gambler,
looking at a last chance to make up for his losses.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone driven to get a bet down probably can _ whether it's
buying a plane ticket to Vegas, tracking down a local bookie or
hopping on the Internet. More than $20 million will be bet via the
Internet on the Super Bowl, industry analyst Sebastian Sinclair
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Wexler, who runs a national hotline for compulsive
gamblers (1-888-LAST BET), says he gets 20 percent of his calls at
Super Bowl time. The National Council on Problem Gambling averages
more than 30,000 calls on Super Bowl weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Bowl Sunday to the compulsive gambler is like New Year's
Eve to the alcoholic,'' said Wexler, who is a recovering compulsive
gambler. ``I don't think people even care about the teams in the
game. The Super Bowl is the Super Bowl.''

CLINTON TAX PLAN COULD LEAD TO CUT IN `MARRIAGE PENALTY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With CLINTON-SPEECH; will be updated after State of Union.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In proposing Thursday night to reduce the marriage
penalty that the tax code levies on many two-income couples,
President Clinton embraced an issue that has been pushed for years
by Republicans and so opened the door to a compromise on an
election-year tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The approach set out by Clinton would help fewer couples than
alternative changes preferred by most Republicans, and in
particular would do little for couples in higher income brackets.
But with Republicans in the House having vowed to make a marriage
penalty bill one of their first priorities this year _ and with
Democrats in Congress loath to vote against such legislation at a
time of swelling federal budget surpluses _ Clinton's plan could
provide the seeds for a bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that this issue has a lot of political resonance,''
said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato
Institute, a conservative research group. ``Clinton is very adept
at taking politically popular Republican ideas and embracing them
as his own. This is a strong signal to me that we will see marriage
penalty relief this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty proposal was one of dozens set out by
Clinton in his State of the Union address, but one of the few that
he had not previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   The others included a revised version of a plan he first offered
last year to create incentives for retirement savings among low-
and middle-income people. They also included initiatives to make
health insurance more affordable, provide prescription drug
coverage within the Medicare system, increase funding for school
construction, expand the tax credit for the working poor and
provide more money for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the proposals _ few of which have much chance of
becoming law in their present form _ are intended to channel money
toward problems facing low-income people, reflecting Clinton's
emphasis Thursday night on spreading the benefits of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage penalty is mostly an issue among middle- to
high-income voters, and one that is more complex than it is often
made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty hits many two-income couples, especially
those in which the two partners make roughly the same amount of
money, pushing them into a higher tax bracket than they would face
if they could file individual tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by analysts at the Treasury Department
concluded that 24.8 million couples paid a marriage penalty in
their 1999 returns, or 48 percent of the 51.4 million joint returns
filed. The average penalty was $1,141, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also found that the same quirk in the tax code
that hurts many couples also helps many others, mostly those where
only one spouse works or where one spouse makes substantially more
than the other. The study found that 21 million couples, or 41
percent of all couples filing jointly, actually received a marriage
bonus, which averaged $1,274. About 11 percent of couples pay
neither a penalty nor a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The main component of Clinton's plan would help 9.1 million
two-income couples that pay a marriage penalty, those that claim
the standard deduction on their federal tax returns. It would
address the marriage penalty by increasing the standard deduction _
$7,200 in 1999 for couples filing jointly _ until it is twice as
much as the standard deduction for single filers, currently $4,300.
The change would be phased in over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would do nothing for couples who itemize their
deductions, as most higher-income households do.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also give a break to some taxpayers that do
not pay a marriage penalty. It would increase the standard
deduction for all couples by an additional $500 in 2005, and by
$250 for single filers.
</P>
<P>
   When fully phased in, Clinton's proposal would increase the
standard deduction for couples filing jointly by $2,150. For
someone in the 15 percent tax bracket, the tax savings would be
$322 a year when fully phased in.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimated the cost of the proposal at $45
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have offered a variety of proposals to address the
marriage penalty in recent years. Republicans in the Senate last
year proposed eliminating the penalty altogether by giving couples
the option of filing joint or individual returns. They estimated
the cost at $117.7 billion over five years starting in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican presidential candidates, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona backs a plan similar to what Clinton proposed. But Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas would take a different approach. He would
create a deduction for two-earner couples of 10 percent of the
lower-earning spouse's income, up to a maximum deduction of $3,000.
The cost of Bush's proposal was estimated at $40 billion over five
years and $12.5 billion a year after being fully phased in.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan, said Bruce Bartlett, a Treasury Department
official in the Reagan administration, ``is a minimalist approach
to dealing with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress said they were glad to see Clinton
acknowledging the importance of tax cuts in general and the
marriage penalty in particular. But they said they would insist on
a bigger and more extensive tax cutting package than the president
offered Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``think all Americans deserve tax relief, not just
the handful the president picks,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R- Texas,
who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed a number of other tax initiatives in his
address. He would provide tax incentives for charitable giving,
including allowing taxpayers who do not itemize deductions to claim
a 50 percent deduction for charitable contributions above $500 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed a series of tax incentives to encourage the
development and distribution to poor countries of vaccines to fight
diseases including malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS.

 &HT;    Lyle may return to starting lineup for Rams
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An official decision may wait until shortly before
Super Bowl XXXIV starts Sunday, but the possibility is increasing
that Rams free safety Keith Lyle will return to the starting lineup
for the first time in more than two months, replacing Devin Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, it would be the second straight bum Super Bowl
for Bush, who was phased almost completely out of the gameplan last
year by the Falcons in a Super Bowl played in his hometown of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle, 27, had started 73 straight games before a Nov. 14
shoulder injury caused nerve problems and weakness in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the final seven games of the regular season, but
played about 15 snaps in last Sunday's 11-6 win over Tampa Bay in
the NFC Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Bush, a first-round draft choice of the Falcons in
1995, the St. Louis defense didn't miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   He had 50 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery
while starting seven games.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second straight day, Bush and Lyle split repetitions
in practice Thursday, although neither claims to know who's
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle had 40 tackles, two interceptions, and a sack while
starting nine games.
</P>
<P>
   That and his reputation were good enough to earn him Pro Bowl
alternate status. He tied for the NFL lead with nine interceptions
in '96, and has a reputation for being near the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started playoff games against Minnesota and Tampa Bay,
getting in a nasty altercation after the Bucs game with Tampa guard
Frank Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lyle) did well,'' Rams coach Dick Vermeil said Wednesday of
Lyle, whom St. Louis drafted in the third round in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took some good hits on (the injured shoulder), and came
away fine. I'm pleased with the progress he showed, and we'll get
him prepared to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans running back Eddie George and quarterback Steve McNair,
who both weigh 225 pounds or more, figure to try to run the ball a
lot Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who's 6 feet, 210 pounds, is probably the equal of Lyle
(6-2, 210) as a tackler, but the durability of Lyle's shoulder
could come into question.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle is the better ``ball hawk,'' as he has 27 career
interceptions to Bush's five, but the Titans don't figure to test
the deep middle much.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who signed a four-year, $7.2 million contract with the
Rams shortly after last season, started 36 games at both safety
spots in his first three years with Atlanta, including 31 of 32 in
'96-'97.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons signed Eugene Robinson before the '98 season,
and he took Bush's free safety job.
</P>
<P>
   As Robinson went on to the Pro Bowl, Bush's role in nickel and
dime defenses diminished to the point where he barely got on the
field in a 34-19 loss to Denver in Super Bowl XXXIII.

 &HT;    Cold keeps players' minds on preparation
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service The Titans were feeling the heat
<TEXT>
Thursday.
<P>
   Their once-frigid interview tent outside the Grand Hyatt in
Buckhead was equipped with machines blowing more hot air than the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Donald Mitchell even peeled to his T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big relief,'' Mitchell said of the almost balmy
conditions. ``You don't want to sit in a building that's just as
cold as it is outside.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he didn't mind the chilly air at their first practice
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect us all that much,'' he said. ``It was just
like a normal day of practice. It gets cold in Tennessee _ but it's
not this cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Josh Evans even said the weather ``is a plus for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not too much to do right now because of the weather,''
he said, ``so we stay in watching film and going over a lot of
different things about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of heat, Evans said the constant refrain the Titans
get no respect ``is like pouring gasoline onto the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice report
</P>
<P>
   The Titans went through a 2-hour, 15-minute workout in helmets
and sweats after another short walk-through. The temperature at
Georgia Tech was 20 degrees warmer than it was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair took about 80 percent of the snaps _ more than he
did last Thursday _ and did not seem to have any mobility problems
despite his sore toe.
</P>
<P>
   However, backup Neil O'Donnell handled the opening 2-minute
drill.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher attributed that to ``superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not done it in eight weeks and we've continued to
win,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   No exceptions
</P>
<P>
   For Jevon Kearse's brother to hear who wins the Super Bowl, a
prison guard will have to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kearse, who is serving 7 1/2 years for armed robbery at
DeSoto Correctional Institution in Arcadia, Fla., is under
disciplinary confinement for fighting with another inmate on New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, whose brother is the star rookie defensive end for the
Titans, was moved from an open dorm to a cell in an isolated
section of the prison. He is not permitted to watch television,
listen to the radio, read a newspaper or use a telephone until Feb.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Warden Linda Williams said officials will not make an exception
to let him watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not fair to the other inmates, just because he's got a
brother in the Super Bowl,'' Williams said. ``We can't say, `We'll
let you watch,' and not let someone else watch because they don't
have a brother in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Par 3
</P>
<P>
   Al Del Greco is always trying to hit the ball straight. He's a
scratch golfer as well as the Titans' kicker. Kicking the ball
between the uprights is like driving a ball down the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al is as serious about his golf game as he is about kicking
footballs,'' said Craig Hentrich, the Titans' punter who is also
Del Greco's holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's golf season, yeah,'' said Del Greco, who shoots
68-75 during the offseason, 72-78 when the Titans are playing.
``This time of year, Craig likes to make fun of the fact that when
I don't hit a good shot, I get upset on the golf course. I
shouldn't say upset, but I don't like it. He fondly calls me the
bulldog because of my aggressive nature. We have a lot of fun
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco said playing with Hentrich, who is also a good golfer,
helps them be better teammates as well because they can share
something outside football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the reasons I've been more successful the past
two years is because of him,'' Del Greco said. ``We spend so much
time together day after day that if we didn't like each other, it'd
be a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hentrich said he expects to see Del Greco on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Del Greco said, ``the Celebrity Players Tour, because
I'll make more money doing that than competing against good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   There is superstition
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco remembers a kicker with garlic in his socks, though he
can't remember the guy's name.
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco has the same routine on game day because it's worked
for the past seven or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really consider them superstitions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He eats basically the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I eat spaghetti, a couple of pieces of bacon and a
glass of orange juice,'' Del Greco said. ``At 7 o'clock in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   You want fries with that?
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George said he knows his life would be much different if
he hadn't gone to Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy and found the
discipline to work hard as a student athlete. But, he pointed out,
he'd still be on the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be in jail,'' George said. ``I might be a manager
at McDonald's or something, not that it's a bad job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell me why
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's philosophy is to be a leader on the field, not a drill
sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe players have changed,'' he said. ``Ten years ago,
you could tell a team to line up on the goal line after practice
and run 10 100-yard dashes, and they'd do it. Now you tell them to
do it and they ask, `Why?' That's the difference in the athlete.
Now, you have to give them a good reason (to do it). Ten or 15
years ago, I think trust and respect were synonymous with a coach.
It's not any more. You have to earn their trust and respect.''

PATRIOTS HIRE BELICHICK, ENDING JETS' BORDER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Bill Parcells in the unfamiliar role of peacemaker, the New
York Jets and New England Patriots each got what they wanted
Thursday. The Patriots hired Bill Belichick as their head coach,
and the Jets received the Patriots' first-round draft pick for the
2000 draft in exchange for releasing the former Jets'
coach-for-a-day from his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ended what had been a bizarre month in which the
Jets (not in this order) lost two head coaches in two days, hired a
third, gained a new owner and defended themselves before the
National Football League commissioner and a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells took the initiative to broker the deal that led to
Belichick's hiring when he called the Patriots' owner, Robert
Kraft, on Tuesday night. ``I told him it was Darth Vader calling
and he said he knew who that was,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first meaningful conversation the two have had since
Parcells _ with Belichick, his assistant head coach, in tow _ left
the Patriots for the Jets in a wave of acrimony that has lingered
for three years. But in a conversation that lasted about 40 minutes
_ one that Parcells described as amiable _ the two buried their
personal animosity.
</P>
<P>
   They were both aware that finding a compromise for Belichick's
services benefited both teams. They talked about their stormy past
and shared a few laughs. Parcells acknowledged Thursday that he has
regrets about how his career in New England ended and said he hopes
he may someday return to watch a game in New England, perhaps from
the owner's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mended a lot of fences,'' said Parcells, the Jets' director
of football operations. ``We came to an agreement that regardless
of what happened with Bill Belichick, this border war with the Jets
and Patriots needed to come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious that we make an attempt to repair the
relationship. He's a good businessman, and I knew that if there was
an opportunity, regardless of who is presenting it, that would
improve his franchise, he would consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who consulted with the Jets' owner, Robert Wood
Johnson IV, said that he and Kraft only briefly negotiated that
night, with the Jets adamant in their demand for a first-round pick
and the Patriots not offering it. By Wednesday, Parcells was
convinced that a deal could not be done, that Kraft would end up
hiring someone else and that Belichick would likely be out of
coaching for a year and the Jets would lose his rights with no
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The start of free agency for NFL players is in two weeks, and
the Patriots, without a general manager or a coach, were under
pressure to put a staff together. But Kraft was reluctant to give
up the first-round pick before knowing the outcome of the antitrust
lawsuit Belichick filed against the Jets and the NFL on Monday. On
Tuesday, the judge in the case refused to issue a temporary
restraining order that would have freed Belichick from the Jets and
allowed him to negotiate with other teams. Parcells called Kraft
that night.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Belichick and his attorneys dropped the suit. The
Patriots interviewed Dom Capers, Jacksonville's defensive
coordinator, for four hours that day. At about 11 p.m. that night,
Kraft called Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the two completed the agreement. They
informed the NFL, which will review the final deal. The Jets gave
the Patriots permission to talk to Belichick early Thursday
morning. Belichick said he did not know what was going on until he
got a call from Parcells at 7 a.m. Thursday. Kraft called him at 10
a.m. and, within hours, Belichick was in Foxboro, Mass. At 6 p.m.,
Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this press conference will go a little better than
the last one I had,'' Belichick said, alluding to the rambling
monologue he delivered when he resigned from the Jets. ``The
opportunity to be in coaching was something I wasn't sure I would
have as late as 24 hours ago, and I'm extremely grateful for the
opportunity to coach in the 2000 season. It was quite an ordeal,
but it's behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the first-round pick, which gives the Jets the
16th and 18th overall picks in this year's draft, the Jets will
receive the Patriots' fourth- and seventh-round picks next year,
while the Jets give the Patriots their fifth-round selection in
2001 and the seventh-round pick in 2002. In 1997, the Jets gave the
Patriots four draft picks over three years, including their
first-round pick in the 1999 draft, to secure Parcells, who had
just led the Patriots to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's win-win for everybody,'' Parcells said. ``If I
were him and things were reversed, I would have paid it, too. Now,
we're in a position to help our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had wanted Belichick all along and asked for
permission to interview him the Monday after the regular season
ended. They were told it was too late, that Parcells had resigned
on Sunday night and that Belichick was already the Jets' head coach
because his contract stipulated that he would get that job
automatically upon Parcells' resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had been talking intermittently since Belichick
stunned the Jets organization by resigning Jan. 4 as the Jets' head
coach, one day after he was publicly introduced in that role.
Belichick claimed when he quit that he was concerned about
Parcells' future with the team and the Jets' unstable ownership
situation, which was resolved several days later when Johnson
bought the team from the estate of Leon Hess.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he took Belichick's reasons for quitting at face
value and said the two have never discussed the resignation.
Parcells said he did not feel there were any hatchets to bury with
Belichick and that he was happy that Belichick would not be out of
coaching for a year. He added: ``The Patriots got a good man. He'll
be a formidable adversary.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, Belichick used measured
language to describe his relationship with Parcells. ``Bill and I
have had a good professional relationship throughout my entire
career, and I feel that's still in place,'' Belichick said. ``We
won a lot of games together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My diplomacy is directly proportional to the scoreboard,''
Parcells said. ``I don't think anybody won. I think we made a
business deal.''

   John P.Lopez
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WE are not here to disparage the motives of Delton Carter or
question the opportunities he should receive, given the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone deserves a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   D.C., as the Westside Tennis Club security and maintenance man
is known, has a checkered past, but that should not preclude him
from trying to establish a productive future.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the way it should be done. These are not the
right circumstances for Carter to forge his trail, much less
troubled 19-year-old NBA phenom Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, this is no way for the NBA and its players
association to send a message that it cares anything about its
young players except for what they produce on the court.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several weeks, Carter, who has been convicted of
forgery, theft and solicitation of prostitution in various
incidents from 1990-1997, has aligned himself as a mentor of sorts
for the 6-11, 235-pound Smith.
</P>
<P>
   D.C.'s motives seem sincere, and he has earned the confidence of
several Rockets players and his employer, Jim McIngvale, but he has
no proper training in counseling from the NBA or its players
association.
</P>
<P>
   He is not employed by any club or league organization and knows
little about the demanding and often seductive off-court world of
NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Some might hear of Carter's criminal record and believe he is
just another hanger-on hoping to wedge his way into the elite NBA
fraternity. That might be true.
</P>
<P>
   But what is true is scary: Carter's only apparent qualifications
for taking Smith under his wing were his willingness to help and an
endorsement from union director of player programs Purvis Short.
</P>
<P>
   That's no way to counsel any young NBA player, much less one
like Smith, the tormented Mavericks rookie. Since being drafted out
of Chicago's Martin Luther King High School last summer, Smith has
been suspended from the Mavs for defying the coach's orders, has
been charged with assault against his former girlfriend and has
attempted suicide with an overdose of some 250 aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is confused, emotionally vulnerable and struggling to find
his way. He has problems that can be overcome. But Carter is the
best the NBA and the Mavs could come up with?
</P>
<P>
   That Carter has become so involved and was directed to Smith by
Short is only symptomatic of something bigger and more dangerous
for the league.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing pool of talent in the NBA consists of those
players who can score and jump but cannot walk into most sports
bars. Including Smith, there are 14 players in the league under 21.
Dozens of others are 21 and 22, like the Rockets' Steve Francis and
Kenny Thomas, and also have been thrown into the gluttonous world
of the NBA at a tender age.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, NBA players come into contact with those who hover
around teams, trying to squeeze themselves into players' personal
lives. Every day, there are influences and temptations, whether
it's someone hanging outside the practice facility offering to be a
new best friend, someone offering something illegal or improper or
someone curvy, but whose motives are unknown, waiting outside the
locker room asking for a date.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous coaches, veteran teammates and executives regularly
offer advice to NBA youngsters, and the NBA offers guidance through
its player programs department. But the league has no organized
network of trained counselors or former NBA players who can devote
themselves to directing young players down the smart path.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Leon Smith-Delton Carter saga should slap the
league in the face like a splash of cold water. It needs to wake up
and acknowledge that kids, even drop-stepping, slam-dunking kids,
need guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate that the vast majority have not had a
series of problems,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
``There have been and there will be a lot more (teen-age players).
We're looking seriously at creating our own minor league to deal
with some of those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Carter are not the biggest problem the league
faces. Neither is Smith. At least Carter seemingly had Smith's best
interests in mind when he became involved and Smith was looking for
someone who cared.
</P>
<P>
   But the league and players association should not have to turn
to the Delton Carters of the world _ those who are untrained and
unwise to the ways of the NBA. Too many people would exploit such
an opportunity, and in the end the tragedy would be a wasted career
and, perhaps, a life.
</P>
<P>
   Every NBA franchise has at its disposal retired players who have
been through the wars, earned more money than they ever imagined,
made the long six-night trips and learned how to handle the
lifestyle. The league should tap into this pool of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said to me, What conclusion do you draw from Leon
Smith?'' Granik said. ``To me that's a unique case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, caring ex-players such as Calvin Murphy and Mike Newlin
here, or James Silas and Mike Gale in San Antonio, or Jamaal Wilkes
and Michael Cooper in Los Angeles, could be trained as
club-appointed advisers for the growing number of young players.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has long been at the forefront of perpetuating a good
image. Now is a good time to face something potentially bad. Smith
has problems, but so do other young ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time for the NBA to address its youth movement and
come up with a network of mentors _ and we're not talking
maintenance men and security guards.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one eye on his own legacy and another on the
political aspirations of his vice president, President Clinton
claimed credit Wednesday night for leading the nation onto the
broad uplands of unparalleled prosperity and laid out an
election-year manifesto for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he spoke of successfully crossing his bridge to the
21th century. Inevitably, he spoke at great length. Inevitably, he
put some Democratic spots on Republican ideas. Inevitably, too, he
set sweeping goals _ no child raised in poverty, affordable health
care for everyone, a cleaner and safer planet _ without much of a
road map toward realizing them.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's last State of the Union address _ his final
crack at an annual political ritual that he loves, in part because
he is so good at it. Barring some national political crisis, he
will have only two more occasions before he leaves office next year
to address the nation at length, rather than in the snippets that
appear on television and in news articles: at this summer's
Democratic National Convention and in a farewell address later.
</P>
<P>
   He summed up his message in a single paragraph, just 60 words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,'' the
president declared in an advance text that was released by the
White House. ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so
much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis
or so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed
opportunity _ and therefore, such a profound obligation _ to build
the more perfect union of our founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton listed his economic achievements, as unabashedly as
a salesman hawking his wares: rapid growth, low inflation, low
unemployment, decreased poverty, ``the first back-to-back budget
surpluses in 42 years'' and ``the longest period of economic growth
in our entire history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with all the expansiveness of a man who had hit
the lottery or answered Regis Philbin's million-dollar question.
With dollars cascading into the Treasury in a profusion that was
unimaginable when his second term began, Clinton proposed tax cuts
and federal initiatives in more than a dozen fields.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded more like the Bill Clinton who told Congress on Feb.
17, 1993, ``Tonight I want to talk to you about what government can
do, because I believe government can do more,'' than the Bill
Clinton who declared not once but three times in his State of the
Union speech on Jan. 23, 1996, that ``the era of big government is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   But as always, he re-staked his claim to the middle ground, the
political terrain where he built his political victories as he led
his party back to power after 12 years of Republican control of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We restored the vital center,'' he said pointedly in a summary
of his seven-going-on-eight years in the Oval Office, ``replacing
outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring
values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all and a
community of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who knows a parade when he sees one approaching, leapt
to the head of another one Wednesday night. He signed on to a
Republican proposal, one of several, to ease the so-called marriage
penalty in the tax code, just as he had embraced other pet
Republican programs _ national missile defense, a scaled-down
version of the old ``Star Wars'' program; the balanced budget;
reform of the Internal Revenue Service; and opposition to same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But like many of his other initiatives, his marriage-penalty
proposal had a sharp political twist, because it was aimed squarely
at the poor and lower-income families. It would apply only to
taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, a provision that
would exclude most mortgage-payers. Other remedies for the problem
would have covered more people and cost more.
</P>
<P>
   This was not only Clinton's last State of the Union address but
the first of the new millennium, as he took pains to note. Yet it
was more matter-of-fact than some of his past efforts, with fewer
rhetorical furbelows. Perhaps scholars are correct when they
suggest that this president does best when he is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the confrontation with Congress in 1996, facing
what looked like a potentially difficult re-election campaign, he
put himself in a commanding position for November by declaring a
consensus on a number of issues that the Republicans on Capitol
Hill had expected to struggle over. In 1998 and 1999, reeling from
the Monica Lewinsky case, he not only delivered fluent speeches,
which many had thought beyond his powers in such a fraught
situation, but reframed the budget debate by telling the Republican
tax-cutters: Save Social Security First.
</P>
<P>
   A different view is taken by Michael A. Waldman, a former
director of speechwriting for the White House, who was involved, to
a greater or lesser degree, in drafting Clinton's first seven State
of the Union messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that after the 1994 election you see an effort
to reconstruct the presidency and its role through these
speeches,'' Waldman said. ``Not the heroic presidency any more that
passes grand programs, but a presidency refocused on what a lot of
pundits deride as small issues, but which are in part an effort to
bit by bit restore people's confidence that government can do
things.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus on the possible and the manageable, of course, seems
to some a lack of vision, particularly when it comes to foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's speech was devoid of new initiatives in that
area. A series of excerpted highlights produced by the White House
press office mentioned drugs and education and gun control, but
included not a word about foreign affairs. The speech itself urged
a new effort to close the gap between the world's have and the
have-nots, but proposed no new funds for aid to poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized the need to work to strengthn democracy in
Russia rather than vigorously condemning Russian policy in
Chechnya, and he devoted little time to assuaging Russian fears,
shared by Western Europe, that the United States has turned its
back on efforts to control nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the president hopes that his role in bringing a
tenuous peace to Northern Ireland and nudging Israel and Syria
towards a peace agreement will be seen as his foreign-policy
legacy. He hoped to add luster to that in his speech Wednesday
night, while aiding the campaign of Al Gore, who stood beside him.
A Gore victory would of course redound to Clinton's credit.
</P>
<P>
   But historians increasingly see him as ``a politically talented
underachiever'' who dealt mainly in ``incremental policy
departures.''
</P>
<P>
   Those phrases come from a new book by Fred Greenstein, a
professor at Princeton University, to be published in May by The
Free Press. Titled ``The Presidential Difference: Leadership Style
from FDR to Clinton,'' it sums up the president as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tribute to Clinton's resiliency and political prowess
that he has succeeded in serving two presidential terms. It is a
commentary on his weaknesses that this talented political leader
has not had more to show for his time in office.''

JUSTICES MISS PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sending regrets, the Supreme Court broke with
longstanding tradition and missed President Clinton's final State
of the Union address Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The court, whose attendance at the yearly event is ceremonial,
sent its unexpected regrets early Thursday in a brief note to House
Sergeant at Arms Wilson Livingood, who oversees the guest list for
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justices of the Court had planned to attend the State of the
Union address, but travel changes and minor illnesses have
intervened,'' the court's message read. ``No justices will be in
attendance, but they do thank you for the invitation to be present
for the address.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices on the nation's highest court have been an annual
fixture in the House chamber during the presidential speech. Not
since 1986 has the court been unrepresented. That year, President
Reagan's address was rescheduled following the Challenger shuttle
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, appointed for life and in keeping with the court's
independence from the elected branches of government, sit stoically
through the address, even as members of the Cabinet and Congress
interrupt the president's speech with raucous applause.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The court's public information office disclosed the whereabouts
of four of the justices, leaving the activities of the other five a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's two Supreme Court appointees, Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, were feeling under the weather.
Ginsburg, who had colon-cancer surgery in September, was coping
with the side-effects of radiation therapy, and Breyer had a touch
of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas remained near his boyhood home inSavannah, Ga., following the death Sunday of his younger brother,
Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was traveling to New York for a
speech he was scheduled to deliver at St. John's University.
</P>
<P>
   The public information office declined to comment on Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra
Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter.

 &HT;    'Psycho' one of the few sure things at Sundance
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Sandra Bullock and her beau's band, the Scabs,
were supposed to be there. So were Matthew McConaughey, fellow
University of Texas alum Renee Zellweger and Austin-born Ethan
Hawke. That's what the publicists told us and that was the canard
panted on the snow-sloshy streets at the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. In sincerest consideration for our necks (all
that whiplash craning) and eyeballs (pingponging just can't be good
for them), none of the above paragons of superior dental hygiene
showed at the overflow bash. Rocking Austin band the Agency and
folkie Shawn Colvin did play, but, you know, they're musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-ticket wingding _ thrown not as part of Sundance but of
its bratty stepchild Slamdance _ was the premiere party for the
Austin-filmed comedy ``What I Like About You,'' whose cast and
crew, including director Jeff Stolhand, hail from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   They all showed, as did actors Rachel Ward and, briefly, a
full-bearded Jason Priestley. Scott Von Doviak, ``What I Like's''
co-screenwriter and co-star, said that the film's single screening
at Slamdance had been sold out since Saturday and that two foreign
distributors were already biting. Co-star Dee-Dee Stirneman happily
informed me she was able to get fliers for the film into the hands
of Kevin Smith, Roger Ebert and James Woods, who were common sights
down the road at Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about connections,'' says Von Doviak. ``It would be
amazing if the film is picked up. This is just one step. Maybe not
the big leap, but something.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the average moviegoer may never see or hear of ``What I
Like About You,'' whose budget was in the low six figures, both
Sundance and Slamdance have been quaking with acquisition deals, or
near-deals. Much palm sweat has been swapped, promises made and
nerves frayed in the smarmy sport of let's make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   I spent almost all of my five days in Park City at Sundance,
where the clarion buzz for a sackful of new movies is flying. Most
of those films are being plucked by hungry distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, the vice president of Artisan Entertainment
excitedly told me that his company had picked up the seriously
strange comedy ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' for around $1.5 million. Variety
reported that rave drama ``Groove'' was purchased by Sony Pictures
Classics and that the features ``Girlfight'' (which some have bets
on to win top festival awards), ``Two Family House,'' ``Panic'' and
``Love and Sex'' are on the verge of deals.
</P>
<P>
   Other major titles, such as Kevin Spacey's ``The Big Kahuna,''
the Nick Nolte vehicle ``Trixie'' and the female ensemble dramedy
``Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her,'' with Glenn Close
and Cameron Diaz, arrived as studio-project premieres headed for
theaters. Arriving this weekend on a wave of expectation is
SofiaCoppola's ``The Virgin Suicides.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are highlights of the films I saw that will likely make it
to theaters in the coming months:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``American Psycho'' _ The big-buzz flick at Sundance drew
turnaway crowds at its premiere last Friday night at the 1,400-seat
Eccles Theater. Some of those told to walk had waited four hours in
line. (I was turned away and had to see it at a stuffy Saturday
morning press screening.) Coming to theaters in April, ``Psycho''
is a bracing pitch-black parody of Trumpian Manhattan in the 1980s.
Evidently, it's significantly different from Bret Easton Ellis'
notoriously gruesome novel, but director Mary Harron (``I Shot Andy
Warhol'') retains a thrilling pungency that's not overly explicit.
(Sex content earned it an NC-17 rating, which to me could be
mellowed to an R with nanosecond deletions.) A spectacular
Christian Bale plays the title character to unctuous perfection.
The hilarious, harrowing script is air-tight and beautifully
written. Harron's sleek direction thrums with menacing elegance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' _ This aggressively offbeat tragicomedy by
Miguel Arteta (``Star Maps'') disarms and dislocates with its
bizarrely deadpan tone and low-budget complexion (it was shot
entirely on digital video). It's about a semi-psychotic gay man,
Buck (played by the film's writer Mike White), who stalks his best
childhood pal, Chuck. Too long by 15 minutes, ``Chuck'' is sad and
amusing, creepy and affirmative. It's very good and festival
audiences loved it, but it's so idiosyncratic marketing it will be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Nowhere to Hide'' _ Lee Myung-Se's Korean action-art film
was screened in the World Cinema program and unjustly remained a
work of unsung genius during its run. A challenge to describe, this
blazing crime story is a frenetic, funny, violent, rock 'n' roll
homage to John Woo's action spectaculars, riddled with visual
allusions to other movies (from ``Ikiru'' to ``The Third Man'') and
filmed with as much formal dazzle as ``Run Lola Run.'' No other
film I saw was half as fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rated X'' _ Emilio Estevez directs and stars in this lemon.
Estevez and brother Charlie Sheen portray the real-life Mitchell
Brothers, who produced some of the most successful porn in the '70s
and '80s. It's a who-cares biopic that's so poorly crafted it can't
be taken seriously. Like ``Psycho,'' it was a hot ticket with
turnaway crowds. Seen in the audience at the Tuesday night
premiere: Roger Ebert, Anne Heche, Ellen DeGeneres, Edward James
Olmos, Estevez and Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' _ RuPaul narrates this heavily
buzzed bio of Tammy Faye, chronic weeper and former
wife/co-conspirator of crooked TV evangelist Jim Bakker. The cheeky
movie draws a dubiously sympathetic portrait of its subject, who
proudly claims she buys all of her signature makeup at swap meets.
Playful, funny and featherweight, the Ewok look-alike comes across
as both sweet and woefully vacuous. The eyes have it: ``Without my
eyelashes I wouldn't be Tammy Faye,'' our heroine chirps.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Filth and the Fury'' _ Danny DeVito, who co-produced
this jittery Sex Pistols documentary, introduced it at its Tuesday
premiere in apt Pistols fashion, pronouncing it ``a great
(expletive) film!'' Julien Temple (``Absolute Beginners'') directed
the Pistols-sanctioned chronology of the life and crimes of the
legendary punk band. Swirling with distracting random images, it
flitters between archival concert footage, savage band in-fighting
and irrelevant stock film. For all its ``punk'' quick-cutting
chaos, ``Filth'' is conventional history, at once engrossing and
unsatisfying. Pistols John Lydon (formerly Johnny Rotten) and Steve
Jones, looking thick and ragged, gave a spicy postscreening Q and
A.

ON WELFARE AND NOT CLAIRVOYANT? NEW YORK WILL PROVIDE TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late at night, when testimonials to ``incredible
psychics'' flash across the television screen, the $4.99-a-minute
soothsayer standing by the phone to ``actually solve your
problems'' could be a welfare recipient recruited, screened and
coached for the job by New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The city's welfare department has been recruiting welfare
recipients to work from home as telephone psychics since April.
Fifteen people have been hired so far by a company called Psychic
Network, said Ruth Reinecke, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clairvoyance is not among the qualifications listed on the
city's recruitment flier. Any public assistance recipient with a
high school equivalency degree, ``a caring and compassionate
personality'' and the ability ``to read, write and speak English''
can qualify for Psychic Network's ``minimum starting salary of $10
per hour, plus bonuses,'' the flier says.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested are asked to call Business Link, a division of
the city's Human Resources Administration that finds and trains
workers from the welfare rolls, and to sign up for a group
screening session.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I'm not a psychic?'' a caller to Business Link asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll train you,'' the city employee who answered the
telephone replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reinecke said that applicants were trained to read tarot
cards by a representative from Psychic Network at the city's
Business Link office on West 34th Street. She refused to provide
any other information about Psychic Network, citing a promise of
confidentiality to participating companies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's welfare-to-work effort, the
city set up Business Link in 1995 to connect businesses that needed
workers and welfare recipients who needed jobs.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 recipients have been placed and about 160 businesses
now participate, city officials said, many qualifying for wage
subsidies and federal and state tax credits of up to $10,000 for
each worker.
</P>
<P>
   The city does not investigate the businesses that participate to
determine if they are in trouble with the Better Business Bureau,
the Labor Department, the bankruptcy courts or the Internal Revenue
Service, Ms. Reinecke said. Instead, she said, the program leaves
welfare recipients as free to choose an employer as any other job
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the only Psychic Network listed in the current
Manhattan telephone book were unsuccessful. The local number was
disconnected in July, and the only street address given was one in
West Palm Beach, Fla., where a variety of records show it to be the
residence of a man, William B. Tide, who uses several names and has
an unlisted telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   But Janice Scott King, owner of a metaphysical bookstore called
the Psychic Network in Pompano Beach, Fla., said that she had been
bombarded with complaints meant for the other Psychic Network since
Tide failed in several attempts to acquire her trademarked name and
toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Thursday whether the company that is hiring
welfare recipients in New York City has any connection to Tide's
operation. Ms. Reinecke would not identify the woman who contacted
Business Link offering jobs with Psychic Network, and she said the
woman turned down a request to speak to a reporter. There was also
no evidence that the company that is working with the city has had
any complaints filed against it.
</P>
<P>
   In federal, state and local agencies where investigators have
struggled to curb abuses in the boom-and-bust psychic hot line
industry, tracking a phone line to its source is a familiar
problem. There are many parties involved in the typical
pay-per-call transaction, like long-distance companies, direct
marketers and bill collectors.
</P>
<P>
   And in a field dominated by those who control the best
late-night television slots, database marketing lists and expensive
telecommunications equipment, market leaders with a changing array
of names and affiliations have been accused of defrauding
customers, creditors, employees and stockholders around the
country, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators typically reacted with disbelief to New York
City's welfare-to-work psychic venture, but an enforcement official
with the Federal Communications Commission, where 40 percent of all
complaints concern psychic pay-per-call operations, laughed
uncontrollably, then begged for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described ``genuine psychics'' were not amused. ``That is
totally a scam,'' said the manager at Abracadabra Productions Ltd.,
a small New York City company that lists tarot, astrology,
palmistry, Turkish coffee and tea leaves on its Web site. ``Genuine
psychics study for years,'' she said, refusing to give her full
name. ``The city should not be doing this. It's shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the city, Ms. Reinecke defended the recruiting
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who performed in the job, the pay is rather good and
it's attractive to be able to work out of the home for the mothers
who have young children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of the telepsychic realm tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises of $10 or $12 an hour, actual pay at these
networks is often far less, because it is based on a per-minute
rate paid only for time spent on the telephone with callers, said
Judy Ann Cannizzaro, who has worked as a telephone psychic, taking
calls from the Psychic Readers Network, the Fort Lauderdale. Fla.,
company that has dominated the field since the 1997 bankruptcy of
Inphomation and its Psychic Friends Network, endorsed by Dionne
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   An extra 25 cents is paid for every name and address that can be
extracted from a caller, information that can be resold to direct
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Calls are automatically routed first to those workers who keep
callers on the line the longest, with scripted ploys like
pretending to see _ very slowly _ winning Lotto numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a clairvoyant all my life,'' Ms. Cannizzaro said.
``If I could get the lottery numbers, would I be working as a
telephone psychic?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the calls generated by late-night commercials are from
poor people, she added, and though the ads carry a required
disclaimer that the psychic reading is for entertainment only, many
callers are desperate for otherworldly solutions to their real
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to keep a person who doesn't have money for
bread on the phone at $5 a minute,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry's hub is in Fort Lauderdale, Robert J.
Buchner, an assistant attorney general in Florida, said he receives
hundreds of complaints from around the country. Most consumer
complaints, he and other lawyers said, concern the practices called
``cramming and slamming'' _ the padding of a customer's telephone
bill with charges they never knowingly incurred, and the switching
of their long-distance service to another carrier without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   In one notorious example from 1998, Access Resource Services, a
psychic hotline collection company run for a company in Pearl
River, N.Y., out of Fort Lauderdale, tried to collect $329.34 from
a West Hartford, Conn., man who had been dead for 20 years. In
other cases, long-distance carriers have contracted with psychic
networks to offer ``free psychic readings'' as an incentive to
switch carriers. Thousands of customers complained that they had
been switched without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Cohn, a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission, said the
FTC was on the verge of promulgating a new rule to make it harder
for unscrupulous operators to avoid accountability. Under the rule,
no company could try to collect a telephone charge unless it could
show the consumer proof of its validity, like a signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of the industry said that many of the major players
have been able to cash in and move on despite earlier regulations
aimed at cleaning up the business, while the workers at the bottom
answering the phones were left with dwindling revenues and bounced
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare is probably going to be dealing with welfare,'' Ms.
Cannizzaro said of New York City's psychic recruits, remembering
predawn calls from a woman in the Bronx who had suffered a
miscarriage, and from a drug-addicted mother who said she was going
to commit suicide. ``You're talking people with problems that not
even a soap opera can list, and you're giving them to people who
are only interested in $12 an hour.''

WAVERING GORE STANDING WITH CLINTON _ FOR NOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ In a New Hampshire debate last fall, Al Gore
couldn't wait to express his ``disappointment and anger'' at
President Clinton's sexual escapades. But in Gore's final face-off
with Bill Bradley before the state's presidential primary, the vice
president was eager this week to tout his ties to Clinton and the
economic good times during the seven years of the Democratic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, there was Gore, getting ``heavy face time'' on
national television, sitting behind Clinton on the dais in the U.S.
House chamber in Washington as the president delivered his last
State of the Union message. The link between the men seemed as
politically inextricable as it was physically obvious.
</P>
<P>
   For now, as Gore courts Democrats on the nomination trail, his
role in the Clinton administration has become a highlighted item on
his political resume. But could that change again, if Gore becomes
the Democratic nominee and the connection to Clinton becomes more
problematic in the general-election campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wavering view of what Clinton means to his own White
House aspirations is one of the most interesting and closely
watched features of the national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a tough one'' for Gore, said George C. Edwards
III, director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M
University. ``It's inevitably awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by so strongly associating himself with Clinton in the
debate Wednesday, was clearly playing to Democrats, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Polling suggests the association is welcome at this point in the
campaign. A survey of Democratic caucus attendees in Iowa on Monday
found that 84 percent approved of Clinton's job performance, even
though less than half approve of him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a short-term gain,'' Edwards said of the inter-party
pitch. ``That can come back to haunt you.... You give the
Republicans a sound bite'' for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, including presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, the governor of Texas, can't wait to try to put Gore in a box
on his service with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can figure out how to handle his relationship
with the president,'' Bush said Thursday. ``He distances himself,
he doesn't distance. He distances himself, he doesn't distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to send confusing signals to the
voters.'' Bush said. ``I look forward, if I'm the (Republican)
nominee, to debating the vice president and talking about
distancing and not distancing.''
</P>
<P>
   If pressed as the campaign progresses, Gore is expected to seek
to link himself to administration policies rather than to Clinton
personally, as he did in the debate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of the whole discussion about the president's
personal mistake,'' Gore said in the debate. ``They think that, by
and large, he has been a great president in turning this economy
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's contention was borne out by an independent voter who
heard the vice president speak Thursday at Silknet, a new software
company in an old textile mill along the Merrimack River in
Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hall, a Silknet product manager, said Clinton's scandals
did not affect his view of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't play into my thinking,'' said Hall, 35. ``But his
connection with the last seven years and the economic prosperity,
that is good. I've gone from five years ago earning $10 an hour to
today living in a very prosperous neighborhood. You don't want to
remove a variable for success ... I don't want to change the
policies and take chances with the prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to pick up on such sentiments, at least in New
Hampshire, Gore has warmed to discussing his ties to Clinton's
policies. But it has not always been thus.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Gore signaled that he was ready to go it alone,
telling The Washington Post in October that the campaign was a
``very personal quest.'' The translation offered by most analysts
was that the vice president acknowledged Clinton was a negative.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, in the debate at Dartmouth College, after
expressing his ``disappointment and anger'' at Clinton's
indiscretions, Gore said the president was, of course, his friend.
But he painted his service during the Monica Lewinsky scandal as
being more a fulfillment of his constitutional duty than his
standing up for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took an oath under the Constitution to serve my country
through thick and thin, and I interpreted that oath to mean that I
ought to try to provide as much continuity and civility during (the
Lewinsky scandal) as I possibly could,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also in his constitutional capacity as presiding officer
of the Senate that Gore was on the House podium Thursday night,
sharing in whatever reflected glory Clinton could generate. State
of the Union addresses almost always bring a spike in a president's
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are thinking more long term and already pondering
how to present the Clinton-Gore link in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore represents essentially a third Clinton term,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``So the question is: Does the
country want a third Clinton term? I think the answer ultimately
will be no.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandals aside, Gore seems to have another view of that
question.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that in an Iowa debate Bradley had asked voters if
they were better off than when the Clinton administration took
office, Gore said Wednesday in New Hampshire: ``I think the answer
to that question is yes, but I don't think that's the question. I
think a far more important question in this campaign is, can we do
even better?''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for Bradley, Gore's only Democratic challenger,
express a lack of interest in Gore's Hamlet-like musings on his
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't care about things you can't do anything about,''
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser, but he quickly added that
``it's been pretty clear that (Clinton) has been very actively
supportive'' of Gore's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our minds it's one of the institutional advantages the vice
president has,'' Hauser said. He cited suspiciously
``coincidental'' White House initiatives on health care and
agriculture that filled in some gaps in administration record on
which Gore was getting flak and the president's renomination of
Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve six months before
the decision had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are 'good news from the White House,''' Hauser said.

THE SCENE: SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ALL ABSENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With CLINTON-SPEECH; may be updated after State of Union.) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton
had to be there, and were. The justices of the Supreme did not, and
weren't.
</P>
<P>
   In what may charitably be seen as a remarkable series of
coincidences and scheduling flukes, not one member of the Supreme
Court attended President Clinton's final State of the Union address
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The court sent the justices' regrets in a two-sentence message
to the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justices of the Court had planned to attend the State of the
Union Address, but travel changes and minor illnesses have
intervened,'' the letter stated. ``No Justices will be in
attendance, but they do thank you for the invitation to be present
for the address.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Clinton appointees to the court, Justices Stephen G.
Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, cited health reasons for skipping
the speech. Ginsburg has been undergoing radiation treatment after
colon cancer surgery. Breyer sent Clinton a note saying he wanted
to attend, but was homebound with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens is taking care of his wife, who
recently had hip replacement surgery. Justice Clarence Thomas is in
New Orleans, where his brother died Sunday. Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy has to be in New York to deliver a speech on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation from the court for the absences of
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist or Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   No one takes attendance at the State of the Union, but news
accounts indicate that at least five or six members of the court
have attended each of Clinton's previous addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the entire court missed the speech was in 1986,
when President Reagan hastily rescheduled his State of the Union
after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The court prides itself on its work ethic. In January 1996, when
a storm dumped 2 feet of snow on Washington, the court was the only
government institution in the region to remain open. Rehnquist
dispatched four-wheel-drive police vehicles to fetch members of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no comment on the court's truancy, but
others did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just astonished,'' said Theodore B. Olson, a Washington
attorney and former Justice Department official in the Reagan
administration. ``On the other hand, these things have become so
ritualistic and boring that it would be easy to find more
entertaining alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Olson added, ``enough of them saw what the chief
justice went through during the impeachment trial that they decided
they didn't want to go near the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no more campaigns ahead of him and the justices
serve for life, but Gore and Mrs. Clinton are in the middle of
heated battles for high office. Gore's aides were unhappy with the
image of the vice president standing behind the president and
serving as his chief cheerleader, but there was no way he could
decline to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The event, they winced, served as a visual reminder of the vice
president's subservient role in the Clinton administration as he
essays on the campaign trail to establish his own identity as a
potential president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, aides said, was not expecting a political lift
from the event and was approaching the speech as she has all
previous such addresses, as a chance to make her husband look good.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was careful not to overdo the president's
tributes to his wife and his sidekick. A top adviser said that
speechwriters counted the mentions of Gore in previous State of the
Union addresses (usually from two to four) and tried not to be too
obvious about patting him on the back this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited Gore's contributions five times _ on computer
literacy, expanded health care for poor families, support for gun
control legislation, environmental activism and proposals to
improve the ``livability'' of American cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton got virtually the same salute she gets every year,
for her work on family issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Clinton said a little before the halfway point of
his 9,400-word oration, ``I am especially grateful to the person
who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked
tirelessly for children and families for thirty years now: my wife,
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., said that Thursday night's speech
was unlikely to provide a boost for either Gore or Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this is Clinton being Clinton,'' said Biden, who
is officially neutral in the Democratic presidential race but who
is close to former Sen. Bill Bradley. ``I don't think he's sitting
there thinking of Gore or his wife. I think this is about him going
out big.''

 JUDGE THROWS McCAIN OFF PRIMARY BALLOT IN MUCH OF UPSTATE NEW(lh) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a decision that puts Sen. John McCain's
presidential campaign in New York in jeopardy, a state judge on
Thursday night threw McCain off the primary ballot in a wide swath
of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Joseph R. Cannizzaro of state Supreme Court in Albany,
ruled that the McCain campaign had failed to gather enough valid
signatures on nominating petitions in eight congressional
districts, and overturned a move by the state Board of Elections on
Wednesday to keep McCain on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   After the successful challenges by the state's Republican
establishment, which is backing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
McCain is now out of the March 7 primary in at least 13 of New
York's 31 congressional districts. Even if McCain wins the primary
on Tuesday in New Hampshire, where he is in a close race with Bush,
the expense of waging a campaign in a patchwork of districts could
force him to all but withdraw from New York's contest.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to appear on the ballot across the state, McCain's
only hope now is to win a federal lawsuit that he has filed to
overturn the state rules, which are so complex that candidates not
favored by the state party usually fail to comply. A federal judge
in Brooklyn is to hold a hearing on the case Friday, and the
wrangling over the ballot could continue well into next month.
</P>
<P>
   While Cannizzaro was handing a victory to the Bush forces, the
campaign of another candidate, Steve Forbes, was going on the
offensive, charging in a separate state lawsuit that Bush should be
kicked off the ballot in six congressional districts in New York
City because his campaign had engaged in widespread fraud in
assembling its nominating petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Muir, a lawyer for the Forbes campaign, said he had
identified Bush petitions with numerous signatures that appeared to
have been written by the same person. He said that on some
petitions, the signatures appeared last name first, as if they had
been copied directly off a list of registered voters. Jeffrey T.
Buley, chief counsel for the Republican State Committee, which is
spearheading the Bush campaign, said the petitions were valid.
</P>
<P>
   Cannizzaro's decision on the upstate districts was the latest in
a battle over the New York ballot that has flared on several fronts
_ from election boards to the state and federal courts to the
Legislature _ all the while rekindling a debate over whether the
rules are unfair to insurgents. In many states, widely recognized
candidates like McCain automatically gain a ballot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Cannizzaro ruled that McCain's campaign had failed to obtain
enough signatures in the districts, and he implicitly criticized
the state Board of Elections for validating the petitions. The two
Democrats on the board had blocked the challenges filed by the
Republican State Committee, in what appeared to be an effort to set
up a more fractious Republican primary, which could hurt Bush and
help the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the rules, which were approved by the state
Legislature at the behest of the state party, were reasonable, and
as a result, he said, it would be wrong to allow McCain on the
ballot after he failed to comply with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold otherwise,'' he wrote in his decision, ``would
unfairly and unreasonably treat the McCain delegates differently
than other possible candidates who obeyed the clear and unequivocal
letter of the law and complied with the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry T. Berger, a lawyer for the McCain campaign, attacked the
decision. ``It demonstrates the absurdity of the election law,''
Berger said, ``when a candidate such as John McCain, who is a
leading candidate in the race, can't get on the ballot in more than
a third of the election districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Buley, the state party's counsel, said the decision showed that
the Democrats on the state Board of Elections had abused their
authority. ``The petitions didn't meet the requirements in the
law,'' Buley said. ``The court did what the Board of Elections
should have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the New York primary is 31 separate contests, and
even if McCain is not on the ballot in some districts, he can win
delegates in the others. But as a practical matter, that is
difficult. It would not be worth buying television time to air
commercials in upstate counties because they would be shown in many
districts where McCain would not appear on the ballot. In the New
York City media market, McCain is off the ballot in four districts.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain mounted his petition effort with volunteers, Forbes
spent at least $750,000 to comply with the rules. The Republican
State Committee, which views Forbes as less of a threat to Bush,
had promised not to challenge the Forbes petitions, and the Forbes
campaign had expected to be on the ballot in all 31 districts.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on Long Island filed their own objections,
knocking Forbes off the ballot in three districts. In retaliation,
the Forbes campaign filed objections against Bush in the six city
districts.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal judge on Thursday rebuffed the Clinton
administration's latest effort to clear the way for 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez's prompt return to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, William M. Hoeveler, gave relatives who are holding
the boy here nearly a month, until Feb. 24, to prepare a response
to the Justice Department's argument that the relatives have no
legal right to act in the child's behalf. A Justice Department
lawyer had asked for a ruling by next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the Miami relatives' request, the department
included documents contending that the relatives offered the boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, many blandishments to let Elian stay
in Miami. Gonzalez told an investigator for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that in a telephone call, the relatives
``started offering me $2 million, a house and a car'' and that a
church had offered Elian $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was assured, he added, that ``I could go there with all
my family and would be taken care and could have a job if I wanted
to work, but with the money offered I would not need to do so. That
is when I hung up the telephone.'' He assumed that Miami's
Cuban-American community would be the source of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami relatives, who denied Gonzalez's contentions, were
elated by the ruling of Hoeveler of the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. ``We feel very good about the judge's
decision,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, who with his wife and daughter, are fighting for
custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his wisdom,'' Eig said, ``he ignored the request made by
the government. We want Elian to get a full and fair day in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler's ruling marked one more setback for the Justice
Department and the immigration service. Initially, the government
intended to repatriate the child on Jan. 14. Elian was rescued from
sea two months ago after his mother drowned fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As the court fight continued here, there were signs that
Republicans in Washington were backing off their support for making
the boy an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, ``politicians just have to step aside,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of Republican House members, Hastert would only
say ``there's a difference of opinion'' among party members about
how to proceed. Hastert has supported the legislation but declined
to predict its fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there was strong Democratic opposition to the
citizenship bill, and Republicans were divided. Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, waged a
strong battle to keep the measure off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a leading
congressional proponent of returning Elian to Cuba, claimed the
Capitol Hill efforts this week by Elian's grandmothers, who had
traveled from Cuba to argue for the boy's return to his father,
helped to build congressional opposition to the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers were lining up behind a less controversial bill
that would confer permanent residency on Elian rather than full
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of
the bill who once pledged to rush it to the Senate floor this week,
is now undecided about a timetable, his spokesman, John Czwartacki,
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In another turn, the Dominican nun who brought Elian together
with his grandmothers at her Miami Beach home on Wednesday said on
Thursday that she had changed her mind as a result of the meeting
and believed that the boy should not be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from her car before flying to Washington and
meetings on Friday with Attorney General Janet Reno and Florida's
senators, Connie Mack, a Republican, and Bob Graham, a Democrat,
the nun, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, said she was surprised by the
shift in her views. Sister Jeanne is the president of Barry
University in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to yesterday,'' Sister Jeanne said, ``I thought that the
law was simple and that a decision could be made straight away'' to
let the father have custody.
</P>
<P>
   But in the grandmothers' preparations for the meeting, their
fearful demeanor and Sister Jeanne's sense that the Castro
government was intruding behind the scenes, she said, ``I began to
experience something that worried me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with manipulation and a lack of freedom in the
presence of fear. I became concerned that this child could not
flourish in that kind of environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preparations for the hour-and-a-half meeting, at which
Elian's Miami relativeswere permitted to wait in separate rooms,
Sister Jeanne said the women or their negotiators wanted pictures
of her house, inside and outside, showing that in assigning
everyone to rooms, the two sides would not see one another. ``I
felt they were controlled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the grandmothers, too, the meeting was unsettling in another
way. After returning to Washington to lobby for custody of the boy,
they said they had barely recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed completely,'' said Mariela Quintana, mother of
Elian's mother, Elizabet Broton Gonzalez, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the fashion of teen-agers, Elian showed up at the meeting on
Wednesday wearing a gold chain. He has been taught to wear baseball
caps, backwards, and to use beepers and cell phones. He plays
Nintendo games and watches video movies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Churches, which has been coordinating
the grandmothers' six-day quest and has provided a plane for them,
said on Thursday that it was turning them over to the Cuban
Interests Section in Washington, which performs some of the
functions of an embassy.

COURT ALLOWS LAWSUIT BASED ON GOLFER INJURED BY WAYWARD `MULLIGAN'

<P>
   The next time you try sneaking an extra shot on the golf course,
better hope it sails fair and true. If your surreptitious do-over
goes astray and bonks a fellow golfer, the courts of the state of
New Jersey might brand you a reckless menace.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court has ruled that a golfer can be held
responsible for any injuries if others nearby do not get ample
warning. In other words, even bellowing ``Fore!'' after you hit
what is known as a mulligan _ an additional shot, usually from the
tee, that magically leaves no trace on the scorecard _ would not
automatically spare you from the courts if your ball goes seriously
amok.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an appellate court in New Jersey ruled that an
injured golfer could go ahead with a lawsuit against John Ferolito,
an iced tea magnate whose errant shot in a 1994 game hit the golfer
square between the eyes and broke his nose. Whether the shot was a
mulligan, of course, is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it is a bad day for duffers, but I do think
it is a bad decision for duffers,'' said James M. DeMarzo,
Ferolito's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you take to a playing field, whether it is a baseball
field or a football field or the golf links, you are subject to
certain risks inherent to the sport itself,'' he said. ``We don't
want to have the door open to litigation every time someone gets
hit on the head.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard M. Chisholm, the lawyer for Jeffrey Schick, the man
hit by the golf ball at the East Orange Golf Course, a public
course in Millburn, N.J., disagrees that the case could have such
far reach. He thinks only an inappropriate playing style might lead
to damage cases, not randomly crowning someone with a wayward shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anticipating that someone is going to hit a mulligan at
point-blank range is not a standard part of the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed with that reasoning, ruling that ``hitting an
unannounced and unexpected mulligan from the tee after all members
of the foursome have teed off creates such an unanticipated risk to
the other members of the foursome, from which they cannot protect
themselves, that it cannot be considered an inherent or integral
part of the game,'' wrote Judge Leonard Arnold for a three-judge
panel of the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers involved said that since sports injury cases are
generally decided under state law, it is impossible to assess what
impact the case might have on golfers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But to take at least one infamous golfer who has been know to
take his fair share (at least on a presidential scale) of
mulligans, there was no sense that the ruling would affect
President Clinton's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``His use of mulligans has been exaggerated in the press, but he
certainly reserves the right to use one from time to time,'' said
Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman. ``The president is pretty
vocal, so when he makes a bad shot he usually lets people know. I
don't think he would surprise everyone if he decided to take
another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Schick and his father, Wolfgang, of
Livingston, N.J., where the family runs a factory that makes
airplane parts, were playing on the public course. As is often the
case on crowded public courses, on the 10th hole they decided to
join Tom Gonella and Ferolito, a founder of the company that makes
Arizona iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat inexperienced foursome golfed together without
problems until the 16th tee.
</P>
<P>
   There, Schick and his father took their shots, and Gonella
followed. Those three then stood behind Ferolito while they claim
he sliced his ball into the woods to the right of the course. At
that point, the court papers say, the two Schick men moved their
golf cart about 10 to 16 feet in front of the tee, about 45 degrees
off to the left.
</P>
<P>
   They say that at that point Ferolito took a mulligan, but the
heel of the club hit the ball and it hooked left, hitting Schick
between the eyes. A plastic surgeon reconstructed his nose and some
facial bones. Chisholm said his client, now almost 30, faces over
$30,000 in medical bills and suffers from repeated nightmares about
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear at this point whether the defendants will get the
New Jersey Supreme Court to review the decision or whether the
lawsuit will proceed in a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers said there were plenty of legal precedents when it
comes to sports injuries, although not for golf since in its ideal
form it doesn't involve contact. The usual standard for lawsuits
has been that players involved assume a certain amount of risk,
unless the others in the game seem deliberately and recklessly
trying to wound them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly everyone feels bad whenever anyone gets hurt,''
DeMarzo said, before adding a quote from an unidentified sports
writer, ``But if you knew where the ball was going to go every time
you hit it, it wouldn't be much of a sport.''

FOR ROBERT KARAFT, A FAMILIAR FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As he mulled over the price the Patriots
would be willing to pay in order to pry Bill Belichick from the New
York Jets _ most important, a first-round pick in this year's NFL
draft _ owner Robert Kraft said he reached the decision to pull the
trigger on the deal at 10 Wednesday night only after he was
reminded of another tough business decision.
</P>
<P>
   It was the one he made six years ago to buy the Patriots from
James Busch Orthwein for about $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same kind of situation,'' Kraft said during
Belichick's introductory press conference at Foxboro Stadium. ``We
had no shot of getting the team and people were trying to move it
and they wouldn't let us in the process. Then they let us in right
at the end and we paid the highest price ever paid for any
franchise, anywhere in the world, at that time. A lot of people
told me that I was nuts, but in my heart, I knew I was doing the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was another motivating factor that compelled Kraft to
return Bill Parcells's phone call Thursday morning and agree to the
Jets' terms, thus setting into motion the chain of events that
culminated with an armistice between the heated AFC East rivals and
Belichick's arrival as the Patriots' new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the Robert Edwards situation,'' Kraft
admitted, ``and about the uncertainty that we all have with draft
picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft recalled how the Patriots thought they ``had the running
back position solved'' after the club drafted Edwards with their
first-round pick (18th overall) in the 1998 draft. A product from
the University of Georgia, Edwards showed great promise when he
rushed for 1,115 yards, marking the third-best rookie rushing
performance in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But any thoughts of gridiron grandeur proved premature when
Edwards suffered a severe knee injury in a freak accident while
participating in a flag football game on the beach during last
year's Pro Bowl activities in Honolulu. Edwards wound up sitting
out all of this season and his future is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, through an act of God, changed all that and
we're still dealing with that now,'' Kraft said. ``I said, here's a
chance to solve our problems with all the positions in the
organization. (Belichick's) someone who gives me peace of mind that
he knows what he's doing and he knows what it takes to win and
that's why we're all in this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, for a No. 1 draft choice, we can bring in a man who I
feel certain will do something rather than with the uncertainty of
the draft pick. So it wasn't even close when I thought about it
(Wednesday) night. That's when I told Bill (Parcells) that we could
do the deal, because we were ready to move in another direction and
make the offer to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft declined to say who was next in line for the Patriots, but
it had been widely speculated that Jaguars assistant Dom Capers was
the pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most rewarding things in life are very complex and you
have to go through difficult times to enjoy the good times,'' Kraft
said. ``A former head coach said to me that this is not a business
for sane people and I probably have a better understanding of that.
On the other hand, if you persevere and you have a vision of what's
right and you have a collection of good people around you and can
help you get there, then you have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our family is committed to winning. I think Bill Belichick
said it well. We have a good nucleus of players here, our family is
willing to commit the capital to do it, and we will continue to do
it because you have to do that if you want to win.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one eye on his own legacy and another on the
political aspirations of his vice president, President Clinton
claimed credit Thursday night for leading the nation onto the broad
uplands of unparalleled prosperity and laid out an election-year
manifesto for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he spoke of successfully crossing his bridge to the
21th century. Inevitably, he spoke at great length. Inevitably, he
put some Democratic spots on Republican ideas. Inevitably, too, he
set sweeping goals _ no child raised in poverty, affordable health
care for everyone, a cleaner and safer planet _ without much of a
road map toward realizing them.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's last State of the Union address _ his final
crack at an annual political ritual that he loves, in part because
he is so good at it. Barring some national political crisis, he
will have only two more occasions before he leaves office next year
to address the nation at length, rather than in the snippets that
appear on television and in news articles: at this summer's
Democratic National Convention and in a farewell address later.
</P>
<P>
   He summed up his message in a single paragraph, just 60 words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,'' the
president declared in an advance text that was released by the
White House. ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so
much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis
or so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed
opportunity _ and therefore, such a profound obligation _ to build
the more perfect union of our founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton listed his economic achievements, as unabashedly as
a salesman hawking his wares: rapid growth, low inflation, low
unemployment, decreased poverty, ``the first back-to-back budget
surpluses in 42 years'' and ``the longest period of economic growth
in our entire history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with all the expansiveness of a man who had hit
the lottery or answered Regis Philbin's million-dollar question.
With dollars cascading into the Treasury in a profusion that was
unimaginable when his second term began, Clinton proposed tax cuts
and federal initiatives in more than a dozen fields.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded more like the Bill Clinton who told Congress on Feb.
17, 1993, ``Tonight I want to talk to you about what government can
do, because I believe government can do more,'' than the Bill
Clinton who declared not once but three times in his State of the
Union speech on Jan. 23, 1996, that ``the era of big government is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   But as always, he re-staked his claim to the middle ground, the
political terrain where he built his political victories as he led
his party back to power after 12 years of Republican control of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We restored the vital center,'' he said pointedly in a summary
of his seven-going-on-eight years in the Oval Office, ``replacing
outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring
values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all and a
community of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who knows a parade when he sees one approaching, leapt
to the head of another one Thursday night. He signed on to a
Republican proposal, one of several, to ease the so-called marriage
penalty in the tax code, just as he had embraced other pet
Republican programs _ national missile defense, a scaled-down
version of the old ``Star Wars'' program; the balanced budget;
reform of the Internal Revenue Service; and opposition to same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But like many of his other initiatives, his marriage-penalty
proposal had a sharp political twist, because it was aimed squarely
at the poor and lower-income families. It would apply only to
taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, a provision that
would exclude most mortgage-payers. Other remedies for the problem
would have covered more people and cost more.
</P>
<P>
   This was not only Clinton's last State of the Union address but
the first of the new millennium, as he took pains to note. Yet it
was more matter-of-fact than some of his past efforts, with fewer
rhetorical furbelows. Perhaps scholars are correct when they
suggest that this president does best when he is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the confrontation with Congress in 1996, facing
what looked like a potentially difficult re-election campaign, he
put himself in a commanding position for November by declaring a
consensus on a number of issues that the Republicans on Capitol
Hill had expected to struggle over. In 1998 and 1999, reeling from
the Monica Lewinsky case, he not only delivered fluent speeches,
which many had thought beyond his powers in such a fraught
situation, but reframed the budget debate by telling the Republican
tax-cutters: Save Social Security First.
</P>
<P>
   A different view is taken by Michael A. Waldman, a former
director of speechwriting for the White House, who was involved, to
a greater or lesser degree, in drafting Clinton's first seven State
of the Union messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that after the 1994 election you see an effort
to reconstruct the presidency and its role through these
speeches,'' Waldman said. ``Not the heroic presidency any more that
passes grand programs, but a presidency refocused on what a lot of
pundits deride as small issues, but which are in part an effort to
bit by bit restore people's confidence that government can do
things.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus on the possible and the manageable, of course, seems
to some a lack of vision, particularly when it comes to foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech was devoid of new initiatives in that
area. A series of excerpted highlights produced by the White House
press office mentioned drugs and education and gun control, but
included not a word about foreign affairs. The speech itself urged
a new effort to close the gap between the world's have and the
have-nots, but proposed no new funds for aid to poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized the need to work to strengthn democracy in
Russia rather than vigorously condemning Russian policy in
Chechnya, and he devoted little time to assuaging Russian fears,
shared by Western Europe, that the United States has turned its
back on efforts to control nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the president hopes that his role in bringing a
tenuous peace to Northern Ireland and nudging Israel and Syria
towards a peace agreement will be seen as his foreign-policy
legacy. He hoped to add luster to that in his speech Thursday
night, while aiding the campaign of Al Gore, who stood beside him.
A Gore victory would of course redound to Clinton's credit.
</P>
<P>
   But historians increasingly see him as ``a politically talented
underachiever'' who dealt mainly in ``incremental policy
departures.''
</P>
<P>
   Those phrases come from a new book by Fred Greenstein, a
professor at Princeton University, to be published in May by The
Free Press. Titled ``The Presidential Difference: Leadership Style
from FDR to Clinton,'' it sums up the president as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tribute to Clinton's resiliency and political prowess
that he has succeeded in serving two presidential terms. It is a
commentary on his weaknesses that this talented political leader
has not had more to show for his time in office.''

GILLETTE'S STRUGGLES BECOME CLEAR IN EARNINGS DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gillette not so proudly affirmed its place within the ranks of
struggling consumer products companies Thursday, reporting lower
sales and earnings for the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Gillette, which is best known for its razors but
makes everything from Duracell batteries to Right Guard deodorant,
said earnings dropped 22 percent, to $339 million in the final
three months of 1999 from $435 million a year earlier. Quarterly
sales slipped about 4 percent, to $3.03 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a per-share basis, Gillette earned 32 cents, in line with the
expectations of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the picture was nearly as grim. Gillette's sales
fell about 2 percent, to just under $10 billion, and profits dipped
12 percent, to $1.26 billion, or $1.15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette has been buffeted by the aftereffects of the economic
crisis in Asia and Latin America, which caused inventories of its
products to swell worldwide. Reducing those inventories lowered
sales and earnings throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, profits for the company's Braun electric razors
division fell sharply last year, and sales and profits from
toiletries like Right Guard remain weak. Even the Mach 3 razor,
rolled out with fanfare two years ago, has not been the panacea the
company hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call to discuss the earnings, a Gillette
spokesman said that the company believed its worst problems are
behind it and that it was comfortable with analysts' estimates that
its profits and sales would rebound in 2000. Analysts estimate that
Gillette will earn $1.28 a share in 2000, up 10 percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company will probably continue to face pressure from
investors to sell off its weakest divisions or even to consider a
merger with Procter &AMP; Gamble. Gillette officials have declined to
comment on a Wall Street Journal report of an overture made by P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had operating problems,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, a
senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus, which owned almost 4 million
Gillette shares as of September 1999. ``It was a
very-high-valuation blue-chip that has certainly come down, and I'm
not surprised that Procter took a look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette and P&AMP;G have ``the same distribution channels, the same
ability to innovate on a product,'' he continued. ``I think they
could probably help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette has said it may sell or restructure Braun and its
stationery products division. In the most recent quarter, Braun
sales fell 4 percent, and profits dropped 55 percent, while
stationery sales and profits fell 17 and 89 percent, respectively.
In the conference call, the company said it would decide what to do
about Braun and stationery products this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gillette's got a lot to prove,'' said Erik Gustafson, a senior
portfolio manager of Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham, which owned 1.8 million
Gillette shares in September, all of which it has sold. ``Unless
they can prove to their investors that they can show consistent
quality earnings, this stock is going nowhere.'' In trading
Thursday before earnings results were released, Gillette closed at
40, up 11/16.

   Two Tides Are Rising In Retirement Plans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employees have long been asking for more facts and more choices
when it comes to retirement plans. It seems that many employers
have heard them loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Research from Hewitt Associates, a management consultant in
Lincolnshire, Ill., indicates that companies are offering more
investment options and bolstering education efforts. The level of
employer matches in 401(k) plans has risen slightly since 1997,
Hewitt found, with 19 percent of employers providing
dollar-for-dollar matches. Still, the most common match is 50 cents
per dollar, the survey found, at 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 survey of 491 employers with a total of 3.3 million
participants and $295 billion in assets, Hewitt found that plans
offered 11 investment options, on average, up from 8 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. McCarthy, a 401(k) consultant at Hewitt, said
employers were adding options ``purely to remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   With greater choice, McCarthy added, comes a need for more
education. ``While some people love it, some are overwhelmed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six percent of the employers said they provided
investment education, up from 59 percent in 1997. And 62 percent
use the Internet for such purposes, up from 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet allows companies to fill a gap in investment
education, McCarthy said. Previously, the fund companies providing
the plans would advise employees on how to allocate funds by asset
class, he said; now, on the Web sites, the fund companies help with
the ultimate decision _ how much to put in each fund. ``It's a
simple choice,'' he said, ``but a lot of times it paralyzes
people.'' &QL;

PATRIOTS MAKE PEACE AND GET THEIR MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Peace at last for this region's own little version of
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him up and told him it was Darth Vader calling, and
Bob laughed,'' New York Jets head of football operations Bill
Parcells said of the first step toward ending his long-running feud
with Patriots owner Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hatchets have been buried,'' said Parcells. ``The border
war is over. In fact, when I called Bob that first night (Tuesday),
I told him I thought it was time to end the border war. He
agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   So after three years of icy relations, and three weeks of
wrangling over the services of Bill Belichick, Parcells and Kraft
came together to reach an agreement that allowed the Patriots to
name Belichick their head coach late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   New England gave up a first-round draft pick as part of the deal
that allowed Belichick out of his contract with the Jets. The teams
were forced to work out a similar compensation package after the
1996 season, when Parcells wanted out of New England and his
contract with Kraft on the heels of leading the Patriots to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As result of the Parcells defection, the Patriots-Jets rivalry
became a white-hot rivalry for both sets of fans, fueled largely by
the cold war between Kraft and Parcells. The issue dominated the
talk before the games, before the seasons, even.
</P>
<P>
   So now that it's over, where does all this leave Kraft and
Parcells?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about our relationship right now than I have,''
Parcells said. ``I know for my part there's a good feeling about
him, and I think it's the same way with Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Darth Vader?
</P>
<P>
   That's the nickname the assistant coaches on Pete Carroll's
staff gave Parcells because of the fear/contempt with which he was
held in Foxborough. They kiddingly referred to the Jets as the Evil
Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was amused when he learned of the Darth Vader label and
used it to open his first conversation with Kraft in nearly three
years.
</P>
<P>
   At Belichick's introductory press conference Thursday at Foxboro
Stadium, an elated Kraft spoke of how ``it did surprise me'' when
he received Parcells's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone came in and said `Bill Parcells is on the phone,'
I said, `You'd better give it to Helena (Movsesian, Kraft's
executive secretary),' because I've got a buddy who says he's
Donald Trump and uses different names,'' Kraft joked. ``But
(Parcells) said, `It's really me.' When the phone call came in, I
was very delighted to receive it. It was an excellent phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Kraft indicated, both men proceeded to
repair their frayed relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells decided to reach out to Kraft after Belichick's bid to
gain a temporary restraining order against the Jets, freeing him to
negotiate with other teams, was denied by a federal judge Tuesday.
``I didn't want to see him out of football, and knowing that Bob
liked him, I thought that Bob didn't want that either,'' Parcells
said. ``So I made the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the first 30 minutes mending fences, and then
we talked about Belichick. Bob said he still had interest but would
like to get something done fast, because if we couldn't, he had to
move on and get something done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few good laughs about some of the things that
happened. I told him that I'd wished things had turned out
differently when I left New England, and I think he felt the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed (compensation) ideas. I told him what I wanted,
and he didn't want to do that, so we both agreed to think about it.
The next day, Bob didn't call so I thought it was over, that we
couldn't make a deal. But Bob called back late that night
(Wednesday), and we made the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kraft, ``I was delighted that he called and made that
opening gesture for two reasons. One, is we were moving on and we'd
seen some excellent candidates and (Thursday) morning we were ready
to make an offer. Until (Parcells) called Tuesday night, I didn't
know that there was any chance that we could get Bill Belichick.
But the conversation, he opened it up in a way that was top drawer
and allowed us to have a talk for about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reviewed a lot of things, and I think each of us agreed
that if we had to do it over again, we both might've handled a few
things differently and perhaps the New England Patriots . . . well,
maybe they'd be playing down in Atlanta, I don't know. But it was
good to be able to mend the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots gave up their No. 1 pick in this year's draft (16th
overall), and a fourth- and seventh-round choice in 2001. New
England received the Jets' fifth-round pick in 2001, a
seventh-round pick in 2002 _ and Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation was reversed, I would have done the same
thing,'' Parcells said. ``Belichick is a good man. He'll do a good
job up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with Belichick twice on the phone (Thursday) morning.
I told him what was happening. I told him I didn't want to see him
out of football, and he said he appreciated that. We talked again
after the trade was passed by the league, and I wished him well and
told him to go up there and show what he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also said, ``I want to feel good about going back to
New England and be able to sit in that stadium and watch a game. I
loved my time in New England. I left a lot of my blood there. We
were getting very close to doing some special things when I left
there. I wish now it could've ended differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft publicly extended his gratitude to Parcells for taking the
Patriots to the Super Bowl in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our family was privileged to buy the team in 1994, he had
been here for a year and he brought respectability and stability to
this franchise,'' Kraft said. ``He gave us a chance to go out and
market it and do the things we wanted to do to help win, and I will
forever be grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The finalization of the Belichick deal took some time because of
its unusual features, a coach being exchanged for draft picks.
Kraft and Parcells first put together a letter of agreement to
release Belichick from his Jets contract that had to be approved by
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Then Andy Wasynczuk, representing New England, and Mike
Tannenbaum of the Jets, each team's salary cap expert, put in
writing the compensation agreement Kraft and Parcells had reached.
Parcells said he pressed for a No. 1 pick because he didn't have
room under the salary cap to sign veterans.
</P>
<P>
   When that was done, Belichick was on his way to Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Kraft spoke how ``an added bonus'' of Belichick's
hiring was the fact he and Parcells finally were able to establish
a line of communication. When asked if he intended to go so far as
to have Parcells as his guest in his owner's box, Kraft smiled and
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, ``but only if we aren't playing the Jets.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Candidates for the White House have to slog through the snows of
New Hampshire, shaking hands over and over again and submitting to
a job interview that goes on for more than a year. In the virtual
world of professional football, all it took for the Patriots to
hire a commander in chief was a few feints toward the judicial
system and a pragmatic conversation between those two old buddies
Bob Kraft and Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the acerbic Jersey coach and the owner of the Pats
settled on a price for the services of Bill Belichick, the master
of defensive game plans who for many years had been Parcells's
protege. The Pats will give the Jets New England's first-round
draft choice this April _ the 16th pick in the round _ and there
will be a trivial exchange of lower picks over three years.
</P>
<P>
   This method of acquiring a leader would be unthinkable in the
real world, but as every player and every fan knows, the NFL is not
a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about the melodramatic saga of Belichick's
escape from New York is not only that one of his jilted bosses with
the Jets suggested he was loco but that he is the popular choice
among Patriots players.
</P>
<P>
   They have had three years under Pete Carroll, a nice guy who was
unable to take them back to the Super Bowl. They want the kind of
compulsive, monomaniacal coach who can lead them to the top of the
mountain again. And having had Belichick as their defensive
coordinator in their salad days, they know he is a defensive
schemer capable of throwing a scare into Napoleon himself.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kraft's pursuit of Belichick amounts to a tacit
admission that the owner was wrong not to hire the Wesleyan
graduate in 1997, when Parcells lit out for the Jersey swamplands.
This is the era of the obsessive techie executive, not the
well-adjusted company man. The slogan of the coming Belichick era
might be: Don't communicate, dominate.

 _ SF CHRON  
 `Sleepy Hollow' Director Takes Act to the Web  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Tim Burton, the director of ``Batman,'' ``Edward Scissorhands'' and
``Sleepy Hollow,'' will bring his edgy sensibility to a new
animated series for San Francisco's Shockwave.com, an online
entertainment site.
<P>
   Officials at Macromedia, Shockwave's parent company, will
announce at the Sundance Film Festival today that Burton will
create 26 ``Webisodes,'' or online comics, for the site
(www.shockwave.com).
</P>
<P>
   The series, which will debut this spring, will revolve around
Burton's ``Stainboy'' creation, a simply-drawn character that
appeared in his recent book, ``The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy
and Other Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Shockwave has been working feverishly to land high-profile
artists as entertainment content becomes a more important feature
in luring 18- to 34-year-old Web surfers. The company recently
signed similar deals with Spiderman creator Stan Lee, and Trey
Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the raunchy ``South Park''
show.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for its graphics development software and Shockwave
plug-in, which lets Internet users play clips of video, games,
music and other forms of media, Macromedia spun off Shockwave.com
this summer to separate the entertainment- and game-oriented site
from its traditional business.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's two- to five-minute animated shorts will appear
periodically on Shockwave.com, and will be free to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Though Burton's often moody, dark work in movies has gained him
the most attention _ he produced the films ``Mars Attacks!''
``James and the Giant Peach,'' and ``Ed Wood'' _ he is also an
author and animator who likes to delve into stories and characters
outside the traditional Hollywood system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have the kind of freedom to try out an idea
without having to have a lot of meetings,'' he told the Associated
Press. ``I get to do shorts with a character I want to explore, and
this medium seems perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Shockwave officials didn't give plot or other details of
the series or character, including how often new ones will be
available, a drawing of the character depicts a smiling, portly
fellow with an ``S'' on his chest and what looks like a cape.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but Macromedia
chief executive Robert Burgess said Burton will receive an equity
stake in the company, which is expected to offer its shares to the
public in the next year. Burton will also retain control if the
series jumps to other media like TV or films.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sign of the times,'' Burgess said. ``You're going to
see the greatest storytellers of our day targeting the Internet and
it will change people's minds about what the Internet can be.''

FOR ROBERT KARFT, A FAMILIAR FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As he mulled over the price the Patriots
would be willing to pay in order to pry Bill Belichick from the New
York Jets _ most important, a first-round pick in this year's NFL
draft _ owner Robert Kraft said he reached the decision to pull the
trigger on the deal at 10 Wednesday night only after he was
reminded of another tough business decision.
</P>
<P>
   It was the one he made six years ago to buy the Patriots from
James Busch Orthwein for about $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same kind of situation,'' Kraft said during
Belichick's introductory press conference at Foxboro Stadium. ``We
had no shot of getting the team and people were trying to move it
and they wouldn't let us in the process. Then they let us in right
at the end and we paid the highest price ever paid for any
franchise, anywhere in the world, at that time. A lot of people
told me that I was nuts, but in my heart, I knew I was doing the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was another motivating factor that compelled Kraft to
return Bill Parcells's phone call Thursday morning and agree to the
Jets' terms, thus setting into motion the chain of events that
culminated with an armistice between the heated AFC East rivals and
Belichick's arrival as the Patriots' new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the Robert Edwards situation,'' Kraft
admitted, ``and about the uncertainty that we all have with draft
picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft recalled how the Patriots thought they ``had the running
back position solved'' after the club drafted Edwards with their
first-round pick (18th overall) in the 1998 draft. A product from
the University of Georgia, Edwards showed great promise when he
rushed for 1,115 yards, marking the third-best rookie rushing
performance in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But any thoughts of gridiron grandeur proved premature when
Edwards suffered a severe knee injury in a freak accident while
participating in a flag football game on the beach during last
year's Pro Bowl activities in Honolulu. Edwards wound up sitting
out all of this season and his future is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, through an act of God, changed all that and
we're still dealing with that now,'' Kraft said. ``I said, here's a
chance to solve our problems with all the positions in the
organization. (Belichick's) someone who gives me peace of mind that
he knows what he's doing and he knows what it takes to win and
that's why we're all in this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, for a No. 1 draft choice, we can bring in a man who I
feel certain will do something rather than with the uncertainty of
the draft pick. So it wasn't even close when I thought about it
(Wednesday) night. That's when I told Bill (Parcells) that we could
do the deal, because we were ready to move in another direction and
make the offer to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft declined to say who was next in line for the Patriots, but
it had been widely speculated that Jaguars assistant Dom Capers was
the pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most rewarding things in life are very complex and you
have to go through difficult times to enjoy the good times,'' Kraft
said. ``A former head coach said to me that this is not a business
for sane people and I probably have a better understanding of that.
On the other hand, if you persevere and you have a vision of what's
right and you have a collection of good people around you and can
help you get there, then you have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our family is committed to winning. I think Bill Belichick
said it well. We have a good nucleus of players here, our family is
willing to commit the capital to do it, and we will continue to do
it because you have to do that if you want to win.''

 Webvan Sees Sales Surge 136%  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Bolstered by a growing customer base, Webvan Group Inc., the
Foster City e-tailer that delivers groceries to homes, reported
yesterday a 136 percent jump in sales in the fourth quarter to $9.1
million from $3.8 million a year ago.
<P>
   Webvan, which launched its service in June with Bay Area grocery
delivery, racked up $13.3 million in sales in 1999. The company
more than doubled the number of customers it has to 47,000 in the
fourth quarter from 22,000 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan, which accepts orders for groceries over its Web site and
delivers them to peoples' homes, also announced an acceleration of
its national expansion plans yesterday. It intends to operate in 15
U.S. markets by the end of 2001, up from an earlier estimate of 11
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive George Shaheen said the company does not need to
raise additional financing for the faster rollout. ``We're good to
go on capital through this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan raised more than $400 million in an October stock
offering and completed additional rounds of private financing. As
of December 31, the e-tailer had $638 million in cash and
marketable securities, according to financial statements released
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really impressed with their desire to increase the speed
of the rollout,'' said Lowell Singer, an e-commerce analyst with
Robertson Stephens. ``This will ultimately make Webvan a bigger
company sooner than we had thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Webvan also reported net losses that were in line with Wall
Street expectations. For the year, Webvan posted a loss of $144.6
million ($1.27 per share) and a fourth-quarter loss of $49 million
(22 cents per share).
</P>
<P>
   The pro-forma loss for 1999, which excludes expenses related to
executive compensation and other onetime charges, totaled $76.3
million (28 cents per share) while the pro-forma fourth-quarter
loss totaled $25.7 million (8 cents per share).
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made after markets closed yesterday. In
after-hours trading yesterday evening, Webvan shares rose to $15,
up from the market closing price of $13.75.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who try Webvan are coming back. Repeat orders
accounted for more than 75 percent of fourth-quarter orders, up
from 65 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Order sizes grew to an average of $81.31 in the fourth quarter
from $72.53. Shaheen said Webvan needs average orders of $103 to
meet its financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its announcement, Webvan said it had finalized deals
to enter four new markets: Boston, Denver, Philadelphia and
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The company will launch in its second market, Atlanta, this
spring, and is currently setting up automated distribution centers
in Chicago, Dallas, Seattle and Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Webvan announced alliances with grocery
manufacturers Pillsbury, Quaker and Kellogg, which will pay fees to
Webvan in exchange for being able to offer promotions on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers will also sell Webvan discounted merchandise
``so we can be cost-competitive'' with supermarkets, Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar deals with Nestle and General Mills were announced late
last year.

 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton bragged Thursday night that the
state of the union had never been better and proposed using some of
the nation's wealth to provide modest tax relief for lower- and
middle-income Americans, particularly married ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the
American spirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in
25 years. Teen births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by
30 percent. Welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30
years,'' Clinton said in his seventh report on the State of the
Union. ``My fellow Americans, the state of our union is the
strongest it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   In one surprise that presidential aides kept from reporters
until just before the speech, Clinton urged federal legislation to
require licenses for all handgun purchases. Saying that states now
license hunting and driving, Clinton recommended similar photo
identifications for handgun buyers once they pass a background
check and a gun-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton stepped to the rostrum, the House chamber was
crowded, as always, although the entire Supreme Court was
puzzlingly absent, some without any stated reason. But the drama of
his address a year ago, delivered on the eve of his impeachment
trial, was gone. Instead, Clinton's main adversary was the
calendar, which shows less than a year to go until his successor's
proposals are the ones that matter.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore seated behind his right shoulder and
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the balcony above, Clinton did much to
try to help their political fortunes and the effort of other
Democrats to take back the House from the Republicans who had
impeached him.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Clinton, as he has done so often during his
tenure, seized an issue dear to the Republicans and made it his
own. He announced a proposal to alleviate the parts of the tax code
that penalize married couples, forcing them to pay higher rates
than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   That makes such a change likely, since Republicans on Capitol
Hill had previously said that ending the marriage penalty was one
of their principal goals this year and had appeared to have enough
Democratic backing to enact it even before Clinton embraced the
measure Thursday night. The proposal was one of a series of tax
cuts that aides said totaled $350 billion over 10 years, measured
against an estimated $2 trillion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton took credit for the extraordinary health
of the American economy _ and shared credit lavishly with Gore _
while warning that the prosperity not be squandered.
</P>
<P>
   But while last year's address was built around a pledge to save
Social Security before taking any other actions or cutting taxes,
this year, Clinton felt times were good enough to call for both tax
cuts, although modest ones, and a spree of social spending.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, an area in which he hopes to be remembered,
Clinton urged lawmakers to give China most-favored-nation trade
status on a permanent basis, and he reiterated his view that
America must stay engaged in the world, especially with former
adversaries still struggling to enact democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in previous speeches, Clinton devoted far less time to
foreign policy and national security issues than to his domestic
agenda, quickly surveying America's role as a mediator in the
Middle East and Northern Ireland and as a defender of human rights
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the trend toward globalization was ``the central
reality of our time,'' one that was ``building new networks''
between nations. He called for a new consensus on trade, urging
Congress to pass legislation easing trade barriers with African and
Caribbean nations and to approve the agreement his administration
reached with China last year to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open markets and rules-based trade are the best engines we
know for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and
environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas,''
Clinton said. ``There is only one direction for America on trade:
We must go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia had been held back from its full potential by
economic turmoil and ``a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya''
but said the United States should help ``those Russians struggling
for a democratic, prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing technological advances that ``make weapons of terror
easier to conceal and easier to use,'' he said the United States
would act to restrain North Korea, Iran and Iraq from obtaining
weapons that could threaten their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The president vowed to protect vital computer systems from
cyberattacks and pledged to continue developing a national missile
defense system, although he repeated his previous assurances to
preserve the Antiballistic Missile treaty with Russia. He also
called for ``a constructive bipartisan dialogue'' on the
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, which the Senate voted to reject
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the points he made were not new, but he did announce a
proposal to offer tax credits to pharmaceutical companies to speed
development of vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS in
poorer nations. He also said his budget would include $150 million
to fight disease around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With his speech coming between this week's Iowa caucuses and the
New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, Clinton unveiled a legislative
shopping list aimed to some degree at ensuring his relevance as the
country's attention shifts to the campaign. Election-year
Congresses are notoriously unproductive ones, but Thursday night
Clinton advanced some proposals designed to win congressional
backing this year and other initiatives designed to linger for the
Democrats until well beyond Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great goals, worthy of a great nation,'' Clinton
said in excerpts of the speech released in advance by the White
House. ``We will not reach them all this year. Not even in this
decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first
American revolution was not won with a single shot. The continent
was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history _ and
the lesson of the last seven years _ is that great goals are
reached step by step, building on our progress, always gaining
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   On education, Clinton borrowed heavily from Gore's campaign
platform, proposing $3 billion in new spending for the politically
popular Head Start program and new after-school initiatives, as
well as school construction and enhanced teacher pay. He reiterated
his $31 billion plan to make college more affordable through
enhanced federal grants and by making part of tuition tax
deductible. He has credited Mrs. Clinton with twisting him arm to
make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our
faith that every child can learn,'' he said. ``Because education is
more than ever key to our children's future, we must make sure that
all our children have that key. That means universal preschool and
after-school, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and
college opportunities for all our children.''

   &UR; BIKE _ &LR;  ``Remember,'' said bike messenger Andrew Brady before
hitting the wet, windy streets, ``if it's made of metal, it's

WASHINGTON: our children.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the president's proposals have been suggested before but
have never gained traction in Congress. Clinton urged renewed
action on ``unfinished business,'' including hate-crimes
legislation, a minimum wage increase from $5.15 an hour, a bill of
rights to give patients more say with their health maintenance
organizations, and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, the father of a teen-age boy killed last April at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was one of the guests
invited to sit beside Mrs. Clinton in the balcony. The president's
speech pushed the gun-control measures that Congress failed to act
on last year, along with money to enhance the enforcement of
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years _ the
longest decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped
to forge on community police, sensitive gun control and effective
prevention,'' the president said. ``But nobody believes America is
safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the
safest big country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's various tax-relief ideas would supplement
working families' retirement savings, assist with child care
expenses, encourage charitable giving and make up to $10,000 of
college tuition tax deductible. In another helping hand for
struggling families, Clinton proposed $21 billion to expand the
earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of undoing the marriage penalty is always politically
popular. But the president's plan, which would be phased in over a
decade and would double the standard deduction for two-income
couples to twice the amount of a single filer's deduction, is more
limited than various Republican proposals. It would not benefit
couples who itemize on their returns.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed measures to encourage drug companies
to develop vaccines to combat AIDS and tuberculosis. He pushed
again for prescription-drug benefits under Medicare, one of a
handful of health care proposals. And he vowed to pay off the debt
by 2013 _ two years ahead of his previous predictions _ and resist
reckless spending that chips away at Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one of his biggest legislative defeats last year,
Clinton called for a ``bipartisan dialogue'' on the comprehensive
test ban treaty, conciliatory language indicating that he did not
intend to push the matter again. He stressed the importance of
engaging countries like China and Russia, which still maintains a
nuclear-missile arsenal. And he addressed the dangers of biological
warfare and ``cyberterrorism,'' without offering any specific
solutions to those dangers.
</P>
<P>
   One facet of Clinton's vision of a ``new America'' entails
closing what he has called the ``digital divide.'' He renewed his
requests for government aid to help poor people gain access to
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In length and breadth, the speech reflected Clinton's basically
centrist political instincts, the advice of many people in the
White House and on Capitol Hill _ and the president's desire to
savor his last big moment in the spotlight before the nation's
attention turns inevitably to the next president.

EURO SETTLES BELOW DOLLAR FOR FIRST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The value of Europe's single currency, the euro, plunged 1.3
percent Thursday to finish trading for the first time below the
psychologically important level of $1. Since its debut, one year
and 27 days ago, the euro has fallen 15.3 percent against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a euro at 98.86 cents, where it was in
late trading in New York on Thursday, and its $1.0013 value on
Wednesday is small. But the decline is an emotional blow to a
currency that was expected to rally after its birth and even
challenge the supremacy of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is turning into the little currency that couldn't,'' said
Ann Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the $1 level has been pierced, foreign exchange
analysts expect the 11-nation currency to fall further. Some are
scaling back their expectations for a rally later this year as
well. Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase
Securities, now expects the euro to fall as low as 95 cents and
bounce back by the end of the year to $1.07, instead of $1.10, as
she predicted late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that there is a policy of benign neglect,''
said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a
consulting firm in Essex, Conn. ``The Group of Seven just met and
didn't mention the euro in the communique,'' he said, referring to
the meeting of finance officials of the seven leading industrial
nations.
</P>
<P>
   With the break below parity, which the euro had done in intraday
trading on Tuesday and Wednesday and twice more in early December,
the currencies represented by the euro are at their weakest point
against the dollar since the mid-1980s and earlier. This is good
for American tourists, as the cost of travel to Europe becomes
cheaper. But it is tough on American exporters, whose products
become more expensive on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   What is mystifying about the euro's decline is that the economic
fundamentals are positive. The 11-nation euro bloc, known as
Euroland, is growing again, albeit slowly, and inflation is low.
The pace of American growth, meanwhile, is expected to slow this
year, as the Federal Reserve tries to cool the economy by
continuing to raise short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies, though, can suffer even when economic fundamentals
are positive. The dollar was quite weak in 1995 and 1996, as the
current economic expansion was gaining a full head of steam and the
U.S. stock market was taking off.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's weakness is aggravated by its recent record.
Investors who bet on it early have lost a lot of money. Those
losses serve as a reminder to investors to sell quickly when the
euro fails to meet expectations. ``When people start to see it go
down, they don't have the heart to stay with it,'' Ms. Mills said.
The beginning of the year was particularly disappointing. The euro
rose 2.7 percent as the American stock market fell. But that rally
sputtered after just seven trading days, and the euro has gone
downhill since.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, a weak currency is not bad right now for Euroland
(Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain). It helps exports,
which are critical to Europe's economic recovery, by making them
less expensive abroad. A weak currency can add to inflationary
pressures by making imports more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe is at the beginning of an economic rebound, while the
U.S. economy is days away from setting a record for the longest
expansion in its history. This means price pressures will build
more slowly in Europe than they would in the United States. In
addition, unemployment remains high in Euroland, and core
inflation, excluding food and energy, remains low at about 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of a weaker euro and the dearth of inflationary
pressures put the European Central Bank in a tight spot. A rate
increase could help strengthen the euro. But with no hint of
out-of-control price pressures, there is no strong reason to raise
interest rates aggressively to curb growth. Otmar Issing, chief
economist of the European Central Bank, made it clear on Wednesday
that the central bank would not worry about the level of the euro
unless it was adding to inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can afford to raise interest rates,'' said
Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston.
``The economy is still too weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts expect the European Central Bank to raise
short-term rates modestly this year to assure that the economic
rebound does not ignite inflation. A factor in the bank's decision
will be the results of key wage talks, starting with IG Metall,
Germany's largest union.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers of the European Central Bank are meeting on Feb. 3
to discuss whether to raise rates. Ms. Parker of Chase Securities
said that the latest fall in the euro ``may mean that they do half
of a percentage point instead of a quarter of a percentage point,
or do it earlier.'' She is still expecting policy-makers to wait
until March before acting.
</P>
<P>
   Given that U.S policy-makers are expected to raise the key
short-term interest rate target at least a quarter-point on
Wednesday, the European Central Bank may have some added pressure
to respond sooner, rather than later.

<P>
   Emeralds, the precious stones sought after for centuries to
grace maharajahs' and sultans' turbans and the crowns of European
kings, have yielded an insight about their origins to a team of
French researchers.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing inherent traces of the water from which the stones
crystallized eons ago, the researchers say they can identify the
country and even the individual mine from which an emerald came.
</P>
<P>
   The French method has helped delineate the routes by which
emeralds were traded in the ancient world, and may also influence
present day prices for the stones, which are often deemed more
valuable if their provenance is known.
</P>
<P>
   The only sources of emeralds before the discovery of the New
World were thought to be Cleopatra's mine in Egypt and a small mine
discovered by the Romans in the Austrian Alps. But analysis of the
emerald in a Roman earring found in France showed it must have come
from a mine in Pakistan, perhaps from the ancient kingdom of
Gandhara, and would have reached Europe along the Silk Road, the
French scientists say in a report in Thursday's Science.
</P>
<P>
   The emerald analysis method was developed by Dr. Gaston Giuliani
of the Center for Petrographical and Geochemical Research in
Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy and colleagues elsewhere. It depends on
vaporizing a small sample from the surface of the stone so as to
measure the ratio of oxygen isotopes. The oxygen is derived from
the hot waters out of which the emeralds crystallized, and each of
the few known mines in the world seems to have had water with
different isotope ratios. Isotopes are atoms of the same element
that differ in the number of neutrons they contain.
</P>
<P>
   The vaporization leaves a minute pit in the emerald's surface.
Even though the pit is invisible to the naked eye, the method is to
that extent destructive. Giuliani said the director of the Museum
of Natural History in Paris let him experiment first on two
emeralds owned by the Abbe Hauy, the founder of mineralogy, which
turned out to come from the old Roman mine in the Austrian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's team was then allowed to test a precious relic, the
emerald set on the central jewel lily of the Holy Crown of France
by Louis IX. St. Louis' emerald too proved to come from the
Austrian mine.
</P>
<P>
   A new source of emeralds was opened up when the Spanish, after
much torture and protracted fighting, discovered the Colombian
mines that were the source of the emeralds found in Mexico and
Peru. Giuliani tested a smuggled emerald _ it was not listed on the
manifest _ salvaged recently from the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a
Spanish treasure galleon that foundered off Key West in 1622. The
oxygen isotope test showed the emerald came from the Tequendama
mine of the Muzo district of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Colombian mines were in their possession, the Spanish
started to develop buyers for the emeralds and found considerable
interest among the rulers of India, Persia and Turkey. ``So
sultans, shahs and maharajahs were the principal market,'' said
Fred Ward, a gemologist and author of the book ``Emeralds.'' Gem
Book Publishers, 1996 The Spanish at first shipped the emeralds
from Spain, then sent them via the Philippines. In India, the
Philippines was long believed to be their source of origin, Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's team tested four emeralds from the treasure of the
Nizam of Hyderabad. He reports that three of the emeralds came from
Colombia, each from a different mine, and the fourth probably from
the Pansher Valley of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Ward described the French method as a ``dramatic innovation''
which could affect the emerald market because of owners' interest
in the stones' provenance. ``If someone can say definitively an
emerald is from a certain mine it may cause the emeralds to be more
pricey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds at present are sourced by a battery of visual and
spectroscopic tests which are indicative rather than definitive.
``We regard origin as a professional opinion rather than a
scientific fact,'' said Dr. Kenneth Scarratt, director of the
testing laboratory at the American Gem Trade Association in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Scarratt praised the French team's study but said more samples
would be needed to validate the method. Even if it proved reliable,
the fact that even a minuscule part of the stone was destroyed
might deter clients who did not want to take the risk, he said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Road Warriors Deliver the Goods  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
``Remember,'' said bike messenger Andrew Brady before hitting the
wet, windy streets, ``if it's made of metal, it's trying to kill
you.
<P>
   ``That goes for cars, doors, manhole covers, tracks,'' he said,
tightening the strap on his shoulder bag. ``What do you do? You
crash, you roll, you bounce, you get up. That's the way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   And with those encouraging words, Brady pedaled off on his first
run of the morning _ a pick-up at a dot-com company south of the
new Pacific Bell ballpark at China Basin.
</P>
<P>
   While fast-riding, red-light-running bike messengers have long
been a fact of life in downtown San Francisco, these samurai of the
streets have been making headlines lately for a different reason:
disputes with employers over pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A brief strike last week at the leading courier firm, DMS Corp.,
highlighted the growing discontent among the city's bikers. About
30 DMS messengers stayed off the job for a week to press demands
for better pay and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The DMS strike followed votes to unionize at two other local
courier outfits, Professional Messenger and UltraEx, where
follow-up negotiations with management are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our hope we can get an industry-wide contract and
industry-wide standards,'' said Howard Williams, president of the
San Francisco Bike Messengers Association and a rider for UltraEx.
``But it's difficult. We're not going to beat around the bush on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to perceptions, San Francisco's roughly 300 bike
messengers aren't just a bunch of scruffy, pierced, tattooed
anarchists flying at breakneck speed along roadways.
</P>
<P>
   They are in fact scruffy, pierced, tattooed anarchists who bring
a unique set of skills to a job that requires split-second decision
making, in-the-field problem solving, a strong sense of personal
initiative and a pace that makes most vocations look positively
sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   After whizzing down the middle of streets, through a variety of
intersections and past about a dozen stop signs, Brady steered his
mountain bike into the flooded parking lot of Gazoontite.com, an
online company specializing in allergy relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man,'' he moaned as his bike sank about two feet into the
water, soaking his sneakers. ``It's too early for this.''
</P>
<P>
   When it rains, and even when it pours, as was the case earlier
this week, bike messengers remain on the job, racing from gig to
gig.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, 35, who is director of operations at King Courier and has
been working as a messenger for 18 years, was dripping from head to
toe as he jumped off his bike at Gazoontite's back door and charged
up the stairs. He made his way through the office to the
receptionist's desk, where he received an envelope that had to be
delivered across town in just minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good day for swimming out there,'' one of the workers
commented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Brady agreed, already making for the door.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds he was once again on his bike and churning
through the flooded lot. ``Let's go!'' he shouted over his shoulder
before beginning a sprint through Multimedia Gulch to the offices
of a well-known venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Most courier companies pay messengers on a commission basis. In
King's case, it's a straight 50-50 split, with the average delivery
_ or ``tag,'' in messenger parlance _ worth about $8. The typical
bike messenger aims to pocket about $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a messenger will handle literally dozens of
tags, and in so doing ride about 30 miles, every single day. For
$100.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why the DMS messengers were up in arms is because
that company doesn't use commissions. Instead, it employs a
``universal pricing grid,'' which is designed to compensate bikers
using a complex formula that considers the size of the package, the
distance covered and the effort required to make a delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' said Terry Hird, who runs the San Francisco office
of DMS. ``The problem is that it's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he insisted that DMS pays ``more cash to bikers than
any other company in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   DMS messengers, who declined to give their names, confirmed that
the company does pay pretty well, with the average DMS biker making
about $120 a day. But they said that the universal pricing grid,
due to its complexity, makes it difficult for them to know just
what their rates are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep it complicated on purpose,'' one DMS messenger said,
``so we don't know how much we get and how much the company is
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   To clear up the confusion, not to mention introduce more stable
pricing, the Bike Messengers Association approached the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union a couple of years ago
for help in unionizing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the industry is going to change is through a
combination of regulation and unionization,'' said Peter Olney, the
ILWU's director of organizing. ``Unless a union comes in, the
companies are going to keep competing by driving prices and costs
down.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, there is no official government oversight of the
bike-messenger side of the business because there is no licensing
for messengers. The Department of Motor Vehicles and California
Highway Patrol regulate the trucking side of things.
</P>
<P>
   The courier companies are resisting unionization, and have
brought in outside consultants to assist in their dealings with
workers. At UltraEx, for example, nearly eight months have passed
since the workers voted 27-15 to unionize, with no end to the talks
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're negotiating in good faith'' was all UltraEx President
Ernie Holbrook would say on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   While bike messengers may be the most visible facet of the
courier business, they account for only about 10 percent of revenue
for the larger companies. Approximately 4,000 other
delivery-industry workers in the Bay Area drive trucks and vans or
see to logistical concerns, and they have been less vocal than the
bikers in seeking to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   They also don't go through what the typical messenger copes
with. Inclement weather aside, the biker's average day consists of
a series of confrontations with lobby security guards and corporate
receptionists, punctuated by hops on the bike and almost daily flat
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Brady got his flat after a drop-off at Gap Inc. on Harrison
Street. He made the repair in about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without a doubt the funnest job you can ever have,''
he said. ``You go, you bust ass, you go home tired, you feel good
about yourself. It's an honest day's work for an honest day's
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also really dangerous. All bike messengers have their
horror stories about getting ``doored'' by parked cars or wiping
out in the rain. But in many cases, they're on their own if they
get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   While just about all courier companies have plenty of insurance
to cover accidents involving pedestrians or vehicles, only a
handful offer health benefits to riders. Most even require
employees to supply their own bikes.
</P>
<P>
   And in the event of a fatality, the best send-off most riders
can hope for is a fond farewell from their colleagues. When a
messenger dies, Brady said, the city's bikers gather at South Park
for a wake and then ceremoniously toss their slain colleague's
cycle into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of bikes have gone in,'' he observed, ``but they usually
get fished out by some homeless person.''
</P>
<P>
   Such brushes with mortality are often the extent of a bike
messenger's contemplation of the future. Most live for the moment _
so much so that they usually have little in the way of savings, let
alone a retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dunn, a 37-year-old messenger, said he's been riding for
more than 10 years. ``I like being outside,'' he explained with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn figured he has another eight years in his legs before being
too old to keep working. After that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``That's eight years away. I try not
to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's usually uppermost on the minds of messengers? Over a
quick lunch at the International Restaurant and Mini Mart on
Battery Street _ a favorite among bike messengers, not least
because most items on the menu cost only a buck or two _ the answer
became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Money.
</P>
<P>
   As Brady and several other messengers gathered out on the
sidewalk to wolf down their food, the conversation centered on how
much people in the business are making, or not making, and which
companies currently offer the best pay for deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Heitkamp, 28, fielded a few questions about his latest gig
as in-house messenger for a printing company. ``It's boring,'' he
said. ``You go to the same places over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but there's a lot of cash,'' Brady pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Heitkamp nodded as he lit a cigarette. Despite their awesome
physical condition, nearly all bike messengers smoke like chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation shifted from money to one of life's other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are your favorite bathrooms?'' Brady asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep my favorites a secret,'' Heitkamp replied. ``It's hard
to find a good bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   After some prodding, he revealed only that his favorite rest
stop, in the office of a client, ``has a beautiful view of the Bay
Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady nodded appreciatively. ``My favorite used to be in 3
Embarcadero,'' he said. ``They kept it stocked with all the latest
newspapers and magazines. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady next headed over to ``the wall'' _ the spot at Sansome and
Market where messengers congregate between deliveries. To stay out
of the rain, the bikers had moved across the street to the portico
of 1 Citicorp Center, where they were busily smoking cigarettes and
other substances.
</P>
<P>
   The talk was about the strike at DMS and whether it was truly
feasible to unionize the industry. Some riders were skeptical that
further strikes would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rookies will always take the jobs,'' complained a
20-year-old messenger who asked to be identified only as Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, missing a day of work is the difference between
paying the rent and not paying the rent,'' noted a 24-year-old
messenger going by the street name of Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's radio crackled and he was dispatched to Japantown and
then to an address near the Marina. The rain was coming down in
sheets as he muscled his way up the hill on Laguna Street and then
sped down the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to the Financial District, he said, ``Let's take
the tunnel,'' and proceeded toward the Broadway tunnel, where a
heavy mist from the rushing traffic hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``One piece of advice,'' Brady shouted. ``Ride fast.''
</P>
<P>
   And he took off at full throttle, his bike just inches from
passing vehicles, the surface of the tunnel slick with rain and
oil, broken glass in the gutter waiting to slash another tire.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hell of a way to make a hundred bucks.

AS HE PURSUES THE WHITE HOUSE, BUSH PINES FOR THE GOVERNOR'S
MANSION  
 MORE DEGREES OF SEPARATION

<P>
   AMHERST, N.H. _ Anyone who attended George W. Bush's campaign
events over the last few days heard a number of familiar themes,
from tax cuts and defense spending to education and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he or she perhaps picked up on something less predictable as
well: Bush is homesick.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech on Tuesday night, the Texas governor lapsed into
a reverie about the morning rituals he misses and how long it had
been since he visited the swath of land in Texas where he and his
wife, Laura, are building a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   At other times he talked about his cats. He pined for his dog.
</P>
<P>
   He was off his game on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday, and
again Thursday. He sniffled through speeches. At one point,
characterizing the relationship between the United States and
Israel, Bush mused, ``They're our buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, visiting an elementary school in Nashua that was
celebrating what it called Perseverance Month, he told the gathered
schoolchildren: ``This is Preservation Month. I appreciate
preservation. This is what you do when you run for president.
You've got to preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   And the most difficult part of that endeavor, he said, was being
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   It all made for an interesting contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore comes off as one of the most ardent,
ambitious aspirants to the Oval Office in quite some time, a man
who would crawl across broken glass to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush comes off as a man who wants it, but not at any price, and
sometimes not as much as he wants to wake up in his own bed at the
governor's mansion in Austin, Texas, wander downstairs to make a
pot of coffee, let out the pets, and fetch the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, that is one of the reasons why many
Americans like him.
</P>
<P>
   More Degrees of Separation
</P>
<P>
   Bush is happy to separate himself from both Gore and President
Clinton, and has been more aggressive about it lately.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new line appeared in his speeches, and that does
not happen too often. To rally Republican voters in Iowa, Bush
began talking about what this election really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the end of the Clinton era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a freighted statement, because one of the signals it sent
to Republican voters was that if they wanted the White House back,
as they surely did, it was time to unite around the front-runner
and send him into the general election as unscathed and unbowed as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   It also made a tacit claim to morality at the same time that
Bush was facing questions about abortion and giving answers that
might not be wholly satisfying to religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's victory speech after the Iowa caucuses on Monday
night, he went a step further, not only referring to the Clinton
era but also appealing to Americans ``weary of scandals and
alibis.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in Concord, someone in the audience played into
his hands, asking Bush how he would handle the baggage of Clinton's
behavior if he were in Gore's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been in his position,'' Bush said. ``I
wouldn't have accepted the vice presidency under Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, when he was asked a similar question by a reporter,
Bush said of Gore: ``I don't think he can figure out how to handle
his relationship with the president. He distances, he doesn't
distance. He distances, he doesn't distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Words Count In a Campaign _ Even in Song
</P>
<P>
   In the semiotics of political campaigns, perhaps nothing is as
revealing as the music that plays at a candidate's events. Bush's
aides have assembled an entire soundtrack, which made its debut
last week, and the song list is almost a synopsis of Bush's persona
and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Bamba'' is on it, with Spanish lyrics that evoke both
Bush's ability to speak the language and his outreach to
Hispanic-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   The singer John Fogerty's ``Centerfield'' is on it, a reminder
that Bush loves baseball, was once the managing general partner of
the Texas Rangers and is ``ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of country and western, for that down-home,
folksy feel. There is a bit of mild disco, just to show that Bush
can groove.
</P>
<P>
   Van Morrison's ``Bright Side of the Road'' telegraphs Bush's
optimism, while Tom Petty's ``I Won't Back Down'' claims a certain
degree of tenacity, his homesickness notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   And Sting's ``A Brand New Day'' promises precisely that. Never
mind that the song is more romantically than politically inclined.
</P>
<P>
   After a miscue several weeks go, when ``Cat's in the Cradle,''
about a son who grows up to be like his aloof father, played at
several campaign appearances, all the lyrics were carefully vetted
this time around.

SECURITY FLAW DISCOVERED AT ONLINE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what may prove to be a cautionary tale about
the headlong rush into electronic commerce, a new online bank
permitted customers for almost a month to transfer funds from any
other account in the nation's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, someone armed with another person's account number
and bank routing number could move money from that account to the
Internet bank, then withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability was apparently discovered and exploited by at
least one Internet grifter. The company's executives acknowledged
Thursday that they had contacted law-enforcement officials because
of one incident, but said the dollar amounts involved ``are not
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The security flaw, which the company said was corrected earlier
this week after computer security experts alerted it to the
problem, highlights the potential risks inherent in moving
traditional commerce into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The company, X.Com, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was founded in
March 1999 and has been online since early December. Its banking
services are provided by X.com Bank, a division of First Western
National Bank, a small community bank based in La Jara, Colo. The
relationship is intended to permit the Internet start-up to develop
technology ``that makes accessing and moving your money easy,''
according to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts said Thursday that the company had
erred in making unauthorized electronic funds transfers far too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not need to explain to you the dangers and damage
that could be caused by this security flaw in X.com's systems,''
said Elias Levy, a computer security expert at Security Focus, a
San Francisco-based consulting firm. ``Anyone with half a clue
could perform these unauthorized transfers for over a month via
their Web site and create some real financial problems for other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had verified that the flaw existed last week by
transferring money from another account with the permission of the
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives acknowledged the Web banking service had some
early problems, but said they had instituted procedures intended to
prohibit fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris, chief executive of X.com, said the company had
changed its procedure for authorizing new accounts after it had
discovered about 10 instances in which inaccurate or suspicious
numbers had been entered into online application forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done thousands of transfers, and five or 10 that have
been problematic,'' he said. ``We have had people attempt to beat
our systems in a number of ways and now we think that we've
identified and addressed these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The company now requires that new customers fax or mail a copy
of a canceled check to establish their ownership of an account
before transferring money from it. In addition, only transfers from
accounts in the same name can be used to open accounts with the
online bank.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of a small but growing number of
Internet-oriented banking operations trying to offer consumers more
convenience and better interest rates than conventional banks.
Others include Telebank, a subsidiary of ETrade, the Internet
brokerage company; and Wingspan, part of Bank One Corp. Traditional
banks and financial services like Charles Schwab Corp. are also
offering Web-based banking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make everything electronic,'' said Harris, a former
chief executive of Intuit, the online financial services company
and software publisher. ``It saves us money, and lowering our costs
means we can increase our yields.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial industry experts said X.com's experience highlights
the potential risks of introducing Internet banking systems before
they are completely tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here is not unique to online banking,'' said Mark
Rasch, vice president of the Global Integrity Corp., a financial
systems computer security consulting firm based in Reston, Va.
``But with online banking you're exposed to the Web, and as a
result your network is more vulnerable and you have to be extra
vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the X.com security flaw was the company's decision to
directly interconnect its online application form with the nation's
Automated Clearing House network.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules governing fund transfers through the network, debit
transactions from a consumer's account must be authorized in
writing. But the rules place responsibility for verification and
authorization on the receiving party.
</P>
<P>
   ``An opening question in an online banking relationship should
be, `Where is the money coming from?''' said Robert H. Ledig, a New
York lawyer who is the co-author of ``21st-Century Money, Banking
and Commerce,'' published in association with the National
Automated Clearing House Association. ``If the answer isn't clear,
it's a bad start for the relationship.''

MANAGERS STILL MATTER IN INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent strength of Coca-Cola and Walt Disney stock is a
hopeful sign that dot-com mania hasn't entirely obliterated the
market's regard for meaningful measures of investment value.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, before frenzied speculators began throwing
money at loss-ridden Internet enterprises, there was a saying on
Wall Street that recognizing good management was key to successful
investing. Conventional wisdom held that while earnings did indeed
drive stock prices, the purchase of a company's shares was a bet on
its management.
</P>
<P>
   Without imaginative top managers, a corporation's ability to
sustain dynamic profit growth was suspect. Therefore, in the final
analysis, the anticipated stream of earnings that drove demand for
a stock depended on management's perceived capacity to deliver
ever-larger earnings numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's recent reaction to management moves for two
components of the Dow Jones industrial average indicate that the
investment community still hews to this conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   At Coca-Cola Co., management missteps had led to declining
confidence in its chairman-chief exec, sending its stock into an
extended swoon. The board of directors reacted to what it saw as a
threat to Coke's venerable brand image by naming Douglas Daft to
replace Douglas Ivester as the company's commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Daft has moved quickly to make his presence known by engineering
key personnel and strategy moves. One of his most important actions
came last week when he named a second in command, which was
something Ivester had resisted doing.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting vote of confidence by the investment community
since the top management shuffle was initiated has been a stock
price rebound of about 30 percent in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the sort also has happened at Disney, whose stock
has been languishing for more than a year. Part of the problem was
chief exec Michael Eisner's seeming reluctance to appoint a No. 2
since Michael Ovitz's departure as president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eisner is only in his late 50s, some past health
problems have no doubt exacerbated Wall Street's concern about his
insistence on running a one-man show. Eisner this week took a
convincing step toward addressing the need to ensure an eventual
orderly transfer of power by promoting ABC chief Robert Iger to
president and chief operating officer and making him a director.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a stunning $5-a-share pop in Disney's stock
price Tuesday. It didn't hurt, of course, that Disney also released
almost simultaneously a relatively strong earnings report for its
fiscal first quarter. Nevertheless, the profit improvement alone
wouldn't have been enough to launch a one-day 15 percent jump for
the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial aspect of Wall Street's enthusiasm seemed to be
Eisner's perceived willingness to at long last begin grooming a
successor, even though the company was careful not to characterize
Iger's ascension as such.
</P>
<P>
   Given how the Internet stock market has undermined traditional
confidence in tangible measures of corporate value, these
developments are reassuring. It's even quite possible they signal
the beginning of the end of the market's recent manic phase.

ON WELFARE AND NOT CLAIRVOYANT? NEW YORK WILL PROVIDE TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (CORRECTS year to 1998 in 20th graf, beginning: Despite
promises...) 
 (rk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late at night, when testimonials to ``incredible
psychics'' flash across the television screen, the $4.99-a-minute
soothsayer standing by the phone to ``actually solve your
problems'' could be a welfare recipient recruited, screened and
coached for the job by New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The city's welfare department has been recruiting welfare
recipients to work from home as telephone psychics since April.
Fifteen people have been hired so far by a company called Psychic
Network, said Ruth Reinecke, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clairvoyance is not among the qualifications listed on the
city's recruitment flier. Any public assistance recipient with a
high school equivalency degree, ``a caring and compassionate
personality'' and the ability ``to read, write and speak English''
can qualify for Psychic Network's ``minimum starting salary of $10
per hour, plus bonuses,'' the flier says.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested are asked to call Business Link, a division of
the city's Human Resources Administration that finds and trains
workers from the welfare rolls, and to sign up for a group
screening session.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I'm not a psychic?'' a caller to Business Link asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll train you,'' the city employee who answered the
telephone replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reinecke said that applicants were trained to read tarot
cards by a representative from Psychic Network at the city's
Business Link office on West 34th Street. She refused to provide
any other information about Psychic Network, citing a promise of
confidentiality to participating companies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's welfare-to-work effort, the
city set up Business Link in 1995 to connect businesses that needed
workers and welfare recipients who needed jobs.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 recipients have been placed and about 160 businesses
now participate, city officials said, many qualifying for wage
subsidies and federal and state tax credits of up to $10,000 for
each worker.
</P>
<P>
   The city does not investigate the businesses that participate to
determine if they are in trouble with the Better Business Bureau,
the Labor Department, the bankruptcy courts or the Internal Revenue
Service, Ms. Reinecke said. Instead, she said, the program leaves
welfare recipients as free to choose an employer as any other job
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the only Psychic Network listed in the current
Manhattan telephone book were unsuccessful. The local number was
disconnected in July, and the only street address given was one in
West Palm Beach, Fla., where a variety of records show it to be the
residence of a man, William B. Tide, who uses several names and has
an unlisted telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   But Janice Scott King, owner of a metaphysical bookstore called
the Psychic Network in Pompano Beach, Fla., said that she had been
bombarded with complaints meant for the other Psychic Network since
Tide failed in several attempts to acquire her trademarked name and
toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Thursday whether the company that is hiring
welfare recipients in New York City has any connection to Tide's
operation. Ms. Reinecke would not identify the woman who contacted
Business Link offering jobs with Psychic Network, and she said the
woman turned down a request to speak to a reporter. There was also
no evidence that the company that is working with the city has had
any complaints filed against it.
</P>
<P>
   In federal, state and local agencies where investigators have
struggled to curb abuses in the boom-and-bust psychic hot line
industry, tracking a phone line to its source is a familiar
problem. There are many parties involved in the typical
pay-per-call transaction, like long-distance companies, direct
marketers and bill collectors.
</P>
<P>
   And in a field dominated by those who control the best
late-night television slots, database marketing lists and expensive
telecommunications equipment, market leaders with a changing array
of names and affiliations have been accused of defrauding
customers, creditors, employees and stockholders around the
country, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators typically reacted with disbelief to New York
City's welfare-to-work psychic venture, but an enforcement official
with the Federal Communications Commission, where 40 percent of all
complaints concern psychic pay-per-call operations, laughed
uncontrollably, then begged for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described ``genuine psychics'' were not amused. ``That is
totally a scam,'' said the manager at Abracadabra Productions Ltd.,
a small New York City company that lists tarot, astrology,
palmistry, Turkish coffee and tea leaves on its Web site. ``Genuine
psychics study for years,'' she said, refusing to give her full
name. ``The city should not be doing this. It's shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the city, Ms. Reinecke defended the recruiting
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who performed in the job, the pay is rather good and
it's attractive to be able to work out of the home for the mothers
who have young children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of the telepsychic realm tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises of $10 or $12 an hour, actual pay at these
networks is often far less, because it is based on a per-minute
rate paid only for time spent on the telephone with callers, said
Judy Ann Cannizzaro, who has worked as a telephone psychic, taking
calls from the Psychic Readers Network, the Fort Lauderdale. Fla.,
company that has dominated the field since the 1998 bankruptcy of
Inphomation and its Psychic Friends Network, endorsed by Dionne
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   An extra 25 cents is paid for every name and address that can be
extracted from a caller, information that can be resold to direct
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Calls are automatically routed first to those workers who keep
callers on the line the longest, with scripted ploys like
pretending to see _ very slowly _ winning Lotto numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a clairvoyant all my life,'' Ms. Cannizzaro said.
``If I could get the lottery numbers, would I be working as a
telephone psychic?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the calls generated by late-night commercials are from
poor people, she added, and though the ads carry a required
disclaimer that the psychic reading is for entertainment only, many
callers are desperate for otherworldly solutions to their real
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to keep a person who doesn't have money for
bread on the phone at $5 a minute,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry's hub is in Fort Lauderdale, Robert J.
Buchner, an assistant attorney general in Florida, said he receives
hundreds of complaints from around the country. Most consumer
complaints, he and other lawyers said, concern the practices called
``cramming and slamming'' _ the padding of a customer's telephone
bill with charges they never knowingly incurred, and the switching
of their long-distance service to another carrier without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   In one notorious example from 1998, Access Resource Services, a
psychic hotline collection company run for a company in Pearl
River, N.Y., out of Fort Lauderdale, tried to collect $329.34 from
a West Hartford, Conn., man who had been dead for 20 years. In
other cases, long-distance carriers have contracted with psychic
networks to offer ``free psychic readings'' as an incentive to
switch carriers. Thousands of customers complained that they had
been switched without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Cohn, a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission, said the
FTC was on the verge of promulgating a new rule to make it harder
for unscrupulous operators to avoid accountability. Under the rule,
no company could try to collect a telephone charge unless it could
show the consumer proof of its validity, like a signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of the industry said that many of the major players
have been able to cash in and move on despite earlier regulations
aimed at cleaning up the business, while the workers at the bottom
answering the phones were left with dwindling revenues and bounced
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare is probably going to be dealing with welfare,'' Ms.
Cannizzaro said of New York City's psychic recruits, remembering
predawn calls from a woman in the Bronx who had suffered a
miscarriage, and from a drug-addicted mother who said she was going
to commit suicide. ``You're talking people with problems that not
even a soap opera can list, and you're giving them to people who
are only interested in $12 an hour.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Toting bags bulging with everything from slick
brochures for sophisticated surgical equipment to packets of
Pepto-Bismol, crowds of Cuban doctors, nurses and technicians
strolled along the red-carpeted aisles of the first American trade
show here since the United States imposed an economic embargo four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the whole affair could have been limited to the handful of
Cuban officials actually responsible for purchasing medical
products. But many of the 8,000 medical professionals expected to
attend the United States Health Care Exhibition were eager to
participate in a curious encounter that was part seminar on modern
medical knowledge, part window-shopping for American medical
devices and part political opening.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the scene at the Pabexpo Convention Center _ with
Cuban doctors calmly talking shop with American sales
representatives _ was oddly juxtaposed with the Cuban government's
recent clamor for the return of the 6-year-old refugee Elian
Gonzalez. The American executives, in turn, expected few quick
deals, if any, because of the intricate regulations governing the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is the latest small gesture, like last year's
visit of the governor of Illinois to explore agricultural exports,
where politicians and businesspeople seek to raise awareness of
opportunities with the ultimate goal of lifting the embargo that
has yet to topple President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we lose out?'' said Tony DeLio, the president of
ADM Nutraceutical, a division of Archer Daniels Midland, a sponsor
of the exhibition. ``The economic embargo has not worked. It has
not accomplished its political objectives. Opening up trade and
normalizing relations with Cuba would be in the best interests of
America economically and politically. We trade openly with Vietnam,
with whom we had a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for the Cuban health care system, which is an
often-invoked accomplishment of the very revolution that eventually
provoked the embargo, the Cubans crowded around demonstrations of
optical equipment, tried on leg braces and chatted about the latest
technologies and techniques that remain tantalizingly beyond their
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we only need two things,'' concluded one Cuban as he left
the exhibition hall. ``More equipment. And the money to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both things are in short supply here, ever since the collapse of
the Soviet Union pushed Cuba into an economic slide from which it
has yet to recover fully. Replacement parts for medical equipment
can be scarce, as are some medicines at pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans with relatives in the United States treasure their
regular shipments of vitamins and aspirin, poring over bottle
labels as if they were deciphering scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   Medical goods and food are eligible for sale despite the embargo
because they are considered humanitarian aid. American officials
said that in the last 18 months they had licensed $45 million in
medical sales to Cuba, although that only means companies were
approved to begin negotiations. They said they did not know how
many sales had taken place, but Cuban officials insisted none had
because the deals fell through after delays or because financing or
transport could not be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials chafe at other American regulations, like the
requirement to document that medicines and equipment supplies have
not been used to treat foreigners and hence earn hard currency from
hospital charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I ensure that every patient is a Cuban?'' said Rodrigo
Alvarez Cambras, the director of the Frank Pais International
Orthopedic Complex, where almost a third of the patients are indeed
foreigners. ``They want a clinical history. That is crazy. If we
pay for it, what does it matter if we give it to a Cuban or a
foreigner? If you get hurt and come here, do I have to say to you I
cannot help you and let you die?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the American products the executives brought here with
them _ bandages, vitamins and, in one case, a $365,000 radiation
therapy device _ will be donated as a gesture of good will, not to
mention brand awareness and a first step toward the day when
business and diplomatic relations between the two countries are
normalized.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a medical show, several executives said that would
come only through ``the biological solution,'' a thinly veiled
allusion to the aging Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a learning experience,'' said Jeff Dziura, the
director of international sales for the Ferris Mfg. Corp., a
wound-care products company in suburban Chicago. ``You have to test
the water whether you make a deal or not. Things change
politically. That's the beauty of international trade. A lot of
people in the States are afraid of it. But if you have action in
many countries, when one country is suffering problems you can
enjoy prosperity in another part of the world. You spread your
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some people noted that the companies at the show did
not send any high-powered delegations, it mattered little to the
Cubans. A half-dozen people waited patiently to have their vision
tested, while others gingerly tasted free samples of chile without
carne, made from soybeans. And while the exhibition was devoted to
health, cigarette smoke wafted through the air, a reminder that
American medical attitudes against smoking have yet to filter down
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have yet to see are any little pills to help me stop
smoking,'' said Xiomara Rodriguez, as she sheepishly crushed out
her cigarette in a potted plant. She said that while Cuba had made
its own medical advances, in the field of natural medicines in
which she works, for instance, the displays of new equipment
reminded her of the gap that remained in both technology and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they remove the blockade so we can get ahead,'' she
said. ``Nobody has the right to take away our right to develop. We
have been trying to advance, but they do not let us.''
</P>
<P>
   Intent on at least advancing her own knowledge, Dr. Vilma Lisnar
spent hours instead of dollars learning about physical therapy
equipment, disposable syringes and nutritional supplements. At a
booth sponsored by Pfizer, she discussed with a sales
representative the side effects of some new antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is marvelous, because in the clinic where I work we need
these a lot,'' said Dr. Lisnar, a family doctor. ``Another company
had a product to improve your memory. How wonderful that would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in some quarters, memories of the last four decades
of revolution and embargo have persisted perfectly well without it.

   The Federal Trade Commission decided to postpone a decision on
whether to block the proposed $30 billion merger of BP Amoco and
Atlantic Richfield after the companies made a new offer to sell
additional assets, people involved in the discussions said. While

   A leap in demand for airplanes and electronic equipment pushed
up orders for durable goods 4.1 percent in December, helping
manufacturers to their best year since 1997, the Commerce
Department said. In another report, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development said the home ownership rate climbed to an
all-time high of 66.8 percent in 1999, further evidence of the

   Shares of Coke Continue to Decline
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for eight workers who have sued Coca-Cola for racial
discrimination contended the company was improperly coercing black
employees to sign away their right to be part of the lawsuit and
any eventual judgment. And the day after Coke announced that it
would dismiss 6,000 workers as part of a reorganization, investors
reacted with dismay. Coca-Cola shares continued to decline, falling
$3.563, to close at $59.50.

   Gillette Reports Lower Sales
</P>
<P>
   Gillette reported lower sales and earnings for the fourth
quarter. The company, which is best known for its razors but makes
a variety of products from Duracell batteries to Right Guard
deodorant, said earnings dropped to $339 million from $435 million
a year earlier. Gillette earned 32 cents, in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly said its fourth-quarter profit rose 20 percent as
newer drugs like the schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa made up for a
decline in sales of the antidepressant Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   EToys, the most-visited Internet toy store last Christmas, said
its fiscal third-quarter loss widened because of higher costs of
doing business on its Web site. Shares of eToys fell $4.375, or 21
percent, to $16.875, a record low close and below the initial price
of $20 in May.

A RACIAL COMPLAINT OVER CUTBACKS AT COKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the Coca-Cola Co. said it would dismiss 6,000
employees worldwide, lawyers for eight workers who have sued the
company for racial discrimination contended Coke was improperly
coercing black employees to sign away their right to be part of the
lawsuit and any eventual judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Coke said on Wednesday that it would cut 6,000 people, or
one-fifth of its workers, in an effort to make the company more
profitable and decentralize many of its operations. Coke plans to
take an $800 million charge against earnings in the first half of
this year to cover severance payments and other costs associated
with the move. The company also said its earnings would shrink
further because of less demand for concentrate from bottlers in
Japan, Germany and Eastern Europe, and some expect more bad news
once the company completes its review of business in other areas,
including India.
</P>
<P>
   The actions at Coke were met with dismay by many investors,
although some Wall Street analysts have said the moves are
necessary to improve performance, which has been disappointing for
the last two years. On Thursday Coca-Cola shares continued to
decline, falling $3.563, to close at $59.50.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers filed a motion Thursday in federal court in Atlanta,
asking the court to ``reject the company's attempt to buy the
silence of its African-American employees.'' One lawyer, Pam
Coukos, said she did not know whether any of the plaintiffs in the
lawsuit had been laid off, or how many people who might be part of
the lawsuit if it is granted class-action status had lost their
jobs or would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know everybody's status at this point,'' she
said. ``We've asked the company for that information.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a waiver, standard procedure at many companies, that
employees who are laid off must sign if they want to receive a
severance package. Anyone who signs the waiver acknowledges that he
or she is giving up any future legal action against the company
under various statutes, including the Americans With Disabilities
Act and the Equal Pay Act. It goes on to specify the
racial-discrimination lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in
April, and lists the telephone numbers of two Atlanta-area lawyers
representing the plaintiffs that employees might want to consult
before signing the release.
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman said the company had tried to be as
thorough as possible in notifying people about the lawsuit in the
waiver. ``Because of the pending litigation, we went above and
beyond what is required by law to make prospective class members
aware of the situation and encourage them to talk to plaintiffs'
counsel before signing the release,'' said the spokesman, Ben
Deutsch. ``Our goal is to treat everyone who is affected by this
realignment fairly and equally.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer in New York City said such waivers were not unusual
as part of a layoff. ``It's absolutely legal,'' said Allen Fagin,
the co-chairman of the labor and employment law department at
Proskauer Rose. ``It sounds like Coke was being not only careful in
how they structured the waiver, but provided to their employees the
disclosure that was required.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees have 45 days to decide whether to sign, and seven days
to revoke their decisions, according to a sample waiver that was
attached to the motion. Executives who want to accept
early-retirement packages must sign a similar waiver.
</P>
<P>
   But because the judge in the case has not yet ruled on the
request for class-action status, employees faced with the choice
may decide the severance package is the surer thing, another lawyer
said. ``If I were counseling an African-American I would say to
leave that out, and probably not get the benefit,'' said Judith P.
Vladeck, a specialist in employment law. ``It's a little bit of a
Catch-22, because the employee at this point doesn't really know
whether he or she is part of the class, and even if he is, it
doesn't guarantee a benefit.'' The severance packages represent
``something in hand,'' while what becomes of the lawsuit is much
less clear.

JOHN HANCOCK MAKES DEBUT ON BIG BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of John Hancock Financial Services began trading modestly
on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, as expected, but
executives of the former policyholder-owned insurer got what they
most wanted: shares to use as currency to buy up competitors. And
they immediately began reviewing their shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look at anything that would help us with our lines of
variable life insurance, annuities or long-term care or mutual
funds,'' said Stephen L. Brown, the chief executive of the former
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., ``any potential
acquisitions that would help us gain scale in those businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who got the company off to a flying start with three cash
deals in the last year, said he would look mainly at potential
quarry in the United States and Canada. But he said that Hancock
also hoped to expand through acquisition in Asia, where it is
already doing business in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers for Hancock sold 102 million shares of the company at
$17 each, to raise $1.734 billion before trading began Thursday
morning. The stock opened at $17.75, rose to $18.3125 and fell back
to close at $17.625.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stock was one of the most actively traded on the Big
Board, with a turnover of more than 32 million shares. ``You
probably had a lot of what you call flippers, people who buy the
stock and sell right away if it goes up a bit, or if it doesn't go
up, sell and go on to the next deal,'' said Ira L. Zuckerman, an
analyst at Nutmeg Securities in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   By the company's calculation, the $17 a share was a little above
book value _ higher than the initial price obtained by some
competing mutual companies as they converted to shareholder
ownership, but less than the 1.5 times book value at which many
shareholder-owned companies are trading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hancock executives said they were pleased. Insurance and
banking stocks have been depressed as a result of rising interest
rates and Hancock's performance has been, like that of other mutual
companies, somewhat below the pace of the rest of the insurance
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Hancock set a price range of $16 to $18 a
share for its stock, scaling back from initial hopes of getting as
much as $25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock turned another 229.7 million shares over to its roughly
three million policyholders for their stake in the company. That
put a total of 331 million John Hancock shares, worth about $5.97
billion, into the market in the first phase of what may be an
avalanche of new insurance stocks; three other big mutual insurers
are expected to go public in the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance, for instance, is expected to issue
838 million shares with a market value of perhaps $15.92 billion in
late March.
</P>
<P>
   All those shares, in a market of insurance issues previously
valued at $90 billion, are expected to put further downward
pressure on all insurance stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lackluster price performance, Tom Burnett, the
president of Merger Insight, a financial research firm in New York,
called the Hancock offering ``a very significant financial event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are going to be a major acquirer now that they have
stock to use as currency,'' he said.

BRADLEY: ENOUGH'S ENOUGH AS PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL GOES AFTER GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATHAM, N.H. _ Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley said Thursday
he'd ``had it'' with opponent Al Gore and would no longer refrain
from the kind of attacks he has said drag down American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``After absorbing months of misleading statements and
misrepresentations, last night I decided, well, it's my turn, and I
threw a little elbow,'' the former basketball star and senator
said, referring to Wednesday's feisty debate between the Democratic
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had said for weeks that he was avoiding attacking the
vice president because noble politics required that he tell voters
what he is for, not against.
</P>
<P>
   But one day after using a televised debate to accuse Gore of
practicing dishonest campaign politics, Bradley's new refrain was:
The vice president can't be trusted to reform health care, protect
the environment or reward the public's respect if he can't be
trusted to tell the truth about Bradley in the race for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whose New Hampshire lead has largely evaporated since
Gore's decisive win in Iowa on Monday, made one of his newly
aggressive points as he stood on the icy shore of the Great Bay
estuary with environmental activists who support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a candidate doesn't take a long enough view to trust the
people by telling them the truth in a campaign, a long enough view
about democracy, how can you trust a candidate to take a long
enough enough view that will focus upon the kind of things that we
need to do now to protect our natural world for the coming
generation?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quite understand how someone can condemn so-called
negative attacks while in the next breath launching real negative
attacks himself,'' Gore told workers at Silknet, a Manchester
software developer specializing in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid and replace it
with an inadequate subsidy. That's a fact, not a negative attack,''
the candidate said. ``Senator Bradley's health care plan does not
devote a dime from the surplus to protect Medicare against the
impending doubling of Medicare recipient population when the baby
boomers retire. That's a fact, not a negative attack.``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has disputed those facts.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is usually low-key, intellectual and sometimes remote on
the campaign trail. Gore is the one known for pumping up the crowd,
pouring coffee at diners, recalling his lawmaking battles against
congressional Republicans and shadow-boxing with his election
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Bradley bagged groceries for a voter, portrayed
himself as a legislative fighter, ad-libbed jokes and tackled a few
new policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he presented a passable imitation of the daily
approach used by the more energetic and aggressive Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to workers at the Timberland outdoor apparel
headquarters, Bradley described his Wednesday night confrontation
with Gore, in which the contenders argued about which one has
deployed ``negative'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he complained about Gore's criticisms, he
linked Gore to President Richard Nixon's discredited claims of
innocence, and alleged that Gore had lied about Bradley's health
care reform proposal as well as his legislative record. Gore denied
it and said Bradley is the one who has been on the attack, in
violation of his own campaign principles.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore again pointed out that Bradley has refused his offer
for more detailed debates in lieu of 30-second TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, I'm not sure Senator Bradley wants a debate on
the substance of the issues,'' Gore said, adding that if he wins
the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, he would offer the
same challenge to his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling John McCain would say yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his continuing effort to match his lawmaking credentials with
Gore's, Bradley told the employees he led the fight in the Senate
to close income tax loopholes and develop a blueprint for
international trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In response to audience questions, Bradley tread on new policy
ground. He said the minimum wage should be raised and tied to the
average national wage, so that it floats upwards without periodic
approval from Congress. He also said the United States lacks the
resources and the wisdom to intervene in ethnic wars in other
countries, so it should fully fund the United Nations and rely on
such international organizations to deal with the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking his campaign style as well as the tone of his rhetoric,
Bradley made a few impromptu, Gore-style visits to a doughnut shop
and a supermarket, where he bagged groceries and bantered with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he showed a lot more vitality'' in the debate,
customer Sherry Taylor said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But another customer, Laura Davies, said, ``I really don't like
the confrontational stuff.'' She said that after chatting with
Bradley, she remains undecided about the primaries and may vote
Republican.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BARRON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ When the Tennessee Titans unveil their four-wide-receiver
set in Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV, the St. Louis Rams still must
worry about two of the most dangerous, prolific running backs in
the National Football League.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie George you know about. But what chills the Rams' defense
during practice sessions on these frigid January mornings is the
threat posed by the Titans' other running back _ quarterback Steve
McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a scarier weapon than Eddie George, because once Eddie
George has the ball there's not much he can do but run with the
ball,'' Rams defensive lineman D'Marco Farr said. ``When McNair
drops back, you hold your breath and just hope you can get to him
before he gets loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Good plan, since when McNair gets loose, the goal line
frequently beckons. He enters Sunday's game with 11 rushing
touchdowns _ eight during the regular season, three during the
playoffs _ despite missing five games after undergoing back surgery
following Tennessee's season-opening victory over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a running back who can throw the ball very well,'' George
said. ``He can make you miss, he can run you over, and he can spin
out of tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair came to the team then known as the Houston Oilers in 1995
with the well-earned moniker of Air McNair, based on his 14,496
career passing yards at Alcorn State. Five years later and 12
pounds heavier at 237, he brings every dimension to the game these
days except for, strangely enough, blockbuster passing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 regular-season games, McNair threw for a relatively
pedestrian 2,179 yards and 12 touchdowns with a so-so 78.6 passer
rating. He returned from surgery Oct. 31 with 186 yards and two TD
throws against the Rams and had four 200-yard passing games the
rest of the way, including a five-TD performance against
Jacksonville in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, however, he had only 76 passing yards in the
Titans' miracle win over Buffalo, 112 against Indianapolis and 112
against the Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game with his only TD
pass of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But his touchdown run against the Bills was Tennessee's only TD
of the game from scrimmage, and his 91 yards rushing against
Jacksonville tied Earl Campbell for fourth place in franchise
playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he doesn't put up Hall of Fame numbers doesn't
matter to Steve,'' Titans tight end Frank Wycheck said. ``That's
what so special about the guy. He goes out and makes big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the uncertainty that worries defenses _ and inspires
McNair himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think even McNair knows when he's going to run. It
just happens,'' Farr said. ``If he has any kind of hole or if he
sees any kind of hole, he's going to take off. His first deal is to
run. It puts so much stress on your defense, and that is what got
them to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Titans' presence in the Super Bowl continues to amaze
those who followed their star-crossed days as the Oilers, McNair's
development as a star is no surprise. He was groomed carefully and
methodically for the starting job by coach Jeff Fisher, sitting
through two years as a backup to Chris Chandler before taking over
for good in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous change from throwing for 4,000 yards a
year in college and throwing the ball at least 40 or 50 times a
game,'' he said. ``But now it's like playing in a more controlled
offense, and that's something that I had to get used to and get my
mind focused on the fact that it's something we have to do as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've come a long way from my first two years, sitting
on the sidelines and learning the game mentally. My most improved
aspect of this game has been to be a leader. I'm doing what it
takes to lead this team to victory each and every Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his undeniable physical skills, teammates think
McNair the leader may not have gotten his just due.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually no one in the huddle who's getting antsy. It's
more of a laid-back thing,'' offensive lineman Jon Runyan said.
``People are in there making jokes. But he's a quiet leader. When
the ball is snapped, you know he's going to run around and try to
make a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to have someone like that back there who
is not going to just see someone in their face and hit the deck.
He's going to run out of there, break tackles and try to get the
ball down the field, try to run the ball and get the first down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the cold can't get to him. In fact, McNair jokes that the
cold weather here this week has hastened his efforts to recover
from a nagging case of turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stick it in the cold tub every morning, and as cold as it
has been outside, I can just take my shoe off and have some extra
treatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The injured toe and the recent tendency to be more Hare and less
Air have shifted attention from another quiet milestone for the
Titans' quiet leader. He jokes mildly about being the second
quarterback from a Southwestern Athletic Conference school to start
in a Super Bowl, which is another way of saying that he is the
first black Super Bowl starter at his position since Doug Williams
of Grambling State in Super Bowl XXII with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   It is a legacy that he embraces. And it led to a special phone
conversation Wednesday night between the two trail blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Williams) told me not to go out there and do something
that I haven't been doing all year,'' McNair said. ``I should
continue to do the things I've been doing all year to get here and
not change things. He said I should go out and play my game and
don't try to force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a young guy when Doug was in the Super Bowl, but I
remember watching the game. To be the only other one to start in
the Super Bowl is a great inspiration to me. It's only happened
once, and I'm the second one. Any time you can have a long trend
like that, with a long distance from one person to another, it's
special.''

   ST. LOUIS _ In the star-crossed, luxury box revenue chasing
world of professional sports, there is nothing so fitting as this
football season's grandest spectacle, Super Bowl XXXIV, which is
not sponsored by U-Haul, but ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams vying for the NFL championship, the Tennessee Titans
and St. Louis Rams, have relocated three times, leaving rankled
fans and civic leaders in their wake in the pursuit of a
publicly-funded stadium. Each has an owner who could be described,
charitably, as colorful.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' Georgia Frontiere, the only woman to be the principal
owner of an American professional sports franchise, is a former
lounge singer who inherited the team when the sixth of her seven
husbands, Carroll Rosenbloom, drowned in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently if she felt badly for fans of the old Los Angeles
Rams abandoned in Southern California, Frontiere replied: ``The
fans there are still able to watch on television. They watched on
TV and didn't come to games anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans owner Bud Adams, a Texas oilman and a charter owner of
the renegade American Football League, once won three division
titles in four years with three different coaches and ended a
stalled negotiation with a prized lineman by throwing in a herd of
cattle as a signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get them cattle, girls, whatever it took,'' Adams said
Thursday. ``Back then, you didn't need a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, by way of Cleveland and Los Angeles, and the Titans,
via Houston and Memphis, meet Sunday in Atlanta's Georgia Dome. If
this is the Relocation Bowl I, it will be a benchmark occasion of
sorts, the crowning of a Super Bowl champion who is the paragon of
the modern, vagabond sports enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rams and Titans have shown, the curious economics of
today's pro football make it possible, even likely, a franchise
will flourish by choosing a smaller market, like Nashville or St.
Louis, over bigger ones, like Houston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While small market teams in Major League Baseball have sagged
and now find it nearly impossible to compete, in the NFL, smaller
may be better. A smaller city like Nashville was hungry for the
status a professional team can convey and happily built a $292
million stadium for Adams with taxpayers money. They also let Adams
dictate the key revenue-generating terms of his lease.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Adelphia Coliseum has 144 luxury suites, the most
precious commodity for a sports franchise owner. With billions of
dollars in national television money shared equally by NFL teams
and with a rigid salary cap restricting every team's payroll, the
rules of the game make small markets equal to their big market
brethren. With newer, more favorable lease agreements they are even
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike a baseball team, which is trying to fill its ballpark
and parking lots 81 times a year, the small market NFL team only
needs area fans and corporations to take an interest in eight home
games a year. Given the daylong carnival atmosphere that envelops
most NFL games these days, that is not asking too much.
</P>
<P>
   This model of the new commerce in sports, where NFL franchises
sell for more than $600 million, was on exhibit last weekend when
Frontiere's Rams earned their Super Bowl berth. They did so with a
victory before a sellout crowd inside the Trans World Dome, a $280
million facility built to lure a NFL franchise back to St. Louis,
which had lost its Cardinals to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking Georgia to Georgia,'' the Rams coach Dick Vermeil
shouted to the crowd in an on-the-field ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere, honored in St. Louis for bringing pro football back
to the area and active in a variety of philanthropic ventures, was
cheered by the Rams fans in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta this week, Frontiere has kept a low profile and not
appeared with the team or during the many press conferences
orchestrated by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil has occasionally spoken for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been a wonderful owner, wonderful to me and my staff
and our families,'' the coach said. ``She has done whatever it took
to make this franchise a winner and she deserves credit for that.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Frontiere, whose exact age is not known although she is believed
to be in her early 70s, has been vilified for leaving Los Angeles
in the Southern California newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Frontiere owned the Rams, they had established a
standard for the carpetbagging sports franchise. In 1946, as league
champions, they deserted Cleveland and relocated to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Years before baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers or basketball's
Minneapolis Lakers went west, the Rams became a Hollywood
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their running back star Elroy ``Crazy Legs'' Hirsch was
recruited by movie directors and a linebacker, Mike Henry, played
Tarzan. Their T-formation quarterback Bob Waterfield married the
starlet Jane Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team flights were events by themselves,'' said Rams
quarterback Roman Gabriel of the Rams' Hollywood halcyon days.
``You would just wait to see if Jane was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams became such a hot property that Rosenbloom, who owned
the storied Baltimore Colts, swapped his Colts for the Rams in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   On Apr. 2, 1979, the Rams were nine months away from their first
Super Bowl appearance when Rosenbloom drowned swimming in the ocean
by himself. Because Rosenbloom was known as a strong swimmer, there
were rumors of foul play and a series of celebrated investigations,
but the case has remained officially an accidental drowning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams moved from Los Angeles' Memorial Coliseum to Anaheim
Stadium 35 miles away and had several winning playoff seasons. But
Frontiere had fired most of her former husband's football
executives and her management style was erratic. She once told a
gathering of fans that she consulted an astrologer on player
trades.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Rams had lost 10 or more games for five consecutive
years. Although there was a ``Save the Rams'' movement in the Los
Angeles area, Frontiere took her team home to St. Louis, where a
new domed stadium awaited with a sweetheart lease.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams then lost every season in St. Louis far more than they
won, until this season's magical ride to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lesson in perseverance,'' Vermeil said of the Rams
saga.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the result in St. Louis is a misplaced mix of
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Trans World Dome, they have a sort of Football Hall
of Fame. But it is half St. Louis and half Rams, so Hirsch, who
played in Los Angeles, is next to Larry Wilson, the Cardinals
safety who played in St. Louis. Before last Sunday's playoff game,
Lawrence McCutcheon, the former Los Angeles Rams star, was a
ceremonial captain on the field with Dan Dierdorf, the ex-Cardinals
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Whose team is this anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That's today's NFL, you can't know your franchise's history
without an atlas.
</P>
<P>
   Adams knows as much. Thursday, he talked about his 40 years in
pro football and made no apologies for turning his players into
gypsies who jumped from Houston to Memphis in 1997, then to
Nashville's Vanderbilt University football stadium in 1998 before
settling into Adelphia Coliseum this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we had to do, I didn't want to leave Houston,''
Adams said. ``But we couldn't get the revenue we could with a new
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   While the move has been prosperous and the Titans have made it
to the Super Bowl _ something the Oilers never did _ Adams Thursday
almost seemed to bemoan the loss of innocence in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   He told a story of how he negotiated with players, baiting them
with stacks of money in his desk. He would place $100 bills on the
top of several piles of $1 bills to coax players to sign. Adams,
who like Yankees owner George Steinbrenner attended Culver Military
Academy, also used to take media relations into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bashed a reporter in the jaw back in '62,'' he said. ``You
can't do that these days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams did watch one of his assistant coaches, Buddy Ryan,
throw a punch at another assistant coach, Kevin Gilbride, during a
game. And he had a head coach, Jerry Glanville, who left Oilers
tickets at will call for Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've seen a lot in 40 years,'' Adams said Thursday.
``I've seen the game change. I can't say it's changed for the
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I know where we were. And look where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, where Adams's team used to be, fans of the old
Oilers said they would be rooting hard for the Titans on Sunday,
though not for their owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Oilers,'' said Marcus Ramirez, a patron at Champs
Americana, a popular sports bar. ``I hate the owner, Bud Adams.
He's the one person I'd want to fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people wearing old Oilers jackets. Until we get our
own team again in Houston, everyone will be pulling out the stops
for the Titans.''

ONE RAM'S CLIMB: NOT QUITE TO THE TOP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Trent Green is the St. Louis Rams' forgotten man. He
is the flip side of Kurt Warner and his amazing story, a resident
of a terrible parallel world where the want of an inch, here or
there, results in disappointment and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Green, the 29-year-old quarterback who was going to be the Rams'
starter, was injured last summer in a preseason game against the
San Diego Chargers. When he went down, the Rams' players, fans and
management felt cursed. No one knew this was a blessing in
disguise. Isaac Bruce, the fleet wide receiver, slammed his helmet
on the turf; Dick Vermeil, the head coach, wept the next day, and
St. Louis mourned.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later Bruce is Pro Bowl-bound, Vermeil is the
National Football League's coach of the year, and St. Louis is
floating on gossamer wings.
</P>
<P>
   And Kurt Warner, the former Arena League and NFL Europe
quarterback, is the Super Bowl Cinderella. ``I don't think anybody
could have predicted the type of season he had,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The maddening question for Green is whether the Rams would have
reached the Super Bowl had he not injured his knee.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to suggest that Green would have been as
successful as Warner; no other quarterback in the NFL this season
has done as well as Warner. Green enjoyed a good preseason, that's
all. Before that, he was just another quarterback teetering on the
brink between permanent journeyman and starter.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who went to high school in St. Louis, was drafted out of
Indiana University in 1993 by San Diego. In the 1994 season, the
Chargers went to the Super Bowl, but Green spent that year in the
Canadian Football League and the next four seasons with the
Washington Redskins. Green did not attempt a pass or start a game
until 1997, when he did both for Washington, starting one game and
throwing one pass. An incompletion. In 1998, he started 14 of 15
games for Washington, passing for 3,441 yards and 23 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a four-year, $16.5 million free-agent deal with St.
Louis last February and prepared for a fabulous homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams made all the right moves: they signed offensive lineman
Adam Timmerman, acquired the elusive Marshall Faulk in a trade and
drafted receiver Torry Holt. Green enjoyed a marvelous preseason,
completing 28 of 32 passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all falling into place really nice; unfortunately I
wasn't able to finish,'' Green said. ``That makes it tough to deal
with: going home, the high expectations and the way we got
everything turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's season ended on Aug. 28 when the Chargers' Rodney
Harrison rolled up on the back of Green's left knee, tearing a
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Green if he thought the Rams would be in the Super
Bowl if he were the quarterback. ``I think so,'' he said. ``I was
feeling real confident. I was playing as well as I've ever played.
The preseason was going extremely well for me when I got hurt, and
I think the offense was doing extremely well. To say I would have
the same type of numbers that Kurt put up this year, I can't say.
Maybe they're worse numbers, maybe they're better. But I did feel I
was playing well, and I think the team would have been successful
if I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Green has given up on the idea of being the starter in
St. Louis. Warner earned it. ``It's not realistic at all,'' Green
said. ``I'd be kidding myself if I thought that coming into
training camp it would be an open competition. A guy plays as well
as Kurt has, one of the best single seasons in NFL history, and
he's the MVP, there's just no way he doesn't go into the season as
a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Green says all the right things _ and at an intellectual level,
believes what he says. Still, ``I would love an opportunity to play
for the Rams,'' he said. ``But I also want an opportunity to start
in this league. I've proven that I can be a successful starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the organization has to decide is if they're going to
keep me to be the backup. Obviously you never know on what play a
season-ending injury might happen. So from an organizational
standpoint, they need to determine if they want to keep both of us,
or if there is an opportunity for me to start out there if they're
going to trade me, or do whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Zygmunt, the Rams' executive vice president, admitted that
the situation was awkward. ``We expect to have both under contract
next year. We'd like the ability to have depth at that position,''
he said. ``While it might be awkward, we feel it's a pretty good
problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe for the organization. But for Green, the injury and
Warner's success and acclaim have made this Super Bowl the most
bittersweet experience of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely mixed emotions,'' Green said. ``You have times
when you do the `what if' thing, but you can't afford to dwell on
that. You have to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like an opportunity to start somewhere. I'm not one to
make demands, stomp my feet and pound the table and that kind of
thing. I'm not going to demand anything. We've agreed that after
the season we'll sit down and talk about what the organization
wants to do, what I want to do and just see what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As Green fielded question after question and dug deep for new
ways to express his joy and frustration, someone wondered if he had
divined a lesson in this setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure it out, because I thought I had
paid my dues up to this point,'' he said. ``I didn't know I had any
more to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the lesson.

RUSSIANS AGREE TO END PARLIAMENT WALKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Leaders of three Russian political parties agreed
Thursday to end their boycott of the Russian Parliament on Feb. 9,
thereby avoiding an open-ended confrontation with the acting
president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his parliamentary allies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin had interceded in the parliamentary dispute earlier this
week by meeting separately with two former prime ministers, Yevgeny
M. Primakov and Sergei V. Kiriyenko. The men, together with Grigory
A. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko party, led a
parliamentary walkout last week to protest what they called
strong-arm tactics by Kremlin tacticians.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parties headed by Primakov, Kiriyenko and Yavlinsky
together control about 140 of 450 seats, they had been allotted
chairmanships of only two of Parliament's 27 committees.
</P>
<P>
   With their walkout, they had hoped to create a parallel rump
parliament. While that effort turned out to be short-lived, the
leaders suggested Thursday that their protest had fulfilled its
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider that it is now clear to all, what kind of majority
has formed in the Duma,'' Yavlinsky said, referring to the lower
house of the Russian Legislature, ``what position is taken by the
president's administration, and what position is taken by the
acting president. At this stage, we have done all that we could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   By joining with the Communist Party, a pro-Putin faction known
as Unity was able to put together a blocking majority. Until the
resignation of President Boris N. Yeltsin on Dec. 31, the
Communists had the largest parliamentary faction and were the core
of anti-Kremlin opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between Unity and the Communists was seen as an
effort by Putin _ now the clear favorite in March 26 presidential
elections _ to bring Parliament under his control. But in a
television interview aired last Sunday, Putin insisted that the
arrangement with the Communists had been strictly temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Putin this week sought to defuse a political crisis that in the
opinion of many political analysts was caused by tactical blunders
by top Kremlin staffers emboldened by Unity's surprisingly strong
showing in parliamentary elections on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko, leader of the Union of Right Forces, a party of
liberal economists, was the first to seek a compromise with Unity,
after meeting with Putin. Thursday, he said he would have led his
party back into Parliament if he had not given his word to stand
firm with Primakov, leader of the Fatherland-All Russia faction,
and Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Members of another parliamentary faction that had participated
in the walkout last week, so-called regional deputies led by Oleg
Morozov, returned to their seats earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Putin, Kiriyenko said he had been assured
that the government would press ahead with reform legislation,
including a bill to amend Russia's tax code, labor and land laws.
But so far, Putin has not committed himself publicly to any
specific legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, the opposition leaders were pressing
for a compromise that would create new legislative committees and
chairmanships, but that idea has been rejected by the parliamentary
speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov.

 &HT;    GORE WINS PRAISE IN CLINTON SPEECH
 &HT;    With UNION. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ President Clinton's State of the Union
address Thursday night heaped praise on Vice President Al Gore and
championed some of the proposals the vice president has advanced in
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a big part of this presidency,'' explained
Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta. ``We'll have the biggest
economic expansion in the nation's history. Al Gore is a big part
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those helping to write the speech was Bob Shrum, a White
House consultant who also is one of the vice president's chief
advisers, charged with fashioning the Gore campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly in his speech, the president proposed that
``we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion'' to expand federal
programs aimed at expanding health care insurance coverage to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's sharpest criticism of Gore in the Democratic
primary campaign has been that the vice president's health care
proposal merely ``nibbles at the edges'' of the problem of health
care for children in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The president also included Gore's proposal to cover
prescription drug costs under the federal Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   And he saluted Gore's wife, Tipper, for her role in trying to
improve coverage of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised Gore's efforts in connecting classrooms to
the Internet, noting the progress in that effort from 3 percent in
1994 to more than 50 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited Gore's key role as the Senate voted to ``face down
the gun lobby'' in an effort to close loopholes in the sale of
guns, an initiative prompted by the student shooting tragedy at
Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He also credited the vice president's role in the
administration's economic and environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for the opportunity the vice president and I
have had to work hard to protect the environment and finally to put
to rest the notion that we can't expand the economy while
protecting the environment,'' he said.

HOME OFFICE ISN'T LIABILITY FOR FIRMS, U.S. DECIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Labor Department said this week that employers would not be
held liable for any health and safety violations occurring in the
homes of telecommuting employees.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department officials announced this policy clarification
after the department sent out mixed signals in recent months over
whether U.S. companies could be fined thousands of dollars for
safety violations at the homes of the nation's estimated 20 million
telecommuters, who use computers and modems to do work outside the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mixed signals was a letter that was sent in November
by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration to a Texas
credit services company stating that companies would be held
responsible for federal health and safety violations in the homes
of employees working at home.
</P>
<P>
   That letter alarmed thousands of corporate executives and
angered many lawmakers, especially Republicans, who raised the
specter of Big Brother banging on doors to examine whether chair
seats were too high or keyboards too low.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early January, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman created
further confusion by issuing a statement that partly backed off
from the November letter.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became an embarrassment to the Clinton administration
and Republicans were using it against Vice President Al Gore,
asserting that the Labor Department had adopted the policy to
please Gore's powerful union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jeffress, the director of OSHA, an arm of the Labor
Department, took pains to reassure employers in testimony he was to
give to Congress on Wednesday, although the testimony was delayed
because of the snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's clarifications were first reported in
Thursday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Occupational Safety and Health Act does not
apply to an employee's house or furnishings,'' Jeffress said in his
prepared testimony. ``OSHA will not hold employers liable for work
activities in employees' home offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that his agency had sowed some confusion on the
matter, Jeffress added that OSHA did not expect employers to
inspect home offices and that OSHA did not and would not inspect
home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, vice president for labor affairs for the United
States Chamber of Commerce, applauded the policy clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' he said, adding that the
chamber would like to see legislation barring the government from
ever holding employers liable for home-office safety.
</P>
<P>
   In its policy clarification, the Labor Department has sought to
balance century-old concerns about the dangers of blue-collar
workers' sewing and doing other manufacturing work at home against
the privacy concerns of the growing number of white-collar
telecommuters.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress made clear in his testimony that the Labor Department
would hold employers responsible for health and safety violations
that occur in home workplaces other than home offices, for example,
in homes where employers ask employees to work with hazardous
materials.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an incident in which 17 workers were injured in 1998
when fireworks being manufactured in a California home exploded and
destroyed the house.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress also cited disclosures last year that a dozen Silicon
Valley electronics manufacturers had assigned assembly piece work
to employees working at home. Those operations often involved using
lead solder and acid flux, which sometimes produced dangerous
soldering fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress said, ``Where work other than office work is performed
at home, such as manufacturing operations, employers are
responsible for hazardous materials, equipment or work processes,
which they provide or require to be used in an employee's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department officials said OSHA would conduct inspections
of hazardous home workplaces only when the agency received a
complaint or a referral.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress said, ``The bottom line is, as it has always been, that
OSHA will respect the privacy of the home and expects that
employers will as well.''

 &HT;    GORE WINS PRAISE IN CLINTON SPEECH
 &HT;    With UNION. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ President Clinton's State of the Union
address Thursday night heaped praise on Vice President Al Gore and
championed some of the proposals the vice president has advanced in
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a big part of this presidency,'' explained
Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta. ``We'll have the biggest
economic expansion in the nation's history. Al Gore is a big part
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those helping to write the speech was Bob Shrum, a White
House consultant who also is one of the vice president's chief
advisers, charged with fashioning the Gore campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly in his speech, the president proposed that
``we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion'' to expand federal
programs aimed at expanding health care insurance coverage to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's sharpest criticism of Gore in the Democratic
primary campaign has been that the vice president's health care
proposal merely ``nibbles at the edges'' of the problem of health
care for children in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The president also included Gore's proposal to cover
prescription drug costs under the federal Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   And he saluted Gore's wife, Tipper, for her role in trying to
improve coverage of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised Gore's efforts in connecting classrooms to
the Internet, noting the progress in that effort from 3 percent in
1994 to more than 50 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited Gore's key role as the Senate voted to ``face down
the gun lobby'' in an effort to close loopholes in the sale of
guns, an initiative prompted by the student shooting tragedy at
Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He also credited the vice president's role in the
administration's economic and environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for the opportunity the vice president and I
have had to work hard to protect the environment and finally to put
to rest the notion that we can't expand the economy while
protecting the environment,'' he said.

SARA LEE SETS TIMETABLE FOR SHIFT IN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ John H. Bryan, the longtime top executive at Sara Lee
who helped transform the company into one of the world's largest
consumer packaged goods concerns, said Thursday that he would step
down as chief executive in July.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sara Lee have been suffering for more than a year,
partly because of weakness in a mature food and consumer products
industry. But Bryan, whose tenure of 25 years as chief executive is
one of the longest at a major U.S. corporation, said Thursday that
the recent performance of Sara Lee Corp. was solid and that his
departure was part of a succession plan put in place three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I would retire at 65, and it seems to me this
is a fairly orderly way to do it,'' said Bryan, 63. ``I've never
felt better. The management is in good shape, and the company is
performing at a very high level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan will remain chairman until he retires in October 2001. The
chief executive duties will be assumed by C. Steven McMillan, Sara
Lee's 54-year-old president and chief operating officer, who has
worked under Bryan for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the decision, saying it was indicative of a
company that charted a cautious and predictable course of solid
earnings growth throughout Bryan's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a revolution at this company; things
evolve,'' said William Maguire, an analyst at Wassterstein Perella
Securities. ``McMillan is a fine operator, adroit politically.''
Maguire added, though, that the new chief executive would probably
look at whether Sara Lee had the right structure for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sara Lee, based in Chicago, fell 37.5 cents Thursday,
to $18.4375.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan will take over a $20 billion conglomerate that owns
brands like Hanes underwear, Playtex bras, Coach leather goods,
Ball Park hot dogs and Sara Lee baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   When Bryan became chief executive in 1975, the company was
called Consolidated Foods and had revenue of about $2.4 billion.
Now, after a series of big acquisitions, Sara Lee has leading
brands in everything from coffee and tea to cosmetics and
pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company has had a string of quarters with
double-digit percentile earnings growth, it stumbled badly last
year after a huge recall of bacteria-tainted hot dogs resulted in
millions of dollars of write-offs and a battery of lawsuits. Shares
of Sara Lee are down more than 35 percent the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings growth has since strengthened, but analysts say an
important question is whether Sara Lee has the right mix of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee's meat division has struggled the last year, while
branded goods, including L'eggs pantyhose and Coach accessories,
have recorded strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said he was not looking to make any major changes, and
the fact that Sara Lee is a huge conglomerate may rule out a big
merger in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee will grow through takeovers, he said. The company,
which recently bought Chock Full o'Nuts, the coffee marketer, said
its year, which ends in July, should be among its most acquisitive.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, a graduate of Rhodes College in Mississippi, came to Sara
Lee from Bryan Foods, a company begun by his father. He has been
active in the arts in Chicago and was an early supporter of
President Clinton. In 1992, he was considered a candidate for
commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan has an undergraduate degree from Auburn University and
an MBA from Harvard Business School. He began his career at
McKinsey &AMP; Co. in Chicago. He joined Sara Lee in 1976 and has run
nearly every division.

JUDGE SAYS `MEGAN'S LAW' MUST TIGHTEN NOTIFICATION DATA ON SEX
OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ New Jersey, one of the first states to
require that the public be alerted to the presence of paroled sex
offenders, now appears to be the first to face a new type of legal
hurdle: a ruling that its ``Megan's Law'' is failing to keep
information about the offenders from reaching people not entitled
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a two-and-a-half-year-old lawsuit by the New Jersey
public defender, long a foe of the 1994 law, a federal judge in
Camden said this week that New Jersey's rules on public
notification infringed on the privacy rights of some paroled sex
offenders by not preventing the unauthorized disclosure of their
names, addresses and other personal information to people not
legally authorized to have it.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Joseph E. Irenas of U.S. District Court, ordered the
state's attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., to redraw those
rules, and suggested that the law could eventually be found
unconstitutional if the revised rules failed to ``reasonably limit
disclosure to those entitled to receive it.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued Tuesday, means that New Jersey's law,
already one of the nation's most restrictive on public
notification, must be tightened further. Other states have far more
leeway in alerting the public; Connecticut, for example, posts the
names and addresses of all paroled sex offenders on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws have been unsuccessfully challenged in many states,
including New Jersey, on the ground that they are unconstitutional
because they impose an additional punishment on offenders who have
already served their time. This week's ruling is believed to be the
first to address contentions that unauthorized public warnings
violate the privacy rights of the parolees, lawyers for both sides
said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Thursday that they had not decided whether
to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas accepted the argument by a deputy public defender,
Michael Z. Buncher, that the state's current rules on public
notification failed to protect the rights of 45 paroled offenders.
Buncher had contended that their names, addresses, photographs and
other information had been improperly posted in fliers in day care
centers and schools, and on telephone poles and church bulletin
boards, as well as printed in newspapers and given to people,
including children, not authorized by county judges or prosecutors
to receive the information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one case Irenas cited, the child of a school principal took
home a flier about an offender distributed at the child's school,
and the principal then took the flier to her school and improperly
distributed it to parents.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas said the 45 cases violated notification restrictions that
the New Jersey Supreme Court imposed in 1995 when it upheld the
constitutionality of the law. New Jersey's Legislature passed the
law in October 1994 during a public furor over the murder of Megan
Kanka, 7, by a twice-convicted sex offender who lived near her home
in Hamilton Township, near Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the law permitted communitywide notification about
the parolees living in towns. The 1995 ruling banned such broad
alerts and ordered restrictions intended to achieve a better
balance between privacy rights and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, information about offenders whom prosecutors
deemed at the greatest risk of committing a new sex crime could be
circulated to immediate neighbors, schools, day care centers,
shelters for women and other organizations that cared for women and
children. Notifications about those considered moderate risks was
limited to schools, day care centers and women's shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 decision also tightened the guidelines used to classify
offenders as high and moderate risks. Because of those changes,
almost two-thirds of paroled sex offenders in New Jersey are
classified now as low risks and no information about them or their
whereabouts can be distributed to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and New York allow far broader distribution of
information about paroled sex offenders. For the last year, the
names of all those in Connecticut have been available on the
Internet, regardless of the risk they pose, said the state's
attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. He said two parolees had
challenged the Internet site in court on various constitutional
grounds. Connecticut's law also allows anyone to inspect
directories listing all sex offenders at all local police stations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, directories of high-risk offenders are
available to anyone at local police stations. New York state also
operates a telephone database that provides a caller information
about a high-risk offender if the caller provides the parolee's
name and address.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas said the attorney general's office had done an
``admirable'' job of addressing various state and federal court
rulings that have ordered revisions to the law. He also said it was
impossible to prevent all unauthorized disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   . ``A system of distributing this information with zero leakage
to unauthorized people is, in reality, unattainable,'' the judge
said. ``However, the mandate for the attorney general is not to
devise a perfect system but one calculated to achieve the goals of
the statute without unreasonably impinging on the nontrivial
privacy rights'' of parolees.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas criticized the existing rules because, he said, they did
not guarantee a uniform method of distributing notifications in New
Jersey's 21 counties. He also noted that no New Jersey judge had
found anyone in contempt of court for improperly circulating
information about a parolee, even though state officials overseeing
the law have routinely said that contempt citations were the best
way to prevent improper disclosures.

SPORTS COLUMN: DRAFT CHOICE TERMINATES BORDER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's not nominate Bill Parcells and Robert K. Kraft for the
Nobel Peace Prize for speaking to each other on the telephone. They
were just playing out the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Bill Belichick slugged the Jets' organization in the
solar plexus with his resignation this month, it has been a matter
of ``Show me the draft choices.''
</P>
<P>
   All the meetings and all the legal briefs were just Xs and Os _
dust on a chalkboard. The judge could have giggled when Belichick's
lawyers claimed his contract was invalid. It was up to Parcells to
identify himself on the telephone as Darth Vader and for Kraft to
know exactly who it was.
</P>
<P>
   Because of guy-stuff machinations like this, the Jets have been
the most entertaining team in pro football this month, even more
exciting than the Rams and the Titans, who will meet in the Super
Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For all the legal maneuvering, it was essentially a foregone
conclusion. Coaches with good reputations do not languish in
never-never land. They move to the next job, as soon as the lawyers
work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   This does not necessarily mean that all sporting contracts are
worthless. Players are not going to be able to jump while they
still have contracts, because a team can live with a player who
feels used. They just tell him, ``Take it out on the other team,
big fella.''
</P>
<P>
   In football, however, when a coach blows the whistle and demands
a few gassers at the end of practice, he'd better not show
indifference on his face. Yes, it's a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I want to see Bill Belichick out of coaching?'' Parcells
asked magnanimously Thursday. ``No, but he probably could have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that if he had not called Kraft on Tuesday night,
Belichick would have been out of work. Belichick more or less
agreed with that last evening when he said, ``The opportunity to be
coaching was something I wasn't sure I'd have 24 hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, however, did not put Parcells up for any humanitarian
award. The fact is, Parcells wore out his welcome with the Giants
and the Patriots because of his needs and his ego, and he
understood the power play Belichick set in motion. In his own
strong-willed way, Parcells probably respected Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got a real good man in Bill Belichick,'' Parcells
said about his former assistant who was finally named coach and
general manager in New England last evening. ``We both realize this
is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells showed his shrewdness by trying to wait out Belichick's
appeal for liberty. Then he called Kraft, with whom he had not
spoken in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good businessman,'' Parcells said Thursday of Kraft.
``Regardless of what went on in the past, if he sees a good deal,
he's going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells characterized the first-round draft choice as a
nonentity _ the 16th-best college senior in the next draft. The
most recent nonentity chosen 16th was Jevon Kearse from Florida,
who may be noticed on Sunday flinging various Rams around from his
position on the Titans' defensive line. Nevertheless, Parcells
would like it to seem that he held out for this high-draft choice
strictly on principle.
</P>
<P>
   There were no innocents in this confrontation. Belichick had
been turned off by the hasty events after the last game of the
season, when Parcells abruptly retired as head coach only to stay
on as chief football executive. It did not escape Belichick that
the suddenness of the move corresponded with Pete Carroll's being
dismissed in New England, and that he had been capitulated into
honoring his contract to coach the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft had been second-guessing himself ever since he and the
obstreperous Parcells butted heads three years ago. Thursrday
Parcells said it was time to end this ``border war'' and he
conceded, ``Hey, there were a few things I could have done
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hard feelings toward Parcells, Kraft had not
thought it appropriate to retain Belichick as head coach, but now
he has followed his original instincts. The Jets go forward with Al
Groh, and the Patriots move forward with Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound sentimental to say Belichick wanted to go ``home''
but he and his wife, Debby, have moved eight times in his career,
and their house in Nantucket, Mass., has become the family retreat.
Belichick will be making far more money in New England than he
would have been as head coach with the Jets. He will also be far
from the turbulent shadow of the man who calls himself Darth Vader,
but is only joking, you understand.

BANK OF SCOTLAND SWEETENS OFFER FOR NATIONAL WESTMINSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Hoping to bolster its bid for National Westminster
Bank, the Bank of Scotland said Thursday that it would sweeten its
24.8 billion pound offer for NatWest, Britain's third-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish bank, which is competing with its in Edinburgh
rival, the Royal Bank of Scotland, for control of NatWest, said it
would improve its hostile bid by replacing a special dividend with
a guaranteed special stock unit, effectively raising the bid's
value to 29.2 billion pounds, or $47.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NatWest, which wants to remain independent, rejected Bank of
Scotland's latest offer. ``This is nothing more than tactical
maneuvering by a bank that is struggling to achieve credibility for
an inadequate and risky proposal,'' said Sir David Rowland,
chairman and chief executive of NatWest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the move may still force Royal Bank of Scotland to increase
its (PS)26.5 billion bid, which now trails the bid of its rival.
Both banks have been scrambling to win shareholder support before
the deadline expires Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland replaced a 120 pence special dividend once it
sold several NatWest assets with a stock unit worth a guaranteed
126 pence. Because Bank of Scotland's original special dividend was
contingent on the sale of several NatWest assets, many shareholders
and investors did not include the dividend in the offer price. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Explaining his sweetened offer, Sir John Shaw, governor of the
Bank of Scotland, said, ``In making this new offer we are pleased
to be able to remove uncertainty as to the value and timing of our
proposed special dividend and to provide more value to NatWest
shareholders.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that they had expected Royal Bank to win the
bruising bidding war, but that Thursday's move by Bank of Scotland
kept it in contention. ``It seems to have gone down well with the
institutional investors,'' said Tom Rayner, an analyst at SG
Securities in London. ``It gives their offer a lot more
certainty.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent shares of all three banks up. Bank of Scotland's
latest move is expected to raise the ante for NatWest. ``I wouldn't
rule out both Scotts increasing their offers,'' Rayner said. ``At
the very least, Royal Bank needs to find 2 billion pounds over the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, independence remains a possibility for NatWest. &QL;

IN TWILIGHT OF PRESIDENCY, CLINTON REMAINS PRIMARY FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ That was not an optical illusion Thursday night.
Bill Clinton still does hold center stage in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in his presidency, Clinton's State of the Union
address has competed with compelling events offstage: the O.J.
Simpson civil trial, the first suggestions that Clinton had had an
affair with a White House intern, his impeachment and trial, and
now the presidential campaign to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   But with candidates braving chill winds and snowy streets in New
Hampshire and with voters preparing to make their selections in the
first primary, the president's annual report to the nation was also
a reminder that, even in his twilight, Clinton remains the central
figure in the nation's politics _ shaping the substance of the new
presidential contest, affecting the tone of the political debate,
coloring his vice president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And though the 2000 campaign is being conducted in a different
millennium from Clinton's breakthrough in 1992 and his reelection
in 1996, there was a whiff of familiarity to the proceedings, which
were breathtaking in length and in detail even by Clinton's own
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The principal economic issue on the campaign trail is how to
sustain the boom that began in Clinton's first term. The principal
moral issue is how to wipe away the tarnish that Clinton's private
comportment put on the White House. The principal domestic issue is
how to address the health-care problems that first became
incendiary during the early years of the Clinton presidency. The
top political issue is how to deal with the campaign-finance
scandals that flowered during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's address was full of the broad declarations of
principle _ a ``more perfect union,'' in the president's paraphrase
of the preamble to the Constitution, for example _ and the precise
policy prescriptions. _ to include prescription drug benefits for
seniors on Medicare _ that have become standard fare for a Clinton
address to Congress and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The destiny of the president's plans for a $110 billion plan to
broaden health-care coverage, a $30 billion package of college tax
breaks and scholarship aid, and the patients' bill of rights _ all
proposals being pressed by a president with his eyes on his legacy
_ will be determined by a Republican-controlled Congress with its
eyes instead on the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Americans the president was addressing Thursday
night, none has more riding on Clinton than the man who sat behind
him and just over his shoulder. Vice President Al Gore slogged
through a full day of campaigning in New Hampshire before speeding
back to Washington; he knew that his presence on television
throughout a Capitol Hill spectacle that lasted more than an hour
was worth more than a town meeting in Derry or a stroll around the
Green in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big focus this week is on New Hampshire, but the State of
the Union still takes place on the greatest podium in the world,''
said Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican. ``The president
has the Republicans at his feet, he's proposing popular programs,
and the economy is in good shape. All that has got to help Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans by a substantial margin believe that, in the long run,
the accomplishments of the Clinton administration will outweigh its
failures. When the Pew Research Center surveyed Americans on that
question this month, 51 percent agreed, with 37 percent in
disagreement. Gore has floated in and out of the president's orbit
since he began his presidential campaign, but in recent weeks, as
he has appeared before Democratic loyalists, he has once again
moved closer to Clinton. Thursday night, on television, the
distance between them could be measured in quarters of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a lame duck, it is the last year of his term, his
party doesn't control Congress, and a lot of the things he is
talking about are designed to assist his loyal vice president,''
said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a political scientist at the University
of Pennsylvania. ``He can help Gore, especially with minority
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore apparently agrees. Earlier this month, during a
presidential debate in Des Moines, former senator Bill Bradley of
New Jersey challenged Gore to demand that Clinton sign an executive
order banning racial profiling. Gore bellowed back that Clinton's
record with minority voters spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Clinton's rhetoric Thursday night matched his vice
president's. Throughout the campaign, and again in a Manchester,
N.H., debate Thursday night, Gore has spoken of Social Security and
Medicare. And so when the president said his new ``investment''
proposals and tax-cut plan should be considered ``only in the
context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life
of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt,''
he was singing from the Gore campaign hymnal.

CLINTON PROPOSES $350   BILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Basking in the nation's vibrant economy, President
Clinton Thursday night offered Americans a $350 billion tax cut,
urged generous new spending on a host of domestic initiatives, and
proposed licensing handguns ``to make this country the safest big
country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final State of the Union address, Clinton appealed to
Congress for a bipartisan effort to pass a package of ideas
``worthy of a great nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,''
Clinton said in an advance text of his speech. ``Never before has
our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress
with so little internal crisis or so few external threats.''
</P>
<P>
   The televised speech carried a heavy nostalgic and historic
tone, as the president laid out an ambitious agenda for the final
lap of what has been a tumultuous, two-term presidency. This one,
the White House hopes, will be a victory lap for a president eager
to seal his legacy and advance his policy agenda. It could also
boost the presidential candidacy of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's proposals will face a tough road in a Congress
controlled by Republicans who want to regain the White House, they
were nevertheless ambitious and included targeted tax cuts,
expanded health-care coverage, incentives to develop new vaccines,
and measures intended to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While crime has dropped steadily for the last seven years,
``nobody believes America is safe enough,'' Clinton said. ``So
let's set a higher goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been reluctant in the past to push for handgun
licensing, saying it would never get past Congress. But after
several gun-related tragedies, including the Columbine High School
massacre last April, the administration has put a greater emphasis
on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was in stark contrast to last year's. In 1999, a
battered Clinton, fresh from being impeached by the House and in
the midst of being tried by the Senate, was faced with a country
and a Congress emotionally and politically wounded from the Monica
S. Lewinsky episode.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night featured another side of Clinton: that of the
survivor, a man whose political career has endured and even
flourished despite scandals, foreign policy crises, and legislative
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   The president took advantage of perhaps his single greatest
success _ the robust economy _ to remind Americans that they could
afford to help the poor, protect the environment, and develop new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   When he first took office, Clinton said, ``it was not clear to
most Americans that there would be much to celebrate in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to
set things right,'' Clinton added. ``We restored the vital center,
replacing outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic,
enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and
a community of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ideas in Clinton's speech _ such as the patient's
bill of rights and his desire to increase the minimum wage _ have
been put forth before, without being passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enormous budget surplus, Clinton faces a tough fight
getting his agenda passed by the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government,'' said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
Republican of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the GOP response to the president, Senators Susan
Collins of Maine and Bill Frist of Tennessee promised Republicans
would put education first on their agenda, protect Medicare and
Social Security, reduce taxes, and build a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good education is the ladder of opportunity,'' Collins said.
``It turns dreams into reality. That's why education is at the top
of the Republican agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, said, ``I think
the president's agenda has a fighting chance in this Congress. I
doubt the Republican majority wants the distinction of having
presided over the mother-of-all `do-nothing' Congresses. For
Republicans to have any sort of a record to run on, they'll have to
work with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton laid out a strong agenda that is good for
the country and good for Massachusetts,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy. Kennedy has been the leading Capitol Hill force behind
many of the president's proposals, and would carry much of the
burden in getting them passed.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut, totaling about $350 billion, includes easing of the
so-called marriage penalty, in which two working spouses end up
paying more in taxes than if they had filed separate returns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton plan, married, working couples would be able
to take a standard deduction twice as much as the single filer
deduction. More than 9 million married couples would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Further, by 2005, the personal deduction for taxpayers would
increase by $500 for couples and $250 for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the tax plan is aimed at low-income Americans. One
provision would create retirement savings accounts for low-income
families, with the government offering a 2-for-1 match for the
first $100 contributed by each individual. The plan also would
expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   For wealthier taxpayers, the plan includes tax breaks and
incentives to encourage charitable giving, including a provision to
allow taxpayers to deduct gifts to charity from their gross income,
even if they do notitemize.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the $350 billion, 10-year tax cut would actually cost
the federal government $250 billion, said Gene Sperling, director
of the National Economic Council, because it would be offset by the
closing of loopholes in corporate taxes. Congress has in the past
rejected White House efforts to close such provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for a long list of social policy
initiatives. Remarking on the success of Boston's gun-tracing
program, Clinton proposed a federal version so US agents can trace
the origin of a gun used during a crime. The president also
proposed a $280 million expansion of the federal firearms
enforcement program, as well as a $10 million investment to fund
``smart guns,'' weapons that can be discharged only after the user
``unlocks'' it with a code. The idea is to keep guns from being
fired accidentally, especially by children.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs include a total of $4.5 billion in education
programs, including money to vastly expand the Head Start program,
which helps needy pre-school children; new funds to hire 100,000
more teachers and improve training; an expansion of an after-school
program for struggling schools; and money for a program focused on
teacher accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of higher education, Clinton proposed a $31 billion
plan to help people afford college, as he already had announced.
Much of that money would fund a $10,000 personal tax deduction to
pay for higher education.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Clinton proposed making China's Most Favored
Nation trading status permanent. He also outlined providing $1
billion in tax credits to help developing countries combat disease.
The money would be used as an incentive to develop vaccines against
malaria and tuberculosis, and to help people who have AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The State of the Union address, somewhat political in the best
of years, takes on an overtly political tone in a campaign year.
This year was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who took a break from campaigning in New Hampshire to take
his seat behind Clinton, was mentioned several times in the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tax-cut proposal comes at a time when the leading
Republican presidential candidates are sparring over how big a tax
cut to offer Americans. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona,
has proposed a $237 billion tax cut over five years, while Texas
Governor George W. Bush wants a $483 billion cut over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the ideas Clinton mentioned in his speech buttress
Gore, who has made the Clinton administration's economic record a
central theme of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has been attacking his opponent, former New Jersey
Senator Bill Bradley, on his sweeping health-care proposal that
would replace Medicare with a subsidy averaging $150 a month for
families to purchase health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, announced Thursday night, would dedicate $400
billion to Medicare; $300 billion toward ensuring the solvency of
Medicare, and the rest for coverage of prescription drugs _ a Gore
campaign item.

AS CAMERA SALES SOAR, POLAROID WAITS FOR GAINS TO REACH BOTTOM
LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can selling razors really guarantee that razor blade sales will
soar?
</P>
<P>
   That is the make-or-break question for Polaroid Corp., the
photographic equipment company that faces the challenge posed by
the classic razor-and-blades marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Polaroid was dismissed as a has-been by numerous
analysts and investors. But last year the company, which announced
its 1999 results on Wednesday, sold 9.7 million instant cameras,
topping its 1978 record of 9.4 million. Fourth-quarter sales alone
were up 20 percent from the quarter a year earlier, driving revenue
to $650 million, easily surpassing analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a 20 percent sales increase since 1986,'' said
Gary T. DiCamillo, Polaroid's jubilant chief executive, whose
contract was just renewed through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vibrant rebound, and one reflected in the company's
shares, which rose $1.625, to $24.1875, Thursday. One problem,
though: while sales were well above analysts' forecasts, earnings _
$28.5 million, or 64 cents a diluted share _ were exactly what Wall
Street expected.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the sales gain fail to filter down to the bottom
line?
</P>
<P>
   The problem, apparently, is that most of the revenue increase
came from cameras. For imaging companies, cameras are practically
loss leaders; the lucrative ``razor blades'' are the films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not clear how much of an impact camera sales will
have on film sales,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst at
Prudential Securities Research who still maintains a strong buy
recommendation on Polaroid stock.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding the crystal balls is the fact that most of Polaroid's
increased sales came from new cameras, whose market longevity is
untested. Polaroid, which significantly increased its marketing and
advertising budget in October, had promised $120 million to $200
million in sales of brand new products in 1999; the actual number
was $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   After good sales in Japan, for example, Polaroid began three
months ago to offer the I-Zone, a $25 camera that takes
matchbook-size pictures, in Europe and the United States. I-Zones
were originally aimed at teen-agers, but have become a fad item
among adults, and Polaroid has sold as many as it could make.
</P>
<P>
   DiCamillo is certain that film sales will follow. ``First you
sell the camera, then you sell the film, and remember, no one
else's film can be used in our cameras,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts agree. ``You are really going to see the benefit
of increased film sales in the second quarter,'' said Ulysses
Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid and one of
Polaroid's biggest fans on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be that cut and dried. Polaroid's fourth-quarter
sales were helped mightily by Christmas gift-giving, and gifts
often wind up in a drawer when the season is over. Moreover, the
I-Zone's success with adults notwithstanding, many of Polaroid's
new products are aimed at children, who are notoriously quick to
discard fads.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the films do sell well, profits may take a while to
catch up. The films for the I-Zone, for example, sell for about $7,
far less than traditional Polaroid film. And, since the films are
new, many analysts say it will take a while before Polaroid can
manufacture them profitably.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dollar of I-Zone sales is just not equal to a dollar in
sales of films that they can make in their sleep,'' said Michael W.
Ellmann, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co. who is lukewarm about
Polaroid shares.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Polaroid sold a lot of product last year,
but several analysts note that the company did not subtract the
cost of a huge mail-in rebate program from its revenue figures.
``They account for them as marketing expenses, and that practice
really inflates their top line,'' said Gibboney Huske, an analyst
with Credit Suisse First Boston who is neutral on Polaroid stock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood is cheery around Polaroid headquarters in
Cambridge, Mass. The company spent a lot on cultivating retailers
last year, and the push has paid off. Polaroid products, once sold
primarily through mass merchandisers, are now found in toy and
convenience stores; all told, some 60,000 U.S. stores sell the
cameras and film, up from 40,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   DiCamillo said that both camera and film sales remained brisk in
January, ``so this was not just a Christmas phenomenon.'' He
predicts the company will sell at least 10 million cameras this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the company's near-term future may be answered
next month at the Photographic Manufacturers Association's annual
trade show in Las Vegas, where retailers usually make their
commitments to carry film and cameras for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid expects to introduce even more products before the
show. ``That's when we'll see how much re-upping of the ante
they'll get,'' Henderson of Prudential said.

 &HT;    CLINTON CALLS ON NATION TO 'SET GREAT GOALS'
 &HT;    Eds: Will be updated by 11:30 p.m. EST.
 &HT;    With UNION-SCENE and UNION-GORE.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Challenging a prosperous nation to strengthen its
future by aiding its poor, President Clinton called Thursday for
$350 billion in tax breaks aimed at helping low-income families
gain a grubstake in the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of unprecedented wealth and budget surpluses, Clinton
said, the country can afford to help the millions of families still
struggling to get by, even as it commits to paying down the biggest
portion of the federal debt by 2013 and shoring up Social Security
and Medicare for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for a new slate of gun controls, including the
requirement that purchasers be required to pass a firearms safety
course before being issued a license to buy a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth and final State of the Union address before
Congress and a national television audience, Clinton cast a
backward glance at his seven years in office, hoping to obscure the
pall of scandal lingering over his tenure, while asking his
countrymen to embrace a broad array of goals unlikely to be met
until long after he leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight let us take our look long ahead, and set great goals
for our nation,'' said Clinton, speaking in the ornate House
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``America again has the confidence to dream big dreams,''
Clinton said as Al Gore, his vice president and possible successor,
sat behind him and listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be
forever young,'' Clinton said. ``That is our destiny, and this is
our moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning from national destiny to personal legacy, Clinton
portrayed his own time in office as a record of achievement
mirroring, even largely responsible for, the nation's broader
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Richer, more influential and more secure than at any time in its
history, the country has traveled a fortunate road, Clinton said,
since he first took office in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,'' said
Clinton. ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much
prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and
so few external threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Not content simply to let the clock run out on his waning
presidency, though, Clinton dropped back and threw long. Calling
for ``a 21st Century American Revolution,'' he challenged the
nation to adopt seven dozen separate goals and initiatives, from
improving elementary schools and preserving federal lands to
combating hate crimes at home and bringing peace to foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans immediately denounced Clinton's agenda
as an overly costly approach that set the country on a course of
big government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
before Clinton's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the past is any judge of today, it is going to be spending
after spending after spending, which proves my point,'' Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, told
reporters in Nashua, N.H. ``If there is money left in Washington it
is going to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and clearly enjoying himself, Clinton shrugged off such
sentiments Thursday night, leaving the political fights he knows
await him for another day.
</P>
<P>
   While he appeared engaged, Clinton's speech also lacked much of
the tension that invigorated his past two State of the Union
addresses, both given under the duress of a 15-month scandal over
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Clinton drew on the cast of Americans for
symbols of the triumphs and tragedies the nation has borne on his
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the reflected glory of one of the nation's newest
sports heros, Clinton tipped his hat to Julie Foudy, co-captain of
the U.S. women's soccer team that won the World Cup last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the NATO air campaign he spearheaded last year
against Serb forces in Kosovo, Clinton led the Congress in a
standing ovation for U.S. Air Force Capt.. John Cherrey, who was
awarded the Silver Star for courage in his efforts to rescue an
American pilot downed over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also paid tribute to a grand old man of the Democratic
Party, his former Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen. The Texan, who
suffered a stroke in 1998, struggled to raise his right hand in an
emotional response to Clinton's gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the issue of race relations, Clinton acknowledged
the contributions made by former Atlanta Braves slugger Hank Aaron,
a pioneer in African-American participation in professional sports,
who was seated at a place of honor directly to Mrs. Clinton's
right.
</P>
<P>
   And, in one of the most dramatic moments of the speech, Clinton
introduced Tom Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was one of 12 students
killed last April by a pair of armed teenagers at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a large lapel button with a photo of his late son,
Mauser rose as Clinton implored Congress to approve an ambitious,
and controversial, slate of new gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that his courage and wisdom will move this Congress to
make common-sense gun safety legislation the very next order of
business,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned limits on ammunition clip size, background checks
for sales at gun shows and child safety locks on handguns _ a group
of measures Clinton proposed, the Senate passed, and the House
killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the ante on gun controls, Clinton also asked Congress to
require that every purchaser of a handgun first pass a gun safety
course and that states issue photo identification cards indicating
whether a potential purchaser had passed a background check.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted much of Thursday night's speech to well-worn
themes: calls for increased spending on the nation's schools,
funding to put additional police on the beat in crime-ridden cities
around the country and a so-called patients' bill of rights, giving
increased leverage to Americans who are sick or injured.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Clinton's message, though, was a clear directive
for the country to dedicate a growing portion of its wealth to help
low-income Americans pay for child care, college tuition and health
care and save, like their higher-paid countrymen, for their
uncertain futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a new economy,'' said Clinton, ticking off the
strengths of the country's commercial machinery set to kick out
more than $9.5 trillion in goods and services this year, and
spinning out record levels of tax revenues that congressional
analysts project will to generate up to $1.9 trillion in federal
budget surpluses over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To 21st Century America,'' said Clinton, ``let us pledge that
every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate, ready to
succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work,
and no child will be raised in poverty,'' an admonition that drew
one of many standing ovations during a speech lasting more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Clinton laid out an extensive package of
targeted tax cut proposals, the details of which will be contained
in the 2001 budget recommendations he submits to Congress on Feb.
7.

   ATLANTA _ Giants coach Jim Fassel got a one-year contract
extension Thursday, but it came with a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to win next year,'' Fassel said. ``It's a bottom-line
business; that's the first thing you learn about coaching. You
better win. I don't want to not be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who was entering the final year of a four-year contract
worth $3.2 million, is now under contract through the 2001 season.
His new deal pays him $1.2 million annually and includes various
incentives that can be earned if the Giants make a playoff run next
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is highly unlikely Fassel will remain with the Giants for
the extra year added Thursday unless the Giants improve
dramatically on last season's 7-9 record. The Giants' ownership and
management support Fassel, but they also agreed to offer the coach
no more than a one-year extension because they didn't want to be
committed financially past 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, through his lawyer, Tom Curtin, had sought a multiyear
extension, even as much as three extra years. But Fassel didn't
seem ruffled by the outcome of the negotiations and insisted the
talks were amicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied with the contract,'' Fassel said in a
conference call from his Giants Stadium office. ``If we had made a
playoff run or won the conference championship, sure it might be
different. Everything is a reflection of what you do. But we
didn't. And whether I signed a five-year deal or whatever, I'd want
to win this next year just as badly. So I think this is very
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel was not pressured to fire or reassign anyone on his
staff, and he said Thursday that he did not expect there to be
changes among his assistant coaches, although his defensive
coordinator, John Fox, has interviewed for the head coach's job
with the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he planned some shuffling of roles within his staff.
People familiar with Fassel's plans said Thursday that the coach
would soon promote the quarterbacks coach, Sean Payton, to
offensive coordinator. Payton took over the team's play-calling
duties from Fassel late last season.
</P>
<P>
   Making the 36-year-old Payton the offensive coordinator is also
a pre-emptive move by the Giants. It will mean a significant raise
for Payton and should head off other teams who might have tried to
hire him.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Skipper, currently the Giants' offensive coordinator, helps
in a variety of roles, especially with the running backs and the
deployment of personnel groupings during games. He will be given a
new post, perhaps head assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday to evaluate his three years as Giants coach,
Fassel said he thought the team did better than he expected his
first season when they were 10-5-1 and won the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from last place to first place in 1997,'' he said.
``Then, the next year, we dropped back down to reality. This year
the disappointing part was that we didn't get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel referred to the team's three-game losing streak at
midseason, with defeats to Indianapolis, Washington and Arizona, as
particularly disheartening. And he mentioned the team's rash of
late-season injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four games, we had a lot of guys out,'' Fassel said.
``And we were playing four playoff teams, three of them on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who had a 25-22-1 record with the Giants, also added:
``You are what you are in this league. And we were 7-9. But we came
down to the last game with a chance at the playoffs in each of the
last two years and I still have a winning record.''
</P>
<P>
   As for other changes on the team, Fassel acknowledged that he
and General Manager Ernie Accorsi have begun mapping a general
strategy for what players to keep and what free agents to pursue.
The Giants themselves have 20 restricted or unrestricted free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   And Fassel said he would spend more time during the off-season
talking with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm going to work on is to spend a
tremendous amount of time with these guys to get our attitude
right,'' Fassel said. ``I'm going to start doing that now and keep
doing it on through training camp so we go into the season with the
right attitude.''

1 OF 8 MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS HAS SMOKED OR CHEWED TOBACCO, SURVEY
FINDS
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first national survey on smoking among children 11 to 13
years of age has found that one of every eight has used tobacco in
some form, including unfiltered Asian cigarettes that are
considered more hazardous than American brands, the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another national study, of high school
students, recorded a decline in tobacco use since 1997. But a
spokesman for the agency said a drop had been expected after
tobacco companies raised cigarette prices to help pay for last
year's $206 billion lawsuit settlements and cautioned that the
decline might not be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study of younger children _ sixth, seventh
and eighth graders _ were ``startlingly high,'' said Sherryl
Healton, president of the American Legacy Foundation, which
conducted the survey with the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are so young,'' Ms. Healton said. ``And combined
with what we know about young people of high school age, we can
expect that 5 million children under the age of 18 alive today in
the United States will die prematurely as a result of addiction to
cigarette smoking _ unless we can reverse the pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the foundation, set up with money for research and
education provided by the tobacco settlement, had set a goal of
lowering the percentage of young people who smoke by 2 percent a
year until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said 9.2 percent of these 11- to-13-year-olds had
smoked cigarettes and 6.1 percent had smoked cigars within a month
of the time surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in September and October, found that 2.4
percent of middle-school students were smoking bidis (pronounced
BEE-dees), cigarettes from India that are hand-rolled and flavored
with chocolate or cherry, and 1.9 percent were smoking kreteks
(KRAY-teks), clove-flavored cigarettes from Indonesia. The foreign
brands often require more puffing and thus pull more smoke into the
lungs than American cigarettes, said Dr. Terry Pechacek, associate
director for science in the Centers for Disease Control's office of
smoking and health.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 7,529 high school students, conducted last spring,
found that 28.4 percent reported using tobacco products in the
preceding month. In 1997, the last time the agency looked at high
school smoking, 36.4 percent of students said they had smoked in
the preceding month. At the time, teen-age smoking was on the rise.
The percentage of high school students who smoked was 34.8 percent
in 1995 and 27.5 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pechacek said one matter of particular concern in the study
of 11- to-13 year-olds was that ``in the last few years surveys
have been noting that African-Americans were smoking significantly
less than whites and Hispanics, and this was viewed as a
public-health success.'' But he said that in the middle-school
survey, children in all three groups were found to be smoking at
virtually the same rates.

BUSH, McCAIN APPEAL FOR CLEAN CAMPAIGN AMID SNIPES OVERBy CLAY ROBISON 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ The two front-running Republican presidential
candidates argued Thursday over who was more like Democratic
President Clinton as they pleaded for positive campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are
jockeying for first place in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. While
appealing to Granite State voters' desire for a clean campaign,
they also appealed to Republican primary voters' distaste for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly tried to link McCain's tax proposal to the one
Clinton was laying out in his State of the Union address Thursday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John said that he embraced the president's tax, or the
president embraced his tax plan, I think that shows a clear
difference between my view of tax cutting and his,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party ought to nominate someone who will be
able to have a stark difference, a clear difference on basic issues
with the Democratic nominee, not someone who will mimic the
Democratic nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides later said they were considering running ads on the
subject in the Boston-New Hampshire media market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax-cut plan Thursday. McCain,
with his $240 billion plan, and Bush, with a $483 billion plan,
have been arguing over their proposals for weeks, even while voters
say the humming economy dampens their desire for tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   If the Texas governor continues to compare him to the vice
president and Democratic presidential candidate, McCain said:
``Then I will keep my comment from (Wednesday's debate): He spins
like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was endorsed by 1996 vice presidential nominee Jack
Kemp, who campaigned for the presidency with a flat-tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said he still believes in a flat tax but that it would not
be possible to pass one at this time. Kemp called Bush's plan
``practical and realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   As they sniped over their conservative credentials, McCain
pleaded for a clean campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Plaistow, N.H., McCain said, ``I hope
that Governor Bush and all the others will maintain that level now
in these last few days. I challenge them not to get into a negative
campaign. I know you don't like negative campaigns in New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're interested in is our views on the issues, and
that's what I'll do,'' he told reporters before touring the Simplex
Technologies plant, which manufactures fiber optics cable in
Newington.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to another opponent, magazine mogul Steve Forbes, Bush
reacted angrily when one man asked him about Forbes' charges that
he broke his Texas tax pledge and that education has declined
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell half the story in politics or you can tell the
whole story. I laid out a plan in my state of Texas that cut the
taxes by $1 billion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is exactly what happened,'' he maintained, although
few Texas voters actually saw a reduction in their taxes because of
a corresponding rise in many school districts' property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope people do is run on their own record and not try
to tear people down,'' Bush said.

TALKS ON BIOTECH FOOD TURN ON A SAFETY PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Around midnight Wednesday night, Juan Myer, who is
chairing global biosafety talks here, told delegates after a long
day of negotiations to go back to their hotel rooms and ``dream
about the precautionary approach.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to one of the most important issues remaining
in the effort to formulate the world's first treaty regulating
trade in genetically modified products: Must a nation have
scientific proof before it can ban a genetically engineered crop or
animal? Or can it act even in the absence of scientific certainty?
</P>
<P>
   The ``precautionary principle,'' which allows erring on the side
of safety in the absence of scientific certainty, has been
enshrined in numerous environmental laws and treaties since the
1970s, but often more as a vague statement of philosophy than as a
recipe for action. Depending on the outcome of negotiations here,
an agreement on biosafety might contain a strong formulation
authorizing the precautionary principle be used in decision-making,
setting a precedent for other international agreements.
</P>
<P>
   It could also set a precedent for domestic debates in the United
States, where controversy over food made with biotechnology is
growing. Virtually no evidence exists that such foods are harmful.
But critics say there is not enough information about such health
effects, so the foods should be banned or more tightly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations over the biosafety agreement, the United States
and several other big agricultural exporting nations say that
incorporating the precautionary principle in too strong a way would
allow countries to ban imports of genetically modified corn,
soybeans or other crops simply based on fear or protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some proposals that we think would redefine
the concept,'' Frank E. Loy, under secretary of state for global
affairs, said Thursday. ``It would have the effect of justifying
restrictions on biotechnology, including import bans, without any
scientific basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But European countries and the developing countries, which have
been pitted against the United States and a handful of its allies
all week, say precaution is justified because not enough is known
about the environmental effects of genetic engineering. And if a
super-weed or dangerous bacteria were to get loose in the
environment, it could not be recalled like a defective car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries must be able to have the freedom, the sovereign
right to take precautionary measures,'' said Christoph Bail, the
lead negotiator for the European Union. Once damage occurs ``it
would be too late to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   European officials said they are not advocating abandoning an
approach based on science. ``You cannot take action based on just
fear,'' said Margot Wallstrom , the environmental commissioner of
the European Union. ``You need some evidence, you need some
scientific basis for action.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials point out that the United States itself has
endorsed the precautionary principle in treaties such as the Kyoto
agreement on climate change. Steps are being taken to control gases
that contribute to planetary warming even though it could be argued
that the evidence that such warming will occur is not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over the precautionary approach ties in to another
issue. Washington wants to make sure any agreement on biosafety
does not take precedence over the World Trade Organization rules.
That is because under World Trade Organization rules, an import can
be banned only on the basis of scientific evidence.

 &HT;    SPEECH GENERATES CHEERS, BUT LITTLE PASSION
 &HT;    With UNION.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out from the shadow of scandal but approaching the
valley of irrelevance, President Clinton stirred the usual
stick-it-to-'em standing ovations Thursday night, but not the
passions of past State of the Union addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats roared when Clinton boasted ``the state of our union
is the strongest it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans jumped to their feet when he added, ``As always, the
credit belongs to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's final such address, and everybody knew their
parts after two terms.
</P>
<P>
   There were empty seats on the House floor, even on the
Democratic side. Notably absent were all nine members of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justices of the court had planned to attend,'' the court said
in a note to Congress. ``But travel changes and minor illnesses
have intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who came heard a lot of words. The fidgeting seemed to be
not only for a conclusion to a long speech but also for the end of
a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Come next January, Vice President Al Gore hopes to be at that
podium and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., plans to be
standing behind him as speaker of the House. First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton wants to trade her gallery perch for a floor seat as
a Democratic senator from New York. Congressional Republicans are
ready be rid of Clinton because he outsmarted them so often, and
congressional Democrats are tired of their moral dilemma in
defending him.
</P>
<P>
   None of this impatient ambition inhibited the traditional
jack-in-the-box ovations. Democrats stood and cheered for a laundry
list of new and expanded federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans liked the notion of paying down the national debt
and loved it when Clinton misspoke and said, ``last year the vice
president launched a new effort to help make communities more
liberal.'' The word was ``liveable'' in the text.
</P>
<P>
   This choreographed exuberance is aimed at the television
audience, of course, with even Clinton's entrenched enemies not
wanting to come across as party-pooping sourpusses. Someday a
network should produce a VH1-style ``Pop-Up Video'' of a State of
the Union address with message bubbles revealing what the members
of Congress were really thinking while applauding.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly relished these moments _ or hours _ in the
national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The State of the Union _ dubbed ``SOTU'' at the White House _ is
the president's ``favorite time of the year,'' says Michael
Waldman, Clinton's former top speechwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves the policy, the politics, the polling, the
showmanship and schmaltz,'' Waldman wrote in the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   His flair for the dramatic was illustrated when he looked toward
his wife, the Senate candidate, in the gallery and mouthed ``I love
you.'' Sitting on one side of Mrs. Clinton was their daughter,
Chelsea, and on the other was baseball home run king Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan began a tradition of introducing a hero in the
gallery in 1982 when he introduced Lenny Skutnik, who had jumped
into the icy Potomac River to save victims of a plane crash.
Clinton has expanded the practice, adding guests who personify his
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Pat Brown, a 72-year-old retiree from Johnson
City, Tenn., said she was there ``to represent all of the many
older people in this country who are being hurt financially by the
cost of prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another presidential guest was Tom Mauser, father of Columbine
High School shooting victim Daniel Mauser. He has taken a leave of
absence from his job with the Colorado Department of Transportation
to advocate gun-control legislation _ another Clinton priority and
a wedge issue with Republicans in the upcoming congressional
election.

 &HT;    Glenn, crew mates discuss mission
 &HT;    By Ginger Livingston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Some 14 months after NASA sent John Glenn back
to space, the public fascination continues just as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 people showed up Thursday night at Natcher
Auditorium on the campus of the National Institutes of Health for a
symposium featuring Glenn and three of his crew mates discussing
their high-profile 1998 mission aboard space shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Another 300 waited outside the auditorium, which prompted
officials to add a second session. Videos were shown detailing some
of the experiments, the retrieval of a satellite that was launched
for a four-day study of the sun and how they lived on the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Mission STS-95 are being presented over two days.
Glenn served as a test subject for 10 experiments studying space-
and age-related problems. He spent four nights in a wired-up sleep
suit, provided 17 blood samples and also swallowed a capsule
holding a tiny radio transmitter and temperature sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Those results were not to be released until today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to say it's encouraging to send other old
people into space,'' Glenn, 78, said when asked what he thought the
results might yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus we got our toe in the door on research into
osteoporosis,'' muscle atrophy and protein loss and other physical
problems associated with aging and space flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see more of the elderly go into space so that we
would have more of a database.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the scientists behind the experiments
described the findings of tests on plants, proteins and tumor cells
performed by the former senator and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The flight contained more scientific experiments _ 88 _ than any
previous shuttle mission, said NASA Associate Administrator Dr.
Arnauld Nicogossian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission was packed, really packed,'' he said as he opened
the scientific gathering. ``By one of those good fortunes we had,
all of the experiments worked except one.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientist Dennis Morrison described an experiment that
compressed a tumor-fighting drug into a special miniature balloon
and directing the drug into the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually on the right track,'' he said, explaining that
such a system could enable future cancer patients to avoid the side
effects of chemotherapy by receiving drugs only where tumor cells
have grown and not through their entire bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn did not attend the first day of scientific presentations.
But he said in a telephone interview that Morrison's experiment on
microencapsulation was one of the tests that he found most
fascinating during the nine-day mission in October and November
1998.
</P>
<P>
   NASA expanded its experiment itenerary after Glenn was added to
the crew, with the stated purpose of exploring the similarities
between what happens to humans in the zero-gravity environment of
space and what happens naturally on Earth during the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   He was 77 when he became the world's oldest spaceman.

   NEW YORK _ Once again, the familiar visage of Johnnie L. Cochran
Jr. is appearing on television screens here. But this time, the
lawyer who made his name defending O.J. Simpson is offering himself
as the champion of the common man, not the lawyer of the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception anyone can have about me is that all
of my clients are rich and famous,'' Cochran intones in a new
television commercial. ``I'm committed to helping everyday folks
get justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is for the Cochran Firm, which last month became the
largest personal injury law firm in the nation. The venture merges
Cochran's long-running personal injury practice in Los Angeles with
others in New York, Atlanta, Alabama and, soon, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of contemplating retirement at age 62, the a
multimillionaire Cochran is starting several new ventures: in
addition to practicing law, he makes many paid speeches, and
recently took on another new enterprise, Johnnie Cochran Sports
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts and other personal injury lawyers question how,
with an already mushrooming client list of police misconduct
victims and celebrities, Cochran can effectively represent even
more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he's going to do it,'' said Anthony Gentile,
a personal injury lawyer who has practiced in New York since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's perspective, the new national firm could be
derided as a manipulative move by a celebrity lawyer or an attempt
to help average Americans by a skilled litigator. Avaricious or
altruistic, Cochran's new venture takes the melding of lawyering
and celebrity to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's firm has 63 lawyers and already represents more than
1,000 clients nationwide. While not all his cases are well
publicized, in New York alone, his clients include Abner Louima,
the police torture victim; the rap impresario Sean Combs and the
family of Thomas Pizzuto, who died last January after he was beaten
by guards at the Nassau County jail. He also represents two men,
one black and one Hispanic, who were shot at by state troopers on
the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some signs of strain have emerged. Last year the family of
Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant killed by the police
in the Bronx in February, replaced Cochran and his Simpson trial
co-counsels, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, amid reports that the
family felt the three lawyers were paying too little attention to
their case. And some civil rights lawyers in New York have accused
Cochran of using his fame to dazzle clients and muscle his way into
their cases, but then doing little legal heavy lifting himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, in New York last week, said he would be able to take on
additional clients, and that inattention was not the issue in the
Diallo case. He denied muscling into other lawyers' cases. ``That's
not my style,'' he said. ``We have enough business. We turn down
more cases than we take.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the new firm the ``logical next step'' in his career.
While best known for his defense of O.J. Simpson in 1995, Cochran
has devoted nearly all his career to personal injury work. His
goal, he said, is to extend skilled lawyering to the disfranchised,
particularly minorities. ``The client base is diverse, but we want
to make it more so,'' he said, referring to the people already
represented by his personal injury firm.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's new television ads clearly play on the hope of the
common man's being represented by an anything-but-common lawyer.
``What's the least-known fact about America's best-known
attorney?'' an announcer asks in a second ad, which shows Cochran
in a courthouse and meeting with partners and clients. The answer:
``That Johnnie Cochran built his reputation winning big personal
injury cases for the little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcer adds, ``You don't have to be high profile to get
high quality representation'' and offers an 800 number for callers
with ``serious personal injury cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is little chance those callers will end up having
Cochran personally handling their cases, legal experts said. While
tens of thousands of personal injury cases are filed each year in
New York, most result in settlements of several thousand dollars.
Those cases will be handled by junior lawyers, they predicted,
while Cochran will be involved only in the handful of potentially
multimillion-dollar cases that emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm, like nearly all personal injury firms, will charge
its clients a percentage of any rewards they receive, according to
Cochran's partners.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran cited his results to show his effectiveness. Last year,
he won a $3 million settlement for the family of Junious Roberts,
an unarmed black man shot dead by the police in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said the new firm would primarily handle standard
personal injury cases, including medical malpractice and product
liability cases. ``You want to be altruistic,'' he said. ``But you
have to do things that make money for the firm.'' He declined to
comment on how much he would earn.
</P>
<P>
   For the few clients lucky enough to be personally represented by
Cochran, the new venture could be a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Cochran's reputation for swaying juries and
generating press attention, some of the businesses and local
governments being sued may opt to settle. But for most people
spurred to the phone by Cochran's new ads, he is likely to remain a
distant celebrity on the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take every case because sometimes you end up
spreading yourself too thin,'' Cochran said, adding. ``I have to
pick and choose.''

U.S. DELAYS ITS DECISION ON AMOCO-ARCO MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Alaska)   (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government decided Thursday to postpone
a decision on whether to block the proposed $30 billion merger of
BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield after the companies made a new
offer to divest themselves of further assets, people involved in
the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission had been set to approve a staff
recommendation to seek a court order blocking the deal at a hearing
of the commissioners on Friday morning. But after a new proposal
was advanced Thursday by Sir John Browne, the chief executive of BP
Amoco, in a conversation with Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the
Trade Commission, the agency agreed to postpone the meeting until
Monday to spend a few days analyzing and considering it. Further
discussions between the two companies and government officials also
remain possible.
</P>
<P>
   While the agency's decision represented the first significant
progress for the companies in their protracted discussions with
government officials, people involved in the talks said that the
two sides still appeared to be far apart, and that it would be
inaccurate to characterize the day's events as serious
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the pause announced Thursday gave company
executives some hope that they might be able to avoid a courtroom
confrontation. The companies have given the agency until Feb. 3 to
decide whether to approve the deal, although executives have the
authority to extend that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, staff officials at the agency recommended
blocking the deal, raising concerns that the proposed merger could
undermine competition and lead to higher gasoline prices on the
West Coast. While a move by the FTC to block a corporate merger
often has the effect of killing the deal, executives at the two oil
companies have asserted that they have a strong legal case and that
they will not abandon the merger.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to court, a central issue will be the
relationship between the companies' oil production in Alaska and
gasoline prices in California and other states on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies combined produce about 70 percent of the 1.1
million barrels in Alaska each day, and under an agreement reached
with Alaska authorities, have agreed to reduce their combined
ownership to about 55 percent. Government officials have expressed
concerns to the companies that their control over Alaska production
could lead to higher prices on the West Coast, which has among the
highest gasoline prices in the nation and gets most of its oil from
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives say they are puzzled by the government's
opposition because there are no substantial retail or refinery
overlaps of the two companies. The executives and other analysts
also maintain that prices in California are not set by Alaska
production but by world crude prices, and that the West Coast has
higher prices because of certain peculiarities of that market. For
instance, California has higher state taxes and requires
cleaner-burning, and thus more expensive, types of gasoline.

 &HT;    Versatility, vision drive Rams' Faulk
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The subject is St. Louis Rams tailback Marshall Faulk,
and his playing style is an endless stream of adjectives _
exciting, elusive and electrifying _ just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   From running to catching to blocking, Faulk does it all. The
5-foot-10, 211-pounder set an NFL record for total yards from
scrimmage with 2,429 _ 1,381 rushing and 1,048 receiving _ this
season. So he's two great players in one.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's headed to his fourth Pro Bowl in six seasons.
That's why the Rams (15-3) have reached Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   What makes him unique? Is it his blend of speed, strength and
desire that leaves defenders in his wake? Yeah, it's all that _ and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision,'' Faulk said. ``I can see everything.''
</P>
<P>
   All great teams are well-balanced offensively and Faulk is the
perfect complement to quarterback Kurt Warner and fleet wide
receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask Faulk to compare his style with anyone else's. He
won't budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't assessed my style,'' he said. ``I don't know how to
describe it. I just try to make people miss. That's all I think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams pulled off the greatest coup of the 1999 offseason when
they traded their second- and fifth-round draft choices to
Indianapolis for Faulk, whom the Colts grabbed with the second
overall pick in '94 _ behind Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson of the
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The trade allowed the Colts to draft tailback Edgerrin James,
who led the NFL in rushing (1,553) as a rookie this season, but
Faulk's presence in St. Louis solidified the Rams' devastating
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall is such a threat as a receiver and as a runner that
you need to account for him whether he's getting the ball or not,''
Rams offensive coordinator Mike Martz said. ``One of the big values
of having Marshall in there is that it takes pressure away from the
wide receivers and tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is conducive to a guy like him because of his
versatility. We can move him around. He'll run routes with the same
speed and crispness of a wide receiver. He doesn't limit you in any
way. He's the consummate back.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates praise Faulk for his ability to make things happen. He
raises everyone's level around him because he knows each player's
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great back and a smart back,'' offensive tackle Orlando
Pace said. ``I think he reads the linebackers the best I've seen.
If you give him a little crack, he'll make it happen and probably
take it to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk grew up in a housing project in New Orleans, then exploded
onto the national scene as an All-American at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' he said about his childhood. ``Not always did
I walk a straight line. I am not going to say that I am an angel,
but I did make some right decisions along the way that got me where
I am today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things I had to go through makes dealing with
football easy because football is a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked his favorite memory growing up, Faulk just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have one, but it's about to happen, though,''
he said. ``This weekend, I'm going to have some favorite Super Bowl
memories.''

OPENING ONE TRIAL TO TV LEADS TO REQUESTS FOR MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the two days since an Albany judge approved the
televising of the trial of four police officers charged with
murdering Amadou Diallo, news organizations have asked judges
around the state to open their court proceedings to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The results so far have been mixed. An Albany judge agreed to
allow cameras to cover the final day of a trial there on Wednesday,
but Thursday, a Manhattan judge rejected a request to allow cameras
at the coming trial of Sante and Kenneth Kimes, the mother and son
charged with murder, conspiracy and fraud in the disappearance in
July 1998 of Irene Silverman, an Upper East Side millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations also asked a judge in Queens for permission
to use cameras at a hearing for Carmine Agnello, the son-in-law of
the imprisoned mob boss John J. Gotti, but the judge ruled the
issue moot because Agnello did not appear in court Thursday. In
Rochester, a judge had yet to decide on whether to allow cameras
into a murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts predict that the spate of requests and divergent
court decisions will continue until the Court of Appeals, the
state's highest court, rules on the issue or the state Legislature
enacts a law legalizing cameras in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, state Sen. James J. Lack, R-Suffolk County, who is
the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would introduce a
bill to open up courtrooms across the state to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the lawyer who successfully argued for the opening
of the Diallo trial to cameras, said that any speedy resolution of
the issue was unlikely. It can take months, or years, for an issue
to wind its way through New York's appellate courts until it is
heard by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that there are applications being made in
different courts with difficult rulings being handed down,'' he
said. ``The ruling in the Diallo case was the beginning of the end
of the ban on cameras in New York. The end can only come with a
ruling with the New York Court of Appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the state Legislature declined to extend a 10-year
experiment allowing cameras in courtrooms. Opponents cited what
they called the circuslike atmosphere of the O.J. Simpson murder
trial in Los Angeles, saying it was an example of the harmful
effects that cameras could have in courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Since the decision on Tuesday in the Diallo case, Gov. George
Pataki; the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno; and the
Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, have all expressed support for a
new law that would authorize cameras in courtrooms. But whether the
two sides can agree on legislation remains to be seen. Pat Lynch,
Silver's spokeswoman, said he would support only measures that
include provisions that protect the identities of jurors and rape
victims, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Legislature or the state Court of Appeals acts, a
confusing series of court decisions is likely to continue. In
Manhattan Thursday, Justice Rena K. Uviller of state Supreme Court
denied a request from defense lawyers, The New York Post and New
York television station WNYW to allow still and video cameras to
cover the Kimeses' trial, which began Thursday with jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Uviller said that the Diallo ruling was an exception because
a court order to move the case from the Bronx to Albany had caused
``tremendous community concern'' about the fairness of the
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   But in a ruling on Wednesday, Acting Justice Dan Lamont of state
Supreme Court in Albany allowed local television cameras to cover
the trial of a young woman accused of killing her child. In a
decision that reaches the opposite conclusion of Ms. Uviller's,
Lamont said that the Diallo ruling did allow him to grant cameras
access to a local trial.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emory Orgustus Cunningham, a publishing executive who served up
recipes for sweet potato pie and a rosy view of a new suburban
South emerging from the region's rural poverty and decades of
racial strife, died of pneumonia on Monday in Birmingham, Ala.,
where he lived. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham launched his Martha Stewart-like vision of a glossy
new Dixie in 1966 in a magazine called Southern Living. Its
circulation grew from an initial 200,000 to 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine was acquired, with its sister publications, by Time
Inc. in 1985. At the time, the price was the largest ever paid for
a publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's influence was such that The Birmingham News
suggested that Mainers who made cheese grits or Nebraskans with a
good recipe for pecan toffee could probably thank Southern Living.
But the magazine also peddled a new kind of Southern stereotype,
one that Howell Raines, the editorial page editor of The New York
Times who is a native of Birmingham, called the Southern Living
disease in a 1989 article in The Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, who was then the paper's Washington editor, said the
``relentlessly cheerful'' magazine was ``devoted to depicting the
region as one endless festival of barbecue, boiled shrimp, football
Sundays and good old Nashville music.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's February issue seems at least partly to support
this view with its holiday recipe contest, tips for a weekend in
Charleston, S.C., and several articles about traditional Southern
crafts.
</P>
<P>
   John Shelton Reed, a sociologist at the University of North
Carolina, said in 1993 that Southern Living's perspective, ``with
its relentlessly upbeat glimpses of a convivial suburban South of
mum and marigold gardens,'' had replaced the South of ``Gone with
the Wind.'' Indeed, Reed said the Southern Living attitude had
become the vision enunciated by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But even at Southern Living, changes are noticeable. The current
issue also features a short travel guide to the new Birmingham
Civil Rights Institute, which addresses the gritty details of the
South's racial history, including a display of ``white'' and
``colored'' drinking fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham often said his secret of success was treating readers
like neighbors. His own life suggests the extensive changes that
have swept over Dixie. Born to a farmer and a teacher, Cunningham
and five siblings grew up in Kansas, Ala., a speck of a town about
60 miles west of Birmingham. He graduated from Mississippi Gulf
Junior College, served as a Navy pilot in World War II and received
a degree in agriculture from Auburn University.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately took a job selling advertisements for Progressive
Farmer magazine, setting sales records in the magazine's Chicago
office. For the next 20 years he was, among other things, editor,
advertising manager and publisher of Progressive Farmer. The
magazine, which was founded in 1886, was the leading farm magazine
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham pressed the argument that as the South rapidly
urbanized, Progressive Farmer's potential growth in readership was
limited. With Southern Living, he wanted to reach the growing
number of people who lived in cities and their suburbs, though he
still saw their country backgrounds as perhaps their most important
commonality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every adult who was born and raised in the South either
lived as a child in the country or his parents did, so he always
had a first generation contact with the country,'' Cunningham said
in a 1981 interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the treatment of the South in national magazines was
insulting to Southerners, creating a market for his own product.
``There's been less acceptance of national magazines in the South
than in other regions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who was 6 foot 3 and had an ``aw shucks'' manner,
was chief executive of Southern Progress Corp. from 1968 until
1987. In his last two years with Southern Progress, when Time owned
the company, he was also a Time vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Among his achievements was greatly expanding the reach of Oxmoor
House, the company's book-publishing division. For example, in 1976
Oxmoor produced a book called ``Jericho: The South Beheld.'' It had
reproductions of paintings by Hubert Shuptrine and an evocative
text by the poet and novelist James Dickey. Using direct mail,
Oxmoor immediately sold all 150,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Reed, writing in The New York Times, said Cunningham at the
time suggested that the company might want to expand further, ``but
like a farmer with one eye down the road, he allows that he had
better attend to what he has before he thinks about starting
something new.'' Reed added: ``Magazine publishers can interpret
that in one of two ways. Emory Cunningham might buy them out, or he
might not.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that Cunningham spent much of his time trying to
elude Northern companies intent on buying Southern Progress. In
1973, when Time first expressed interest in the company, he warned
its executives not to come to Birmingham in their corporate jet, so
as not to set off rumors among his corporate staff. In 1984, he had
publicly proclaimed that the company would never be sold to a
Yankee interloper.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, when Time returned, its offer, $480 million, was
irresistible. Southern Progress' four magazines were the first that
Time had bought rather than started.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call Emory Cunningham merely the most successful publisher
of regional magazines in the United States is to slight a shining
career,'' said Reginald Brack Jr., then president of Time's
magazine group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the 10th anniversary of Southern Living, Cunningham was
named publisher of the year by U.S. Magazine Publishers, a trade
association.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham is survived by his wife, Jeanne; two sons, James
Emory and David Lee; and two daughters, Sara Cunningham Bright and
Mary Cunningham Beck, all of Birmingham. He is also survived by
three sisters, Charlene Cunningham Oden of Russellville, Ark.;
Doras Cunningham Allen of Carbon Hill, Ark.; and Frances Cunningham
Nix of Kansas, Ark.; and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who traveled to more than 50 countries to study
agricultural practices, was an ecologist years before it became
fashionable. When Southern Progress built an office tower, he chose
the design of an inverted pyramid to avoid harming the root systems
of nearby trees. Visitors to his Shelby County farm were seldom
allowed to leave without an armload of prize-winning tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   He liked to recall Clarence Darrow's accusing a courtroom
opponent of looking for God ``too far away.'' In 1983, he told The
Atlanta Weekly, ``If we want this country to be all it can be, we
start with the little things that are around us.''

CLINTON OFFERS SWEEPING PROPOSALS IN FINAL STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton offered the nation a sweeping
farewell agenda Thursday, using his last State of the Union address
to push unfinished priorities on health care, education and gun
control that Republicans have opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But while trying to generate momentum for a legislative agenda
in his final year to help seal his legacy, Clinton also used his
message to help boost the 2000 presidential campaign of Vice
President Al Gore, whose election-year proposals are virtually
identical to initiatives Clinton outlined before a joint Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton boasted of America's unprecedented
prosperity and challenged the Republican-controlled Congress to
join him in even greater ``goals for our country'' that would help
ensure the nation's economic well being and its national security.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking of the work ``yet to be done,'' Clinton asked the
Republicans to join in a plan to pay off the nation's public debt
of $3.7 trillion by 2013 while providing a $350 billion tax cut
over 10 years and investing more than $110 billion in new funding
to provide health care insurance for the poor and prescription drug
benefits for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton asked Congress to support his call for
nearly $5 billion in new education spending to expand the Head
Start program for needy children, increase funding for afterschool
and summer programs, and to help reduce class size by building more
schools and hiring more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this time in history. Never
before has our nation enjoyed so much prosperity and social
progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats.
Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity _ and therefore
such a profound obligation _ to build the more perfect union of our
founders' dreams,'' Clinton said, citing the nation's economic
strength as evidence that the government can now afford to and
should do more to help its neediest citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But while urging more spending and targeted tax relief, Clinton
stressed the importance of keeping to ``the path of fiscal
discipline that got us here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of
a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social
Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While many of Clinton proposals were re-submissions of previous
initiatives to which he has attached a higher price tag, some were
new and took members by surprise, including a call for
gun-licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, every handgun buyer would need a valid,
state-issued photo license indicating that he or she had passed a
background check and gun safety class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong
hands,'' Clinton said, noting the tragedy last year at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, Tom Mauser, the father of slain Columbine
student Daniel Mauser, listened from the gallery of the House
chamber where he sat next to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Teen gunmen killed more than a dozen people at the Colorado high
school his son attended.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton's licensing proposal, which would
require congressional approval, is aimed at reducing gun violence,
accidental shootings, and keeping guns out of the hands of
criminals and the underaged.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals were predictably hailed by Democrats, who
embraced as their own the themes of community, responsibility and
opportunity. The Democrats are hoping to use popular issues such as
health care, prescription drug benefits and paying down the debt to
their advantage as they seek to retake control of Congress in this
year's elections.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has outlined an agenda that will preserve our
prosperity and take advantage of a historic opportunity to invest
in America's future,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who heads
the House Democratic caucus. He added that the priorities outlined
in Clinton's speech would make ``a difference in the lives of
everyday Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were skeptical of Clinton's proposals, calling his
tax cut package too small and his spending proposals too costly.
But at the same time, Republicans leaders spent much of the day
ahead of Clinton's speech promoting their own health care and debt
relief initiatives, which indicated a willingness to compromise
with the president later if the congressional races tighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert acknowledged, however, that there may be a number of
areas, including education, where Republicans and Clinton have more
agreements this year than differences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other Republican leaders cautioned their colleagues not
to provide Clinton with any help in trying to secure a legacy that
seeks to dismiss his impeachment for the Monica Lewinsky affair or
other scandals that have marred his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton apparently intends these final months in
office to be spent buffing his image for history,'' Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, said, adding that most of Clinton proposals should
be ``discreetly discarded'' by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm suggested the country would be better off if Congress and
the president did little between now and election day to give the
American people time to ``decide the direction of the country with
their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the podium in the House chamber for his eighth and
final State of the Union address in remarkably better spirits than
he was last year when he delivered his annual address to a joint
session of Congress as his impeachment trial was about to begin in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances surrounding his appearance Thursday night were
also stunningly different from when he delivered his first State of
the Union speech in 1993. The nation was still saddled then with a
budget deficit of more than $260 billion, and there was little
inkling that the current economic expansion would prove to be the
longest-running in the nation's history and would lead to
projections of non-Social Security surpluses totaling nearly $2
trillion by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   He pronounced Thursday to a standing ovation that ``the state of
our union is the strongest it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The
fastest economic growth in more than 30 years. The lowest
unemployment rates in 30 years. The lowest poverty rates in 20
years. The lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates
on record. The first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton also offered a host of initiatives aimed
at improving the general well-being of Americans. Republicans
criticized most of them, saying the Clinton would use up all of the
future surpluses trying to provide ``something for everyone''
regardless of need.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his tax cut and health care initiatives, Clinton
called for passage of a consumer protection ``patients' bill of
rights,'' an increase in the minimum wage and campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But his tax cut and health care plans appeared to be at the
heart of his legislative wish list. Some of the more important
provisions included phasing out the marriage tax penalty; up to
$10,000 in tax credits per family to cover college tuitions; a
$3,000 annual credit to help cover the cost of long-term care; and
expansion of the earned income tax credit for the working poor by
$21 billion. His tax cut initiative also included incentives to
spur more charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would cost $350 billion over 10 years. But it
also calls for closing tax loopholes and shelters that could reduce
the cost by $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals included:
</P>
<P>
   _ A prescription drug benefit that could cost as much as $50
billion over the next 10 years to help elderly Medicare patients.
``We cannot allow one more year to pass without providing this
life-line to seniors to help them afford prescription drugs,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   _ A plan that would expand the Children's Health Insurance
Program by $110 billion to cover not only poor children, but their
parents. If approved by Congress, it would amount to the largest
increase in government-funded health care coverage in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ An initiative that would help people 55 and older buy Medicare
coverage by providing them with a 25 percent tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton focused his remarks primarily on domestic policy issues.
But he did call on Congress to approve normal trade relations with
China and to increase foreign aid to Colombia by $1.6 billion to
help in the fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   He also unveiled a plan to help developing countries in Africa
and elsewhere fight malaria, AIDS and other diseases by providing
$1 billion in tax incentives for drug companies to develop new
vaccines and treatments.

DAVOS FORUM OPENS WITH QUALIFIED EXUBERANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ A year ago, when the very rich and the very
powerful gathered by the ski slopes of this Swiss resort for the
annual hyper-schmooze called the World Economic Forum, their
gathering fell under the shadow of the financial damage in Russia
and Latin America and the lingering economic weakness in much of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This year, at least in the opening hours, it was feel-good time.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released by PricewaterhouseCoopers Thursday showed that
1,020 chief executives who control companies with stock worth
billions were overwhelmingly optimistic about Internet-driven
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs market strategist, said
soaring U.S. stock prices were not overvalued and the American
economy would grow, too.
</P>
<P>
   As if to punctuate the initial exuberance of the conference, the
Boston Philharmonic's conductor, Benjamin Zander, led participants
in a rousing rendition of Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a looming issue to tinge the crisp, blue skies
of Davos a darker shade, it was this: how will the haves, who
benefit most from the fast-moving era of technological advance,
continue to do so without courting the backlash of the have-nots _
evident at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of gathering where people come expecting to
frame stirring resolutions. Rather, said one participant, the
investment banker Udayan Bose of Lazard India Ltd., it is a place
where people meet the people who will be making the deals of
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But with a heavy lineup of politicians _ including Bill Clinton,
the first American president to attend, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain _ plus a strong sprinkling of labor leaders and
rights activists invited to leaven the capitalist mix, the debate
surrounding globalization's future will impinge on many among the
300 politicians, 1,200 business leaders and 400 academics, writers
and others gathered here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot forget that we are entering this new age with a lot
of unfinished business from the 20th century,'' said Klaus Schwab,
the Swiss academic who founded the economic forum as a foundation
30 years ago and has since turned it into one of the world's most
glittery gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such are the worries about Seattle-style protests that
the Swiss Army has been deployed in the pine-clad valley
surrounding Davos and American helicopters have been seen in the
skies above. ``U.S. pilots practice for C-Day,'' said the tabloid
Blick, referring to Clinton's arrival Saturday for a six-hour
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly seeking to stir opposition to the president's visit,
anonymous hoaxers sent a forged letter to homes and hotels saying a
curfew would be imposed during that time, Swiss television reported
Wednesday night. A few days ago, a projectile, described variously
as a firecracker or gasoline bomb, was thrown at the bunker-like
center where the forum meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization can be a process which can be of benefit to
everybody,'' Schwab said. ``So what we have to see here is how we
can create the policies and actions in order to make sure that
there are no losers of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Losers are not much in evidence here. Only the wealthiest and
most successful corporations are invited; their executives pay more
than $20,000 to attend; and the guest list this year includes such
luminaries of the markets and the Internet era as Steve Case of
America Online, Bill Gates of Microsoft and the financier George
Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the draw of this gathering, moreover, that the American
delegation includes not only the president but Commerce Secretary
William M. Daley, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Treasury
Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, and the White House trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence has reinforced a trend perceived by other
participants in the event, once dominated by Europeans, that it has
become a forum reflecting the political, technological and economic
weight of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the central theme this year is supposed to be the
human impact of Internet technology and biotechnology. Thursday's
survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers, for instance, said 64 percent
of chief executives who responded were ``somewhat optimistic''
about their companies' prospects for the next three years and 27
percent were ``extremely optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But here, too, social perspectives intruded: 50 percent said
they expected Internet-based business to widen the gap between the
world's rich and poor. while 38 percent said the gap would
narrow.Schwab urged that the Internet and biotechnology revolutions
become ``beneficial and acceptable to all.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a statement, labor leaders from Europe and the United
States _ including Bill Jordan, head of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and John J. Sweeney of the
AFL-CIO _ urged the elite here to ``commit themselves to work
toward universal social justice.''

MAYOR GIULIANI'S ELECTION-YEAR BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Jan. 28: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ebullient Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took the press and other
onlookers through an elaborate slide show of his new four-year
financial plan, missing no opportunity to congratulate himself for
saving New York City from the financial mess left by his
predecessors. He pointed with pride to this year's $2.2 billion
surplus and said his plan would keep spending growing in line with
inflation, cut taxes, avoid accounting gimmicks and reform the way
the city negotiates with unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these contentions are fair. Others exaggerate. Over all,
the budget he offered is responsible but flawed, with elements
designed for election-year politics. The budget will surely
irritate the unions. The city council, though objecting to some of
the details, will embrace many of the tax cuts and other major
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's big news Thursday was to propose to eliminate the 14
percent personal income tax surcharge starting as early as this
year. He also called for cutting a number of business taxes, for a
total tax cut that would reach $2 billion a year by 2004. The plan
calls for spending more on Medicaid by enrolling more eligible
families.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial provision proposed to replace
across-the-board pay increases with a system of merit pay. The idea
would be to offer substantial wage increases to good workers and no
increases to poor workers. Details of the merit pay plan, including
who would control the grading system, would be left to collective
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is both unrealistic and nakedly political, designed
to appeal to conservatives and union-bashers in the upcoming
senatorial campaign. The unions will not accept the proposal, and
it is disruptive to introduce it into labor negotiations when the
mayor is approaching the end of his time in office one way or
another. It would be far better for him, in dealing with
public-employee unions, to use wage increases to push for general
productivity gains, as he has in the past, instead of singling out
a minority of workers for merit raises.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also wants workers to pick up some of their medical
costs, as is common in private industry. Additionally, he wants the
board of education, in return for more money, to turn over some of
the city's worst-performing schools and some summer programs to
private contractors, and has set aside $6 million for a school
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   The budget's most serious flaw is that it leaves a long-term
financial imbalance largely in place. The mayor's own projections
show the city running deficits in excess of $2 billion by 2002. By
cutting taxes, the plan would make those deficits worse. It
proposes to use the current surplus to cover ordinary operating
expenses over the next two years _ another fiscally imprudent idea.
The surplus is temporary. Sound budget policy would use it to pay
off debt or create a ``rainy day'' fund to offset the revenue loss
from a future slide on Wall Street or an economic downturn. The
plan does little to bring the city's long-term spending in line
with expected revenues. The longer the imbalance is allowed to
fester, the steeper and harsher the eventual cuts will be.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts and tough stance toward unions will play well in
Giuliani's senatorial campaign. But however well the plan serves
the mayor's political ambitions, it will leave his successor with a
needlessly deep financial hole.

POLICE CONFISCATE FIRST CAR UNDER RECKLESS DRIVING POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn man accused of driving a Buick LeSabre at
117 miles per hour early Thursday became the first person to lose
his car under a new city policy aimed at confiscating the vehicles
of reckless drivers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, identified by police as Peter Ruggeri, 38, of 112
Avenue T, was pulled over by two highway unit officers at 2:40 a.m.
as he sped west on the Belt Parkway near the Flatbush Avenue exit,
a stretch of roadway where the speed limit is 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruggeri's four-door 1988 LeSabre was pulled over, he was
charged with reckless endangerment, a felony punishable by seven
years in prison upon conviction, and reckless driving, a
misdemeanor, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also charged with driving while intoxicated, a
misdemeanor. Police said that they administered a Breathalyzer test
after detecting alcohol on his breath and that Ruggeri had a blood
alcohol level of 0.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, police were citing the case as a prime
example of why reckless drivers should face charges and the loss of
their cars, a policy that is closely modeled on the nearly year-old
city program of seizing the vehicles of drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ruggeri was pulled over about 100 yards from where a
reckless driving incident occurred Jan. 16 in which two young
people died when a Mercedes-Benz traveling at least 73 mph slammed
into the compact car in which they were riding.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kelleher, the first deputy police commissioner, called
Thursday's arrest ``a perfect example of what our aggressive
enforcement policy is all about, getting people off the highways
and taking their cars from them if they don't show the
responsibility to utilize them properly.'' He added, ``we did what
we thought was the correct thing in taking his vehicle away from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggeri remained in custody Thursday afternoon awaiting
arraignment. New York Department of Motor Vehicle records show that
he has one conviction for speeding in Brooklyn in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to records from the Department of Motor Vehicles in
Florida, where Ruggeri lived before moving to Brooklyn and where
his Buick was registered, he was charged twice with driving while
under the influence of alcohol and on separate occasions faced
speeding and other charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Word of the first arrest under the reckless driving crackdown
drew criticism from Norman Siegel, the executive director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union, who contends that the program is
unfair and not based on state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's fundamentally flawed, the initiative, because
you're supposed to have your day in court before the government can
punish you,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Liberties Union has already filed suit on behalf of
drivers whose cars were seized as a result of the drunken driving
policy, but the program has withstood two court challenges. Siegel
said the reckless driving policy might be more vulnerable to a
legal challenge because arrests and car seizures in such cases _
for example when a driver has been spotted weaving in and out of
traffic _ are based on subjective observations by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The police, however, have countered that before arresting
drivers and confiscating cars, officers look for signs of
potentially lethal driving _ either three dangerous moves or
traveling at twice the speed limit. Police then later decide
whether to seek forfeiture of the car in a civil action, a course
they say they could take even if the driver is acquitted of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher and other police officials marveled that no one was
hurt by Ruggeri on Thursday before he was pulled over. Although his
LeSabre is 12 years old, Kelleher said it had reached a speed far
above the safe level for a highway like the narrow and curvy Belt
Parkway. Officers followed Ruggeri's car, police said, clocking him
on their speedometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember the Belt Parkway and other roads like
this were built many, many years ago,'' he said. ``They are not
meant to be traveled on at such speeds, with bumps and gaps and
such. Even if it was a flat road, which it is not, it would have
been dangerous.''

 &HT;    Somber memory, happy ending
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the one story Eddie George has refused to talk
about this Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't discuss it,'' the Tennessee running back said politely
but uncomfortably as he was leaving an interview session for
Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV match-up with the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The week preceding the championship game is all about festivity,
grand expectation and crowning glory. It's a time to think of
reward, not loss, and it was one reason George wouldn't stray from
the warmth of the spotlight to what has become one of life's
darkest moments for so many other families . . . and almost his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Few NFL players have a tighter bond with a parent than the
former Heisman Trophy winner from Ohio State does with his mother.
After splitting up with her husband in 1981, Donna George raised
her two young children _ Eddie and his sister, Leslie _ on her own.
She worked as a model and, Thursday, she told of how she brought
both kids to fashion shoots and made them sit backstage doing their
homework as she worked the runway.
</P>
<P>
   She's the one who later packed her balking, begging, blubbering
15-year-old son into her aging orange Mustang and drove him from
their Philadelphia home to Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia
so he would get some discipline and higher goals in his life.
</P>
<P>
   And 15 years ago, she was the one who began a career as a TWA
flight attendant. It provided her with the financial means to keep
her son in that private prep school, a tenure that straightened out
his life, got him into Ohio State and gave him the building blocks
he's used to become one of the NFL's best young running backs.
</P>
<P>
   The story George stiff-arms back into the past happened in the
summer of 1996. Just two days before he was to sign his first pro
contract _ a five-year deal worth about $7 million _ his mom was
scheduled to work a July 17 flight from New York to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   The jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing everyone
on board.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Donna wasn't on board was because of that strong
bond with her son. After two months of arduous contract
negotiations, Lamont Smith, Eddie's agent, wanted Donna there when
her son signed the deal that would change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Smith called Donna twice and each time she refused him, saying
she was scheduled to fly. He kept insisting, playing on how she
always had been the rudder on Eddie's ship and how now he needed
more direction than ever before. Finally Donna relented. Instead of
Paris, she would go to Texas for the signing.
</P>
<P>
   She was still in Philadelphia when a friend called and told her
to turn on CNN. Learning of the crash, she went numb. She had
several friends on the flight _ including flight attendant Paula
Carven, a single parent who was flying with her own 9-year-old son
_ and the memories haunted her.
</P>
<P>
   In a private moment Thursday, her son finally admitted the
memories unsettle him as well: ``I still thank God my mother was
kept safe. I just can't imagine . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Smith can. He knows how close mother and son are and he knows
how sensitive Eddie George is. ``I think it would have destroyed
his career,'' Smith once told a Houston newspaper. ``I don't think
he would have played football again.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that had happened, the unlikely Titans almost certainly
would not be in the Super Bowl. In his first four pro seasons,
George has become one of the most prolific running backs in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   He was the NFL's Rookie of the Year in 1996 and, in each of the
three seasons since, he's been voted to the Pro Bowl. Coming into
this season, he'd rushed for 4,061 yards. This regular season he
had 1,304 rushing yards and 458 yards in pass catches, and has
added another 354 rushing yards in the Titans three postseason
wins.
</P>
<P>
   As much as what he's done on the field, he's been an equal force
off of it. ``One of the concerns I had going into this season was
that I thought we lacked leadership,'' said Tennessee coach Jeff
Fisher. ``Our group of guys would do anything for you, but we
needed someone to stick his head up above the clouds and take
charge. Eddie did it for us this year and it had profound impact,
especially on our young guys like Jevon Kearse.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walter Payton died this fall, George approached Fisher _
who had been one of Payton's Chicago Bears teammates _ and asked
the coach to talk to him about Sweetness. Fisher said he told him
that Payton ``always wanted to play the perfect game and live the
perfect life.'' It was a philosophy George soon adopted for his
own.
</P>
<P>
   During the playoffs, George has become the vocal leader on he
sidelines. Last Sunday, he gathered his teammates just before
kick-off and, mixing a scowl with a from-the-heart plea, he urged:
``Go out there, kick some (butt) and play like it's our day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans did and now they're in the Super Bowl. In the
process, Eddie George is working his way onto the NFL marquee long
reserved for elite backs like Terrell Davis, Emmitt Smith and Barry
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I stand among the rankings of the elite
backs,'' George said. ``But I know people are beginning to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Even Amin Bey, a 13-year-old Atlanta kid who won a Weekly Reader
essay contest about the Super Bowl. His prize was an exclusive
interview with George and Thursday morning he got it at the Titans'
Buckhead hotel.
</P>
<P>
   After a few prepared questions, Amin ad-libbed a final: ``I play
running back for my team. You got any pointers for me?''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans back nodded and told him to have fun. As the boy
turned to leave, George suddenly thought of something else and
called him back: ``And make the most of the breaks you're given in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George still wouldn't get into that one story, but as you
listened, you sensed he was telling how it ended . . . for him.

 &HT;    CLINTON CALLS ON NATION TO 'SET GREAT GOALS'

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Challenging a prosperous nation to strengthen its
future by aiding its poor, President Clinton called Thursday for
$350 billion in tax breaks aimed at helping low-income families
gain a grubstake in the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of unprecedented wealth and budget surpluses, Clinton
said, the country can afford to help the millions of families still
struggling to get by, even as it commits to paying down the biggest
portion of the federal debt by 2013 and shoring up Social Security
and Medicare for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for a new slate of gun controls, including
the requirement that purchasers first pass a firearms safety course
before being issued a license to buy a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth and final State of the Union address before
Congress and a national television audience, Clinton cast the
occasional backward glance at his term in office, hoping to obscure
the pall of scandal lingering over his tenure spent presiding over
seven years of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans,'' he declared with evident pride, ``the
state of our union is the strongest it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of his 90-minute speech, however, looked forward
aggressively. Clinton asked his countrymen to embrace a broad array
of goals unlikely to be met until long after he leaves the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight let us take our look long ahead, and set great goals
for our nation,'' said Clinton, speaking in the cavernous House
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``America again has the confidence to dream big dreams,''
Clinton said as Al Gore, his vice president and possible successor,
sat behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be
forever young,'' Clinton said. ``That is our destiny, and this is
our moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning from national destiny to personal legacy, Clinton
portrayed his own time in office as a record of achievement
mirroring, even largely responsible for, the nation's broader
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthier, more influential and more secure than at any time in
its history, the country has traveled a richly blessed road,
Clinton said, since he first took office in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,'' said
Clinton. ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much
prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and
so few external threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Not content simply to let the clock run out on his waning
presidency, though, Clinton dropped back and threw long. Calling
for ``a 21st century American Revolution,'' he admonished the
nation to adopt seven dozen separate goals and initiatives, from
improving elementary schools and preserving federal lands to
combating hate crimes at home and bringing peace to foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans immediately denounced Clinton's agenda
as a budget-busting approach that set the country on a course of
big government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enacted all the new programs the president has talked
about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more
expensive government,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
before Clinton's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the past is any judge of today, it is going to be spending
after spending after spending, which proves my point,'' Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, told
reporters in Nashua, N.H. ``If there is money left in Washington it
is going to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and clearly enjoying himself, Clinton shrugged off such
sentiments Thursday night, leaving the political fights he knows
await him for another day.
</P>
<P>
   While he appeared engaged, Clinton's speech also lacked much of
the tension that invigorated his past two State of the Union
addresses, both given under the duress of a 15-month scandal over
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Clinton drew on a cast of Americans for
symbols of the triumphs and tragedies the nation has borne on his
watch.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the NATO air campaign he spearheaded last year
against Serb forces in Kosovo, Clinton led the Congress in a
standing ovation for U.S. Air Force Capt. John Cherrey, who was
awarded the Silver Star for courage in his efforts to rescue an
American pilot downed over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also paid tribute to a grand old man of the Democratic
Party, his former Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen. The Texan, who
suffered a stroke in 1998, struggled to raise his right hand in an
emotional response to Clinton's gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to the issue of race relations, Clinton acknowledged the
contributions made by former Atlanta Braves slugger Hank Aaron, a
pioneer in African-American participation in professional sports,
who was seated at a place of honor directly to Mrs. Clinton's
right.
</P>
<P>
   And, in one of the most dramatic moments of the speech, Clinton
introduced Tom Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was one of 12 students
killed last April by a pair of armed teenagers at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a large lapel button with a photo of his late son,
Mauser rose as Clinton implored Congress to approve an ambitious,
and controversial, slate of new gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that his courage and wisdom will move this Congress to
make common-sense gun safety legislation the very next order of
business,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned limits on ammunition clip size, background checks
for sales at gun shows and child safety locks on handguns _ a group
of measures Clinton proposed, the Senate passed, and the House
killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the ante on gun controls, Clinton also asked Congress to
require that handgun purchasers first pass a firearms safety course
and that states issue photo identification cards indicating whether
a potential purchaser had passed a background check.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted much of Thursday night's speech to well-worn
themes: calls for increased spending on the nation's schools,
funding to put additional police on the beat and a so-called
patients' bill of rights, giving increased leverage to sick or
injured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Clinton's message, though, was a clear directive
for the country to dedicate a growing portion of its wealth to help
low-income Americans pay for child care, college tuition and health
care and save, like their higher-paid countrymen, for their
uncertain futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a new economy,'' said Clinton, ticking off the
strengths of the country's commercial machinery set to kick out
more than $9.5 trillion in goods and services this year, and
spinning out record levels of tax revenues that congressional
analysts project will to generate up to $1.9 trillion in federal
budget surpluses over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To 21st century America,'' said Clinton, ``let us pledge that
every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate, ready to
succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work,
and no child will be raised in poverty,'' an admonition that drew
one of many standing ovations during a speech lasting more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Clinton laid out an extensive package of
targeted tax cut proposals, the details of which will be contained
in the 2001 budget recommendations he submits to Congress on Feb.
7.

NO LEWINSKY, NO SCANDAL: CLINTON PUSHES AMBITIOUS AGENDA IN THIS
ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What a difference a year, or two, can make for the
state of the union.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton last addressed Congress a year ago, the
federal government was working with its first budget surplus in
three decades. And the president had been impeached and was on
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, balancing the federal budget was only a
possibility. And Clinton had just wagged his finger at the
television cameras and denied having sex with a White House intern,
a claim he later acknowledged was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton stepped to the rostrum in the House of
Representatives for the eighth and probably final time, delivering
a State of the Union message that lays out an ambitious agenda for
his final months in office.
</P>
<P>
   The president used the nationally televised forum to signal,
once again, that he intends to remain an activist president. He
urged congressional action on his unfinished priorities and a raft
of new proposals. Many of Clinton's new programs are designed to
help low-income Americans, reflecting Clinton's emphasis on
spreading the benefits of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity _ and
therefore, such a profound obligation _ to build the more perfect
union of our founders' dreams,'' Clinton said, borrowing liberally
from the preamble of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lengthy speech carried the unspoken message that his
vision for the nation and its booming economy can best be carried
on by the man television viewers saw perched directly over his
right shoulder, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As titular head of the Senate, Gore sat just behind Clinton and
next to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. For millions watching
from home, there was a visual link between candidate Gore and his
president, whose policy announcements in recent weeks mesh neatly
with Gore's campaign proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As the president described a surging economy, declining crime,
shrinking welfare rolls and U.S. efforts to bring peace to far
corners of the world, Gore led the applause. Clinton, whose legacy
would benefit from Gore's ascension to the White House, singled him
out for praise and credited him with several administration
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for the opportunities the vice president and I
have had to work hard to protect the environment and finally to put
to rest the notion that you can't expand the economy while
protecting the environment,'' Clinton said in one of the five
references to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, many of them facing re-election campaigns this year,
already have put the president on notice that only a handful of
issues are likely to emerge. Republicans are working with only a
five-vote majority in the House, where Democrats see a chance to
take control, a formula that threatens partisan gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Americans ``will have to decide if we are watching a president
taking up the Republican Congress on our offer to work together or
is he simply trying to buy himself a legacy?'' said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said Republicans will ``insulate themselves'' from
charges of being a do-nothing Congress by offering their own
versions of proposals likely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things will get done. They will tend to be relatively
modest, and the rather big things will not be done. And that's not
such a bad proposition,'' Hess said. ``A lot of these programs
should be filtered through another national election to get a
reading on what people viscerally feel about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House and Senate already are proposing
a tax-cut larger than what Clinton wants, a package that would
provide relief for two-earner couples and college students.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to trump Clinton in two key areas of his agenda,
Republican congressional leaders recruited a former educator and a
surgeon to provide the televised GOP response to his State of the
Union speech and to tout their plans for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Bill Frist, R-Tenn., also
promised that their party would work to pay off the $3.6 trillion
national debt in the next 15 years, build a missile defense system,
balance the budget and still cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a former college administrator, repeated the Republican
mantra that better education must come through more local control.
``The debate in Washington is not about money. It's about who makes
the decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, a heart-transplant surgeon, said Republicans would work
to reform Medicare and pass a patients' rights bill that makes
lawsuits against HMOs a last resort. At the same time, he cautioned
against additional federal spending or creation of new
bureaucracies. ``Mr. President, please no more red tape,'' Frist
said in the televised response.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from Republican reaction Thursday night was any mention
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which dominated discussion outside
the House chamber before and after Clinton's last two State of the
Union addresses.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton spoke a year ago, the effort to remove him was
still playing out in the Senate. The House had debated whether to
invite Clinton to speak about the State of the Union, an address
traditionally delivered when Congress returns from its holiday
recess each year.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Clinton spoke to the joint session only days
after reports of his White House trysts with Lewinsky, a former
intern half his age. It was the Lewinsky affair and Clinton's
effort to conceal it that prompted congressional Republicans to
impeach him in the House and put him on trial in the Senate.

THE SCENE: SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ALL ABSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add six new grafs to end of original text.) 
 (With CLINTON-SPEECH) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton
had to be there, and were. The justices of the Supreme did not, and
weren't.
</P>
<P>
   In what may charitably be seen as a remarkable series of
coincidences and scheduling flukes, not one member of the Supreme
Court attended President Clinton's final State of the Union address
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The court sent the justices' regrets in a two-sentence message
to the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justices of the Court had planned to attend the State of the
Union Address, but travel changes and minor illnesses have
intervened,'' the letter stated. ``No Justices will be in
attendance, but they do thank you for the invitation to be present
for the address.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Clinton appointees to the court, Justices Stephen G.
Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, cited health reasons for skipping
the speech. Ginsburg has been undergoing radiation treatment after
colon cancer surgery. Breyer sent Clinton a note saying he wanted
to attend, but was homebound with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens is taking care of his wife, who
recently had hip replacement surgery. Justice Clarence Thomas is in
New Orleans, where his brother died Sunday. Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy has to be in New York to deliver a speech on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation from the court for the absences of
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist or Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   No one takes attendance at the State of the Union, but news
accounts indicate that at least five or six members of the court
have attended each of Clinton's previous addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the entire court missed the speech was in 1986,
when President Reagan hastily rescheduled his State of the Union
after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The court prides itself on its work ethic. In January 1996, when
a storm dumped 2 feet of snow on Washington, the court was the only
government institution in the region to remain open. Rehnquist
dispatched four-wheel-drive police vehicles to fetch members of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no comment on the court's truancy, but
others did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just astonished,'' said Theodore B. Olson, a Washington
attorney and former Justice Department official in the Reagan
administration. ``On the other hand, these things have become so
ritualistic and boring that it would be easy to find more
entertaining alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Olson added, ``enough of them saw what the chief
justice went through during the impeachment trial that they decided
they didn't want to go near the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no more campaigns ahead of him and the justices
serve for life, but Gore and Mrs. Clinton are in the middle of
heated battles for high office. Gore's aides were unhappy with the
image of the vice president standing behind the president and
serving as his chief cheerleader, but there was no way he could
decline to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The event, they winced, served as a visual reminder of the vice
president's subservient role in the Clinton administration as he
essays on the campaign trail to establish his own identity as a
potential president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, aides said, was not expecting a political lift
from the event and was approaching the speech as she has all
previous such addresses, as a chance to make her husband look good.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was careful not to overdo the president's
tributes to his wife and his sidekick. A top adviser said that
speechwriters counted the mentions of Gore in previous State of the
Union addresses (usually from two to four) and tried not to be too
obvious about patting him on the back this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited Gore's contributions five times _ on computer
literacy, expanded health care for poor families, support for gun
control legislation, environmental activism and proposals to
improve the ``livability'' of American cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton got virtually the same salute she gets every year,
for her work on family issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Clinton said a little before the halfway point of
his 9,400-word oration, ``I am especially grateful to the person
who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked
tirelessly for children and families for thirty years now: my wife,
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., said that Thursday night's speech
was unlikely to provide a boost for either Gore or Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this is Clinton being Clinton,'' said Biden, who
is officially neutral in the Democratic presidential race but who
is close to former Sen. Bill Bradley. ``I don't think he's sitting
there thinking of Gore or his wife. I think this is about him going
out big.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was warmly received when he entered the House chamber at
9:13 p.m. ET. He was welcomed with a four-and-a-half-minute
standing ovation from Democrats and Republicans, one of the few
times that they found the same thing to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going, Clinton had the Democratic lawmakers and
Cabinet officers bouncing up and down to applaud his demand that
Congress pass legislation on health maintenance organizations, gun
control, campaign finance reform and the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sat stone-faced through that litany, but did cheer
the president's pledge to pay down the national debt and his
assertion that ``We ended welfare as we knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president drew hoots and laughs when he misspoke in a
passage on a Gore proposal to improve the quality of life in
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' Clinton said, ``the vice president launched a new
effort to help make communities more liberal...'' He meant to say
``livable,'' and drew a guffaw from Gore and knowing smiles from
Republican leaders seated just beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came back with a joke that he had been referring to
``last year's agenda'' and said he was sure that Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``will have something to say'' about
another liberal proposal from the White House.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Delivering his final address to Congress, President
Clinton boasted Thursday night that the state of the union had
never been better and proposed using some of the nation's wealth to
provide modest tax relief for lower- and middle-income Americans,
particularly married ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the
American spirit,'' Clinton said pumping his fists for emphasis.
``Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen
births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent.
Welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years. My
fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has
ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton stepped to the rostrum, the House chamber was
crowded, as always, although the entire Supreme Court was
puzzlingly absent, some without any stated reason. But the drama of
his address a year ago, delivered on the eve of his impeachment
trial, was gone. Instead, Clinton's main adversary was the
calendar, which shows less than a year to go until his successor's
proposals are the ones that matter.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore seated behind his right shoulder and
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the balcony above, Clinton did much to
try to help their political fortunes and the effort of other
Democrats to take back the House from the Republicans who had
impeached him.
</P>
<P>
   So packed full of proposals was the speech that it lasted 89
minutes, breaking Clinton's record of 81 minutes, which he set in
1995's speech. The president also received more than 100 ovations,
far more than he has received in his seven previous State of the
Union addresses.
</P>
<P>
   In one applause-winning proposal, Clinton, as he has done so
often during his tenure, seized an issue dear to the Republicans
and made it his own. He announced a proposal to alleviate the parts
of the tax code that penalize married couples, forcing them to pay
higher rates than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   That makes such a change likely, since Republicans on Capitol
Hill had previously said that ending the marriage penalty was one
of their principal goals this year and had appeared to have enough
Democratic backing to enact it even before Clinton embraced the
measure Thursday night. The proposal was one of a series of tax
cuts that aides said totaled $350 billion over 10 years, measured
against an estimated $2 trillion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement held back until just before the
speech, Clinton urged federal legislation to require state licenses
for all handgun purchases, one of numerous proposals the president
borrowed from Gore. Saying that states now license hunters and
drivers, Clinton recommended similar photo identifications for
handgun buyers once they pass a background check and complete a
gun-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton took credit for the extraordinary health
of the American economy _ and shared credit lavishly with Gore _
while warning that the prosperity not be squandered.
</P>
<P>
   But while last year's address was built around a pledge to save
Social Security before taking any other actions or cutting taxes,
this year, Clinton felt times were good enough to call for both tax
cuts, although modest ones, and more social spending.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, an area in which he hopes to be remembered,
Clinton urged lawmakers to give China most-favored-nation trade
status on a permanent basis, and he reiterated his view that
America must stay engaged in the world, especially with former
adversaries still struggling to enact democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in previous speeches, Clinton devoted far less time to
foreign policy and national security issues than to his domestic
agenda, quickly surveying America's role as a mediator in the
Middle East and Northern Ireland and as a defender of human rights
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the trend toward globalization was ``the central
reality of our time. He called for a new consensus on trade, urging
Congress to pass legislation easing trade barriers with African and
Caribbean nations and to approve the agreement his administration
reached with China last year to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open markets and rules-based trade are the best engines we
know for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and
environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas,''
Clinton said. ``There is only one direction for America on trade:
We must go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia had been held back from its full potential by
economic turmoil and ``a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya''
but said the United States should help ``those Russians struggling
for a democratic, prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president vowed to protect vital computer systems from
cyberattacks and pledged to continue developing a national missile
defense system, although he repeated his previous assurances to
preserve the Antiballistic Missile treaty with Russia. He also
called for ``a constructive bipartisan dialogue'' on the
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, which the Senate voted to reject
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the points he made were not new, but he did announce a
proposal to offer tax credits to pharmaceutical companies to speed
development of vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS in
poorer nations. He also said his budget would include $150 million
to fight disease around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With his speech coming between this week's Iowa caucuses and the
New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, Clinton unveiled a legislative
shopping list aimed to some degree at ensuring his relevance as the
country's attention shifts to the campaign. Time after time during
the speech, Democrats jumped to their feet in applause, while
Republicans responded to many proposals with silence.
</P>
<P>
   Election-year Congresses are notoriously unproductive ones, but
Thursday night Clinton advanced some proposals designed to win
congressional backing this year and other initiatives designed to
linger for the Democrats until well beyond Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great goals, worthy of a great nation,'' Clinton
said in excerpts of the speech released in advance by the White
House. ``We will not reach them all this year. Not even in this
decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first
American revolution was not won with a single shot. The continent
was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history _ and
the lesson of the last seven years _ is that great goals are
reached step by step, building on our progress, always gaining
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   On education, Clinton borrowed heavily from Gore's campaign
platform, proposing $3 billion in new spending for the politically
popular Head Start program and new after-school initiatives, as
well as school construction and enhanced teacher pay. He reiterated
his $31 billion plan to make college more affordable through
enhanced federal grants and by making part of tuition tax
deductible. He has credited Mrs. Clinton with twisting him arm to
make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our
faith that every child can learn,'' he said. ``Because education is
more than ever key to our children's future, we must make sure that
all our children have that key. That means universal preschool and
after-school, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and
college opportunities for all our children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's proposals have been suggested before but
have never gained traction in Congress. Clinton urged renewed
action on ``unfinished business,'' including hate-crimes
legislation, a minimum wage increase from $5.15 an hour, a bill of
rights to give patients more say with their health maintenance
organizations, and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, the father of a teen-age boy killed last April at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was one of the guests
invited to sit beside Mrs. Clinton in the balcony. The president's
speech pushed the gun-control measures that Congress failed to act
on last year, along with money to enhance the enforcement of
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The president's licensing proposal stands little chance of
passage this year, and raises constitutional issues, but it put
Clinton clearly in Gore's corner in the presidential campaign, in
which former Sen. Bill Bradley has touted his gun control proposals
as more effective than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years _ the
longest decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped
to forge on community police, sensitive gun control and effective
prevention,'' the president said. ``But nobody believes America is
safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the
safest big country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's tax-relief ideas would supplement working
families' retirement savings, assist with child care expenses,
encourage charitable giving and make up to $10,000 of college
tuition tax deductible. In another helping hand, Clinton proposed
$21 billion to expand the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of undoing the marriage penalty is always politically
popular. But the president's plan, which would be phased in over a
decade and would double the standard deduction for two-income
couples to twice the amount of a single filer's deduction, is more
limited than various Republican proposals. It would not benefit
couples who itemize on their returns.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed measures to encourage drug companies
to develop vaccines to combat AIDS and tuberculosis. He pushed
again for prescription-drug benefits under Medicare, one of a
handful of health care proposals. And he vowed to pay off the debt
by 2013 _ two years ahead of his previous predictions _ and resist
reckless spending that chips away at Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In another reach to Gore, the president talked about global
warming, an issue that he has said the vice president often brings
up with him. The president proposed giving tax incentives to
businesses for the production of clean energy and to families that
buy energy-saving appliances, automobiles and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, deadly
waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will be
flooded, economies disrupted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one of his biggest legislative defeats last year,
Clinton called for a ``bipartisan dialogue'' on the comprehensive
test ban treaty, conciliatory language indicating that he did not
intend to push the matter again. He stressed the importance of
engaging countries like China and Russia, which still maintains a
nuclear-missile arsenal. And he addressed the dangers of biological
warfare and ``cyberterrorism,'' without offering any specific
solutions to those dangers.
</P>
<P>
   One facet of Clinton's vision of a ``new America'' entails
closing what he has called the ``digital divide.'' He renewed his
requests for government aid to help poor people gain access to
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In length and breadth, the speech reflected Clinton's basically
centrist political instincts, the advice of many people in the
White House and on Capitol Hill _ and the president's desire to
savor his last big moment in the spotlight before the nation's
attention turns inevitably to the next president.

FAMILY WATCHING A SPEECH STILL SEES SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOUND BROOK, N.J. _ Al Gomolka thinks President Clinton has done
a good job managing the economy and gave him credit in foreign
affairs, for requiring background checks for gun purchases and for
having a strong foreign policy. But he cannot buy the president's
support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Shelley Gomolka, agreed with the president on equal
rights issues, particularly for women and for abortion rights, and
she was willing to admit that the Clinton administration has done a
good job managing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Gomolkas let their two older boys stay up a little later
than usual Thursday night to watch Clinton's final State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
   The couple often agreed with the president, but their views of
the president had been obscured by the president's moral scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``His moral character is just pitiful,'' said Mrs. Gomolka, 44,
a part-time landscape horticulturalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that economic issues aren't too bad,'' she
said, ``and I agree with him on women's rights, but it bothers me
that so many people say `Well, he did okay' and then vote for
him.'' The couple has three boys, Joshua, Jacob and Isaac.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has started thinking about how American families will
remember him, he could start with the Gomolkas.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they expressed much of the unspoken mix of often
contradictory feelings and beliefs about politics and public
policy.
</P>
<P>
   They are both lifelong Democrats but voted for Ronald Reagan
twice, for Ross Perot in 1992 and for Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gomolka said he believes he is ``on the conservative side,'' but
plans to vote for Bill Bradley, who is considered a liberal, if
Bradley wins the Democratic presidential nomination, because of his
tenure as a U.S. senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly believes in the right to own firearms, but he nodded
approvingly when the president spoke of the success of the Brady
Bill gun control measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brady law was good,'' Gomolka said. ``It may bother the
criminals but to the person who just wants a recreational gun it's
not going to bother them how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is charismatic, they agreed, and persuasive, yet
his words Thursday were often discounted because of his record of
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it all sounds great, but it's just hard to believe
him,'' Mrs. Gomolka said, interrupting herself when the president
stopped to acknowledge his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh puh-leez, look at him smile,'' Mrs. Gomolka said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to truthfulness, and I have to ask, where
does fidelity come into all this?'' she said. ``It all just comes
down to credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president ticked off his agenda, the bread-and-butter
economic issues hit home in the Gomolka household.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are solidly middle-class, with excellent medical
coverage and a generous pension for Gomolka, they are worried about
money and wish for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about helping low-income people but if she doesn't
work for two days, we're living paycheck to paycheck,'' Gomolka
said.
</P>
<P>
   And when the president urged a law to guarantee equal pay for
women, Gomolka picked up: his sister, Susie, works at one of New
Jersey's big pharmaceutical companies and often complains of
earning less than men in equal positions.
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits for college tuition also won praise from the couple,
but they were also concerned that, however bright the president's
promises, they might never become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all sounds good but I'd like to see it in writing,''
Gomolka said. ``It doesn't matter how good it sounds if he is not
going to be around to make it happen.''

REPUBLICANS ASSAIL PRESIDENT'S SPENDING PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 3rd graf for new Hastert quote) 
(With CLINTON-SPEECH) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on Thursday assailed the agenda
President Clinton outlined for his last year in office as
spendthrift, and heralded the GOP as the true steward of fiscal
responsibility, guardian of the elderly and champion of millions of
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton delivered his last State of the Union
address on Thursday evening, Republicans seized on details that
seeped out during the day to warn voters that Democrats could not
be trusted to oversee the nation's prosperity and the federal
budget surpluses that have accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that if you listen carefully, what you'll hear is a
litany of spending,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential front-runner, told a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in
Nashua, N.H. ``If the past is any judge of today, it is going to be
spending after spending after spending, which proves my point. If
there is money left in Washington, it is going to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, expressing amazement at proposed
initiatives that range from a $50 million plan to clean up the
Great Lakes to $20 million to fight infectious diseases, said: ``As
Washington digs out of the latest winter blizzard, the Congress
will dig out of an avalanche of presidential spending initiatives.
We will sift through the president's requests and make a
determination what is necessary and what is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's reaction from Republicans previewed the
year-long battle between the two parties over how best to use the
trillions of dollars in projected surpluses _ already a core theme
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have vowed to protect Social Security and pay down
the $3.6 trillion national debt, but Democrats would use much of
the non-Social Security surplus to boost spending on domestic
programs, while Republicans are eager to plow much of that money
into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For the televised Republican response to Clinton, however, party
leaders picked Sens. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Susan Collins of
Maine, experts on health care and education, issues usually
associated with Democrats. The choice underscored Republicans'
desire to show a moderate face on two issues that have emerged as
immensely popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators took dramatically different approaches. Collins
never even mentioned Clinton or the more than $3 billion in
education spending increases he proposed. She indirectly criticized
the administration for ``dictating to communities how they should
run their schools,'' advocating instead pushing more control over
education decisions to local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans want what all parents want for their children's
schools: more federal help but less federal interference,'' Collins
said in remarks prepared for her response.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Frist, a physician, repeatedly attacked Clinton's
health-care proposals, including a $110 billion health-care package
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time he proposed a health plan was seven years ago,''
Frist said in remarks prepared for his response, referring to the
ill-fated effort headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``And then it
amounted to a federal government takeover of our entire health
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frist also edged closer to embracing a version of two
Democratic health-care proposals _ a patients' bill of rights that
allows patients to sue their health-care plan under certain
conditions, and expanding Medicare to include prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep doctors first, lawyers second,'' Frist
said of the Republican plan to regulate health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers in tough re-election fights were quick to
embrace Clinton's education and health-care aims, while distancing
themselves from domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am in agreement with many of his goals _ for example,
improving the quality of education for our children and creating
some kind of prescription drug benefit for America's seniors _
generally it is important that we restrict increases in spending,
lest we seriously slow our economic growth,'' said Sen. William V.
Roth Jr. of Delaware, who heads the Finance Committee and is facing
a bruising campaign this fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Virtually absent from Thursday night's Republican reaction was
any mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which dominated
discussion outside the chamber at the last two State of the Union
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   And while Republicans were not ready to give Clinton a hearty
send-off, some lawmakers held out a symbolic olive branch, partly
perhaps to avoid being labeled a ``do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, including Representative David Dreier of
California, cheered Clinton's support for bringing China into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said Dreier, who heads the House Rules
Committee. ``Republicans will work in good faith with this
president and every Democrat in Congress who puts ideas ahead of
politics.''

COWBOYS' HEAD COACH FOCUSES ON STAFF OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dave Campo spent his first day on the job as the
Cowboys' head coach in discussions about his staff.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-kept secrets around Valley Ranch these days involve
the hiring of Jack Reilly as offensive coordinator and the
promotion of secondary coach Mike Zimmer to defensive coordinator,
announcements that more than likely will come early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, New England's quarterbacks coach the past two seasons
after a one-year stint with the Cowboys in a similar capacity in
1997, has spent this week at the Cowboys' offices meeting with
owner Jerry Jones, and now Campo.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 54, will bring in the Norv Turner/Ernie Zampese offense
that Troy Aikman has enjoyed his greatest success while winning
three Super Bowls during the 1990s. Zampese is expected to be used
in some advisory capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Two characteristics of this offense are spreading the field and
throwing the ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief,'' Aikman said, ``is that if you think you can just
line up and run the football down people's throats, and not be able
to throw the football, you're going to struggle,'' adding that the
Cowboys during their Super Bowl years ``were able to run the ball
... but we also were able to throw the football very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Chan Gailey, the Cowboys ranked eighth offensively and
16th in the NFL in 1998 and 1999, respectively. They slipped under
the league average (21.5) in touchdown passes with 20 this season
en route to an 8-8 record and a first-round loss in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis over the past couple of years has been placed on
the running game,'' said Aikman, a proponent of the offense that
Reilly will bring to the Cowboys. ``We have not been as proficient
as we need to be in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved one thing last year. And that is that you can run
the football pretty good and not score points, and lose games.
You've got to be able to make big plays to score points ... and
that's what has lacked in our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he wants the 2000 Cowboys to have ``a pass
mentality.'' Campo said he wants to ``attack defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a member of the NFL's influential Competition Committee,
has reasoned: ``We go into those meetings and set up rules to make
the passing game go. That's where a lot of the excitement \Rof the
game\S is, so we're going to be very aggressive in the passing game
and make sure that it's emphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo made it clear that he is on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a defensive coach,'' said the Cowboys' longtime defensive
specialist, ``I've studied every scheme that you can throw against
a team, every situation for 11 years in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that I can bring that to this football team,
supporting the offensive coordinator, whoever that may be.''
Briefly Cornerback/punt returner Deion Sanders underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery Monday to repair meniscus cartilage
damage. The procedure was done in Florida. Sanders will miss next
week's Pro Bowl in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys coach Chan Gailey interviewed with the New
Orleans Saints Wednesday. If he is unable to land the Saints'
head-coaching job, he then most likely will take a position as
offensive coordinator (or pass-offense coach) with either Miami,
New Orleans or Atlanta.

PATAKI OPPOSES REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Republican leaders in the state Senate proposed
Thursday that the state pick up all costs incurred by local
governments, including New York City, to provide coverage for
hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who do not have medical
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Republican leaders puts them at odds with their
chief ally in the Capitol, Gov. George Pataki, who has argued that
the state should not foot the entire bill for providing medical
coverage to low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan is intended to quell a storm of protest that
erupted from local government officials in December when Pataki and
legislative leaders from both parties agreed to create a new health
insurance program for low-income residents, with the costs of the
program equally divided between the state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have increasingly complained that their share of
the new insurance costs _ about $340 million over the next 3 1-2
years _ would ultimately force them to choose between two
undesirable options: raising local taxes or cutting crucial
services.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal is similar to one that has been made by
Democrats in the Legislature, placing greater political pressure on
Pataki to endorse it or face taking the blame for creating huge
fiscal burdens for local governments. New York City's share would
total about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the majority leader in the Republican-dominated
Senate, said Thursday that the state could afford to pick up the
cost of the entire program because of a projected budget surplus of
at least $1 billion this fiscal year, which ends on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said that he would push for his proposal to be part of any
final state budget agreement between the governor and the
Legislature. He contended that it was the state's responsibility to
``take that extra burden off the backs of county taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pataki administration responded coolly to the proposal,
even going so far as to privately suggest that the governor would
call for cuts in other programs dear to the Legislature to pay for
the Senate Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office also released a statement in which Pataki
said that he had saved local governments more than $3 billion over
the last five years through his policies, chief among them his
drive to restrain state and local spending for Medicaid, the
program that provides medical care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democratic leaders in the state Assembly responded
with delight, seeing an opportunity to draw Republicans to their
side in their annual fight with the governor over enacting a state
budget. Richard Gottfried, the chairman of the Assembly's Health
Committee, said that Democrats had pushed for a plan similar to the
one that Republicans in the Senate proposed Thursday, only to be
rejected by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of not having a local share was an Assembly
position from the start,'' said Gottfried, a Democrat from
Manhattan. ``I welcome the Senate on board. I think they are in the
best position to bring the governor on board.''
</P>
<P>
   The groundswell of complaints across the state is particularly
troublesome for Pataki because it involves Republican county
executives, who wield great influence within their party and
represent suburban and upstate constituencies that played crucial
roles in Pataki's victories in the 1994 and 1998 races for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Gregory, the executive director of the New York
Association of Counties, applauded the proposal by the Senate.
``Counties have limited resources,'' he said. ``If more revenue is
needed, the only place for counties to go is a sales tax or a
property tax'' increase.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance program at the center of the dispute was created
in December after a series of protracted negotiations between
Pataki, Bruno and Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who is speaker of the
Assembly. It is one of the most ambitious efforts in recent memory
to deal with the growing number _ now more than three million _ of
medically uninsured New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for providing free coverage to families earning
up to 150 percent of the federal poverty line, meaning that a
family of four with an annual income of $25,000 or less could
receive coverage without paying premiums. The program would cost
nearly $700 million in federal funds over the next 3 1-2 years. The
plan also requires $700 million in state and local funds over the
same period. The localities and the state would split those costs
evenly _ if the Senate plan unveiled Thursday is not approved.
</P>
<P>
   The state expects as many as 500,000 uninsured New Yorkers to
apply for medical coverage over the next 3 1-2 years as a result of
the health care initiative. The state plans to pay for its share of
the insurance costs with revenue from a new 55-cent cigarette tax,
as well as a share of the $400 million a year that it is to receive
from the nation's settlement with tobacco companies.

STATE PHOTO CARD PROPOSED TO REGULATE NEW HANDGUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-SPEECH)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Thursday night proposed a
nationwide system to regulate all future handgun purchases that
would rely on the states to issue licenses with photographs but
only to prospective buyers who could show they had no criminal
records and had passed gun safety courses.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the proposal, already embodied in
several bills in Congress, was intended to put handgun ownership on
a similar footing with state licensing of drivers and hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the proposal _ using the states to administer a
licensing system that would apply only to future handgun purchases
_ is identical to the campaign proposal of Vice President Al Gore,
who stood, smiling contentedly, behind the president during
Thursday night's speech. Gore's opponent for the Democratic
nomination, Bill Bradley, has proposed not only licensing
purchasers but all handguns themselves, including the tens of
millions in existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years _ the
longest decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped
forge on community police, sensible gun control, and effective
prevention,'' Clinton said in the speech, to robust applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody believes America is safe enough,'' he said. ``So
let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the safest big country
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, which would probably face significant
Republican opposition, quickly raised difficult questions about the
authority of Washington to use the states as an instrument to
enforce federal laws. In June 1997, the Supreme Court narrowly
struck down a provision of the so-called Brady Law that required
state officials to conduct background checks of prospective handgun
purchasers. The court, which in recent years has been involved in a
profound debate about the relationship between the states and the
federal government, said that the Brady Law provision improperly
trampled on state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said Thursday night that they thought
the president's proposal would not run afoul of the 1997 decision,
Printz vs. United States, because states would not be required to
issue the licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made sure that state participation would be optional,
not mandated,'' said a senior White House official who asked not to
be identified. ``In states that choose not to participate, we will
have federally approved gun dealers or some other federal entity
would be used instead to issue the licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The official also said there would likely be some provision that
would reimburse the states for the cost of administering the
license program.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Jackson, a law professor at Georgetown University and an
authority on state-federal questions, said such a proposal might
well be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson said that the state of the law was in great flux but
that ``if the states really have a choice and they can turn down
the money for the program and it won't affect their getting money
for other programs, it might not be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that the states could not be forced to
administer such a program, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drew immediate criticism from the National Rifle
Association, whose executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said
it revealed the Clinton administration's true agenda of eventually
confiscating handguns throughout the nation.

CLINTON PROPOSES FAR-REACHING PLAN ON DRUGS AND THE UNINSURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS throughout to update text, flesh out proposals, add
details; no pickup.) 
 (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed an ambitious,
multifaceted health care agenda Wednesday night, calling on
Congress to provide prescription drugs to the elderly, new
government subsidies to help people buy health insurance, new tax
breaks for long-term care and a new federal law to define the
rights of people in health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton urged Congress to
``give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for
prescription drugs.'' But contrary to expectations, he did not
dwell on this proposal, and he did not accuse drug companies of
charging excessive prices, as he often has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's restraint may have indicated that he wanted to work
with Republicans and the drug industry to forge a compromise on
Medicare drug benefits. Or it may simply have reflected the fact
that his speech was packed with dozens of proposals on health care,
education, gun control and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, drug company lobbyists were saying they feared the
president would attack their industry before a national television
audience, but the attack never came. Alan F. Holmer, president of
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, was asked
for comment tonight, but had no immediate reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The president proposed a new tax credit for pharmaceutical
companies that develop vaccines and drugs to prevent or treat AIDS,
malaria, and other diseases afflicting millions of people in the
third world.
</P>
<P>
   He also highlighted his request to spend more on mental health
care, as recommended by Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al
Gore. And without giving details, Clinton said he wanted government
action to prevent medical errors that harm tens of thousands of
people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said Clinton would ask Congress to dedicate nearly $400
billion of the expected budget surplus over the next decade to
shore up the finances of Medicare and to help pay the cost of new
outpatient drug benefits for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the White House disclosed many of the
president's health care proposals. But Wednesday night, Clinton
discussed the package as a whole and wrapped it together with a
common theme.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. When Clinton unveiled his pharmaceutical plan
in June, he said it would cost $118 billion over 10 years. But the
Congressional Budget Office said the cost would exceed $165
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that all Medicare beneficiaries should have access
to an affordable option for insurance coverage of prescription drug
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern
medicine,'' Clinton said Wednesday night. ``No one creating a
Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for
prescription drugs. Yet, more than three in five of our seniors now
lack dependable drug coverage, which can lengthen and enrich their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The president referred to drug prices in only one sentence of
his speech, and did not call for government price controls.
``Millions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most
pay the highest prices for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In good conscience, Clinton said, ``we cannot let another year
pass without extending to all seniors the lifeline of affordable
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests invited to Wednesday night's session was Pat
Brown of Johnson City, Tenn., a retiree who spends $4,000 of her
savings each year on prescription drugs for heart and thyroid
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's health care proposals will set the tone this year for
campaign debates and will influence the agenda of Congress.
Republicans, while favoring different approaches, said Wednesday
night that they wanted to address many of the problems cataloged by
Clinton: the growing number of Americans without health insurance,
the frustrations of HMO patients and the desperation of elderly
people seeking affordable prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already laid some groundwork for legislation on
these issues, and many of the president's proposals have some
election-year appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   One new item in Clinton's package was a proposal for a tax
credit to accelerate the development of vaccines for malaria,
tuberculosis and AIDS. Jennings said the tax credit would create an
incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in development
of vaccines for poor countries, which often cannot afford to buy
the vaccines they need.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and the House passed different versions of
legislation defining patients' rights last year. But only the House
version, which would make it easier for patients to sue HMOs for
injuries, is acceptable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Wednesday night that any legislation on
this issue must include ``an enforcement mechanism, to ensure
recourse for patients who have been harmed as a result of a health
plan's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The president asked Congress Wednesday night to help millions of
Americans get health insurance by creating new tax breaks and by
expanding existing programs. He would, for example, let parents
enroll in a children's health program created in 1997. These
initiatives, taken together, would cost $110 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That would be ``the largest investment in health care in the 35
years since the creation of Medicare,'' Clinton said.

LONGHORNS AND AGGIES JOIN FORCES ON RAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You know things are good with the St. Louis Rams when
former Aggies players and ex-Longhorns players are pulling in the
same direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' improbable ascent from a 4-12 last-place team in 1998
to NFL's biggest showcase in this season has former Texas players
Taje Allen (third-year cornerback) and Derek Lewis (rookie tight
end) and former Texas A&AMP;M standouts Cameron Spikes (rookie guard)
and Rich Coady (rookie safety) doing their best rendition of ``we
are the world'' togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's more like ``we are in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat up on Taje and Derek after Texas A&AMP;M beat Texas,''
said Coady, who went to high school at Richardson Pearce.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are teammates now. We are all just happy to be in the
Super Bowl. I went to three Super Bowls as a fan growing up. Coming
as a player has always been a dream. To be here is exciting to
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spikes echoed Coady's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing bigger than the Super Bowl,'' Spikes said.
``Playing in the NFL has been my dream since starting playing
football as a kid. But to be here is unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Spikes and Coady, who were part of Texas A&AMP;M's improbable
Big 12 title-game victory over Kansas State last year, this is also
not the first time Lewis and Allen have experienced the feeling of
achieving something no one else thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a Lubbock native, and Lewis, from New Orleans, were on
the Longhorns' team that shocked two-time defending national
champion Nebraska in the 1996 Big 12 championship game. Lewis, a
member of the Rams' practice squad, made the catch on the
now-famous fourth-down pass that sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   While those moments were special, each of the four says those
games don't even come close to the Super Bowl experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Nebraska victory was something else,'' said Allen, who
suffered through two lean years in St. Louis. ``But nothing
compares to the Super Bowl. The Rams have been losing for a long
time. To do what we did this year is unbelievable. We are trying to
savor the moment. We've got a chance to win this thing and be the
world champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, known as much for his comedic flair at Texas as his play,
gives the game its proper spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can touch this, man,'' Lewis said. ``This is the show.
This is the biggest show on earth here. What is it, 800 million?
Billions are going to be watching. It's going to be China, Japan
and Australia. Man, this is bigger than Ringling Brothers in their
prime. You dream about going to the show. This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Aggies and Longhorns living together in harmony.

ANALYSIS: A BUDGET THAT LOOKS BEYOND THE 5 BOROUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Thursday that
he was not proposing anything in his new budget ``for political
purposes'' and was ``very offended'' that people could think
otherwise, the response from city Democrats was a collective roll
of the eyes. The mayor's budget, Democrats said, was an even more
political document than usual, with an income tax cut and an
aggressive stance toward unions aimed at the upstate and suburban
voters Giuliani needs in his undeclared United States Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics? What politics?'' said a facetious Peter Vallone, the
speaker of the City Council, in his reaction to Giuliani's spending
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although budgets are always political maps in which mayors lay
out their priorities and vision, Giuliani's newest spending plan,
full of the surpluses of prosperous times and seemingly with
something for everyone, is different from his other budgets in that
it reaches beyond the five boroughs to appeal to voters statewide.
The mayor's call for a 16 percent reduction in the municipal income
tax rate, although benefiting city workers only, would, for
example, burnish his credentials across New York as a tax-cutting
Republican who understands the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love cutting taxes,'' Giuliani said, then concluded with a
defense of the kind of supply side economics not usually embraced
in an overwhelmingly Democratic city: ``So, tax cutting can produce
more revenues. You need to think about it a little, but thinking
about it is really what makes for intelligent human beings.'' If
people cannot understand the relationship between reduced taxes and
an improved economy, the mayor said, ``then you should be studying
the economy of Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists generally viewed Giuliani's budget as
smart Senate politics intended to put the mayor just to the right
of center. ``Who is he talking to when he talks tax cuts?'' said
Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant. ``He's not
talking to Manhattan liberals, who aren't going to vote for him.
He's talking to outer-borough Catholics, outer-borough ethnics.
He's talking to people in the suburbs, he's talking to people in
Nassau County. He's telling them he's a good manager and he shares
their values.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who said he did not oppose the income tax cut, which
could take effect as early as July, also said he understood its
purpose. ``If it wasn't an election year, would he have mentioned
it?'' Vallone said. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Giuliani's proposal to give city workers wage
increases based solely on merit, not across the board, will
probably be seen by upstate and suburban voters as a desirable
crackdown on the city's powerful unions. Giuliani was in effect
saying that he is an enemy not of all teachers, just bad teachers.
``The city will not agree to a single-percentage pay increase,''
Giuliani said. ``That era is over.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the city would require, in labor negotiations,
that city workers be offered up to five levels of merit pay
increases, including no increase at all. He also said he wanted
more flexibility to remove the worst employees. Across-the-board
increases, he said, mean that ``the very best teacher gets the same
raise as the very worst teacher,'' and therefore, teacher
``performance descends to the lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's budget presentation was also striking for its lengthy
complaint, worthy of a senator, about how much more New York state
sends to Washington in federal taxes than it gets back in revenue.
Quoting a study by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Giuliani said
the state sent $15 billion more to Washington than it got in
return. He added, to no one's surprise, that states like Arkansas _
the home of his likely opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, before she
moved this month to Westchester County _ end up with a surplus.
``So essentially what's happening is New Yorkers are subsidizing
other places,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, responded that she had
been speaking out about New York's unfair tax burden since last
summer, and added, ``It sounds like they're stealing a page from
our playbook.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, Giuliani has a narrow edge over Mrs. Clinton
in statewide polls, but his vulnerable areas with voters remain his
policies toward the homeless and the state of the city's schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, the mayor offered more details on a variety of
education proposals he made in his State of the City speech earlier
this month, including spending $45 million to privatize failing
schools and $6 million for a school voucher program. He also
suggested that the city could save money by selling the Brooklyn
building that houses the Board of Education's headquarters, and by
reducing the school bureaucracy by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sell that damn building,'' said Giuliani,
promising that the city would introduce a resolution for the sale
to the board in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said he would expand his program for the homeless,
although his budget calls for only a modest increase in funds for
the Department of Homeless Services, from $176 million in fiscal
year 2000 to $181 million in fiscal year 2001. But Giuliani, who
spent the fall defending his policies toward the city's homeless,
said he was spending ``significantly more on less people,'' and
those who say the city is not compassionate are engaging in
``political spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added, ``There are people who make their money out of
the welfare industry,'' but as the lives of the homeless improve,
their advocates ``have less money, less budget, less authority, and
you put them on television less, which might actually be the thing
that motivates them more than anything else.''

ACLU STUDIES CITATIONS FOR RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It is not uncommon, civil-rights advocates
say, to hear minority motorists say they are unfairly singled out
by police when driving in Kansas City's suburbs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, the American Civil Liberties Union has collected
accounts from those who say they face such discrimination _ black
and other minority commuters _ who believe police automatically
cast them as suspicious outsiders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But until now, no effort has been made to gather evidence to
determine whether motorists are stopped simply because of the color
of their skin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get at that question, the ACLU is examining thousands of 1998
traffic citations issued by police in Leawood and Prairie Village
in Kansas and Grandview in Missouri, all suburbs of Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is a practice by some police of making
decisions, in part, based on ethnicity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, we have received complaints on a regular basis
from individuals stopped by police in certain jurisdictions where
those stops seem to be based, in part, on racial profiling,'' said
Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Kansas and western Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to determine whether there is some pattern we can
identify in a more scientific way,'' he said. ``We need to put some
meat to the anecdotal information.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A similar study, though much larger, was proposed in a bill
before the Kansas Legislature. Under the bill introduced last week,
the Kansas attorney general would compile a report on the race,
gender, ethnic background and age of those stopped in Kansas. The
report would be based on information supplied by all Kansas law
enforcement agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU study is being done by statisticians at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City. A report on their conclusions still is
three months off, Kurtenbach said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prairie Village, Leawood and Grandview were chosen, he said,
because those are the communities where the ACLU has received the
most complaints over the last several years. The ACLU does not
document how many grievances it receives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in those communities deny racial profiling takes
place and say they are eager to prove that point with the help of
the ACLU study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dickey, deputy police chief in Grandview, said some
minority motorists use the issue as a smokescreen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In a majority of the cases, people just use it as an excuse,''
he said. ``But nobody's perfect and this is not a perfect world.
I'm sure things like (racial profiling) go on in places. But we
don't do that here, not to my knowledge anyway.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sid Mitchell, Leawood police chief, said all city officials are
receiving mandatory racial sensitivity training this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good business to treat people in a discriminatory
fashion,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts this week to reach Charles Grover, Prairie
Village police chief, were unsuccessful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that he has been with the civil-rights group,
Kurtenbach said he had received fewer than 10 racial-profiling
complaints from those living in Kansas City's urban core, an area
with a larger percentage of minority residents. But in the suburbs,
he says he gets ``several'' complaints a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kurtenbach said, it's difficult to draw broad
conclusions about unfair police practices, or whether racial
profiling is simply a matter of bad decisions being made by
individuals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to indict the suburbs,'' Kurtenbach said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Crew, director of the ACLU's Campaign Against Racial
Profiling, said profiling has emerged as the new face of racism,
simmering just below the surface of polite society. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is law enforcement by blind guesswork and hunches,'' Crew
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of focusing on probable cause, police officers look
for a minor excuse _ a broken turn signal or crossing the center
line _ to go fishing. We believe those hunches are inevitably
infected by unconscious racism and unconscious stereotype.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But hard numbers are not easy to come by. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ACLU study in Maryland revealed a disparity in motorist stops
and searches. Although minorities account for 22 percent of all
drivers on the highway studied, they were more than 70 percent of
those detained and searched, the ACLU reports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, a /{Wichita Eagle/} study found that 18 percent of the
motorists ticketed in 1997 and 1998 in that city were black, even
though black persons make up 12 percent of the population. The
newspaper found percentages were even higher on area interstates,
where 19.5 percent of the ticketed motorists were black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU study puts Kansas City in the middle of a roiling
national debate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Results of a Gallup poll released in December show Americans
strongly disapprove of profiling. The poll found that 59 percent of
Americans believe police officers use racial profiling, and 81
percent disapprove of the practice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called the practice ``morally
indefensible'' and last June signed an executive order for federal
law enforcement agencies to gather data on race, gender and
ethnicity of people they stop to question. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley both
say that if elected they would ban the practice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Carolina became the first state to adopt
legislation requiring law enforcement officials to collect racial
data on traffic stops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voluntary efforts are under way in major U.S. cities such as San
Francisco, San Diego, San Jose and Houston. And in Oregon, two
dozen Portland-area police agencies have endorsed a resolution
against racial profiling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Haley, a Kansas City, Kan., Democrat, helped
introduce a bill that would require police agencies in Kansas to
collect and report to the state information on the race, gender,
ethnic background and age of those stopped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to hold any sector of our community to greater
scrutiny than another,'' Haley said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the attorney general would report the traffic-stop
information to the governor and the state Legislature in 2002. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas would be one of only five states in the nation with such
a law, said Kurtenbach. The ACLU supports the bill. Missouri has no
such legislation pending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Racial traffic data, both sides of the national debate say, will
help calm simmering tensions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Darden, former Los Angeles prosecutor and a staunch
critic of racial profiling, has said he is convinced that the first
African-American motorist who owned a Model T was pulled over for
no reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crew said: ``That story conveys the kind of weariness the public
has of racial profiling. This is a problem that we should have left
behind an awful long time ago.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called Thursday for an end
to automatic pay raises for unionized city workers, from trash
collectors to teachers, and proposed $2 billion worth of tax cuts
over the next four years to residents and businesses as part of a
$36.8 billion budget he released.
 &UR;  &LR;  The spending plan for the 2001 fiscal year is balanced in part by
relying on an expected record surplus generated in the current
fiscal year by the city's supercharged economy.
 &UR;  &LR;  The mayor devoted a large portion of his budget speech to
education and the city's public schools, insisting once again that
the school system was out of control and its management bloated. He
singled out teachers in proposing a new system based solely on
merit pay raises _ a plan opposed by union leaders who either
object outright or insist that any merit system be at least linked
to base raises tied to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani further roiled Board of Education officials and union
leaders by proposing to privatize failing schools and some services
like summer programs, and he once again advocated a pilot program
that would offer some parents vouchers to allow their children to
attend private schools.
 &UR;  &LR;  He proposed a cut in the city's income tax rate for all New
Yorkers that would average 16 percent. Although his administration
had said on Wednesday that the cut would not take effect until
2002, after he leaves office, the mayor said Thursday that his
critics in the City Council had persuaded him to accelerate the
sizable reduction to this fiscal year, which begins in July. That
cut would eventually cost $784 million a year, and it would save a
New Yorker making $75,000 a year about $290.
</P>
<P>
   City Council leaders and budget watchdogs offered unusually
generous praise for the mayor's plan. But they warned that it left
the city vulnerable to potentially severe deficits if the economy
faltered. At the same time, the critics said, the mayor's perennial
plan to reduce spending for cultural groups, parks and libraries is
unacceptable and unnecessary when the city is flush with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like using an inheritance to pay your mortgage,'' said
Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens &UR;  &LR; Budget Commission,
referring to Giuliani's plan to use $1.5 billion of the expected
$2.2 billion surplus to balance next year's budget. ``It is
short-run thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders on Thursday also condemned the mayor's so-called
revolution in labor relations, saying that if the city replaced
automatic raises with pay increases based exclusively on merit,
employees would be vulnerable to arbitrary decisions and political
pressure by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, one of
their most powerful allies, said they were not in principle opposed
to tying compensation in part to worker performance, an
increasingly popular bargaining tactic among mayors and governors
across the United States. But they said that city workers had
already agreed in 1995 to help balance the budget by accepting two
years of wage freezes, cutting their pay relative to the private
sector and other local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Merit-pay provisions do encourage many employees to work harder,
labor experts say. But these provisions can also sow divisiveness
within a work force, often creating resentment when one group of
unionized employees receives more than another. Union officials
usually attack merit pay systems, arguing that they are based on
subjective criteria and often lead to punishments for employees who
speak out against management and rewards for employees who toe
management's line.
</P>
<P>
   Overall school spending would rise to $11.3 billion, but it
comes with a number of strings attached. Giuliani offered the
school system $45 million to improve the performance of its 97 most
troubled schools, but only if it agrees to turn at least 19 of them
over to private management companies.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions in cultural programs and social services include
a proposed $42 million cut for libraries, $18 million in cuts for
museums and dance, opera and other performing arts groups, and a
$7.5 million cut in youth programs.

HE'S NOW THE FISHER KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeff Fisher has come a long way since graduating in
1976 from Taft High in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, where he
was an extraordinary receiver his senior season. His team was
beaten in the playoffs by a Charles White-led San Fernando High
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way since 1980, when he was a starting USC
cornerback who inadvertently tipped an almost certain interception
away from his teammate, Dennis Smith, on a play in which UCLA's
Freeman McNeil made a game-winning catch.
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way since he retired from the Chicago Bears
after the 1985 season and went to work for a fledging computer
software company called J.B. Systems _ now known as Mainsaver _ in
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way since he was coaxed by his Chicago
defensive coordinator, Buddy Ryan, to join Ryan at his new
head-coaching position with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who in subsequent seasons lived the gypsy life of an NFL
assistant with stopovers with the Los Angeles Rams and San
Francisco 49ers before joining the Houston Oilers in 1994, has come
a long way since the beginning of training camp last July when his
boss, Bud Adams, issued an ominous public statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to the nitty-gritty this year and I really don't
need to tell them (the score),'' said the Tennessee Titans owner,
referring to Fisher and the team's general manager, Floyd Reese.
``I think they understand where we're coming from ... with this
idea of being 8-8 three years in a row and with the talent we have
on this squad right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Fisher, who assumed control of the Oilers 10 games into
the 1994 season after Jack Pardee was fired, and had to endure the
vagabond existence the franchise went through after moving to
Tennessee in 1997, was at a crossroads in his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   The talented Titans, playing for the first time in their new
Adelphia Coliseum, were expected by Adams to have a successful
season, or there would be consequences.
</P>
<P>
   As Reese said: ``We knew what Mr. Adams expected. I've spent a
lot of years in the NFL and that's just the nature of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's doubtful even Adams expected what has unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!A Super Bowl appearance by his team Sunday against
the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!A 13-3 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!A dramatic, final-second victory against the Buffalo
Bills in the postseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!An unexpected road playoff victory over the
Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!A stirring AFC Championship Game upset of the
Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Fisher, perched on that perennial scorching seat
endemic to those in his craft who have fashioned mediocre records,
has become one of the NFL's reigning coaching geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great coach who's done just a great, great job,'' said
Adams, quickly changing his tune.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher has kept this storybook season in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's nice what has happened to us _ a great
testimony to the dedication and resilience of my players,'' said
Fisher. ``But I know how difficult it is to win in this league.
There are some good coaches around who have had a hard time. There
is such a fine line between winning and losing. In every win this
season, I can point to two or three plays that, if we don't make,
we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, of course, usually begets unrestrained fondness by
athletes for their caretaker _ and the Titans aren't exceptions. At
Thursday morning's news conference in a huge tent next to their
hotel in Buckhead, the Tennessee players had nothing but positive
things to say about Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is a gutsy coach who goes about his work in a mellow but
intense manner,'' said Steve McNair, the Titans' quarterback. ``You
always know where Jeff stands. And he has tremendous courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like most about Jeff Fisher is he lets you know exactly
where you stand,'' said Lorenzo Neal, the Titans' blocking
fullback. ``And he has a way of keeping everyone loose. He told us
players before the Jacksonville game that if any of the assistant
coaches were acting uptight to let him know about it so he would
get on them. It broke everyone up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In coaching, you have to earn trust and respect from your
players,'' said Fisher. ``It doesn't come automatically. You have
to show your players that you're fair and that you're strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even back in high school, you just knew Jeff Fisher was
destined for big things in life,'' said sports talk-radio
personality Steve Hartman, who graduated in the same Taft High
class as Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Tessalone, the longtime sports information director at USC,
knew Fisher was a special person on that day a long time ago at the
Coliseum when the player was victimized by that 58-yard McNeil
scoring reception that resulted in a 20-17 UCLA victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget going up to Jeff in our dressing room
afterward and seeing his head bowed and how unhappy he was,''
related Tessalone. ``I told him, `You know all the reporters will
want to talk to you about that play. But you don't have to talk to
them if you don't want to.' And Jeff said, `Let's go. I'll talk to
them now.' I knew right then this wasn't an ordinary person.''

EXCERPTS FROM THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-SPEECH) 
(rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the text of the Republican reply to
President Clinton's State of the Union Message prepared for
delivery by Sens Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Frist of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Collins: Our Republican agenda is driven by the simple but
powerful truth that America will continue to lead the world as long
as our government allows opportunity, initiative and freedom to
flourish. Letting people create what they can dream has transformed
our economy.
</P>
<P>
   As we reflect on our economic health, we should never forget
that America's recent success is, above all, a triumph of values.
Americans will never let our country become rich in things and poor
in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements of the ``dot-com'' generation rest on the
foundation built by our parents and grandparents. They prevailed
through the Depression, defeated the force of fascism and made
personal freedom the hallmark of countries around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   To pay tribute to those great Americans on whose shoulders we
stand, we are honor-bound to keep our promise to protect Social
Security. Last year, for the first time in 39 years, the federal
budget was balanced without dipping into the Social Security trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   We'll do it again this year, and we'll pay down even more of the
national debt. We've already paid off $150 billion in the last two
years. Now, our goal is to eliminate the $3.6 trillion debt
entirely in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   To promote job growth, we'll continue to help our small
businesses. That means reducing burdens like the federal ``death
tax'' _ so that when parents work their whole lives to leave their
children a family business, it won't have to be sold just to pay
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, in general, are simply too high. We will continue to
fight for tax relief for American families so that they can keep
more of what they earn.
</P>
<P>
   We'll honor our commitment to our brave men and women in
uniform. Last year the Republican Congress approved the largest
increase in military pay in more than a decade. And to protect our
country from terrorist nations, we will build a shield against
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   As important as all these issues are, there's something else
that is vital to securing our future, and that is education. ...
</P>
<P>
   We live in a time of unparalleled prosperity. But between
Silicon Valley and Wall Street, many Americans still live in the
shadows of the new prosperity. New technologies, unimagined a
decade ago, provide exciting opportunities for some but pose
unsettling challenges to others.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter the 21st century, every young American must be
educated to adapt to a changing workplace, and many in our current
work force must be provided with new skills to succeed in the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   A good education is the ladder of opportunity. It turns dreams
into reality. That's why education is at the top of the Republican
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight I ask the president to join with Republicans in our
commitment to bring a good education to all our children. Our
four-point plan for educational excellence will ensure that all
children have an equal opportunity to reach their full potential.
</P>
<P>
   First, we will continue to increase federal funds for elementary
and secondary education. Last year the Republicans boosted
education spending by $500 million more than the president's
budget, and we added funds for children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Second, rather than Washington dictating to communities how they
should run their schools, we should listen to those who know best:
our parents, teachers and local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in Washington is not about money. It is about who
makes the decisions. We need a change of approach _ one that
recognizes that local schools, not Washington offices, are the
heart and home of education. We will empower states and communities
to use federal education dollars in the ways children need most.
...
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want what all parents want for their children's
schools: more federal help but less federal interference. Instead
of imposing a one-size-fits-all straitjacket, our plan recognizes
that one community may need more math teachers while another may
need better reading programs _ and still others, new computers. It
should be your community's decision, not Washington's.
</P>
<P>
   In return for that flexibility, the Republican plan requires
real accountability _ not more paperwork, but better results.
Schools will be held responsible for what is truly important _
improving student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Third, our plan will strengthen teaching excellence. America's
teachers need our help. About one-third of our new teachers get so
discouraged that they leave the profession. Many are prevented from
doing their very best because they don't have a chance to get
enough training in the subject they teach.
</P>
<P>
   We will increase federal grants to states and communities and
give them the freedom to use that money to better prepare, recruit
and retain good teachers. The lessons are clear _ we must encourage
talented people to choose teaching as a career and keep them in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, our plan will continue the longtime Republican support
for higher education. Last year we increased Pell grants and
student loans to open the doors to college for more low- and
middle-income families. This year we will increase the amount that
families can contribute to education savings accounts to make
higher education more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Education today is America's broad band to the fixture _ a
powerful conduit for achievement and success. Let us work together
to ensure that all Americans have the educational opportunity for a
bright fixture. . . .
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frist: I'm a senator from the state of Tennessee, but I've spent
the better part of my life working in hospitals, caring for people
with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned a lot by listening to my patients and to the people
who work in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier tonight we heard the president talk about his latest
health care proposals. The last time he proposed a health plan was
seven years ago. And then it amounted to a federal government
takeover of our entire health system. It would have forced every
American into a Washington-run HMO and denied them the right to
choose their own doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, thank goodness, it was soundly defeated by Democrats
and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Now tonight, 84 months later, the president has unveiled a
similar plan just as bad as the first. It makes government even
bigger and more bloated because each new program we heard about
tonight _ and there were about 11 of them in health care alone _
comes with its own massive bureaucracy. And each will cost you, the
taxpayer, billions more of your tax dollars _ more than $1,000 for
every man, woman and child.
</P>
<P>
   During my surgical fellowship, I worked in England for the
British National Health Service, and I saw firsthand the rationing,
the lack of choice, the long waits and the denial of care for
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that socialized medicine _ whether in England or in
Canada, where patients are fleeing to the U.S. for treatment _ just
does not work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if David Letterman had lived in Canada, he'd still be
waiting for his heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But I think we all know that America's health care system can be
better. Costs are climbing. Too many people can't get insurance or
breakthrough drugs. Too many heavy-handed HMOs tell doctors how to
do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, we should remember that Americans still enjoy the best
and most advanced health care in the world. That's why people from
all over the globe come here for the latest treatments. If you have
diabetes or arthritis or high blood pressure, chances are your
medicines weren't even around 10 years ago. Today we live longer,
and stay healthier, than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   So a lot is good. A lot is working. But we still have to make it
even better.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans in Congress, we're determined not to be guided by
bigger government, but by your freedom to choose your kind of
health care and to select the doctor of your choice. Already
because of Republican efforts, five million more children now have
access to health care; if you change jobs, you can now take your
health insurance with you; new mothers can leave the hospital when
their doctor, not some bureaucrat, says they're ready. And we're
doubling medical research for more and better cures. A great start,
but not enough.
</P>
<P>
   As a doctor, I've cared for thousands of seniors. I know
Medicare is their lifeline, their security. But this 35-year-old
program, with 130,000 pages of regulations, creates waste and abuse
and leaves our seniors with confusing red tape and heartache. Worst
of all, Medicare doesn't even include the mainstay of modern
medicine _ outpatient prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not government-dictated price controls that stop
life-saving research, or forcing the 65 percent of seniors who now
have drug coverage to pay more or give up what they have.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come
together with a plan to build on two simple principles: choice and
security. It lets people choose the type of medical plan that is
best for them, including prescription drugs. No senior citizen, no
mother, no person with a disability, will ever be told by a
bureaucrat what plan to pick, what doctor to see or what service
they can receive.
</P>
<P>
   But just last year the president said ``no'' to this plan, put
forth by the National Bipartisan Medicare Commission _ the very
commission the president and Congress appointed to save Medicare.
...
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm proud to say that I've asked for and received full
assurances today from our majority leader, Trent Loft, that he is
prepared to bring this needed bipartisan legislation to the Senate
floor within two weeks. For this to happen, President, all we need
is for you to tell the American people, ``Yes,'' to this Democrat
and Republican plan to fix Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And tonight, to show you that we are sincere and that we mean
business, Republicans take a first step toward making Medicare
stronger. To guarantee that seniors can rely on Medicare forever,
we will add it to the Social Security lockbox, which will lock away
the surplus for both Social Security and Medicare. We will not let
anyone spend your Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that neither HMOs nor the government should be
practicing medicine. That's why Congress will, for the first dare,
send the president a real ``patients' bill of rights'' with strong
patient protections. In our plan, if you're denied the treatment
that you and your doctor decide is right, you'll get a quick appeal
to an independent doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the president, we see lawsuits as a last resort, not the
first. Because as every American knows, your sick child needs to
see a doctor, not a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   During the Clinton years, the number of individuals without
health insurance has increased by six million people. But with the
plan we announced yesterday, we will finally make it easier for
low- and middle- income families to buy the coverage of their
choice. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I believe we will dramatically improve medical care in America.
How could anyone not be hopeful, with what we've seen? Just look at
our ability to correct heart defects in children, halt the
progression of osteoporosis and treat breast and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we'll see revolutionary new treatments for conditions like
Alzheimer's, sickle cell anemia and schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   But all of these innovations require freedom, because progress
and freedom go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   You know, my father was a family doctor for 55 years. As a young
boy making house calls with him, I remember his stethoscope, his
doctor's bag and best of all, his wonderful and compassionate
heart. But these were his only tools. Just one generation later, he
would join me on my rounds and he'd witness the miraculous new
technologies and medicines that allowed us to transplant hearts and
to give new life.
</P>
<P>
   It's all possible because Americans are blessed with the spirit
to dream, the freedom to explore and the work ethic to produce.
</P>
<P>
   And so tonight, Mr. President, I ask you to put your trust in
the American people _ in their creativity, in their
resourcefulness, in their ability to achieve _ free of government
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, please, no more red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, give us a health care plan that includes choice and
security.
</P>
<P>
   The American people deserve no less.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of Senator Collins and myself, thank you for being
with us. Good night, and may God bless all of you and our great
nation.

ED CLARK, 88, EYE BEHIND MEMORABLE PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Tenn.)   (rk) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Ed Clark, the veteran Life photographer who soon after President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's death caught a nation's grief in the
tear-stained face of a Navy bandsman playing an accordion salute,
died on Saturday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career, Clark charmed his way into the good
graces of presidents and politicians, movie stars and farm workers.
``His photographs will remain an important part of the way we see
history,'' said Barbara Baker Burrows, picture editor for special
projects at Life. Ms. Burrows said Clark's access to his subjects
was particularly impressive. ``He hung out with presidents _ that's
why he got the pictures he got,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark photographed a cheerful President Harry S. Truman taking a
walk. He did a portrait of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, using
one of Mathew Brady's wet-plate cameras.
</P>
<P>
   After he had covered John F. Kennedy for a few weeks during his
presidential campaign, the senator invited Clark to lunch at his
Georgetown house. Clark asked to see the new addition to the
household. Jacqueline Kennedy said Caroline was asleep, but Kennedy
took Clark to the nursery, where he was able to photograph the
wide-eyed baby and her smiling father.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who was born in Nashville on July 3, 1911, dropped out of
high school to join The Nashville Tennessean. In 1936 he became a
stringer for Life, and in 1944 he was hired as a staff
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Nashville when he received a phone call from New York
asking him to get to Warm Springs, Ga.: Roosevelt had just died
there. Clark drove all night, he said. At the train station, where
the caisson carrying the body was to be transported to Washington,
Clark heard an accordion. He turned and saw a weeping Navy
bandsman, Graham Jackson, playing ``Goin' Home,'' a Roosevelt
favorite. His picture took up a whole page in the April 17, 1945,
issue of Life.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Life in 1961, he accepted assignments from various
magazines
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joyce; a son, Tom, of Frederick,
Md.; a sister, Nellie Dunlap of Nashville; two grandchildren; and
three great-grandchildren.

   WASHINGTON _ Basking in an annual rite for the last time,
President Clinton bragged Thursday night that the state of the
union had never been better and proposed using some of the nation's
wealth to provide modest tax relief for lower- and middle-income
Americans, particularly married ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the
American spirit,'' Clinton said pumping his fists for emphasis.
``Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen
births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent.
Welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years. My
fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has
ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton stepped to the rostrum, the House chamber was
crowded, as always, although the entire Supreme Court was
puzzlingly absent, some without any stated reason. But the drama of
his address a year ago, delivered on the eve of his impeachment
trial, was gone. Instead, Clinton's main adversary was the
calendar, which shows less than a year to go until his successor's
proposals are the ones that matter.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore seated behind his right shoulder and
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the balcony above, Clinton did much to
try to help their political fortunes and the effort of other
Democrats to take back the House from the Republicans who had
impeached him.
</P>
<P>
   So packed full of proposals was the speech that it lasted 89
minutes, breaking Clinton's record of 81 minutes, which he set in
1995's speech. The president also received more than 100 ovations,
far more than he has received in his seven previous State of the
Union addresses.
</P>
<P>
   In one applause-winning proposal, Clinton, as he has done so
often during his tenure, seized an issue dear to the Republicans
and made it his own. He announced a proposal to alleviate the parts
of the tax code that penalize married couples, forcing them to pay
higher rates than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   That makes such a change likely, since Republicans on Capitol
Hill had previously said that ending the marriage penalty was one
of their principal goals this year and had appeared to have enough
Democratic backing to enact it even before Clinton embraced the
measure Thursday night. The proposal was one of a series of tax
cuts that aides said totaled $350 billion over 10 years, measured
against an estimated $2 trillion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were taken aback by the sheer number of initiatives.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas called the speech ``a litany of
spending,'' and Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said that
``Congress will dig out of an avalanche of presidential spending
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement held back until just before the
speech, Clinton urged federal legislation to require state licenses
for all handgun purchases, one of numerous proposals the president
borrowed from Gore. Saying that states now license hunters and
drivers, Clinton recommended similar photo identifications for
handgun buyers once they pass a background check and complete a
gun-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton took credit for the extraordinary health
of the American economy _ and shared credit lavishly with Gore _
while warning that the prosperity not be squandered.
</P>
<P>
   But while last year's address was built around a pledge to save
Social Security before taking any other actions or cutting taxes,
this year, Clinton felt times were good enough to call for both tax
cuts, although modest ones, and more social spending.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, an area in which he hopes to be remembered,
Clinton urged lawmakers to give China most-favored-nation trade
status on a permanent basis, and he reiterated his view that the
United States must stay engaged in the world, especially with
former adversaries still struggling to enact democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in previous speeches, Clinton devoted far less time to
foreign policy and national security issues than to his domestic
agenda, quickly surveying the country's role as a mediator in the
Middle East and Northern Ireland and as a defender of human rights
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the trend toward globalization was ``the central
reality of our time. He called for a new consensus on trade, urging
Congress to pass legislation easing trade barriers with African and
Caribbean nations and to approve the agreement his administration
reached with China last year to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open markets and rules-based trade are the best engines we
know for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and
environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas,''
Clinton said. ``There is only one direction for America on trade.
We must go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia had been held back from its full potential by
economic turmoil and ``a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya''
but said the United States should help ``those Russians struggling
for a democratic, prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president vowed to protect vital computer systems from
cyberattacks and pledged to continue developing a national missile
defense system, although he repeated his previous assurances to
preserve the Antiballistic Missile treaty with Russia. He also
called for ``a constructive bipartisan dialogue'' on the
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, which the Senate rejected last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his points were not new, but he did announce a proposal
to offer tax credits to pharmaceutical companies to speed
development of vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS in
poorer nations. He also said his budget would include $150 million
to fight disease around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With his speech coming between this week's Iowa caucuses and the
New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Clinton unveiled a legislative
shopping list intended to some degree to ensure his relevance as
the country's attention shifts to the campaign. Time after time in
the speech, Democrats jumped to their feet in applause, while
Republicans responded to many proposals with silence.
</P>
<P>
   Election-year Congresses are notoriously unproductive, but
Thursday night Clinton advanced some proposals designed to win
congressional backing this year and other initiatives designed to
linger for the Democrats until well beyond Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great goals, worthy of a great nation,'' Clinton
said. ``The lesson of our history,'' he said, ``and the lesson of
the last seven years _ is that great goals are reached step by
step, building on our progress, always gaining ground.''
</P>
<P>
   On education, Clinton borrowed heavily from Gore's campaign
platform, proposing $3 billion in new spending for the politically
popular Head Start program and new after-school initiatives, as
well as school construction and enhanced teacher pay. He reiterated
his $31 billion plan to make college more affordable through
enhanced federal grants and by making part of tuition tax
deductible. He has credited Mrs. Clinton with twisting him arm to
make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our
faith that every child can learn,'' he said. ``Because education is
more than ever key to our children's future, we must make sure that
all our children have that key. That means universal preschool and
after-school, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and
college opportunities for all our children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's proposals have been suggested before but
have never gained traction in Congress. Clinton urged renewed
action on ``unfinished business,'' including hate-crimes
legislation, a minimum wage increase from $5.15 an hour, a bill of
rights to give patients more say with their health maintenance
organizations, and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, whose only son, Daniel, was killed last April at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was one of the guests
invited to sit beside Mrs. Clinton. The president's speech pushed
the gun-control measures that Congress failed to act on last year,
along with money to enhance the enforcement of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The president's licensing proposal stands little chance of
passage this year, and raises constitutional issues, but it put
Clinton clearly in Gore's corner in the presidential campaign, in
which former Sen. Bill Bradley has promoted his gun control
proposals as more effective than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years _ the
longest decline on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped
to forge on community police, sensitive gun control and effective
prevention,'' the president said. ``But nobody believes America is
safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the
safest big country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's tax-relief ideas would supplement working
families' retirement savings, assist with child care expenses,
encourage charitable giving and make up to $10,000 of college
tuition tax deductible. In another helping hand, Clinton proposed
$21 billion to expand the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of undoing the marriage penalty is always politically
popular. But the president's plan, which would be phased in over a
decade and would double the standard deduction for two-income
couples to twice the amount of a single filer's deduction, is more
limited than various Republican proposals. It would not benefit
couples who itemize on their returns.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed measures to encourage drug companies
to develop vaccines to combat AIDS and tuberculosis. He pushed
again for prescription-drug benefits under Medicare, one of a
handful of health care proposals. And he vowed to pay off the debt
by 2013 _ two years ahead of his previous predictions _ and resist
reckless spending that chips away at Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In another reach to Gore, the president talked about global
warming, an issue that he has said the vice president often brings
up with him. The president proposed giving tax incentives to
businesses for the production of clean energy and to families that
buy energy-saving appliances, automobiles and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, deadly
waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will be
flooded, economies disrupted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one of his biggest legislative defeats last year,
Clinton called for a ``bipartisan dialogue'' on the comprehensive
test ban treaty, conciliatory language indicating that he did not
intend to push the matter again. He stressed the importance of
engaging countries like China and Russia, which still maintains a
nuclear-missile arsenal. And he addressed the dangers of biological
warfare and ``cyberterrorism,'' without offering any specific
solutions to those dangers.
</P>
<P>
   One facet of Clinton's vision of a ``new America'' entails
closing what he has called the ``digital divide.'' He renewed his
requests for government aid to help poor people gain access to
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In length and breadth, the speech reflected Clinton's centrist
instincts, the advice of many people in the White House and on
Capitol Hill _ and the president's desire to savor a moment in the
spotlight before the nation's attention turns inevitably to the
next president.
