<HEADLINE> Beckenbauer: Africa not Qualified to Host 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- German soccer legend Franz
Beckenbauer said on Thursday that it will take a minimum of ten
years to qualify Africa for staging the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer was drumming up support for Germany's bid for the
2006 World Cup at Cameroon following his visit to Botswana and
Mali.
</P>
<P>
He thought the 2006 tournament is still too early for Africa
whose overall conditions remains to be desired.
</P>
<P>
"2006 is certainly too early, maybe it is possible in 2010,"
said Beckenbauer, chairman of Germany's bid committee and vice-
president of the German Football Association.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he expressed his confidence that Germany will win the
bid which involves five countries.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that by summer 2005 everything will be ready
for us to organise an attractive pre-World Cup tournament,"
</P>
<P>
"Germany is a great football nation and its bid is supported by
over 90 percent of the population," he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides Germany, Morocco and South Africa are both campaigning
to bring the tournament to the continent for the first time, while
England and Brazil are also bidding to stage the finals.

<HEADLINE> Yacht Sinks during Cape to Rio Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Six crew members aboard a
South African yacht taking part in the Cape to Rio regatta race
were rescued by a fellow competitor Thursday shortly before their
vessel sank in the South Atlantic ocean, race officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 12-meter yacht La Bamba was about 790 kilometers west of
the South African coast when it issued a distress call about 12:30
p.m. (1030 GMT) on Wednesday, saying it was taking on water
through a front hatch, but the crew managed to fix the leak.
</P>
<P>
However, the boat sprung a second leak below the water line on
Wednesday evening, and the captain sent out another distress call.
</P>
<P>
A multihull vessel, Island Fling, made a 2 1-2-hour detour to
come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
La Bamba sank shortly afterwards at 5:02 a.m. (0302 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The rescued crew members were exhausted, but uninjured.
</P>
<P>
Island Fling now plans to sail 550 kilometers to Port Nolloth
about 500 kilometers north of Cape Town to drop off La Bamba's
crew before continuing with the race.
</P>
<P>
Race organizers said Island Fling would be compensated for the
time lost.
</P>
<P>
The race of more than 5,520 kilometers started in Cape Town
Saturday, and the American boats Zephryrus and Sagamore were
leading on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Australia Picks Six Golds in World Cup Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian swimmers picked
six out of the 17 gold medals in the opening day of the World Cup
short-course swim meet in Hobart, Australia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Michael Klim, star of the 1998 long-course world
championships and a prolific world record setter over the past
year, highlighted today's performances by winning the men's 100
meters freestyle in 47.83 and the 50m butterfly in 23.55.
</P>
<P>
The hosts also took the men's 100m backstroke, 200m
breaststroke and 400m freestyle, and women's 50m backstroke golds.
</P>
<P>
China snatched five golds in the first day with Chu Yi winning
the men's 50m breaststroke in 27.96 seconds and Han Xue taking the
women's freestyle title in 25.45 seconds. Chinese girls also
wrested 100m butterfly, 200m individual medley and 800m freestyle
golds.
</P>
<P>
American Lenny Krayzelburg suffered a defeat in the 100 meters
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, who established three long-course world records in
a week at last year's Pan Pacific championships in Sydney to
confirm himself as unbackable favourite for this year's Olympics,
was pipped by Australian Matt Welsh, who clocked in 52.67 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Jani Sievinen, a long-course world champion in 1994,
won took gold medals by winning men's 100m and 400m individual
medleys in 55.52 and 4:13.82 respectively.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Penny Heyns continued her remarkable winning
streak in women's breaststroke, easily taking the 100m in 1:07.38.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sticks to Position on Water Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said it was willing to
sell, not give, water to regional countries to help bring about
Middle East peace, reported Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Foreign Ministry official told the English
language newspaper Thursday that the only thing Turkey could do to
bolster the Israeli-Syrian peace process is to sell water to those
countries that want it.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made amid speculations that Turkey was being
pressured by the United States to make some kind of water
concession to Syria in order to secure a peace deal between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Water is one of the four major topics of the peace talks between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that within the framework of a prospective final
settlement on the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria in
1967, Israel would keep the water resources there and would in
return ask its regional ally Turkey to offer more water flow to
Syria from the upper reaches of the Euphrates River.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered Israeli-Syrian peace talks have reached a
decisive stage and are possible to conclude in two months,
according to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin said in Washington
Wednesday that "Water, given its nature, is an issue that is not
only between Israel and Syria but has a regional dimension as well,
including Turkey, and any solutions should have regional
dimensions."
</P>
<P>
Within this understanding of a "regional dimension," Rubin
stated that "We would certainly want to be in regular touch with
Turkey - a NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) ally and
friend of the United States - about this development in the talks."
</P>
<P>
However, ever since Israel and Syria resumed talks in the U.S.
toward the end of last year, the Turkish Foreign Ministry has
repeatedly declared that Turkey firmly backs an Israeli-Syrian
peace deal, but not at the expense of Turkey's water.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official said what Turkey can talk about is the sale
of water from the Manavgat, Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers, all run
within the territory of Turkey, adding that "This is strictly a
commercial matter."
</P>
<P>
He said the sale of water from the Tigris and the Euphrates had
not been considered so far.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, poor in fossil energy but rich in water resources, has
conducted commercial talks with Israel and the Palestinians for
sale of water. An idea was raised during the talks for establishing
a water pipeline linking Turkey with the region.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Confirms Return of Puppet PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait confirmed on Friday
that Al Aa Hussein Ali Al-Khafaji Al-Jaber, prime minister of the
puppet Kuwaiti government during the Iraqi occupation almost a
decade ago, has been detained after returning Kuwait early in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Deifallah Sharar said Al
Aa arrived at Kuwait International Airport early Friday morning
with his four children.
</P>
<P>
"He (Al Aa) has been referred to competent judicial authorities
for taking the legal procedures against him," said Sharar, also
minister of state for cabinet affairs and for National Assembly
(parliament) affairs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Al Aa, who was reportedly holding a Norwegian
passport, returned on his own will.
</P>
<P>
Sharar had denied on Thursday reports that Kuwait had eased the
ban on Al Aa's return.
</P>
<P>
He said Al Aa's children were handed over to their relatives in
Kuwait, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa and other senior members in his short-lived puppet regime
fled the country when Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait by the
multi-national forces in 1991. He was living in exile in Norway.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti court condemned him to death in 1991 on charges of
high treason for heading the "provisional government of free
Kuwait" set up by Baghdad in its seven-month occupation.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Second Lowest-Inflation Year in Israel's History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's consumer price index
(CPI) rose 1.3 percent in 1999, the second lowest yearly inflation
in Israel's history, statistics published Friday by the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS) showed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said that the low inflation
in 1999 was the result of responsible economic policies adopted by
Jacob Frenkel, former governor of the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel, who stepped down last week, said the low price index
rise - the lowest since 1967 - will rejuvenate economic growth,
which he believed is the real solution to unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel hoped that David Klein, his successor nominated by
Barak, will continue a tight and cautious monetary policy. Klein, a
Frenkel-clone in monetary philosophy, is still waiting for the
approval of the cabinet in its Sunday meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, some economic analysts are predicting that once in
office, Klein will lower interest rates, which will theoretically
stimulate consumption, by 0.5 percent at the end of the month in
the context of the low index figures and other economic
considerations.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Rebel Leader Calls for Amnesty in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Abdullah Ocalan, condemned leader
of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), issued a statement
on Friday through his lawyers, calling for an amnesty in Turkey to
achieve "internal peace."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the decision of the Turkish government to stay his
execution, Ocalan said "The point that has reached is a new start,"
the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The tripatite Turkish coalition government decided Wednesday to
delay actions on Ocalan's execution until the European Court of
Human Rights reviews the case. The review process may take 18
months.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is applying for membership of the European Union, which
is opposed to the death sentence and is unsatisfied with Ankara's
treatment of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish special agents in Kenya last
February and was sentenced to death in June for leading a 15-year
war for autonomy in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey.
Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Since his capture, Ocalan has repeatedly called on the
government to spare his life in exchange for a cease-fire from his
followers, which the government dismissed as a "ploy."
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Ocalan said he was not a separatist and that he
backed away from the "historical mistakes that was done in the
past."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Turks and Kurds to "work seriously toward
peace and democracy."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Turkey needs reforms and should abide by the EU
standards.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes EU Involvement in Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry
issued a statement on Friday, dismissing a claim that the European
Union plays a role in the settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue is not a problem that concerns the EU, said the
statement, attributing the claim to the Greek foreign minister,
George Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Cyprus earlier this week, according
to a report from Nicosia, Papandreou said that the EU summit in
Helsinki last month provided an opportunity to push for a
settlement of the Cyprus issue and Cyprus' accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou continued that the Helsinki summit reconfirmed that
Cyprus' EU accession can be achieved even if the Cyprus issue is
not settled.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided after Turkish troops invaded the
Mediterranean island in 1974. International efforts have been made
to resolve the conflicts between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry stressed that "the Cyprus question will
not be a problem for the EU when the two sides on the island reach
a compromise and the EU membership is taken into consideration in
the light of this reality."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a compromise based on negotiations and
agreements is needed and it has to be accepted by the two sides of
Cyprus. "The two equal peoples on the island and two equal
sovereign states which represent them can only do that," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement declared that it is the U.N. Secretary-General,
not the EU, which has the mission to search for a solution to the
Cyprus issue, adding that the two sides ought to participate in
negotiations on the basis of equality and find a solution within
the framework of the good will of the U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's renewed call,
the leaders of the two Cypriot communities held so-called "
proximity talks" in New York last month. The next round of
negotiations are scheduled for January 31 in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' President Rejects Speaker's Call for Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has rejected a call for his resignation made by Parliament
Speaker Spyros Kyprianou earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Kyprianou was obsessed with the idea that the Greek Premier
(Costas Simitis) was following a dangerous policy which would be
detrimental to Cyprus," Clerides said in a written statement,
issued here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said at a press conference that the policy Nicosia and
Athens have adopted is "dangerous".
</P>
<P>
He said he does not consider the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks
on Cyprus as very important but instead places much more
significance on developments in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said an invitation made by German Foreign Minister to
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for talks in Berlin signals
moves to push for acknowledgement of two separate entities in
Cyprus, a long-term goal of the breakaway state in the northern
island.
</P>
<P>
He was very critical of moves for rapprochement with the Turkish
Cypriots and of confidence building measures if these imply a
gradual geographical and ethnic division of the island.
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could have contact with the Turkish Cypriots under
health conditions," Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament speaker was also critical of Europe, saying it
now serves its interests and not the lofty ideals it is meant to
promote.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou asked Clerides to dismiss some of his associates and
review his political alliances.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
Proximity talks between the island's two communities were held
in New York last month under the U.N. auspice to pave the way for a
final Cyprus solution. A new round proximity talks is scheduled to
start in Geneva at the end this month.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou left for the U.S. later Friday for a major heart
surgery.

<HEADLINE> State Urges Calm As Cases of Flu Increase in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Health Ministry and
state physicians have urged the public to remain calm as cases of
flu increase in the country.
</P>
<P>
While calling on Greeks not to be swayed by the recent rumors
of an influenza epidemic, Greece's Health Undersecretary Theodoros
Kotsonis said Friday that the state has taken all necessary
measures to deal with flu.
</P>
<P>
State physicians also urge calmness while pointing out that
most of the patients who flocked to the hospitals are panic-
striken over rumors of a deadly influenza epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Reports of flu have increased over the past few days in Greece.
In the capital city of Athens, a 10 to 15 percent increase in
admissions was reported at hospitals, with most of the patients
being treated for respiratory, heart and other related problems.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, laboratory tests
are to be conducted in order to determine what caused the deaths
of three persons who had developed flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that the deaths of the three persons, including a
30-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man, could have been caused by
meningitis though they did not exclude the possibility of
influenza.
</P>
<P>
So far, most cases of flu in Greece are Type B, but five
suspect instances of viral flu A have also been detected, along
with three confirmations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Holds Talks with Chinese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe held talks here on Friday with visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan on bilateral relations and international
issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
During the talks which proceeded in a very friendly and
in-depth way, Mugabe said both Zimbabwe and China have enjoyed
traditional friendship and cooperation which will be constantly
consolidated and developed.
</P>
<P>
Such relationship will continue to benefit the two peoples, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tang extended Chinese leaders' cordial greetings to Mugabe and
congratulated him on his re-election of President and First
Secretary of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF).  He also highly commended Mugabe's great
contributions to the establishment and development of
Sino-Zimbabwean relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that this year marks the 20th anniversary for both
the independence of Zimbabwe and the establishment of
Sino-Zimbabwean relations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, he said the two countries have always
understood, supported and helped each other and effectively
cooperated in bilateral and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the belief that in the new century, the
relations between the two countries will surely be strengthened
and bilateral cooperation will become more efficient and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Tang said currently developing
countries are facing two major challenges: one, there are new
developments in hegemonism and power politics which have damaged
the independence, sovereignty and development of many developing
countries; two, globalization brings both opportunities and
serious challenges for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st century, he said to build what kind of new
international political and economic order is a key issue for
every developing country to think about.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always advocated to establish a new
international political and economic order in accordance with the
five principles of peaceful co-existance and other commonly
recognized standards on international relations.
</P>
<P>
China holds that countries, big or small, poor or rich, strong
or weak, should be treated equally; a country's internal affairs
should be independently dealt with by its own people and foreign
countries are not allowed to interfere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed the diversity of the world should be respected,
international issues should be solved through consultations.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with economic relations between countries, one
should abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit and
seeking common development. Only by doing so, can the long-lasting
peace and universal development be realized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe agreed to Tang's analysis and views on international
situation, adding that Zimbabwe and China have shared common views
on international issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the so-called "democracy" and "human rights" spread by
some countries are hypocritic. When they ruled African countries,
they had never mentioned democracy or human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Now there are a lot of irrational phenomena in the world. Due
to some reasons, there are also some conflicts and unrests in
Africa. Zimbabwe hopes that international communities will
sincerely help Africa realize peace and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan arrived here on Thursday for a three-day visit to

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Deputies Take Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's newly-elected
parliament, the Assembly of the Republic, held its first meeting
here on Friday, with 246 of the 250 deputies taking their seats.
</P>
<P>
All but three of the 117 deputies elected by the main
opposition party, the former rebel movement Renamo (Mozambican
National Resistance), and its " Electoral Union" coalition allies
showed up.
</P>
<P>
Renamo, rejecting the results of the December 3-5 general
elections, had threatened to boycott the session. However, the
Renamo National Council overturned this decision last week.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano chaired the sitting,
saying the major task facing the country is the struggle against
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The eradication of absolute poverty should constitute the
priority task for all Mozambicans, regardless of their political
options, or their colour, race, sex, ethnic origin, birthplace,
creed or profession," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opening session also saw Mario Mangaze, president of the
country's Supreme Court, read out the court's ruling validating
the election results.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak to Meet on January 20 in the U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat will meet
in Washington on January 20, one day after the resumed Israeli-
Syrian talks, said Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Levy was in Morocco on a two-day official visit which ends on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to meet United States President Bill
Clinton, but it was not clear whether the leaders would hold a
three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday meeting between Barak and Arafat would coincide
with the date of the third and last Israeli pullout from another 6.
1 percent of the West Bank as was stipulated in a September interim
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
After the scheduled January 20 pullout, the Palestinians will be
in full or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank, but the
Palestinians want Israel to return all of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat last met on December 21 in the West Bank city
of Ramallah over the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks and the
resumed Israeli-Syrian track of peace-making.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, Barak reportedly tried to ease the Palestinian
concerns regarding movement on the Syrian track coming at the
expense of the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are trying to reach a framework
agreement by February and seal a final peace accord by September,
according to the timetable set in the Sharm el Sheikh deal signed
last September in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The brain-racking talks have to deal with thorny issues like
Jerusalem, final borders, Palestinian refugees, water rights and
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Barak-Arafat meeting later this month was also seen as
partly aimed to convince the Palestinians that their negotiations
would not be sidelined by the resumed Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareq first met last
December in Washington, restarting the Israeli-Syrian talks after a
freeze of nearly four years. They met again last week in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The January 19 meeting will be their third round of
negotiations, which deal with the Golan Heights Israel seized from
Syria in the 1967 war, water sharing, security arrangements and
normalization of ties.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Britain Sign Exercises Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Britain signed Friday
a memorandum of understanding relating to the location of military
exercises British troops conduct on the island, local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The memo provides for the exercises to be held in Kalo Horio in
southern Cyprus, instead of in the Akamas peninsula at the
northwestern tip of the island.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in the wake of protests by
environmental groups in Cyprus which called for moving the war
games away from the Akamas peninsula, a scenic spot famed for its
flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the Treaty of Establishment, which marks
the founding of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960, has been amended.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, Britain retains two sovereign military bases
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The memo was initialled early last August and British troops
have already begun carrying out military manoeuvres in the
designated area.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides described the memo
as "a satisfactory arrangement for everybody" that safeguards the
rights of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' National Guard also stages exercises in the same area,
which will not be affected by the exercises of British troops, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The decision of the Turkish government to stay the hanging of
Kurdish separatist chieftain Abdullah Ocalan was welcomed by the
European Union circles.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission praised the decision, saying that it had given
the impression that the execution will not be implemented while the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe hailed it "
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schussel, current chairman of the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said this move indicated
Turkey has entered a new phase towards Europe and this was the "
beginning of the path."
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish officials in charge of security affairs said in a
report that the Turkish radical Islamic group Hezbollah, which has
no links to Lebanon's Hezbollah (Party of God), has 20,000 members,
including 4,000 armed militants.
</P>
<P>
The group, which was recently involved in the kidnapping of
three Istanbul businessmen, was notorious for carrying out attacks
against members of pro-Kurdish parties and sympathizers for Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The Istanbul Stock Exchange (IMKB) rallied on Thursday on the
back of optimism over a Turkish government accord to delay Ocalan's
execution, with its main index soaring 7.11 percent to hit a new
all-time high of 18,138 points and trade volume at a record high of
1.85 billion U.S. dollars at the end of the day.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 2.7 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surge in last year's consumer prices stemmed from a big
jump in energy costs. But prices were relatively contained in most
other areas, posting the best performance since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that outside of energy and food, the "core"
rate of inflation was up just 1.9 percent in 1999, the smallest
annual increase since a 1.5 percent rise in 1965.
</P>
<P>
Last's year core rate was even better than a 2.4 percent
increase in 1998 and suggests that inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
The 2.7 percent advance in consumer prices was the largest
annual gain since a 3.3 percent rise in 1996. It reflected a 13.4
percent jump in energy costs, which had fallen sharply in 1998 as
the Asian financial crisis severely dampened global demand.
</P>
<P>
Production limits by oil-producing nations and increase demand
from recovering economies in Asia helped pushed the surge in
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
For December, the Consumer Price Index, the most closely
watched inflation gauge, rose only 0.2 percent, less than many
analysts were forecasting. The December gain came from a leap in
gasoline and other energy prices.
</P>
<P>
The rise in December's overall consumer prices reflected a 1.4
percent advance in energy prices, boosting the total increase for
the year to 13.4 percent, the largest annual gain since an 18.1
percent increase in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices picked up 4.1 percent last month. That pushed
the total increase for 1999 to 30.1 percent, highest since a 36.8
percent increase nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report showed that food costs rose a tiny 0.1
percent in December and 1.9 percent for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Outside energy and food, the "core" rate of inflation rose a
scant 0.1 percent in December, reflecting a smaller increase in
shelter costs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Take Measures to Improve Air Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement, which will be made public shortly, comes after
more than a year of talks between the airlines, the pilots and the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, unionized pilots from American Airlines,
Continental Airlines and members of the Air Line Pilots
Association, which represents 50,000 pilots at 51 airlines, and
others will take part in the "Aviation Safety Advancement
Partnerships."
</P>
<P>
The deal is aimed at improving understanding of the errors that
cause accidents, errors that might go unreported by pilots or crew
members who fear reprisals or punishment for violating FAA
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"It is a reporting system that allows pilots to report safety
discrepancies and have them addressed by the FAA, the union and
the airline in a non-punitive environment," said one official
familiar with the agreement.

GENEVA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of people seeking
refuge in Switzerland rose to a record level with more than 46,000
people applying for asylum in 1999, said the Swiss federal office
for refugees Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of asylum seekers was 11.5 percent more than that in

The other main sources of asylum-seekers were Iraq (3.6 per
cent),Bosnia-Herzegovina (3.3 per cent), Sri Lanka (3.2 per cent),

peak of around 10,000 in June, before falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
The office added that it had granted asylum to 2,050 people, or
5.7 percent of applicants. Last year, just under ten percent of
applications were accepted. There are now over 171,000 people
living under asylum law in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Continue Consultations with Security Council On Nominee of Arms Inspection Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday said that he would continue the consultations
during the day with the Security Council on the nominee for the
chief of a new U.N. weapons inspection regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said" It's been a bit more
complicated than one would have expected."
</P>
<P>
"We all knew that it was going to be difficult, but I am
continuing my consultations today and I am still hoping to be able
to meet the deadline of 30 days," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last month narrowly adopted a resolution
which created the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC) to replace the United Nations
Special Commission(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction. UNSCOM has been barred by Iraq from returning
since it withdrew from the country days before the U.S.-led
military strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested the U.N. chief to appoint the chairman
of UNMOVIC within 30 days of the adoption of the resolution, with
the approval of the Security Council. Rounds of consultations have
been undertaken between the U.N. chief and the Security Council,
but no consensus has been reached so far.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Serviceman Arrested in Okinawa For Alleged Rape Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. serviceman was arrested in
Japan's island prefecture of Okinawa early Friday on suspicion of
attempted rape in the city of Okinawa, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Lance Oswald McDonald of the U.S. Marine Aircraft Group-36 at
the Futemma Air Station allegedly attempted to rape a Japanese
woman in her 30s on the dance floor of a disco at around 4 a.m.
local time, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Yutaka Kawashima, in a meeting
with visiting U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Jacques Gansler in
Tokyo, expressed regret at the occurrence of the incident, and
urged the United States to make greater efforts to prevent similar
incidents from recurring and to tighten discipline within the
military.
</P>
<P>
Gansler agreed the incident was regrettable and pledged the U.S.
will make efforts to prevent such incidents from occurring again
and promised to fully cooperate in investigations related to the
case, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first arrest of a U.S. serviceman since the U.S.
military lifted a four-year-old curfew last October that banned
its personnel from being in a central district of the city of
Okinawa from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., the report said.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was imposed one month after the rape of a 12-year-
old Japanese girl by three U.S. soldiers in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rape of the girl ignited anger throughout Japan, especially
in Okinawa Island where U.S. bases are concentrated.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrillas Release 2 Pro-Israeli Militiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas
released two members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) on
Friday, one day after the SLA and Israel set free 27 Lebanese
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two SLA militiamen, 19-year-old Najem Elias and 30-year-old
Asad Turmos, were captured more than six months ago in the Israeli-
occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven Lebanese fighters and others accused of aiding them
were freed from Israeli and SLA prisons on Thursday. The release
was a goodwill gesture marking the new year and Id Al-Fitr, the
holidays marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan,
the SLA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly 125 Lebanese detainees still held in
prisons in the occupied zone and 34 in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claim to protect its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks. The zone covers about one 10th of the Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese resistance movement, spearheaded by the Iranian and
Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
dislodge about 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from
the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army detained members
of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement in the West Bank since
Thursday night after receiving information that the radical
militant group was planning attacks, the army said in a statement
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made in areas around the West Bank towns of
Jenin, Hebron and Ramallah, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not disclose the number of detainees.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-based Islamic Jihad is strongly opposed to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace moves with Israel and is
responsible for a series of suicide bombings and attacks since the
signing of the 1993 Oslo interim peace agreement between Israel and
the Arafat-led Palestinian Liberation Organization.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Wages Increase in Third Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Wages in the 11-country euro
zone rose in the third quarter last year at their highest annual
rate since 1997 as growth recovered in nearly all the countries,
the European Union's statistical office, the Eruostat, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total hourly earnings in all sectors rose by 2.2 percent on an
annualized basis, up from a 2.0 percent rate in the previous two
quarters and at their briskest pace since a 2.6 percent registered
in the final months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In industry, total labor costs rose at a 2.2 percent rate, up
from 1.8 percent in the second quarter and 2.1 percent in the
first quarter, which was also the fastest increase since the final
quarter of 1997, data from Eurostat showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total hourly labor costs grew fastest in the
Netherlands with 3.4 percent and Finland with 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth was slowest in Italy with 0.5 percent, where cuts in
employer social security contributions in 1998 continued to hold
down the rise in total wage bills.
</P>
<P>
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data released separately
confirmed the Netherlands and Finland were among the fastest
growing euro zone economies in the third quarter. Dutch GDP rose
by 1.1 percent quarter on quarter and by 4.0 percent year on year.
Finnish GDP was up 0.7 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The White House is preparing a new federal budget that will
ignore the spending limits reached in a 1997 breakthrough
agreement with Congress, a move that could open the way for new
policy initiatives but also help Republicans escape a fiscal
restraint that had become a political embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
-- In a significant concession, Syria has agreed to "friendly
and good neighborly relations" with Israel--including open borders,
full diplomatic relations, and arrangements on trade, tourism and
transportation--in the event the two countries reach a peace
agreement, according to a U.S.-drafted document.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian troops tried to tighten their grip over the
breakaway republic of Chechnya. Troops combed for rebels and
sympathizers in Argun, a town near Grozny, the capital, that has
become a conspicuous example of how hard it may be for Russia to
keep what it has taken.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Security Council confronted the question of
refugees in a debate that demonstrated how new wars demand new
definitions and policies if the millions of people they have made
homeless are to survive.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's president reshuffled key military posts and
outlined plans to overhaul the state oil company, Pertamina. Wahid
has ordered a string of changes at state-run firms this week.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Treasury, buoyed by a surging federal budget
surplus, will buy back as much as 30 billion dollars in debt
outstanding held by the public by year end.

<HEADLINE> Doctor: Maradona under Cocaine Withdrawal Symptoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentina soccer legend
Diego Maradona has got changeable in his mood after he showed
cocaine withdrawal symptoms on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Alvarez, his personal cardiologist, said here on Friday
that Maradona's mood was constantly changing due to the withdrawal
symptoms and he was now beginning the mental struggle with cocaine
addiction.
</P>
<P>
Maradona last week spent five days in a Uruguayan clinic
following an alleged cocaine overdose. He was flown back to
Argentina last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Maradona's possible trip to Toronto for specialist treatment,
Alvarez said if Maradona gave his consent a visa to enter Canada
would arrive first thing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Diego began his rehabilitation exercises on Thursday after
suffering high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat while
with his family in Uruguay's upmarket holiday resort of Punta del
Este.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said Maradona's heartbeat, which went up to 130 a
minute while skipping and doing ball control skills, did not show
signs of an irregular heartbeat this time.
</P>
<P>
A fit person should be able to work at that rate for between 60
and 70 minutes said Alvarez, but decided Maradona would not do
that because of the deterioration of his heart muscle.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Running Well CPC, State (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said an important factor behind negativity and corruption
within the Party is the slack management of some Party units and
leaders and their neglect of education, administration, and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Party committees at all levels should
establish and perfect a responsibility system, one that will have
to take responsibility when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that leaders and officials must be educated and
administered strictly, and they must set firm restrictions for
their spouses and children. Their power should never be used as a
means of advancing their own interests or those of family members.
</P>
<P>
The selection and promotion of officials must follow strict
rules, and the examination of moral quality must be considered
when choosing officials, he said, adding that the abuse of power
for personal purposes, or striking deals between power and money
will be severely punished when they are discovered.
</P>
<P>
He said that officials also must be under strict supervision,
and their conduct after work too. Party Committees at all levels
should actively seek effective ways and methods to supervise
officials.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that illegal activities and violations of
discipline among officials must be strictly investigated and
punished without mercy, no matter how high their ranks or how
renowned the offenders are. They all must face the punishment they
deserve.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in order to maintain the Party's vigor,
unqualified members must be expelled from the Party.
</P>
<P>
The Party today faces the pressing issue of educating its 60-
plus million members, he said, adding that efforts should be made
to encourage discipline inspection personnel to bravely undertake
their duties in enforcing the laws and disciplines, and in
investigating illegal activities among Party members, and help
them overcome difficulties in their work.

Arbel met police chief Yehuda Wilk here Friday afternoon to discuss
how the police will carry out investigation into the case
concerning President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The development followed a decision made Thursday night by Arbel
and Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein to ask the police to take
over the inquiry into Weizman's acceptance of cash gifts from
French businessman Edouard Seroussi.
</P>
<P>
Arbel and Rubinstein announced Thursday night that their
decision does not mean that the police inquiry is the start of the
criminal investigation against the president, but a part of the
examination they launched earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the material evidence for the past 48 hours,
they said they reached the conclusion that the material requires
additional clarification, for which they do not have the tools.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a police team will be asked to help continue the
examination, accompanied by the State Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
On learning the decision, Weizman conferred with his lawyers at
his home in Caesarea, northern Israel, and issued a statement in
which the president said he welcomes the decision to hand over the
investigation to the police.
</P>
<P>
"The President and his legal advisors welcome any step that will
bring the truth to light," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement clarified that Weizman does not consider himself
above the law, saying the president does not seek any kind of
special privilege for himself.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with what Weizman has reiterated over the past few
days, the statement made it clear that Weizman has no intention of
stepping down at this juncture.
</P>
<P>
Israeli reporter Yoav Yitzhak broke the story at the end of 1999
that Weizman received a total of 453,000 U.S. dollars from Seroussi
and Weizman used this money from 1988 to 1995 when he was member of
the Knesset (parliament), minister and president.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said he used the money for medical treatment of his
son, Shaul, who was badly wounded in the 1970 War of Attrition.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Deputy DM Denies Plans to Handover Abu Dis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said Friday that Israel has no plans at the
moment to handover Abu Dis, a Palestinian village around Jerusalem,
to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Sneh denied media reports
that the Israel Defense Forces' third-stage redeployment due next
week will include Abu Dis or other Palestinian villages in the
Jerusalem area.
</P>
<P>
Sneh confirmed the maps regarding the next withdrawal are to be
discussed at Sunday's cabinet meeting. According to Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum sighed by the two sides last September, Israel should
withdraw from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Sneh said he believes that the issue of Jerusalem should not be
resolved by dividing the city or by expanding it. In any case, he
added, it should be discussed in the permanent talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala)
told the Jerusalem Post Thursday that after next week's
redeployment, PNA will completely control Abu Dis, A-Ram, and
Eizariya, which are already under Palestinian civilian
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted senior Palestinian officials as saying
that Barak will satisfy Arafat's demand for a foothold in the
Jerusalem area to show the Palestinians and the United States that
Israel is not neglecting the Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon also told
the Knesset (Parliament) earlier this week that a transfer of Abu
Dis to full Palestinian control is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues between the
two sides and Israel claims the whole city as its eternal capital.
The Palestinians want the eastern part of the city, which Israel
seized from Jordan control in 1967, to be the capital of a future
state.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that the two sides would resolve this
issue by enlarging the city to include surrounding villages and
towns and then divide the enlarged city into parts separately
controlled by Israel and the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Job-finding has become more
difficult for Japan's graduates, according to a government survey
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of university seniors graduating this spring who
have already scored job offers has hit a record low, said the
survey conducted by Japan's Labor and Education ministries.
</P>
<P>
Only 74.5 percent of university students had been promised jobs
as of December 1, the lowest figure since the survey was first
undertaken in 1994, it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, only 46.8 percent of junior college students and 67.3
percent of senior high school students graduating in March had
lined up jobs as of December 1 and late November respectively,
also the lowest figures.
</P>
<P>
Some 241,000 graduating students still have not found jobs,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 5,860 students at 108
universities, junior colleges, and senior high schools across the
country last November.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Friday expressed regret and deep concern over U.S. State
Department officials' meeting with the so-called foreign minister
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Acts of this kind in fact mean support of terrorists and
separatists, and not only in Russia," Ivanov told reporters
following a meeting with Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews, who
is also chairman of the Council of Europe's committee of ministers,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are in the middle of a military campaign
against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The offensive was launched last September following two waves
of armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate
of terrorist bombings, which left more than 300 people dead in
three Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been pressing Moscow to ease the campaign,
accusing it of using inappropriate force and causing casualties
among civilians. Moscow has rejected such charges, saying the
military actions were aimed at "bandits and international
terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said U.S. meetings with the so-called Chechen foreign
minister were making it more complex to find solutions to the
North Caucasus problems and were indeed deepening the plight of
the peaceful civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. State Department James Rubin acknowledged
that Iliyas Akhmadov met late Thursday "ordinary employees" of U.S.
departments that deal with human rights, refugees and Russian
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. officials were meeting with Akhmadov as a "
private individual and a Russian citizen."

Matthaus criticized the MetroStars for not consulting him on

"The people I had been in contact with have both been sacked,"
Matthaus said. "I have been wronged and I don't let myself be
treated this way. Under these conditions, I am losing motivation."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Running Well CPC, State (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC),
stressed here today that in order to run the State well, efforts
must be made to strictly run the CPC well first and this is
decided by the nature, status and historical mission of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The key to how things are done in China today is the ruling
party, its thought, work style, discipline, organization, fighting
power and leadership, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also Chinese State president and chairman of the
Central Military Commission, made the remarks here today while
addressing the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which was presided over by Wei
Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the CCDI.
</P>
<P>
The session was also attended by other senior Chinese Party
leaders Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
In view of the CPC's history of more than 70 years, the
brilliance and twists and turns of the cause of socialism in the
world in the 20th century, and the current outstanding problems
among the Party members and leading Party officials, Jiang
expounded the necessity, urgency, and significance of strictly
running the Party well.
</P>
<P>
"The more we do in reform and opening up and in developing
socialist market economy, the stricter we should be in running the
Party well," the Chinese leader stressed, adding, otherwise, it is
"very dangerous" if the Party is loose in discipline and
organization."
</P>
<P>
How to always play the Party's powerful role as the leading
core under the new domestic and international environment is the
fundamental question of further consolidating and fully
demonstrating the superiority of socialism in its cross-century
development in China.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Anti-Corruption Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will continue and
heighten its ongoing anti-corruption campaign to ensure a clean
and honest government in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the fourth plenary session of the
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), which opened Wednesday and ended here today,
has set strict rules demanding that leaders at all levels perform
their official duties honestly, and forbidding their pursuit of
illegal profits either for themselves or their family members.
</P>
<P>
The state will continue to crack down on violations of the law
committed by leading officials of the Party, government
departments, law-enforcing departments, procuratorates, and
economic management departments, and priority will be given to
major cases.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that unhealthy tendencies in government
departments and all economic activities should be corrected.
Efforts should be made to ensure the safety and efficacy of
medicine, further lighten the burdens on farmers, supervise the
use of state bonds and social security funds, and end the charging
of all illegal highway fees and school tuition.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening anti-corruption efforts is an important measure
for pushing forward the reform and development of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the session said that General Secretary of the
CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin in his speech at the session
today profoundly analyzed the anti-corruption struggle, and set
new specific tasks.
</P>
<P>
They asked all Party members to accomplish the tasks set forth
by Jiang Zemin on opposing corruption, building the Party, further
upgrading leadership ability, and continuing the anti-corruption
struggle to meet with confidence the challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Participants also reviewed the country's efforts to clean up
government and fight corruption during the past year, and agreed
that great achievements have been made in creating a clean and
honest government in accordance with the Party guidelines.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out, however, that the fight against corruption is
far from over, and called for more stringent enforcement of all
laws and regulations.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Change of Jordanian Royal Court Chief Heralds Reforms By Wang Bingfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent move to strike
harmony with the government, Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein on
Thursday appointed Fayez Tarawneh as new royal court chief to
replace Abdul Kareem Kabarati who resigned earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The re-emergence of the 50-year-old career politician as chief
of the powerful royal court was viewed here as the start of a
series of measures by King Abdullah to reform the administrative
structure of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh was first named as royal court chief in March 1998 and
five months later he was appointed as prime minister by late King
Hussein Ibn Talal, Abdullah's father.
</P>
<P>
The royal court chief, one of the most important posts of the
kingdom, is responsible for handling daily affairs of the royal
family and serves as the de facto liaison officer between the king
and the government.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the royal court chief is
actually the No. 3 figure in the political hierarchy of the kingdom
after the king and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Kabarati, known as a liberal-minded reformer, resigned after his
personal relationships soured months ago with Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
In public, both Rawabdeh and Kabarati had sought to play down
their differences, and pictures carried on local newspapers showed
they are shaking hands in all smiles. However, Kabarati had shunned
meetings during the past months which were also attended by the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah appointed Kabarati member of the 40-seat Senate, or
the upper house of parliament which was formed by veteran
politicians. But the outgoing chief also seems interested in
resuming his original job as the board chairman of the Jordanian-
Kuwaiti Bank this year.
</P>
<P>
Though at odds with Rawabdeh, Kabarati had enjoyed support from
the monarch for his administrative reforms and budget cuts that
saved the royal court at least 1 million Jordanian dinars (1.4
million U.S. dollars) during his nine-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
Kabarati also credited himself for playing an instrumental role
in the diplomatic arena to improve the kingdom's ties with Syria,
Lebanon and the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Kabarati who is eager for speedy reforms, Tarawneh
believed that Rawabdeh should garner as much solid support as
possible for the reforms as he is at the forefront of state
affairs, a source close to Tarawneh said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh hoped to maintain the smooth ties between King Abdullah
and the prime minister, said the source, adding that Tarawneh is
known as an "old guard" who does not have any private motives.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh had enjoyed a close personal relationship with King
Abdullah who assumed the throne last February after King Hussein
died of cancer. And Tarawneh also kept excellent working ties with
Rawabdeh who replaced him as prime minister on March 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, also blessed with diplomatic experiences, had served
as Jordan's ambassador to the United States from 1989 to 1992
before he was appointed as foreign minister under then Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
He also headed the kingdom's negotiating team with Israel before
the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Lebanese held in Israel since 1987 and 25 others who had
been detained in the South Lebanese Army's Khiam Prison in the
security zone were released Thursday to mark Id al-Fitr, the
festival concluding the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The latest move, the fourth of its kind in the past month, was
seen as a further confidence-building measure, as well as a means
of trying to obtain information regarding the fate of missing
Israeli Air Force navigator Ron Arad.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office confirmed the
authenticity of the U.S. draft document pertaining to an Israeli-
Syrian accord, which was published by Ha'aretz newspaper Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's office explained that the American document is
merely a preliminary draft and that Israel has submitted to the U.
S. dozens of pages of remarks in response.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State
Attorney Edna Arbel announced Thursday that they has asked the
police to take over the inquiry into allegation that President Ezer
Weizman had accepted cash gifts from French businessman Edouard
Saroussi
</P>
<P>
But they insist that this is part of the examination they
launched earlier this week and not the start of a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Weizman immediately announced that he welcomes the decision to
hand over the investigation to the police.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad Thursday to discuss the third round of Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, which are to resume on Wednesday in Shepherdstown,
West Virginia, for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders talked at length about "how we can make progress
when the next round commences," White House deputy press secretary
Jake Siewert said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Words on Fate of Saudi Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Said al-Sahaf has refuted a statement by Saudi Arabia accusing Iraq
of hiding information about the fate of a Saudi pilot whose
warplane was shot down inside Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iraqi TV's Satellite Channel on
Thursday evening, Sahaf described the statement made by Saudi
Defense Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz as "baseless and incorrect."
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said the Saudi authorities had informed Iraq early October
1992 that a Saudi warplane F5 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Nadira
was shot down by Iraqi ground defense forces in the border area of
Arar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, searching for the body of the dead pilot in
the Arar area was impossible as it was filled with mines planted
during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
And the Iraqi air defenses had shot down a number of hostile
warplanes, most of which were U.S. and British jets, however, these
downed planes may include some Saudi ones, Sahaf added.
</P>
<P>
He refuted Saudi Arabia's claims that the pilot was seen
detained in Iraq by saying that Iraq had produced certain evidence
which proved that the Saudi pilot was killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said that an Iraqi colonel who is now on pension had
informed the foreign ministry in a letter in 1997 that he saw the
fall of a Saudi plane by Iraqi air defenses early February 1991 and
he buried the pilot after he made sure that he was Saudi.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said that this Iraqi colonel recited details of the story
to the Saudi authorities when he attended meetings of a technical
committee in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said that Iraq has presented serious proposals to end this
matter by sending a team of representatives from Iraq, Saudi Arabia
and ICRC to the scene and getting the corpse of the pilot out of
grave.
</P>
<P>
He added that ICRC informed Iraq on December 14, 1999 of the
Saudi acceptance of the Iraqi proposal to search for the wreckage
of the plane with the participation of Iraqi and Saudi personnel
only.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Iraq is ready to send copies of memos
concerning the matter which had already been sent to ICRC and the
Saudi defense minister via their permanent representatives in the
Arab League.

sell, leading the key Nikkei index to minus territory briefly
following its sharp gain in early trading.
</P>

<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian table tennis
player complained on Friday that the air conditioning at a venue
for the Sydney Olympics created too much wind and caused his ball
to drift, according to reports from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Werner Schlager created a stir at an official Sydney Olympic
test event, said: "I was a little bit angry because of the wind
condition here...there was really strong wind yesterday. I wasn't
really focused. That shouldn't happen normally."
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Games organisers said there had been no
official complaint and that conditions were set at standards
approved by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).

URUMQI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A mudslide caused by heavy
snowfall destroyed two houses, three livestock sheds and killed
130 livestock in Ili in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Trees over 100 years old were uprooted and about 30 hectares of
grassland was also destroyed by the mudslide which occurred in the
early morning of January 9.
</P>
<P>
The mudslide has caused Kazak herdsmen at a village in Xinyuan
County to resettle elsewhere. Since the new year, the western part
of the Tianshan Mountain has recorded 120 hours of snowfall.
Snowfalls have averaged 40 cm.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attributed the mudslide to heavy snowfalls, the
largest snowfalls recorded in Ili in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Ili river valley in the northern part of Xinjiang is known
as "wet island". Its has the highest annual rainfall in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> HK, Finland Sign MOU on Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government Friday signed a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Finland on cooperation in
information technology and services and telecommunications in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The MOU contemplates an extensive range of co-operative
activities, from commercial and industrial exchanges to investment
and technology partnerships, and from educational and learning
exchanges to the sharing of policy and regulatory information.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has so far signed MOUs on information and
technology cooperation with Canada, Australia and the United
Kingdom respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since these three MOUs were signed, Hong Kong and its partners
have organized a number of activities under the MOUs which prove
to be mutually beneficial and enriching, according to a senior
information technology official.
</P>
<P>
"This has encouraged us to explore the opportunities for
entering into similar co-operation arrangements with other
countries," Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting
K C Kwong said at the MOU signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to industry estimates, the total value of products
and services transacted over the Internet in Hong Kong will
increase from 60 million U.S. dollars in 1998 to 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The potential market in the Chinese mainland is even more
impressive, Kwong said, adding that the number of Internet users
has doubled from about 2 million in 1998 to some 4 million in 1999
and the electronic commerce turnover is forecast to leap from a
minuscule 8.1 million U.S. dollars in 1998 to 3.8 billion U.S.
dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Signing on behalf of the Finnish government was Olli-Pekka
Heinonen, minister of transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that co-operation between Finland and Hong
Kong will help to advance our mutual interests in the rapidly
evolving fields of information technology, information services
and telecommunications," Heinonen said.

HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An inter-departmental red
tide working group Friday reported four red tide sightings within
Hong Kong waters, but no fish culture zones were affected.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the working group said a red tide formed by
Prorocentrum dentatum and Prorocentrum minimum was observed along
Shing Mun River by staff of the Environmental Protection
Department last Friday and the red tide began to dissipate on
January 13.
</P>
<P>
"They have been sighted in Hong Kong waters before but led to
no associated fish kill," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said red tide was a natural phenomenon and the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's pro-active
and comprehensive phytoplankton monitoring program would continue
monitoring red tide occurrence to minimize its impact on
mariculture industry.

<HEADLINE> HK Retail Sales Pick up in November 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's volume of retail
sales picked up further in year-on-year growth in November 1999,
according to the figures on retail sales released Friday by the
Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The increases in sales volume across a wide range of consumer
goods pointed to a rather broad-based revival in consumer spending
as the local economy progressively picked up. Also helping
consumer demand was the prevalence of price discounts.
</P>
<P>
Among the high-value items, sales of jewelry, watches and
clocks, and valuable gifts were virtually unchanged, but sales of
motor vehicles and of furniture and fixtures continued to show
double-digit increases of 14 percent and 11 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
For the first eleven months as a whole, total retail sales
decreased by 2 percent in volume compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman pointed out that year-on-
year growth in the volume of retail sales accelerated for the
fifth month in a row since the rebound in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The value of total retail sales in November 1999, estimated at
14.3 billion HK dollars (1.83 billion U.S. dollars), decreased by
3 percent compared with November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by type of retail outlet and on a year-on-year
comparison, the sales of most categories of consumer goods
increased in volume terms in November 1999.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Restart Demining Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
announced that an official program of mine clearance will soon be
restarted forcefully around the heavily-mined country, the
National Radio Station reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to provide the National Institute
of Removing Explosive Obstacles with funds for reviving the
activities delayed for four months by the rampant civil conflicts,
General Director of the institute Helder Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cruz, in the current year the institute will give
priority to the training of sappers with an aim to recover and
improve the capacity of defusing the explosives.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, the demining activities in Angola led by
the government have been totally paralyzed due to the fierce
battles in the central highlands, where a lot of strategic cities
and towns are heavily mined, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Banks Oversee Banking Card Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An organization to supervise
the banking card market in Shanghai was established today through
the joint effort of local banks.
</P>
<P>
All major Chinese banks and branches of the Standard Chartered
Bank and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd. are
members of the new organization, aimed at intensifying
communication and exchanges on banking card business, and creating
a fair and open market for all competitors.
</P>
<P>
The fast development of the banking card market has caused some
banks to use unfair methods including lowering business fees to
increase their market share.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's banking card market has developed rapidly in the
last few years, and there are now some 16 million cards in use in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that along with cards issued by the
eight main Chinese banks, some medium and small-sized commercial
banks, such as Everbright, the Guangdong Development Bank, and the
Shenzhen Development Bank, have also entered the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
Compared with the urban waste water treatment situation in 1999,
the treatment level will be increased by five to 10 percentage
points, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, recently urged governments at all levels to step
up construction of waste water treatment facilities in urban areas
and continue to curb pollution in both urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Mayor Liu Qi said earlier this week that the city
aims to have 40 percent of its waste water treated before it flows
into rivers by the end of this year, a level higher than most
other major cities in China which have less to spend on these
projects.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Delegation Arrives in Baghdad to Voice Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A large Spanish delegation
comprising 107 key figures early Friday arrived in Baghdad to voice
solidarity with the Iraqi people on the 9th anniversary of the 1991
Gulf War, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the ruling Baath party's Foreign Relations
Bureau said the Spanish delegation will meet a number of Iraqi
officials and organize several activities to show the Spanish
people's solidarity with the Iraqi people in confronting the U.S.-
British aggression and the continuous embargo.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Spanish delegation includes some
company representatives who will bid for contracts under the oil-
for-food program which allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to
buy humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Spain is one of the few West European countries that have
reestablished diplomatic ties with Baghdad after the U.S.-led
multinational forces drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in the
Gulf War which broke out on January 17, 1991.

<HEADLINE> OAU Upbeat Towards Peace Settlement of Ethio-Eritrean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) is upbeat towards the peace settlement of the 20-month
Ethio-Eritrean border conflict, the Addis Tribune newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The African organization has responded adequately to Ethiopia's
request for clarifications of technical arrangement designed to
solve the conflict peacefully, an unidentified OAU official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
After all the detailed clarifications made by the OAU to
Ethiopia, it will be surprising if war is to resume, the official
said, adding that the clarifications should enable Ethiopia to
have the confidence to sign the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The technical arrangement is part of the OAU peace settlement
plans that also include the framework agreement and the
modalities.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has so far accepted the latter two while refusing to
accept the former, alleging that the technical arrangement,
failing to be consistent with the framework agreement and the
modalities, amounts to "appeasement".
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia asked the OAU to clarify the technical arrangement
last August.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the OAU, which offered Ethiopia its
revised peace plan before the end of last year, is waiting for
response from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has announced to accept the OAU's package peace plan.
</P>
<P>
According to OAU officials, the largest African organization
has made unreserved efforts to involve the warring Ethiopia and
Eritrea in a constructive peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of Africa neighbors have been at war since May
1998. The sustained border conflict has claimed tens of
thousands of lives from both sides.

<P>
Sampras did not drop serve against Philippoussis but had to
fight off several break points. Philippoussis raced to a 5-0 lead
in the first set tie-breaker after volleying errors from Sampras
and wrapped it up 7-4.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis won the second set tie-breaker 7-5 after marching
to a 6-3 advantage.

CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Sixth seed Amelie Mauresmo of
France overwhelmed top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland 7-5, 6-3
in a women's semi-final match at the Sydney International tennis
tournament on Friday, setting up a final with defending champion
American Lindsay Davenport, who easily beat eighth seed Anna
Kournikova of Russia.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Jason Stoltenberg will meet Lleyton Hewitt
in the first all-Aussie final.
</P>
<P>
It was sweet revenge for Mauresmo, who rated it one of her best
wins. The Frenchwoman lost to Hingis in the Australian Open final
last year.
</P>
<P>
20-year-old Mauresmo spent 51 minutes to win hard-fought first
set. In the second set, she had a 4-1 early lead before Hingis
clawed back to 4-3. But Mauresmo took the next two games and the
match.
</P>
<P>
Davenport beat her russian rival 6-3, 6-2 in another semi-final.
The American has looked comfortable all week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the men's semi-finals, the unseeded Hewitt continued
his spectacular start to the new year with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over
Spain's Alex Corretja.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt will take on wildcard Stoltenberg who eliminated
Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Macao Banks Not Intend to Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Although there are guesses of
higher interest rates in the United States, local banks have no
intention of raising interest rates, a senior banker in Macao said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that Hong Kong and Macao are undergoing
economic recovery, the banks do not expect to raise interest rates,
said Zhu Chi, general manager of the Bank of China Macao Branch.
</P>
<P>
He noted that banks in Hong Kong and Macao do not always keep
in step with the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "the rise of interest rates in the U.S. will
definitely affect the economies in Hong Kong and Macao," Zhu Chi
said.
</P>
<P>
Possible rise of interest rates in Hong Kong and Macao will
rely on the time and extent of interest rate changes in the United
States, the banker said.
</P>
<P>
As the local currency of pataca in Macao is pegged to Hong Kong
dollar, banks in Macao and Hong Kong normally adopt the same
banking policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, a total of 1.024 million
persons from Taiwan passed through the barrier gate which acts as
the only land connection between Macao and the inland areas of
China, the Macao Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which means that about 2,800 persons crossed the
barrier gate each day on the average, represents a 10 percent
increase over that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the annual number of Taiwan
travelers going through the port exceeded one million.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been a leading transfer site for Taiwan travelers to

<HEADLINE> 5 Bosnian Croats Found Guilty of War Charges, One Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Five Bosnian Croats were found
guilty of crimes against humanity Friday by the U.N. criminal
tribunal for former Yugoslavia and one not guilty in the 1993
killing of more than 110 Muslims in central Bosnia, said reports
reaching here from the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The five were sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Charged with ordering the killing, Vladimir Santic, the then
local leader of the Bosnian Croat militia, was given 25 years of

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Race Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Except East Anglia and Yorkshire and Humberside, every UK
region has now recovered from the property price slump of the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
But the rate of increase has continued to accelerate, with
prices rising at an annual rate of 18.4 percent in the last three
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
David Parry, of Nationwide, said, "London remains the strongest
market, with prices up over 20 percent in 1999, not seen since the
peak of the 1980s housing boom."
</P>
<P>
Overall, UK house prices are now 19 percent higher than at
their previous peak in 1989 and are up 49 percent since their low
point in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here the fast rise in house prices is one of the
main reasons that the Bank of England rose interest rates by a
quarter point to 5.75 percent Thursday.

<HEADLINE> French Investigators Clear Erika Captain of Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- French investigators said on
Friday that the captain of the "Erika" oil tanker which sank in
December off the French western coast and caused one of the
country's largest environment disasters in history, is not
responsible for the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Bureau of Sea Accidents Inquiry (BEA) held the
owner of the ship, its successive charterers, and the Italian
company in charge of checking its security responsible for the
disaster, because the sinking was caused by "its structural
weakness."
</P>
<P>
"In the present stage of investigation, neither the conditions
of loading of the ship, nor the behavior of the captain and his
team seems to have caused with a significant manner what has
happened," said the report, which was submitted to the Minister of
Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot.
</P>
<P>
The oil tanker split in two during a storm on December 12,
because "its structure no longer let it resist," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that there had been signs of corrosion of the bulkhead
and bottom of the ship months before the accident, but the Italian
company of classification in charge of checking the ship, Rina,
failed to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the charterers of the ship over the past two years
had never asked for a verification of the ship's structure, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Financial Market to Open Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dubai Financial Market
(DFM) is expected to go into operation by mid-February, which may
mark the formal launch of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stock
exchange, a local daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the DFM has been delayed for one year because
there was no official instruction to go ahead with it, a senior
official at the Dubai Department of Economic Development told
Khaleej Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The UAE government has been working on setting up a formal
bourse for some years. It finally approved a law on this issue last
October, but it has yet to establish a supervising body --
Securities and Commodities Authority - before the stock exchange
can be formally launched.
</P>
<P>
Under the stock market law, the future exchange will provide
electric trading based on two trading floors in Abu Dhabi and
Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The trading floor in Dubai, namely the DFM, was originally
scheduled to open at the end of last year, but was postponed
because it had to coordinate with the concerned commercial and
financial departments in Abu Dhabi, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It is purely a matter of coordination between the two emirates
which would like to see the two markets begin operations
simultaneously, the unnamed official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the opening of an official stock exchange in
the country will help control market volatility, protect small
investors' rights and boost confidence in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Portugal to Urge EU to Make Clear Position Over Angolan War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Portugal said that it will ask
the European Union to make an explicit position over the Angolan
civil war since the political-military situation in the southern
African country has changed.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, who arrived in Luanda
Thursday, made the statement during his talks with his Angolan
counterpart Joao Miranda on the latest development in the
battle-field.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that after my visit, there will be an adoption of
position by the European Union," the official Angolan news agency
Angop Friday quoted Gama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This(adoption of position) is an imperative during the next EU
 presidency," said Gama, whose country will take the rotating EU
presidency for the following six months.
</P>
<P>
With the great victory gained by the government troops in the
central highlands and the reinforcement of the United Nations
sanctions against the UNITA rebels, more and more countries and
international organizations began re-examining the situation in
Angola and reconsidering their positions over the Angolan civil
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
For most Western countries, Angola is an excellent treasure
house, because it is the second-largest oil-producing country in
Africa and rich in many mineral resources including diamonds,
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Gama reiterated the importance of developing the friendly and
cooperative relations between Portugal and Angola, saying that the
bilateral economic cooperation in the past three years has
increased by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Miranda noted that the issue of the Angolan debts to
Portugal will be discussed and negotiated at a high level.
</P>
<P>
During the first visit made by Gama to Angola in last February,
he declared that the question of debts should not be prior
condition for the development of the bilateral relations, Angop
said.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Found in Chengdu Suburb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A female giant panda which was
found Wednesday in a Chengdu suburb, is now under intensive care
at the Chengdu Giant Panda Research Center 80 kilometers away from
the capital city of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the center said that the giant panda is still in
a critical condition as it is suffering from severe dehydration
and malnutrition. However, they are confident that the panda's
life can be saved, and it will take at least six months for the
panda to completely recover.
</P>
<P>
The panda is about 10 years old, weighs 53 kilograms and has
raised children, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda was found in a coma Wednesday night by a farmer
in a village, Hongkou Township in the city of Dujiangyan, 70
kilometers from Chengdu. The village is inside a 43,000-hactare
nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that there are about 50 to 70 giant pandas
living in the virgin forests in the reserve. In recent years,
local farmers have found several pandas in these forests.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are considered to be one of the world's most
endangered species. Only about 1,000 are known to exist, most of
which inhabit Sichuan, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that about three million years ago, giant pandas
roamed most parts of China, Viet Nam, Myanmar and other Southeast
Asian countries. Over time, however, mountainous areas in Sichuan
became their homes.
</P>
<P>
Almost no giant pandas have been seen in and around big cities
for over 100 years.

<HEADLINE> China's Tourism Industry Recorded 400 Billion Yuan in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's tourism recorded a
rapid growth of 400.2 billion yuan (about 48 billion U.S.dollars)
in 1999, increasing 16.4 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Overseas tourists accounted for 14.1 billion U.S. dollars in

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on tourism being held here,

promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
As the Asian economy started to recover from the financial
crisis last year, tourism in China picked up quickly. China's
tourism saw two-digit growth in the Japanese, Russian, German and
French market last year and strong growth in Asia as well.

overseas arrivals last year, up 14.7 percent on an annual basis.
At the same time, China's tourism market developed rapidly,
recording an annual income of 283.1 billion yuan, increasing 18
percent from the previous year.

The Kunming World Horticulture Exposition between May and
October last year attracted 9.4 million tourists from home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
New regulations have also helped to greatly promote the
industry, said He Guangwei.

NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) is assessing the drought situation in northern
Kenya with a view to providing food aid and starting long-term
development projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's representative to Kenya Frederick Lyons said that the

NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An upturn in Kenya's economic
growth is likely in the second half of this year in view to the
progress made on structural and governance issues in recent
months, the Central Bank of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
The upturn will be enhanced by the anticipated resumption of

</P>
<P>
The review available here Friday said that the recent economic
recovery initiatives taken by the government should bear fruits

<P>
It identified some of the measures already put in place as,
among others, steps to streamline procurement of goods and
services, contain expenditure and balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
Other measures underway to spur economic growth include the
on-going repairs of roads, the restructuring of telecommunications
sub-sector, the rationalization program for civil service and the
privatization of some the state parastatals, the review added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian to Complete Privatization in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Privatization of
parastatals in Tanzania will be finalized within three years,
Tanzanian Minister for Finance Daniel Yona has said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has started with small public ventures
and is determined to clear the remaining big firms in two or three
years, Yona said Thursday at a signing ceremony of a
5.9-million-U.S. dollar grant from the French government.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 270 out of 395 parastatals in the east African
country have been privatized, the "African" newspaper Friday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Yona, the delay to divest large firms was due to
the thorough scrutiny needed because of their complexity,
sensitivity and the fate of many people involved.
</P>
<P>
The biggest parastatals earmarked for privatization include
Tanzania Telecommunication Company Ltd., Tanzania Railways
Corporation, Tanzania Harbors Authority, Tanzania Electric Supply
Company, and the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, many public corporations have been privatized to
ease the government of budget burden.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the privatization process was also aimed at
acquiring modern technology, management skills and production
enhancement.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Acquires Hughes Satellite Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Boeing has taken a major
step in its expansion into the industry of satellite manufacturing
by acquiring the world's biggest maker of commercial
communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer announced Thursday that
it will acquire Hughes Electronics' space and communications
business and related operations for a value of 3.75 billion U.S.
dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has been trying for years to build up its space business
to balance its reliance on jetliners, an economically sensitive
industry that faces heavy price pressure. Meanwhile, Hughes wants
to spend less on satellite in order to invest more in its DirecTV
unit, the largest U.S. satellite television service.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing intends to be number one in space," the company's
announcement quoted its chairman and CEO Phil Condit as saying. "
This acquisition is a significant step forward in executing our
goal of becoming the industry leader in integrated, space-based
information and communications."
</P>
<P>
Industry projections indicate that the space and communications
market will grow from its current 40 billion dollars to 120
billion dollars annually by 2010, primarily driven by growth in
commercial and government information and communications systems
and services.
</P>
<P>
The transaction will boost Boeing's space and communications
revenues and earnings by more than a third and will provide for
significant future growth, the company said in the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The new business unit, to be named Boeing Satellite Systems,
will be part of Boeing's Space and Communications group involving
in launch services, information and communications, human space
flight and exploration, and missile defense and space control.

<HEADLINE> Personal Computer Prices Rise in U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent spike in computer
parts prices and reduced competition among manufacturers are
pushing up prices of personal computers for the first time in
years, according to reports from the Silicon Valley in California
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average price of home computers sold at retail abruptly
reversed course last fall, edging up from 790 U.S. dollars in
September to 844 dollars in December, according to the PC Data
research firm.
</P>
<P>
This month, Hewlett-Packard raised its lowest-priced home
computer by 100 dollars to 649 dollars, and Compaq Computer raised
its cheapest model by 150 dollars to 699 dollars. The prices don't
include rebates or a 150-dollar monitor.
</P>
<P>
Even eMachines, an upstart that vaulted to become the No. 3 PC
seller at retail last year on the strength of its 400 dollar
machine, is crawling up the price ladder.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that driving the prices are two trends.
</P>
<P>
Rivalry among PC companies dropped dramatically last year after
IBM, Packard Bell-NEC and Acer pulled out of retail stores,
smarting from price wars that had slashed profits. The reduced
competition gave the remaining heavyweights -- notably Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard -- more leeway to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
Also lending upward pressure were an increase in memory chip
costs last fall and the aftermath of an earthquake in Taiwan that
damaged some chip factories and disrupted supplies, they said.

<HEADLINE> World Gas Demand Forecast to Grow 2.7 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The demand for natural gas
around the globe is expected to increase at an average annual rate
of 2.7 percent in the next decade, a Chinese energy expert said
here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Dakuang, a senior expert with the China
National Petroleum Corporation, the world's total annual demand
for natural gas would rise to a little over 3,000 billion cubic
meters by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Gas demand in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to increase
from around 200 billion cubic meters in 1995 to some 470 billion
cubic meters by 2010, with an average annual growth rate of six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Han expects China's demand for gas to grow from 18 billion
cubic meters in 1995 to 100 billion cubic meters by 2010.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rapid growth in gas consumption to several
factors. At a time when protecting the environment has become a
global concern, gas as an alternative fuel has been one of the key
reasons for increased consumption.
</P>
<P>
Gas is also an extremely efficient form of fuel, he said,
adding that economic restructuring and urbanization worldwide will
see an ever increasing use of gas.

<HEADLINE> No Influenza Outbreaks Predicted in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese influenza experts say
that there is unlikely to be a nationwide flu epidemic in China in
the wake of outbreaks in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
Epidemic prevention departments in Beijing and Guangzhou also
confirmed today that there have no reports of serious outbreaks so
far.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that following last year's flu outburst in
China, about 60 to 70 percent of Chinese are more or less immune
to the Type A Sydney strain which left millions in Europe
bedridden in the past several weeks, according to Guo Yuanji,
director of the China National Flu Center.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to be infected by the same strain two
years in a row," he said, adding that the mutation has not been
detected in China. "Unless new types of flu virus emerge, there
will be no large scale outburst of flu."
</P>
<P>
China has long been considered as the breeding ground for new
flu virus and is being closely monitored, according to Guo.
</P>
<P>
Type A virus spread throughout China last winter. More than one
million people or one tenth of the total population were hit by
the virus in Beijing alone.
</P>
<P>
The October-January figure of those suffering from upper
respiratory tract infections, the flu and the common cold dropped
by 36 percent from the same period in 1998-1999, said an expert
responsible for monitoring influenza in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The symptoms of most patients, such as coughs, high fever,
sniveling and sneezing, are typical common cold caused by sudden
fluctuations in the weather, but not the flu virus," said Dong
Zhenying at the Beijing Station for Epidemic Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore PM's Visit Brings Hope for Indonesia's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The two-day working visit by
Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong starting Thursday seems
to be an important event for the Indonesian economy which has been
trying to overcome its deepest crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister Goh's visit is focused on the strengthening of
the economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly
in five main sectors, that is, manufacture, trade, finance,
agroindustry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Many in the country expect that the first visit by a
Singaporean leader to Indonesia since its new government was
established would have a positive impact on its economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with Goh's visit, the Indonesian government is also
expected to be able to learn how to handle its economic crisis as
Singapore was noted as the successful country in Southeast Asia
which could overcome its economic turmoil well.
</P>
<P>
Observers hold that Singapore as a neighboring country has a
dominant role to play in Indonesia's economic recovery. The value
of investment planted by Singapore's businesspeople will affect
how fast the economic recovery will progress.
</P>
<P>
Among the members of the Association of Southeast Asia Nation (
ASEAN),Singapore was recorded as the largest foreign investor in
Indonesia with its total value of investment reaching 700 million
U.S. dollars in 1999 in 136 projects nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The National Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) reported that
in 1999, Singapore occupied the fourth place among the foreign
investors in Indonesia after Saudi Arabia, Australia and China's
Taiwan province.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that, with Goh's visit, Singaporean
investors would be more and more interested in Indonesia as the
Indonesian government would offer them many more sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government expected that Singapore's
businesspeople would, among other places, invest their capital in
Aceh province, the western-most province of Indonesia,
particularly to develop the Sabang port, while Minister for
Housing and Development of Territory Erna Witoelar expressed the
hope that Singaporean entrepreneurs would invest in property
sector in this country.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean prime minister, during his talk with President
Abdurrahman Wahid,pledged to keep supporting both Singapore's and
other countries' entrepreneurs to invest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the joint investment
cooperation were signed on Thursday night by the Singapore Chamber
of Commerce and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce (KADIN).
</P>
<P>
An investment value of more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars have
been pledged to be planted in Indonesia in agriculture and fishery
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government would also spend 500 million U.S.
dollars to facilitate Singaporean entrepreneurs who want to invest
in Indonesia and 400 million U.S. dollars as co-landing loan which
would be used as a guarantee against risk for Singaporean
investment.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinary investment," Aburizal Bakrie,
Chairman of KADIN when commenting on the investment commitment
made by the Singapore government.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid appreciated that the Singapore government has
paved the way for foreign investors to keep coming into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"...foreign investors from many countries around the world will
come and invest in Indonesia... We thank Singapore,"Wahid said
after meeting with Goh.
</P>
<P>
In tourism sector, Indonesia also expected that one seventh of
the seven million tourists who visit Singapore every year would be
willing to come to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
While the Singaporean PM's two-day visit has raised hope for
the Indonesia's economic recovery, there are many tasks that still
have to be completed by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
They include security guarantee for investment, law assurance,
and combating corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
The threats of violence and unrest as well as disintegration
should also be tackled soon.

<HEADLINE> Asia To Become "Growth Center" Again: Obuchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a press conference held here Friday, Obuchi said Japan will
cooperate with Asian nations in their structural reforms
especially in the areas of financing and human resources
development.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that after the financial crisis, Asian
countries should take into consideration the social vulnerability
and the protection of environment instead of the single-minded
pursuit of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Thai economic situation which is improving
faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi pledged to convey to the world at the upcoming Group-of-
Eight (G-8) summit in July the "bright and forceful" message that
reflects adequately the interest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Cambodia, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
said that measures addressing the disparity among Southeast Asian
countries should be taken up.
</P>
<P>
In Laos, the second stop of Obuchi's current three-nation tour,
Lao Prime Minister Sisavat Keobounphan considered the human
resources development very important when responding to
globalization, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called for more attention to
developing countries in world economic forums like the
International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization to
improve the welfare of all people in the world, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister said that Japan will listen more to
the developing countries and reflect their voices in the G-8
summit to be held in July in the southern Japanese island of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also pledged to extend more financial help to Asian
countries despite a heavy budget deficit at home.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister arrived here Thursday for a three-
day official visit to Thailand, which is widely seen by analysts
as a demonstration of Japan's growing determination to seek a
leadership role in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Frees 58 Abducted Ugandan Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
released 58 Ugandan girls abducted by the rebels of the Ugandan
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), the New Vision newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi
broke the news late Thursday night, soon after he returned from a
trip to Sudanese capital Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
About 119 girls were abducted in October 1996 by Uganda's LRA
rebels allegedly backed by the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
However, Sudan's release of the girls is regarded as a gesture
of good will to Uganda after Kampala decided to free 72 Sudanese
prisoners of war earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which have been accusing each other of
backing rebels operating in their respective countries, have
decided to mend their ties and to restore full diplomatic
relations by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart
Omar al- Bashir signed a peace agreement in Kenyan capital Nairobi
on December 8, 1999, paving the way for the normalization of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to disband and disarm terrorist groups and to
prevent any acts of terrorism or hostile actions that might
originate in the other' s territory and endanger the security of
the other nation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to make special efforts to locate and
return abductees to their families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LRA, the key rebel group operating in northern
Uganda, abducted at least 30 people in Gulu district in their
latest attack in the region Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They broke into shops, kiosks and houses and looted food and
household property, which they forced captives to carry, Northern
Region Police Commander Marshall Odur was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who entered northern Uganda from their bases in
southern Sudan just days before Christmas, launched a spate of
attacks in Gulu and Kitgum districts recently.
</P>
<P>
LRA rebels have been operating in northern Uganda since 1986
when the ruling National Resistance Movement came to power in
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to have abducted more than 10,000 people and
killed many others.

<HEADLINE> Tung on Executive-Legislature Relationship (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In the last two and a half years, we have a creative,
efficient and clean civil service of outstanding quality," said
Tung.
</P>
<P>
Although there are isolated cases of negligence, and there is
room for improvement, the civil service on the whole have played a
most important role in the implementation of the principle of "
Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and in the formulation
and execution of policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last two and a half years, we have met the challenges
of the transition and the Asian financial turmoil. In the meantime,
we have implemented the 'One Country, Two Systems' framework,
overcome the Asian financial crisis and stabilized the local
financial markets, and the economy has started to pick up," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such progress proves that the present system and the civil
service team are delivering the goods, and that we are truly able
to serve the people of Hong Kong," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the past year or so, Tung said, all major bills were
supported and passed by the Legislative Council. Often this has
been made possible through extensive consultation, he added.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that Members of the Legislative Council and
the government do take into account the overall interest of Hong
Kong, Tung explained. He said that this also bears testimony to
the fact that the Executive and the Legislature are functioning
well in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we should not be complacent about our cooperation
in the last year, and we must learn from our experience and
redouble our efforts, so that we can give full play to our
respective roles," Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Tung on Executive-Legislature Relationship (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will carry on its
executive-led political system in order to promote economic and
social development, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks when addressing the Legislative Council
session on the Executive-Legislature Relationship.
</P>
<P>
"To meet the expectations of the public, whilst maintaining
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, we must retain the efficient
executive-led political system and strengthen the civil service-
based administrative structure," Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the Basic Law has been implemented only for 31
months. "We are still adjusting and are gaining experience in this
process, and we must allow time for further study and for the
present political system to mature," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law has laid down a 10-year timetable to enable us
to consider the next step forward in the light of our political
experience during that time," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
The development must be in accordance with the principle of
orderly and gradual progress and should be designed to be
acceptable to different sectors of the community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The design of the Basic Law for Hong Kong's political structure
centers around an executive-led system. This is manifested in the
articles which stipulate the powers and functions of the Executive
and the Legislature and their inter-relationship, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the Executive is accountable to the
Legislature in four respects: implementing laws passed by the
Legislative Council and already in force; presenting regular
policy addresses to the Council; answering questions raised by
members of the Council; and obtaining approval for taxation and
public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
These provisions of the Basic Law embody the wisdom distilled
from decades of experience in Hong Kong's governance, and retain
the best features of Hong Kong's political system, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "the object of these provisions is to maintain the
distinctive characteristics of an executive-led system and
preserve the efficient administration of Hong Kong to safeguard
our stability and prosperity."

<HEADLINE> Foreigners to Invest US$1.5 Billion in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Investors from Singapore, who
are accompanying Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on a visit
here, on Thursday night signed a memorandum of understanding on an
investment of more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The investment would be put in the agricultural and fishery
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinary investment. This is a great stimulus
for Indonesian entrepreneurs," Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber
of Commerce (KADIN) Aburizal Bakrie said after the agreement was
signed.
</P>
<P>
He also said Indonesian entrepreneurs would get from Singapore
businesspeople two packages of projects worth 90 million dollars
and 1.5 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singapore investors were also interested in buying
national assets now under the control of the Indonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government of Singapore would
provide fund worth 500 million dollars to help Singapore
businesspeople who are interested in investing in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Thursday after meeting with Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid that his government would also provide 400
million dollars as a co-landing loan which would be used to
protect the investment from risk.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that such a move would encourage other (foreign)
investors to come to Indonesia and make them more confident (about
investing in Indonesia)," KADIN Deputy Chairman Bambang Sujagad
for the investment sector said.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik
Kian Gie said the Singapore government is very interested in
helping Indonesia stimulate investment activities.
</P>
<P>
He also said both sides (the Indonesian president and Singapore
prime minister) talked about the possibility of cooperation in
developing a free trade zone which covers the Batam, Bintan and
Karimun islands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Investment and State Owned Companies
Laksamana Sukardi expected that 1 million of 7 million tourists
who visit Singapore every year would come to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"That is way we should firm up cooperation between the
Singapore government and the Batam, Bintan and Karimun islands as
the closest territory to Singapore," Sukardi said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Prime Minister Goh said his government has created
90,000 job opportunities in the three islands.
</P>
<P>
"And the Singaporean companies (in the three islands) have
succeeded in exporting their products worth 2 billion U.S. dollars,
" the prime minister said, adding that there still exist great
potential job opportunities in the three islands.
</P>
<P>
Goh arrived here Thursday for a two-day working visit to
Indonesia. He held talks with President Wahid and Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri Thursday on the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Singapore Friday, the prime minister will
also meet with some other senior officials here.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gurkhas in Nepal to Press for Pension Parity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen
's Organization said it will press its demand for pension parity
for the retired British Gurkhas at an international human rights
meeting,The Kathmandu Post on Friday quoted the organization's
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will place the issue in an International Human Rights
Convention slated for early March in Geneva as the campaign to
address the issue through diplomatic channels has failed," said
President Padam Gurung at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We came to the decision after consulting with fellow Gurkha
pensioners as well as human rights activists both at home an
abroad,"Gurung said, adding that the organization will also
consult lawyers from various countries including the United States,
Japan, France, India and England to place the matter in an
international court.
</P>
<P>
The British government decided late last year to raise the
Gurkhas' pensions effective from April 1, 2000. The new pension
rates range from 7,043.55 rupees (106 U.S. dollars) to 23,612.8
rupees (337 dollars)per month, an increase of 100-192 percent.
</P>
<P>
The organization's officials said, however, that there would
still be a big difference between the pensions received by the ex-
Gurkha soldiers and their British counterparts, who get a pension
of 760 dollars at the lowest.
</P>
<P>
The officials said their consideration was not only for the
increase of pensions, but its four-point demands which include
pension parity, setting up of a Gurkha Welfare Fund to assist
children of Gurkha soldiers, residential visas in Britain for the
ex-Gurkha soldiers and their families and equal treatment for in-
service Gurkhas.
</P>
<P>
Britain maintains that according to a tripartite agreement
signed by Nepal, India and Britain in 1947, the remuneration of
Gurkhas employed by the British Army is pegged against the Indian
Army's pay code so as not to adversely affect Nepali recruitment
in the Indian Army.
</P>
<P>
The organization insists that the agreement does not prevent
Britain from addressing the issue of pension disparity.
</P>
<P>
About 450,000 Gurkha soldiers have served in the British Army
so far,with 3,000 still in active service.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Install New Radars for Better Weather Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Meteorological
Department (BMD) will soon have two extra eyes and will be able to
have a full view of the weather over the landmass covering
Bangladesh,the daily Independent reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two new radars, now being installed in Rangpur and Dhaka, would
create a network of four radars that would enable weathermen to
monitor the movement of clouds and predict rain and storm with
more accuracy then what they can do now.
</P>
<P>
The new radar in Dhaka is replacing an old radar that was
installed atop the BMD building in May 1984. The other one in
Rangpur, 225 kilometers north of Dhaka, is an addition.
</P>
<P>
These two, combined with two other radars at Cox' Bazar, 450
kilometers southeast of Dhaka, and Khepupara, 350 kilometers south
of Dhaka, would give the BMD a complete view of the sky over
Bangladesh and its adjoining areas.
</P>
<P>
The new radars would enable the BMD to forecast the extent of
precipitation by looking into clouds not only over Bangladesh but
also over the Indian states of Meghalaya and the foothills of the
Himalayas. This would also help flood forecasting.

<HEADLINE> Intel Reports Record Annual Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation announced
Thursday that revenues for 1999 were 29.4 billion U.S. dollars, up
12 percent from 1998, resulting in the company's 13th consecutive
year of revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chip-making giant's revenue in the fourth
quarter of 1999 reached a record high of 8.2 billion dollars, 8
percent higher compared to the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, Intel's net income, including acquisition-related
costs, was 7.3 billion dollars, a 21 percent increase on a year-on-
year basis.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Intel expects to reap more revenues in its networking,
communication and wireless businesses by at least 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company said that its research and development (R&AMP;D)
spending, excluding those R&AMP;D in process, is expected to be 3.8
billion dollars for 2000, up from 3.1 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The higher spending is driven primarily by the full year impact
of acquisitions and investments in new businesses as well as
increased investment in Intel architecture-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditure for 2000 is expected to be five billion
dollars, up from 3.4 billion dollars in 1999.

CARACAS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said Wednesday that although his country still welcomes
material aid from the U.S., it will not allow U.S. relief troops
in its territory.
</P>
<P>
"I want to clarify before Venezuela and the world that U.S.
troops are not going to come to Venezuela," said Chavez. "If they
want to send machines or other types of equipment we are open to
that".
</P>
<P>
Chavez's comments have kindled protests from the U.S., which
threatened that it will not provide any equipment without sending
operation and maintenance staff there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced Wednesday that it was sending two ships to
Venezuela to help clear part of a key coastal road damaged in last
December's devastating flood. The ships, with 450 Marine and Navy
engineers and relevant equipment on board, were expected to stay
in Venezuela for two months.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela had previously agreed to accept U.S. troops and
equipment as part of a 25-million-dollars aid package.

According to latest statistics, more than 300 bodies have been
found and 6,000 people are reportedly missing since a heavy flood
swept the nation and caused disastrous landslide. Some 114,000

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Overseas Borrowing Policy Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh took its first loan on
commercial terms from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in a move
that reflected the changes in the government's overseas borrowing
policy,the daily Financial Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ADB approved a loan of 82 million U.S. dollars from its
Ordinary Capital Resources, which lends on commercial terms, for
the Dhaka Power System Upgrade Project.
</P>
<P>
The loan is a part of the ADB' total 157 million dollars credit
to be used for expanding the distribution and transmission system
in Dhaka and reforming the entire power sector.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Finance Ministry's Economic Relations Division
(ERD) were quoted as saying the loan is the first borrowing by the
government on commercial terms from any multilateral donor agency.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the government's policy relating to overseas
borrowing was that the country would only take soft credits from
donor agencies, avoiding loans under commercial terms, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
But now, he said the government has decided to borrow under
commercial terms for some selected projects, if their rates of
return are high enough to pay the money back to the lenders.
</P>
<P>
The ERD sources found two reasons for the commercial borrowing
by the government. One is that in some areas like the power sector,
the donors are now reluctant to provide soft loans. And the other
reason is that availability of soft-term credit has become
difficult in a changed global aid scenario where many poor
countries are now competing for soft loans, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But top officials at the Finance Ministry dismissed the idea
that there is a complete change in the government's international
borrowing policy, saying it was a minor adjustment.

<P>
VIENNA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil warned the country's two main parties Thursday to reach an
agreement on a new cabinet quickly or risk an early election.
</P>
<P>
"None of the parties have any interest in stalling the talks
and thereby creating the danger of an early election," the
president told the Austrian news agency APA.
</P>
<P>
"It looks very bad indeed to both the public and the president
that the two parties that have worked together for 13 years have
failed to reach an agreement on a new cabinet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations started after the far-right Freedom Party replaced
the second largest conservative People's Party in the October 3
election. In that inconclusive national election, though the
conservative ally -- the Social Democratic Party -- remained first,
it did not have enough support to form a majority government on
its own.
</P>
<P>
After the election, the coalition was split over issues of
budget, security and reform of the welfare system. And until now,
a new government has not yet been formed.

Bosnian war, Petritsch, an Austrian diplomat, has the power to
force the Bosnian authorities to implement laws or fire officials
who obstruct efforts to reconstruct the war-torn country.

<P>
He expressed disappointment at the parliament's repeated
failure to adopt the legislation, which, he said, is intended to
combat rampant border crimes such as smuggling and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Bosnia is to build a unified police force
formed by 1,300 officers to guard the state borders, and a 10-
kilometer-wide check-up belt is to be cordoned at every entrance.
</P>
<P>
In order to set up the border force at an earlier date, 30
future police officers were sent to Austria this week to receive
two weeks of training.
</P>
<P>
The Serb deputies in the parliament opposed the establishment
of a joint border checkpoint institution and belt because most
parts of the borders are located in the territory of the Bosnia
Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
Muslim and Croat deputies supported the law.

<HEADLINE> Less Deadly Colorectal Cancer Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have
identified a less deadly form of colorectal cancer, increasing the
chances of survival to victims by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media reported that since Wednesday a research team at
Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital believe that 17 percent of the
colorectal cancer cases belong to the newly identified strain.
</P>
<P>
They have discovered that colorectal cancer is two different
diseases that begins, spreads and concludes differently.
</P>
<P>
In a study of 607 patients in Ontario, they found that 83
percent of the patients had a pattern of genetic damage in their
tumor cells known as "chromosomal instability."
</P>
<P>
The other 17 percent had a different genetic abnormality in
their cancer cells known as "high-frequency micro-satellite
instability" (MSI
</P>
<P>
Those with MSI tumors had a survival rate of 76 percent,
compared with 54 percent of the non-MSI patients, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for this phenomenon is that "MSI seems to
stimulate an immune response" to kill cancer cells, which "don't
tend to spread. And even when they do spread, the patients still
do better," according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
The findings will enable doctors to tailor treatment to each
type of tumor in two years, allowing some patients to skip the
toxic stew of chemotherapy, the researchers predict.
</P>
<P>
Colorectal cancer kills more than 80,000 North Americans a year.
In Canada, 6,300 people lost their lives to the disease last year,
while another 16,600 were newly diagnosed with the disease, which
has become the country's third leading cause of cancer deaths.

<P>
SOFIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- European Commission Chairman
Romano Prodi arrived here Thursday to exchange ideas with
Bulgarian leaders on the launch of the European Union (EU)
accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was accompanied by EU commissioner in charge of
enlargement, Guenther Verheugen.
</P>
<P>
"I want to show our determination to start a quick conversation
and a quick deal with the Bulgarian government (over accession),"
Prodi told reporters at the Sofia airport.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for Bulgaria," Prodi said, answering the question
on whether the European Commission structures were ready for
efficient talks with the 12 aspiring members.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that he is accompanied by Verheugen is a clear
sign that they want to get to work as soon as possible.

The decision to invite Bulgaria to start accession negotiations
was made at the Helsinki Summit on December 10, 1999.

BUCHAREST, January 13 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi Thursday urged Romania to accelerate its current
reforms for early entrance into the European Union (EU), saying
such an integrity process is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
and other leading politicians, Prodi stressed the importance of
improving Romania's macro-economic environment. A perfect law
system and stable economic environment are the keys for a large
inflow of foreign investment, he added.

Prodi said he is satisfied that Romania is giving top priority
to its entrance into the EU and has secured unanimous support from
all parties on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU is ready to make joint efforts with Romania in the
fields of politics and economy, helping the country win EU
membership within several years, said the former Italian prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, along with the EU enlargement commissioner Gunter
Verheugen, left here Thursday night for Bulgaria. During the trip,

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Challenge Japanese Whaling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark was quoted Friday as saying her country would strongly
challenge Japan's continued whaling in the Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported that Clark's statement was responding to
recent Japanese whalers' mistreatment of protesters.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two Greenpeace activists protesting
against Japan's continued whaling in the Southern Ocean were
dragged part-way up the stern ramp of a Japanese whaling ship
after attaching their inflatable to a line towing a harpooned
minke whale.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, the action has
prompted the prime minister to instruct Foreign Minister Phil Goff
to contact his Japanese counterpart to make "strong
representations"about the treatment of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Japan's continued whaling could have tragic consequences not
only for the whales but also for the Greenpeace activists, Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
She questioned Japan's "so-called scientific whaling" program.
</P>
<P>
"Although the international Convention for the Regulation of
Whaling does not prohibit whales being killed 'for the purposes of
scientific research', within the International Whaling Commission
there is a real question about whether this is the purpose for the
Japanese activities, given that they clearly do not meet any '
critically important research need'," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand would strongly challenge the Japanese program at
the next meeting of the commission in Australia in July, she said.

<HEADLINE> -- hke011404 -- Calm Returns to Indonesia's Maluku, Says Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Political Affairs and Security Gen. Wiranto claimed
on Thursday to have restored order in riot-torn Maluku and was now
considering reconstruction and reconciliation there.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Maluku had gradually calmed, thanks to
the heavy presence of security personnel.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 battalions of reinforcement military troops and
two battalions of the National Police's Mobile Brigade have been
sent to the restive territory to help the local security
authorities stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said order had returned, although not completely, to
Tobelo and Galela in Halmahera Island, North Maluku, where
hundreds were reportedly killed in a wave of clashes recently. The
neighboring town of Jailolo remained tense, but Wiranto promised
peace would be restored soon.
</P>
<P>
"The present situation out there is considered conducive to
starting rehabilitation and reconciliation, although physical and
nonphysical isolations are still needed," Wiranto was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said reconstruction projects of mosques and churches,
which were either attacked or burned during the conflict, would be
the top priority of the rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Military (TNI) Commander Admiral Widodo A.
S. Thursday admitted that several minor clashes had occurred
despite the presence of security troops.
</P>
<P>
"The neutral stance displayed by military personnel in the
field has helped prevent further conflicts," Widodo added.
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Tyasno Sudarto called on people in
Maluku to cooperate with the security personnel to cope with the
protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Ahmad Sutjipto said the Indonesian
Navy's Eastern Fleet has deployed around 12 warships and six Nomad
reconnaissance aircraft to blockade Maluku waters.
</P>
<P>
The blockade has been imposed to keep the strife-torn area free
from outside infiltrators who intend to exacerbate the precarious
security situation.
</P>
<P>
"The measure is also designed to foil the entry of weapons into
Maluku and restrict the movement of people among the islands in
the province. In addition, the naval ships can also be used to
help in the distribution of goods and the evacuation of refugees,"
he was quoted by the Antara News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has been the site of bloody communal violence since
January last year, and about 1,130 people have died since then.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Budget Deficit Exceeds Target in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' 1999 budget
deficit hit 113.6 billion pesos (2.8 billion U.S. dollars),
exceeding the 101-billion-peso (2.5 billion dollars) target agreed
with the International Monetary Fund IMF), Business World reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Budget and Management Secretary Benjamin
Diokno as saying overspending and poor revenue collections in 1999
were the main reason for the larger-than-programmed budget
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said the expenditures of the government in 1999 reached
592 billion pesos (14.8 billion dollars), including the 63 billion
pesos (1.6 billion dollars) allocated for accounts payable
inherited from the former administration.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Diokno said, total revenues reached only 478.
4 billion pesos (12 billion dollars) after the country's major
revenue-generating agencies fell short of their goals.
</P>
<P>
The paper said last year's larger-than-programmed budget gap is
expected to affect the Philippine government's special drawing
rights with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Before the IMF agreed with the 101-billion-peso deficit figure,
the government has already negotiated with the IMF for an increase
in last year's budget deficit target to 85.3 billion pesos (2.1
billion dollars) from 68.4 billion pesos (1.71 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
National Treasurer Leonor Briones said she sees no pressure on
interest rates even as the deficit exceeded its target level,
since last year's budget deficit has already been financed.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura said
last year's deficit numbers are now "academic," adding that what
is more important is the government's spending and revenue program
which will determine the budget deficit for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said both domestic and internal investors will keep an eye
on concrete and specific steps the government will take to achieve
its targets and budget numbers, especially those committed to the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
During the latest IMF review last September, the government
committed itself to cap this year's deficit at 62.5 billion pesos
(1.6 billion dollars), a figure that might be review by new
Finance Secretary Jose Pardo.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Starts Fresh Probe Into Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian government officials
said it was starting a new investigation into the May 1998 riots
in Jakarta and other big cities, as past inquiries had uncovered
scant evidence to support claims of sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of the Empowerment of Women Khofifah said her
office along with other relevant offices and several non-
governmental organizations had launched a program to follow up the
findings of a team investigating the riots.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored team, TGPF, presented its findings to
the media in November 1998. Their findings showed that nearly 1,
300 people were killed during the May 13-15 riots and that 52
women were raped with 14 more falling victim to rape with violence,
10 to sexual attacks and nine to sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
"The first step of the program is building coordination with
the Ministries of Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Law and
Legislation, the state minister of human rights affairs, the
attorney general, the armed forces headquarters and the police,"
Khofifah said after signing the "Program to Follow Up TGPF
Findings Over May 13-15 Riotings in 1998" here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The program was expected to be finished in February, she added.
</P>
<P>
She appealed for public cooperation, particularly from victims
and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"I will be very glad if someone can come and arrange a private
meeting between myself and the victims," she was quoted by
national newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, who headed
the earlier investigation, said the investigation had not been so
smooth because of the lack of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"The government is reopening investigations and invites the
general public to provide information, directly or indirectly, to
the Office of the State Minister of the Empowerment of Women or to
the National Police," Marzuki said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government would take transparent and
concrete legal measures to resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said he believed that people would not stand as
witnesses because they were still traumatic or reluctant as some
parts of the TGPF report involved the then army reserve command
chief Lt. Gen.(ret.) Prabowo and then Jakarta military commander
Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and had not been followed up.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A team of 30 Japanese engineers
and architects have arrived here to prepare for the modernization
and expansion project of Sri Lanka's Bandaranaike International
Airport at Katunayake in suburban Colombo, press reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team will be here for three months to prepare the project
proposal and tender documents, the state-run Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund had agreed to fund
the 100 million U.S. dollar project under a yen loan package,the
newspaper quoted W.P.S. Jayawardena, secretary to the Ministry of
Tourism and Aviation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The construction contract will be awarded on a tender basis for
which tenders will be called next year. The project, which will
begin construction work in late 2001, is expected to be completed
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the government spent 1.052 billion rupees (15 million
dollars) on improving existing services and facilities at the
airport which included an instrument landing system, a
communications recorder system, explosives detectors and a
security billet complex.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of the airport was regarded necessary to
cater to the increasing number of arrivals and with a view to
making Sri Lanka a gateway for tourists in the Asia and Pacific
region.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Dollarize in Six Months: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian currency, the
sucre, will be replaced by the U.S. dollar and will gradually
disappear in the next six months, Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga
declared Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) will cease distributing the
sucre, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's circulation.
Some 300 million U.S. dollars will gradually replace the sucres in
that period, said Arizaga.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador will lose about 35 million dollars a year as a result
of the change. "That is not much compared to the long term
benefits obtained from the dollarization," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Production Secretary of State Juan Falconi said the U.S.
Congress is studying a draft law that would permit countries that
officially dollarize their economies to share with that nation
certain rights.
</P>
<P>
If all Ecuadorians were to exchange at this moment all their
sucres in coins and bills for dollars, it would be necessary to
invest 400 million dollars, which is a little less than half the
available liquid assets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad announced Sunday that he
would push the currency plan to establish the U.S. dollar as legal
tender in Ecuador and make it the currency of choice for large
transactions.

commercial banks and toward commercial paper and the capital
markets during the next two years, according to a survey released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, conducted by the Association for Financial
Professionals (AFP), senior financial professionals predict that
lending by commercial banks, which now represents 43 percent of
their total corporate borrowings, will drop to 37 percent over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
This predicted decline is the continuation of a trend: two
years ago, commercial bank lending accounted for 51 percent of
total borrowing, according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, use of commercial paper over the next two
years will jump to 18 percent of total borrowings from 13 percent
two years ago and 15 percent presently. Use of the capital markets
will increase to 20 percent of total borrowings in the next two
years, up from 15 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in December 1999 among senior
financial professionals at companies with annual revenues of 100
million U.S. dollars or more. Of the 200 respondents, 58 percent
worked at companies with annual revenues between one billion to
five billion dollars.

spectrum of financial disciplines.

MEXICO CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments will
continue to flow into Mexico this year, since investor confidence
in the country remains high, an official of the Foreign Trade
National Bank (Bancomext) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bancomext, one of the most influential commercial banks in
Mexico, will provide a 5-billion dollar credit this year and an
additional amount of 1.25 billion dollars to support Mexican firms
that are willing to bid for energy projects, Bancomext Director
Enrique Vilatela Riba said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mexico's economy stands out among Latin American
countries, since it has signed many trade agreements with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
After a seminar on "Mexico and China in the New Millennium" at
the Mexican Foreign Ministry, Vilatela said that China and other
nations take advantage of Mexico, not only because of its market,
but also regard it as a platform for their exports to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country needs to deepen trade relations
with China because of the large market in China.
</P>
<P>
On the effects of July's general elections on foreign
investment, the director said the Mexican government has taken
necessary steps to reduce unfavorable factors and guarantee that
the Mexican economy will continue to grow and maintain stability
and confidence among investors.

<HEADLINE> IAEA to Dispatch Nuclear Inspectors to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) announced here on Thursday that it will send a five-
person team to Baghdad next week to verify the nuclear materials
that remain there.
</P>
<P>
The agency said in a press release that although all weapon-
usable materials have been removed from Iraq in accordance with U.
N. Security Council resolution 687 passed in 1991, Iraq still has
about 1.8 tons of low enriched uranium as well as several tons of
natural and depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
The current inspection mission, said IAEA, is conducted in line
with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)
and has the limited objective of verifying the nuclear materials.
It is not a substitute for the IAEA's verification activities in
Iraq under the relevant Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The present inspection team is the first to be dispatched by
IAEA to Iraq since December 15, 1998 when the U.N. arms inspectors
halted their work there due to friction with Baghdad. The United
States and Britain jointly launched a four-day air strike against
Iraq subsequently.
</P>
<P>
The team is scheduled to begin its work in Iraq at the end of
next week and to return to Vienna by the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Oxford Rowing Team Members Arrested in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four members of Britain's
Oxford University Lightweight Rowing Club were detained in the
northern Spanish town of Amposta on Thursday for causing damage to
a pizzeria during a late night team celebration.
</P>
<P>
The oarsmen were detained by Civil Guard and local police who
were called to the site by the restaurant owner.
</P>
<P>
Local residents also called police after cars in the street
outside the restaurant were allegedly damaged by the Britons.
</P>
<P>
Twenty British students from the rowing club, who trained in
Amposta for a clash with traditional rivals Cambridge University
at Henley, England, in March, were among those arrested. And the
four other fours detained were reported to be an American, a
Canadian, an Indian and a New Zealander.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance apparently came during a celebration by the
rowing club after their final day of training in Spain.
</P>
<P>
The club is distinct from the Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC)
-- which contests the annual Boat Race against Cambridge on the
Thames on March 25 -- but the group of arrested students contained
several potential members of the OUBC boat.
</P>
<P>
The rowing club was scheduled to return to Britain on Thursday
night, but consular officals said that they were now expected to
leave no earlier than Friday.
</P>
<P>
Oxford University confirmed in a statement that the arrested
students all came from the university and said it would consider
internal disciplinary proceedings "in the light of court findings".

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Supervision in Trademark and Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to tighten
its supervision in the areas of trademark and advertisement to
prevent irregular practices in those sectors this year, China
Daily reports today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at fostering an orderly market environment
and help State-owned enterprises make their products more
competitive, said Wang Zhongfu, director of the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC).
</P>
<P>
Illegal practice involving trademarks, such as producing fake
brands of merchandise and brand infringement, will face serious
consequences, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The government will work harder to protect the 280 name brands
in China, while encouraging local companies to develop more
domestic brands.
</P>
<P>
Wang said trademark management is especially important for the
reform of domestic enterprises in order to prevent the draining of
State-owned intangible assets during the brand's asset
reorganization and merger.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to provide a better investment environment for
foreign companies, the administration promised that foreign
trademark infringement cases will receive more attention this
year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the SAIC said the focus is being put on
advertising content standards and the operation of the firms in
this field of business.

SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- To keep better flow of talents
moving throughout the country, China Human Resources (HR) Market (
Shanghai) will establish its second representative office in Xi'an,
capital of west China's Shaanxi Province, in March.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to expand its service area to other parts of
China, and even foreign countries to encourage overseas Chinese
students to work back in China, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the world, we hope to become the real link between
talents in Shanghai and in other places," Wang Shaochang, deputy
director of Shanghai Human Resources Bureau was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Due to large amounts of universities and talents concentrated
in Xi'an and its location as a city connecting central and western
China, Xi'an is selected as the market's second destination for
opening its representative office.
</P>
<P>
"We have done something to help flow talents to West China,
such as the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region," Wang said, "But
something more is needed."
</P>
<P>
The market established its first representative office in
Beijing last October and held several job fairs in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"These job fairs, especially the one on January 8-9 targeting
highly qualified talents from prestigious universities in Shanghai,
caused sensational response among Beijing residents," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hornets to Retire Phill's No.13 on Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The tragic death of
Charlotte Hornets guard Bobby Phills will bring the entire city to
a momentary stop on Friday before life -- and the game -- goes on.
</P>
<P>
Charlotte mayor Pat McCrory said the city will observe a moment
of silence for Phills Thursday evening, just before tip-off of
Charlotte's home game against the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
The Hornets will hold a special prayer delivered by one of the
team's chaplains and a video tribute to honor Phills, who died in
a car crash after leaving shootaround Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Phills as their "fallen leader," the Hornets also
announced the team will wear a black patch with a white No. 13 on
the right side of its game jerseys beginning Friday and for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
Phill's No. 13 also will become the first retired number in
franchise history. No Hornets player will wear the number again
and it will be retired February 9, when the Hornets host the
Cleveland Cavaliers. Phills played his first six NBA seasons with
Cleveland before signing as a free agent with Charlotte in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Hornets postponed Wednesday's game with the Chicago Bulls
after Phills slamming his Porsche into another car.
</P>
<P>
However, Phills' widow, Kendall, asked that the Hornets return
to the court and move past the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"If the players can emotionally handle it, I would want them to
go out and play because that's what Boddy would want," Kendall
Phills said.
</P>
<P>
Phills, 30, was in his ninth season.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Phills' vehicle was traveling well above the
speed limit of 45 miles per hour when it collided with another car
and a minivan. Phills was wearing a seat belt and the occupants
of the other vehicles were hospitalized with injuries that were
not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Phills averaged 13.6 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 28
games this season. He was one of four finalists for the NBA's
Sportsmanshi Award in 1998 and a member of the All-Defensive
Second Team in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Accelerate Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The central government is to
invest 10 billion yuan on building new or renovating existing
highways here in the five years starting from 2001, a local
official source said.
</P>
<P>
Renovating the existing five national trunk lines and 14
regional highways will be the focus of the efforts. And some 2,000
km of roads leading to 100 townships and 600 villages will also be
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is the only region which has no railways among China's 34
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. It depends
mainly on highways to transport goods into and out of the region.
</P>
<P>
This landlocked region in southwestern China spent a total of 3.
6 billion yuan on road construction in the past five years, giving
highway access to over 80 percent of its townships.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the region's highways are expected to exceed
25,900 kilometers in length, linking all the villages in Tibet.

BUENOS AIRES, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The conditions of
Argentine soccer super star Diego Maradona's heart has
deteriorated 62 percent from its former level, top cardiologist
Carlos Alvarez said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, who described as "severe and grave" the heart
conditions of the former Argentine national team captain admitted
to a Uruguayan clinic last week with a life-threatening condition
subsequently linked to a cocaine overdose.
</P>
<P>
Maradona's state of health has improved since but Alvarez
pulled no punches when describing the conditions of the 39-year-
old.
</P>
<P>
His pessimistic prognosis was backed up by Maradona's personal
physician Alfredo Cahe, who said: "Honestly, I was expecting a
cardiac dilation but it's a lot more than I expected and that
worries me."
</P>
<P>
Adding that Maradona was shocked at the seriousness of his
conditions, Cahe said: "When I saw the state of his heart I could
not believe my eyes."
</P>
<P>
The physician said the only solution was for his patient to
undergo a complete change in lifestyle, in particular a strict
diet.

<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Referee Rob Harris has been
suspended by the Premier League pending an investigation into his
handling of the FA Cup tie between Tranmere Rovers and Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Thursday, assistant referee Tony
Green has also been sidelined after failing to notice that a
Tranmere substitute was brought on for a red-carded player during
the closing minutes of the January 8 match.
</P>
<P>
The two men will not be allowed to officiate at Premiership
matches until their conduct has been examined by a Football
Association commission.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in its history that the FA has taken such
action against officials. Fourth official David Unsworth has also
been summoned.
</P>
<P>
The match ended in controversy at Prenton Park when Rovers
replaced Clint Hill with a substitute, even though he had been red-
carded.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tranmere finished the tie with 11 players instead
of 10 and were forced to wait 48 hours for the FA to decide that
their 1-0 victory over Sunderland should, in fact, stand.
</P>
<P>
FA statement said Harris had "less than proficiently applied
the laws of the game".
</P>
<P>
Unsworth and Green are alleged to have committed technical
irregularities in connection with the substitution.
</P>
<P>
The three officials have 14 days to respond to the allegations
and request a personal hearing before appearing in front of a
commission of the FA referees' committee.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Granted Entry to UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Controversial American boxer
Mike Tyson will be allowed to enter Britain despite his rape
conviction, the Home Office said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw made the decision because of the "
exceptional circumstances" of the case and the huge sums at stake.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after fears of a high-profile stand-off with the
duty immigration officer at Heathrow airport when Tyson arrives in
London on Sunday for a fight.
</P>
<P>
The government stepped in after criticism by immigration
officials that it had failed to take a leading role and use its
discretion to end the confusion.
</P>
<P>
Straw said: "It would be invidious for an individual
immigration officer to weigh the competing considerations involved.
</P>
<P>
"I have looked very carefully at the representations that have
been submitted today to the Immigration Service by Mr Frank Warren
and I consider that there are exceptional circumstances that
justify my decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Warren, the fight's promoter, had handed over a 67-page dossier
arguing for Tyson to be allowed to enter the UK.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the cancellation of Tyson's bout with Julius Francis
in Manchester on 29 January could have a potentially devastating
effect on businesses providing services for the fight.
</P>
<P>
He added: "I have also taken account of the effect on business
in the Manchester area and of the inconvenience and disappointment
of the many thousand members of the public who have purchased
tickets for the fight."
</P>
<P>
Straw said he was not satisfied that the rules on people with
criminal convictions entering the UK had been applied consistently
in the past, and they would now be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
At present under British law, anyone who has committed a crime
abroad that would carry a 12-month sentence in the UK cannot enter
the country unless there are "compassionate reasons".
</P>
<P>
Tyson was convicted of rape in the United States in 1992 and
sentenced to six years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The decision ends days of confusion over who could make the
decision on Tyson's entry.
</P>
<P>
Tyson will be allowed to stay in the UK until January 30.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Uganda to Speed up Normalization of Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Uganda asserted the
importance of implementing the agreement on normalization of
relations that was signed by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and
his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni in Kenya last December.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail met visiting Ugandan
Minister of State for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbazi here Friday
and explored steps towards full normalization of ties in the light
of the Nairobi accord, the Sudanese News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to set up three joint committees on the
political, security and humanitarian affairs, said a Sudanese
Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed hope that Sudan would be able to secure
the release of the Ugandan schoolgirls who had been taken hostage
by Uganda's Lord Resistance Army rebels based in Sudan in response
to Uganda's decision to release 72 Sudanese captives. The captives
returned to Khartoum on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan delegation wound up a two-day visit to Khartoum on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed steps to enhance security cooperation,
stop hostile moves and media campaigns, extradite criminals, allow
the refugees of both sides to return homes, and resume flights
between Khartoum and Kampala as a prelude to full normalization of
relations.
</P>
<P>
Uganda severed its diplomatic ties with Sudan in 1995, accusing
Sudan of financing and arming rebels who want to topple Museveni's
government, while Sudan accused Uganda of aiding the rebel Sudan
Peoples Liberation Army, which has been fighting for autonomy in
the south since 1983.
</P>
<P>
According to the 11-point Nairobi deal, the two countries
pledged to renounce support for rebels of the other country.
</P>
<P>
The two countries planned to resume full diplomatic relations at
the end of February.

<P>
The head of state went on to say that the reform for the direct
election of mayors and regional presidents had been a positive
development and expressed his hope that this system will now also
be extended to those regions, like Sicily, that have special

</P>
<P>
The April 16 regional elections will be the first employing the
new electoral law, while the regions with special status go to the

<HEADLINE> (Eds:Updates With More Contents)U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 2.7 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surge in last year's consumer prices stemmed from a big
jump in energy costs. But prices were relatively contained in most
other areas, posting the best performance since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that outside of energy and food, the "core"
rate of inflation was up just 1.9 percent in 1999, the smallest
annual increase since a 1.5 percent rise in 1965.
</P>
<P>
Last's year core rate was even better than a 2.4 percent
increase in 1998 and suggests that inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
The 2.7 percent advance in consumer prices was the largest
annual gain since a 3.3 percent rise in 1996. It reflected a 13.4
percent jump in energy costs, which had fallen sharply in 1998 as
the Asian financial crisis severely dampened global demand.
</P>
<P>
Production limits by oil-producing nations and increase demand
from recovering economies in Asia helped pushed the surge in
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
For December, the Consumer Price Index, the most closely
watched inflation gauge, rose only 0.2 percent, less than many
analysts were forecasting. The December gain came from a leap in
gasoline and other energy prices.
</P>
<P>
The rise in December's overall consumer prices reflected a 1.4
percent advance in energy prices, boosting the total increase for
the year to 13.4 percent, the largest annual gain since an 18.1
percent increase in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices picked up 4.1 percent last month. That pushed
the total increase for 1999 to 30.1 percent, highest since a 36.8
percent increase nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report showed that food costs rose a tiny 0.1
percent in December and 1.9 percent for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Outside energy and food, the "core" rate of inflation rose a
scant 0.1 percent in December, reflecting a smaller increase in
shelter costs.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the nation's
industrial output rose 0.4 percent in December, indicating that
the economy headed into 2000 on solid footing. Operating capacity
was 81.3 percent, well below levels associated with a pickup in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
In another report today, stockpiles of goods on shelves and
backlots increased by 0.9 percent in November, the biggest gain
since March 1995, the Commerce Department said. Sales grew by 1.3
percent, keeping the inventory-to-sales ratio at a record low of 1.
33. That means it would take 1.33 months to exhaust inventories at
the November sales pace.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Military Doctrine Stresses Nuke Deterrence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military official
said Friday that Russia would use nuclear weapons only in case of
an aggression against itself or its allies under a new military
doctrine expected to be approved next month.
</P>
<P>
Valery Manilov, the first deputy chief of the Russian Armed
Forces General Staff who is a key drafter of the document, said
the new doctrine "clearly and distinctly" viewed nuclear armaments
as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the new doctrine will be submitted to the Russian
Security Council, a top advisory body that includes chiefs of the
so-called power ministries, for discussion in the next few days,
Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has the right to use nuclear armaments exclusively in
case of an aggression against itself and its allies and only when
it is impossible to prevent by conventional means the liquidation
of Russia as a subject of international relations, a sovereign
entity in these relations," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Only in that case Russia will have to use nuclear armaments,"
Manilov said. "Russia will never use nuclear armaments if there is
no aggression against it."
</P>
<P>
Russia's current military doctrine, which was approved on
November 2, 1993, "did not announce a possibility of using nuclear
armaments so distinctly and firmly," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it just outlined conditions under which nuclear arms
shall not be used, he said, adding that those conditions remain
valid under the new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not use nuclear arms against signatory states to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of July 1, 1968 that does not
have nuclear armaments, with the exception of two circumstances:
</P>
<P>
-- An armed attack at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces and
other troops or its allies by a country, which has a union
agreement with a nuclear power;
</P>
<P>
-- Joint moves of such a country and a nuclear power to invade
or to make an armed attack at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces
and other troops or its allies or to support such actions.
</P>
<P>
According to Tass, the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces is made
up of three branches -- the Strategic Missile Troops, the Naval
Strategic Forces and the Strategic Aviation Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Missile Troops, equipped with silo and mobile
launchers, are a key component of the nuclear triad. They have 756
launchers with 3,385 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces are composed of 26 strategic
nuclear-powered submarines, including six submarine missile-
carrying cruisers of the Typhoon class, seven of the Dolphin class
and 13 of the Kamar (Squid) class. If fully loaded, these nuclear-
powered submarines can carry up to 440 ballistic missiles with
more than 2,000 warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Aviation has about 100 strategic assault aircraft
of the Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22MZ class, capable of carrying more
than 800 nuclear warheads, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> 15 Percent of Jobs in Italy in Black Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 15 percent of jobs in
Italy are in the black economy, the national statistics agency
Istat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
While regular payroll jobs have been falling because of the
economic downturn, jobs in the underground economy have been
increasing over recent years, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1997, according to the Istat survey, jobs fell
by 3.8 percent overall, while GDP rose 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But regular jobs fell by 5.9 percent, dropping from 20.32
million to 29.13 million, while illegal jobs rose by 9.3 percent
from 3.14 million to 3.43 million the survey found.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of black jobs to total therefore rose from 13.4
percent to 15.2 percent, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of undeclared labor has been especially steep in
certain sectors like shops, catering, transport and communications,
Istat said, -- a rise of 16.1 percent, or 17 percent for
undeclared payrolled workers.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of the total of illegal workers are either
foreigners (16 percent) or people with second or third jobs (24
percent).

<HEADLINE> 65th International Green Week Opens in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The 65th Berlin International
Agricultural Fair, the "Green Week" opened in Berlin on Friday. It
is the biggest showcase for the food and farming industry.
</P>
<P>
German Agricultural Minister Karl-Heinz Funke declared
officially the opening of the "Green Week". And he spent four
hours in the traditional opening walk through the Berlin
fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
1648 exhibitors from 58 countries take part in the fair,
according to fair organizers. On the first day, nearly 20000
visitors came to the fair and taste various kinds of food the food
industry offered. They had a joyful and satisfied tour round the
halls and show-cases.
</P>
<P>
The Green Week has showed the agricultural achievements of
Germany, but the branch has been subject to a new ecology tax for
many years. The President of the German Peasant Association Gerd
Sonnleiter said on Wednesday that his association fights against
the ecology tax of the Federal Government and will take legal
proceedings against the ecology tax if it can not come up to an
agreement about the lightening the burden of the agriculture
before February 15. President Sonnleiter claimed that 900 million
marks, which the peasants must pay for ecology tax, should be used
fully for developing the German agriculture.
</P>
<P>
There are still many criticizes of the Green Week, for example,
the chairman of the Federal Association of the German Food
Industry, Peter Traumann, thought that 1999 was a most difficult
year for the food industry. Because the branch got a total sales
of 0.226 billion marks, down 1.2 per cent. The prices of food fell
by 1.1 per cent and were such low never before. In the opinion of
Traumann it can not be improved within a short time. He calls
attention to it, what seems favorable for the consumers, but it
has negative influences on the employment and the diversification
of food supply. Sonnleiter also reminds consumers of that the
highest quality can not lead to low prices forever.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyed
Axworthy signed an anti-drug agreement with the Colombian
government Friday in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
According to the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, "the
agreement on drug demand reduction" is a follow-up to an
understanding on combating the world drug problem signed last May
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Illicit drug trafficking is a major challenge facing all of us
in the Americas," Axworthy said in a statement released by the
department.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement the two countries will exchange experiences
and practices to deal with drug trafficking and money laundering,
while promoting drug treatment and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister will meet with Colombian President Andres
Pastrana and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Saturday
for trilateral discussions on the drug issue.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy's agenda also includes preparations for the general
assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the
Summit of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The OAS general assembly is slated for June 4 to 7 in Canada's
southern city Windsor, while the Summit of the Americas is
scheduled for April 2001 in Quebec City.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionists to Hold Crucial Meeting on Feb. 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party said in a statement that its council president, Sir
Josias Cunningham, had held talks with David Trimble and other
party leaders and was calling a review meeting for February 12.
</P>
<P>
If there has been no decommissioning by the Irish Republican
Army(IRA) by that time, the council could pull Trimble, the
Northern Ireland first minister, and his ministerial colleagues
out of the recently formed power-sharing Assembly Executive.
</P>
<P>
Trimble persuaded its 800-member ruling council with difficulty
in November to join the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein in
government before a handover of weapons. But the UUP also said it
would review its position in February.
</P>
<P>
Retired Canadian general John de Chastelain, who heads the
province's disarmament commission, will report this month on his
efforts to get the IRA to disarm.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has traditionally regarded disarmament as
tantamount to surrender, broke new ground in December by opening
talks with de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
Reports last weekend -- which were played down by republican
sources -- suggested that the IRA might destroy part of its
arsenal and seal up the rest to put the arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mr. Trimble called on republican paramilitaries to
begin decommissioning in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking following a meeting at Downing Street with the
Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to bring him up to date on the latest
political developments in the province.
</P>
<P>
Power was devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly last month
after the Ulster Unionist Council backed the peace deal brokered
by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell.

ROME, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini met with his Tunisian confrere Habib Ben Yahia Friday for
talks that stressed the two countries' commitment to improving
cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean through
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
</P>
<P>
According to an official communique from the Italian foreign
ministry, they agreed to their common interest in their joint work
on the charter for Mediterranean stability scheduled for
completion in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's bilateral ties with the EU will be discussed at a
meeting on the North African state's association agreement with
the Fifteen on January 2.
</P>
<P>
In the Italo-Tunisian sphere, much of the meeting was devoted
to the long-running issues of fishing rights in the waters between
them.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers urged a definition of the juridical problems
and the need to fit a growing number of fishing boats with
electronic equipment which would make it easier for them to avoid
encroaching on territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the two ministers confirmed their
commitment to overcoming the fishing disputes by the joint
exploitation of fishing resources through the creation of joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Dini also welcomed Tunisian efforts for social and economic
growth and to move towards political pluralism.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 100,000 Cuban mothers
Friday demonstrated in front of the U.S. Interests Office in
Havana to demand the return of boy Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"Give us back our son," shouted the mothers of the shipwrecked
boy, who has become a symbol of the country in the Caribbean
island's struggle against its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The deadline established by the U.S. authorities for the
delivery of the boy to his family in Cuba, in a decision repealed
by Cubans residing in Miami who oppose the government of the
island, comes due Friday night.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno reaffirmed Thursday that boy
Elian Gonzalez must return to Cuba, according to an Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) decision.
</P>
<P>
There is no U.S. authority in condition to assure anything
about the return of the boy, said the Cuban official newspaper "
Granma" Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cuban artistic and cultural education workers demonstrated
Thursday at the Havana Palace of Conventions to demand the return
of the boy.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150,000 citizens of the capital will take part this
Saturday in an open forum to be held at the intersection of the
12th and 23rd streets of Havana to protest against the retention
of Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old boy was rescued on November 25 from the waters
of the Atlantic Ocean after the boat in which his mother and nine
more Cubans had left the island in an attempt to reach U.S. soil
sank and all but the boy and two other persons drowned.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian custom
official Friday confirmed that the Port of Barbera, Somalia, has
become open to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is making use of the Somali port to ease cargo
congestion at the Port of Djibouti, consolidate its export-import
trade and help create alternative and free commercial line for
businessmen, said Wegayehu Eshetu, acting head of Jijiga Branch of
the Customs Authority.
</P>
<P>
Jijiga is the capital of the Somali State of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to Wegayehu, Berbera port is close to towns in
southeastern Ethiopia and businessmen can benefit from the reduced
transportation costs while sending or bringing their goods.
</P>
<P>
The renovation of the 100 kilometer Jijiga-Togomille road
linking eastern Ethiopia to northern Somalia is near completion
and there will be no problem of transportation for heavy duty
trucks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ethiopian official mass media reported that the
country had already brought in 46,000 tons of relief food through
the Berbera port and a further 16,000 tons of relief assistance
were expected to pass through the same port.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has become a land-locked country since Eritrea
declared independence in 1993. It is currently using the port of
Djibouti for import and export business.
</P>
<P>
Its discussions with Sudan on the use of Port Sudan are also
underway.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
expressed optimism over a lasting solution to the security issue
and the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes region, a senior
French official said here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Visiting French State Minister for Cooperation Charles
Josselin, who was here to make a one-day visit to Uganda from
Tanzania, told the press that he came to the Great Lakes region to
express his country's commitment to support the implementation of
the Lusaka peace agreement and to assess chances of peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sure that good sense would prevail and triumph
with all the governments and rebel groups in the region realizing
the importance of peace.
</P>
<P>
Security, development and democratic transition stem from peace
 and stability, he said, adding that he is pleased to see the
change of a culture of revenge to a culture of forgiveness in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister admitted that peaceful democracy is a
long haul and takes time to take shape. He urged all stakeholders
to contribute to the peace process in both Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He said the forthcoming United Nations Security Council's
meeting on the Great Lakes region later this month is a good
chance for the players to come and sit down and bridge their
differences.
</P>
<P>
The minister, while opening the new French Embassy here, also
held talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and rebel
leaders from the DRC. Josselin's next leg of the visit is Kigali,
where he will meet with Rwandan authorities on the peace process.

India has said in the past that it is willing to sign the CTBT
once it has built a domestic consensus on the pact.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Denies Use of U.S. Aid for War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto denied Friday that the
economic assistance offered by the United States to combat drug
traffic will be deviated to increase the public conflict.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez de Soto said that he does not agree to the statement
made by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
guerrilla spokesmen who criticized the 1.6 billion dollar
assistance, fearing that it will make more difficult the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"That is a wrong reading. The U.S. assistance is for the war
against drug traffic," said Fernandez de Soto.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday told to his Colombian
counterpart, Andres Pastrana, that his government had requested
the funds for the war against drugs to the Congress, which could
approve them in June.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who plans to make a
brief visit to Cartagena, warned that Colombia cannot deviate the
funds to combat the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla leader "Raul Reyes," main FARC spokesman in the talks
with the Pastrana government, had said that the funds would be
deviated to combat the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez de Soto also denied that the U.S. assistance is tied
to the imposition of conditions by Washington to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
"There is not any kind of conditioning. The U.S. government has
been completely respectful of the Colombian policies and
sovereignty," said the foreign minister.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- All the anti-
personnel landmines laid by the Colombian Army should be destroyed
in a short term, Colombian President Andres Pastrana said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president announced his decision by making a call to all
the outlawed groups "to destroy all the anti-personnel landmines
they have in their possession or might have buried in the
Colombian fields."
</P>
<P>
The government considers that the illegal armed organizations
have placed, without any kind of warning, some 50,000 landmines.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana did not mention the number of mines planted by the
Army.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of my government is to abide by the (Ottawa)
treaty as soon and as efficiently as possible," said the head of
state during the signing of the Colombian law that puts in force
the Ottawa Convention that forbids the use, warehousing,
production, and transference of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>

Axworthy as a witness of honor, who is making a two-day official

<HEADLINE> Greece Cracks Down on Illegal Parking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- With the successfully
implementation of the Public Order Ministry's pilot program "
Respect for Our Fellow Citizens" in the capital city of Athens,
the ministry has now decided to take similar action in the
northern city of Thessaloniki to crack down on illegal parking.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the program is to prevent cars and motorcycles from
parking illegally on pavements and obstructing pedestrians as well
as to encourage citizens to use public transportation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, traffic police will issue warnings and
remove license plates of the cars and motorcycles parking
illegally on downtown Thessaloniki's footpaths and walkways, but
they will as of Wednesday tow vehicles away without further ado.
</P>
<P>
It will be in effect until February 17, when it will be decided
whether or not it will be finalized according to the measure's
outcome.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.8 million vehicles in Greece do not have a place to
park. In Athens, there is only one legal parking space for every
99 vehicles while there exists one parking place for just one out
of every 40 cars in Thessaloniki, where some 350,000 to 400,000
vehicles circulate in the wider area.
</P>
<P>
The parking problem is not unique to Athens and Thessaloniki.
Major cities around the country, including Iraklio, Larissa,
Patras and Rhodes, have similar problems.
</P>
<P>
In the province of Attica, which has a total of 1.4 million
cars, 440,000 trucks and buses and some 225,000 motorcycles,
traffic police issued a total of 213,760 parking tickets last year,
and this number is expected to soar this year, since the Public
Order Ministry seems more determined than ever to rid the streets
of illegally parked cars.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf has
refuted a statement by Saudi Arabia accusing Iraq of hiding
information about the fate of a Saudi pilot whose warplane was shot
down inside Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iraqi TV's Satellite Channel on
Thursday evening, Sahaf described the statement made by Saudi
Defense Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz as "baseless and incorrect."
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said the Saudi authorities had informed Iraq early October
1992 that a Saudi warplane F5 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Nadira
was shot down by Iraqi ground defense forces in the border area of
Arar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, searching for the body of the dead pilot in
the Arar area was impossible as it was filled with mines planted

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Eritrea to Normalize Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Eritrea agreed Friday
evening to speed up the process of normalizing their diplomatic
ties, strained over the last five years due to exchanged
accusations of rebel backing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between Sudanese Foreign
Minister Mustafa Ismail and his Eritrean counterpart Haile
Woldetensae.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference after the talks, Ismail voiced
Sudan's desire to enhance bilateral ties with Eritrea and name an
ambassador to the neighbor as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is also ready to "open the economic file" with Eritrea,
enhance the exchanges between the people of the two countries and
open air link between Khartoum and Asmara, the Eritrean capital,
Ismail added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean minister said his country attached
importance to upgrading relations with Sudan in diplomatic,
economic, social and cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support for the decision made by Sudanese President
Omar al-Bashir last month to dissolve the parliament and implement
a three-month state of emergency in the country.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that Eritrea could consider the expulsion of Sudanese
armed opposition from its territories. However, he said "the issue
is still a Sudanese affair that concerns the Sudanese in the first
place."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean foreign minister wound up Friday his two-day visit
to Sudan during which he handed al-Bashir a message from Eritrean
President Issayas Aferwerki on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea severed its diplomatic relations with Sudan in December
1994. The two countries signed an agreement to resume ties in Doha,
Qatar, last May.

<P>
Ogata, who is concerned about the steady flow of Burundians
fleeing to Tanzania where camps are filling up, will visit
Tanzania from Sunday, the trip coincided with efforts by former
South African President Nelson Mandela to mediate progress in the
peace process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, will meet
senior government officials in Dar es Salaam and also visit Karago
camp in Kibondo district before departing for South Africa, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, she will meet South African President Thabo Mbeki
and other officials before flying to Lusaka, capital of Zambia on
January 23. In Zambia, she is expected to visit Angolan refugees
in camps before ending her 10-day visit on January.
</P>
<P>
Ogata told an open Security Council debate on refugees in
Africa here Thursday that there are six million refugees in Africa,
who cover the internally displaced persons and those who fled to
neighboring countries, and to take care of the African homeless is
no easy job.
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with the internally displaced is often more arduous
than with refugees who cross borders," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty of having access to large number of people in
insecure and isolated areas is compounded by the complexity of
assisting civilians in their own country -- where their own state
authorities, or rebel forces in control, are frequently the very
cause of their predicament," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of people at risk in war areas such as
South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Angola and
Sierra Leone -- a majority of them internally displaced -- are
presently not accessible to humanitarian agencies," she said.
</P>
<P>
"And where such access is possible, it is often very dangerous,
" she said. "The killing of two United Nations staff members in
Burundi last November is just the last of many such fatal
incidents affecting humanitarian personnel."
</P>
<P>
Current refugee crises also have other complex aspects, she
said. "The security, socio-economic and natural environment of
countries of asylum are severely affected by large forced
population movements."

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A bomb detonated
Friday at a chicken rotisserie in Colombia's northern city of
Bucaramanga without causing victims but only material damage, said
the police.
</P>
<P>
The authorities attributed the attack to a retaliation of the
rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) because the owner of the fast
food stand refused to pay them the so-called "vaccine" (money
exacted in exchange of not being attacked).
</P>
<P>
The explosion wave caused damage to the establishment and to
neighboring houses in Bucaramanga, department of Santander, said
the police.
</P>
<P>
An explosion occurred Thursday considered "casual" by the
police, which attributed it to clumsy management of powder. The
explosion caused injuries to 12 people in the regional state
treasury office in Medellin, capital of the Antioquia department.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Department Admits Problems in Anti-Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-missile missile, known as a "kill vehicle," destroyed
its target high over the Pacific on October 2, 1999. But that was
only after it put its crosshairs on a large decoy balloon meant to
simulate the kind of simple measures a hostile nation might take
to confuse an American anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
"I remind you to keep one thing in mind: The test succeeded.
The target was hit," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
But another defense official confirmed a New York Times report
that the U.S. weapon at first aimed itself at a nearby decoy
balloon sent up to confuse it.
</P>
<P>
"(We) didn't think it was that important, to be honest with you,
" the official said, adding that it was a successful test -- went
well.
</P>
<P>
The Times also reported, and the Pentagon Friday confirmed,
that the "kill vehicle" also had a navigation problem in the
October test. Because an incorrect star map was loaded into the
interceptor's computer, it could not navigate using the stars once
it had separated from the booster rocket that sent it into space.
An on-board guidance system worked, however, so the navigation
problem was of no consequence, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A second such test is scheduled on January 18 and another in
April or May, leading toward a decision later in the year by
President Bill Clinton on whether to start building a U.S.
national missile defense system over objections from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Romania Celebrates Birthday of National Greatest Poet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Academy at a
solemn meeting Friday celebrated the 150th birthday of national
poet Mihai Eminescu, starting the year-long commemorative
activities -- the Eminescu Year.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said in an address that
the Romanians celebrate not only Eminescu's birthday but also the
150th Eminescu Year because "Romanian culture has lived under his
sign, the passion and purity of his voice never ceased to move us.
"
</P>
<P>
He said that Eminescu's poetry and prose forged a model of
Romanian feeling and thinking to which the Romanians turned in the
moments of distress in their history. The Romanians step into the
next century under Eminescu's sign, he added.
</P>
<P>
President of the Romanian Academy Eugen Simion spoke in an
address about the perennial feature of the Eminescu cultural model
and myth in the Romanian spiritual life. He said that Eminescu can
be deemed outdated neither in the essence of his lyricism, nor as
a national poet and nor in the coherence and force of his
political images. "I believe that Eminescu's myth will exist today
and in future so long as this oriental Latin-based language is
going to be spoken," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government declared the year 2000, when the 150th
birthday of the poet occurs, the Eminescu Year. Cultural events
will take place to be dedicated to the life and work of this great
poet.
</P>
<P>
Mihai Eminescu was born in Botosani on January 15, 1850 and
educated at the University of Vienna and the University of Berlin,
where he was influenced by German philosophy and Western
literature. His great talent was first revealed in 1870 and he
soon became recognized as the foremost modern Romanian poet.
Mystically inclined and of a melancholy disposition, he lived in
the glory of the Romanian medieval past and folklore, on which he
based one of his most outstanding poems, Luceafarul (Venus).
</P>
<P>
Eminescu's masterly handing of rhyme and verse form, profundity
of thought and plasticity of expression made him the creator of a
school of poetry that dominated Romanian thought and the
expression of Romanian writers and poets at the end of the 19th
and the beginning of the 20th centuries. His poems, lyrical,
passionate and revolutionary, had a deep influence on Romanian
letters. They were widely translated.

<HEADLINE> ELN Blows Up Oil Pipeline in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's second
rebel group National Liberation Army (ELN) has blown up with
explosives the Central de los Llanos oil pipeline, which is one of
the most important in Colombia, the authorities of that region
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels Thursday night put the dynamite sticks on top of the
pipeline, in a zone near the Aguazul town, in the eastern
department of Casanare.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline distributes the crude produced in the Cusiana and
Cupiagua fields, in Casanare, and takes it to the refining plants
in the northeast of the country, and the explosion caused the
spilling of some 3,000 barrels of the hydrocarbon, said the state-
owned oil enterprise
</P>
<P>
Technicians sent after the attack to repair the damage were
under the protection of the army. The ELN also attacked this week
the oil pipeline that takes the crude from the Cano Limon fields
to the Caribbean port of Covenas.
</P>
<P>
These ELN attacks are part of a campaign of protest against the
system of the contracts of the Colombian oil production with
multinational firms.
</P>
<P>
The rebels consider these contracts damaging for the country,
since the crude is considered one of the treasures most
appreciated at a world level.
</P>
<P>
The ELN maintains, despite these attacks, a rapprochement with
the government of President Andres Pastrana for the establishment
of a peace process. Pastrana is also holding peace talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to end the social
conflict this country is going through.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Delay Test of Space Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
July's scheduled flight from Edwards Air Force Base in
California State to Utah State's Dugway Proving Ground is "
definitely going to be delayed," said Jerry Rising, president of
VentureStar LLC, the joint venture building the 1.2-billion-U.S.-
dollar X-33 space plane.
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether to repair or replace the tanks depends on
the outcome of an investigation by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) and Lockheed Martin Corporation into
last fall's failure of one of the tanks during testing, the second
such defect in a year, Rising said.
</P>
<P>
"If we have to build aluminum tanks for the X-33, that will
take about 18 months," delaying the test flights from July to
early 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
The X-33 is a pilotless prototype for VentureStar space planes
Lockheed Martin and its partners hope to build as privately
operated, possible replacements for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
The first test flights were scheduled for 1999, then delayed
until July. Rising said that there will be up to 15 test flights.
