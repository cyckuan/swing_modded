BOTTOM PUTS YANKS ON TOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During a Yankees batting practice over the weekend,
Joe Torre glanced out at the scoreboard, which had third baseman
Scott Brosius' name and stats in lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that _ 98 runs batted in,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius would finish the season with 98, but after the Yankees'
2-0 victory over the Texas Rangers Tuesday night in the opener of
their American League division series, the 32-year-old third
baseman could take credit for 100 RBI _ one on a punched single
through the right side of the Texas infield that scored Jorge
Posada, and the other moments later on his brilliant base-running,
which allowed Chad Curtis to score before Brosius was tagged out in
a rundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott's base-running instincts are by far the best on this
team,'' Torre has said. ``He never makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, with Curtis on third base and Chuck
Knoblauch up, Brosius broke for second. On a called third strike on
Knoblauch, Ivan Rodriguez, the Ranger catcher, fired toward second
base, where Mark McLemore took the throw in the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to get around McLemore, Brosius stopped, then
quickly retreated toward first base. McLemore unwisely chased him
as Curtis hurried across the plate. The run counted because Curtis
scored before Brosius was tagged by first baseman Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the batting order _ Curtis hit eighth, Brosius
ninth _ along with David Wells' nine strikeouts in eight shutout
innings, put the Yankees on top, 1-0, in the three-of-five-game
series, which resumes Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think of another guy at the bottom of the
batting order with as many RBIs as Scott has,'' Torre had said.
``Maybe Paul Sorrento; he had a lot when he was with the Indians in
1995, before he went to Seattle in the off season.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not a day-to-day regular, Sorrento had 79 RBIs that
season as a first baseman and designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, of course, was in the lineup last night primarily for
his glove. Shane Spencer, the September sensation, had hit 10
homers, including three grand slams, but with Wells pitching, Torre
wanted Curtis' more dependable glove in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells is more of a fly ball pitcher,'' Torre explained.
``Curtis is out there basically for defense.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth inning, though, Curtis appeared to
misjudge a McLemore fly ball that sailed over his glove for a
double. But with Wells' ninth strikeout and Derek Jeter's acrobatic
scoop and throw of Rusty Greer's slow grounder, the Yankees
survived the inning, and Curtis exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pitch,'' Torre had said, ``Texas can score a lot
of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   And last night, the Yankees pitched. Wells was dominant for
eight innings, then Mariano Rivera closed out the Rangers in the
ninth. In recent weeks, Rivera had not been as dependable as usual,
but Torre had pronounced him ready for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fine,'' the Yankee manager said before the game. ``He had
a little problem when he was hit with a line drive in the right
part of his chest and we had to shut him down for four or five
days, but his stuff now is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the middle of the Yankee batting order all but
helpless, the bottom of the order supplied the big hits and the
clever base-running that made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   In that second-inning rally against Todd Stottlemyre, the Texas
starter, Curtis sliced a looping fly ball that just eluded right
fielder Juan Gonzalez's glove not far from the foul line. Then
Brosius slashed a run-producing single, and later danced away from
McLemore as Curtis scored.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, Brosius has been a sweet surprise.
Acquired from the Oakland Athletics in the off-season trade for the
left-hander Kenny Rogers and an unspecified amount of George
Steinbrenner's cash, Brosius batted .300 with those 98 RBIs and 19
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the Yankee front office might have to consider
letting the 32-year-old Brosius, who signed to a one-year contract,
depart as a free agent rather than re-sign him. Some of
Steinbrenner's ``baseball people'' consider the farmhand Mike
Lowell ready to take over at third.
</P>
<P>
   But after last night's theatrics, all the Yankee loyalists in
the crowd of 57,362, the second largest assembly in the 22-year
history of the remodeled Stadium, would insist on re-signing Scott
Brosius.

HACKETT CAN'T PRAISE HIS OWN PASSING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether it's a question of poor blocking or
keeping things simple for the quarterback, there's a reason USC's
passing game has often looked little more than throwing deep to R.
Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a quick ball to throw (when) there's not a lot of pass
protection,'' said USC coach Paul Hackett. ``There's also not a lot
of decision making (for the quarterback) in case the protection
breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   A limited passing game could be the side effect from being
manhandled by Florida State. USC quarterbacks completed just three
of 19 passes for 23 yards. And the Trojans expect Arizona State's
defense to be just as aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hackett would eventually like to use more plays with
four wide receivers, he's reluctant to do anything with the
offensive line struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last week, I'm not going to be quick to throw all these
(receivers) out here,'' Hackett said. ``Passing is about pass
protection. The passing game is not rolling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Trojans concentrating on Soward or the running backs,
receivers like Billy Miller and Mike Bastianelli are getting fewer
opportunities for receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really thrown down the middle of the field at all
this year,'' Bastianelli said. ``That's what I do. He hasn't really
unleashed the offense, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who caught 56 passes last season, has just nine
receptions. Bastianelli, who caught 33 passes last year, has just
four. Hackett said the sheer number of wide receivers is the reason
Bastianelli's numbers are down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five wide receivers we feel very confident in,''
Hackett said. ``The return of Larry Parker and the addition of
Windrell Hayes are two huge differences.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Passing genius: Hackett made light of the fact that USC has
passed for 23 yards twice in the past 19 years: last week against
Florida State and in the 1979 Rose Bowl, when he was the Trojans'
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really a whiz so far,'' he said. ``We're 10th in the
league in passing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wilson to redshirt: The offensive line might be in trouble,
but Hackett said true freshman guard Zach Wilson, who was
impressive in training camp, will still redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tempted (to play him),'' Hackett said. ``I liked what he
did early.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also officially informed tailback Sultan McCullough that
he will redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to redshirt, really,'' McCullough said. ``I think I
need to gain a little weight.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Practice change: In an effort to increase the tempo and
competition, Hackett had the first-string offense and defense
practice against each other. It's a move welcomed by the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practices, everyone's gotten into a routine,'' Bastianelli
said. ``At times, it seems to be slower.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Townsend's a Sun Devil: Former USC defensive lineman Tommie
Townsend is a member of Arizona State's football team. Townsend
left USC last year after encountering academic problems with the
NCAA Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Tailback Chad Morton did not practice because
he needed to rest his sore back. He is expected to return today.
Center Matt McShane practiced and appears healthy enough to start
Saturday.

GONZALEZ HAS BARK BUT NO BITE FOR TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pitch got away from David Wells and sailed right
into the sight line of Juan Gonzalez, like a deer standing before a
hunter. Gonzalez pulled the trigger, swung with might and fouled
off the 2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   A wide-eyed Wells wiped his brow. Close call. In one of his few
mistakes of the evening, Wells nearly handed Gonzalez an
opportunity to send the Yankees into a flashback of the 1996
division series, when the Rangers' clean-up hitter huffed and
puffed and blew their staff down.
</P>
<P>
   At least for a night, the ominous Gonzalez turned into a dark
cloud that passed over Yankee Stadium without a drop. The one time
he made contact and produced a ground ball that was fair, it
dribbled three feet in front of him and Wells threw him out. For
the night, Gonzalez was 0 for 4 with a strikeout, ending the night
as a prime example of a threatening lineup coming up dry in the
Yankees' 2-0 victory in Game 1 of their division series against the
Rangers Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any offense at all, it came from the bottom of the
lineup, not from the imposing heart of the order. The Rangers'
second through sixth batters _ Roberto Kelly, Rusty Greer,
Gonzalez, Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez _ each finished the season
batting over .300. Three of them, Greer, Gonzalez and Clark, had
100-plus RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, with Wells' precision starting to waiver,
Kelly had a prime opportunity to drive in a run for the Rangers
after the leadoff hitter, Mark McLemore, doubled with one out.
Wells battled Kelly and won. On a full count that arrived after
Kelly fouled off three pitches, Wells reached back and delivered a
called strike on the inside corner. Kelly was gone, as was Greer,
who grounded out to Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was over. With the Rangers unable to cause a ripple
in front of Gonzalez, the Yankees did not have to made a decision
to walk him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they walk Juan, as some teams have done, we can go to a guy
who has only driven in 100-something runs and hit over .300,''
Manager Johnny Oates said before the game, referring to Clark.
``And if they walk him, we've got a guy who has driven in
80-something runs. We have to give Juan some help, because he can't
do it all by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no rescue last night. The Rangers had McLemore aboard
on a walk to start the game, but no one could pick him up as Kelly,
Greer and Gonzalez delivered three consecutive outs. In the fourth
inning, with Greer on first base, Gonzalez and Clark ended the
inning with back-to-back strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is try to take advantage of the situation,''
Clark said before the game, knowing if Gonzalez was pitched around,
he would have to deliver. ``If I come up there with runners in
scoring position, I've got to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   There were chances, but each dissolved, and a shutout was on.
The Rangers were not the run-scoring Rangers everyone had come to
know this season.
</P>
<P>
   And Gonzalez was not himself; not that Wells allowed him to
break free. Instead of pitching around Gonzalez, Wells pitched him
carefully inside. With the exception of one pitch that got away
from him, Wells picked at Gonzalez's weakness: the inside part of
the plate. Generally, Gonzalez likes to extend his arms toward
pitches at the middle and outside part of the plate, about belt
high.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to connect with for Gonzalez. This was not
1996. During that series against the Yankees, Gonzalez uncoiled for
five home runs and nine RBIs in 16 at-bats, generating the only
offense for a Rangers team that lost in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was different. There would be a close call, but no
flashback on this night. The gaudy numbers the Rangers put up in
the regular season were nowhere to be found on a blank scoreboard. &QL;

MAY BEST TEAM WIN _ OR LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our 1998 baseball postseason coverage begins with a correction:
Recent reports, on the Texas Rangers' gut-check victory against the
Angels in the American League West and the Chicago Cubs' gasping
win over the San Francisco Giants in the National League wild-card
tie-breaker, might have left the mistaken impression those teams
are in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They are not in the playoffs. For the record, neither are the
Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Boston Red Sox or
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   There really is only one team in the playoffs this year: the New
York Yankees. And there really are only two possible outcomes:
Yankees win the World Series or Yankees lose.
</P>
<P>
   The last order of business in this heavenly baseball season is
to determine if the Yankees are everything they appeared to be in
winning an AL-record 114 games. They did it not with long home
runs, grandiose personalities and loud talk, but one Bernie
Williams line drive, one David Cone curveball and one Scott Brosius
surprise at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Any other team is just a potential spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees win, and they're one of the great Yankees teams of all
time, which means they're one of the great teams of all time,
period.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees lose, and they're one of the great flops of all time.
</P>
<P>
   How plush is the historical context in which they squirm?
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post has been printing game stories, columns, box
scores and stats on a computer-simulated World Series matching the
1998 Yankees and the 1939 Yankees of Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio,
Bill Dickey, Lefty Gomez and Red Ruffing.
</P>
<P>
   The '39 Yankees won the first three games, but the '98 Yankees
rallied to win the series when Paul O'Neill singled home Chuck
Knoblauch in the eighth inning of Game 7. Oh, and Darryl Strawberry
outhomered DiMaggio 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how about real life?
</P>
<P>
   Yankees win, and with two World Series in three years, they're a
Yankees dynasty for a new generation, for the fans brought to
baseball by cable, the trading-cards boom and Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees lose, and they're the Braves, Oakland A's and Pittsburgh
Pirates _ the '90s' other big regular-season winners and postseason
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win the World Series, you'll have something to talk
about,'' Bob Feller of the 1954 Indians _ 111-game winners and
World Series losers _ was quoted saying of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees win, and they're the first team since the '89 A's to
have the best regular-season record in the major leagues and the
World Series trophy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees lose, and it's time to ask if there's something wrong
with a playoff system that serves only to swiftly overturn the
results of 2,429 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was quoted saying that failing to win the World Series
would take the ``luster'' off the Yankees' regular-season
achievement, as if the regular season is the real measure of a
team. And when you think about it, after six months of games, we
!ital!do!off! have a pretty good idea who's best.
</P>
<P>
   And while an occasional upset is nice ... isn't eight upsets in
a row a bit much?
</P>
<P>
   Not even winning 100 games, supposedly the hallmark of
greatness, guarantees a World Series victory. Starting with the '54
Indians, of the 27 first-place teams that won 100 or more games, 18
lost in the playoffs or World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It would be convenient to blame the three-division alignment,
the wild-card playoff spot and the best-of-five first-round series,
and say baseball presents potentially great teams with too many
hoops to jump through. But the new system has been in effect for
only three years, and in that time, only one of the ``best record''
teams was tripped up short of a league pennant, the '97 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   No, if the Yankees come up short, the trouble will lie not in
their format but in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So: Is it all right to root for them?
</P>
<P>
   They're still the Yankees, and even in politically correct Los
Angeles, hatred of pinstripes is one hatred that's still allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The old saying, ``Rooting for the Yankees is like rooting for
U.S. Steel,'' had meaning when you read in Sports Business Journal
that industry experts say George Steinbrenner could get $1 billion
for the team. By analogy, the Dodgers ($350 million) are the local
junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, here's hoping they go all the way. For once, it'll be
nice to see the best team win.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, they'll give a new generation of baseball fans
someone to hate.

GAMUT FOR O'NEILL: PERFECTION OR RAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Cardenal tries not to laugh, and he turns away
if he can't help himself, his body shaking. Cardenal, the Yankees'
first-base coach, not only hears Paul O'Neill's self-indictments
after the All-Star right fielder makes an out, he also all but
feels the heat from O'Neill's explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he's saying, `I can't hit anymore, I'll never get
another hit,' and he's batting .320,'' said Cardenal. ``If he goes
0 for 3, that's the first thing he'll say: `I can't play no more.'
The guy just wants a base hit every time he bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball fans who watched the Yankees defeat the Texas
Rangers, 2-0, in Game 1 of the American League division series last
night know O'Neill for his ability to hit. He averaged .317 this
year, his sixth consecutive season batting over .300, and drove in
116 runs with 40 doubles, 2 triples and 24 home runs. Last night he
was true to form, going 1 for 3 with a first-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   But casual baseball fans _ or fans who hate the Yankees _ have
come to identify O'Neill for his on-field rage, ignited almost
every time he makes an out. If he makes the final out of an inning,
O'Neill might slam his helmet after crossing first base. If O'Neill
makes an out in the middle of an inning, he returns to the dugout
with his head down, sometimes talking aloud. As he nears the bat
rack, the bat boys who sit nearby bend away instinctively, unsure
of how O'Neill's momentary self-loathing might manifest itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with him is that frustration builds up,'' said
Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder. ``He might fail in
his first at-bat, and then his second at-bat, and then in his third
at-bat, if he doesn't have a hit, he's ready to explode. He's never
satisfied. He could be 4 for 4, and then ground out or strike out
in his fifth at-bat, and he's furious.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity apparently runs in the family. O'Neill grew up as
the youngest of five brothers, ``in a very competitive
environment,'' he said. ``When you're competing against your own
family, it's a love-hate thing, man. And it's frustrating when you
continually lose. As you get older, you get closer, but it always
seems like you fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   But hating to fall short goes further back than the Ohio
O'Neills. The O'Neill clan is legendary in Ireland. According to
ancient lore, two rival chieftains _ including the O'Neill leader _
agreed that they would row across a body of water and whoever first
touched the Isle of Destiny would possess land rights. As they
neared land, O'Neill realized he was going to lose. He drew his
sword, cut off his left hand and threw it to shore, winning the
race. The bloody hand _ the Red Hand of Ulster _ is part of the
O'Neill coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill does not have a sword at his disposal, but he
sometimes throws his helmet or flips his bat or flings his batting
gloves when he makes an out. Any out seems to be one too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anyone like him,'' Homer Bush said. ``It can't
be good for your health. But the guys who have been around him say
his rages make him concentrate better and make the needed
adjustments. Every time he comes back, he doesn't just throw things
or hit things _ he knows exactly what he did wrong in that at-bat.
He'll say, `Stay back,' or, `You know he was going to throw you
that pitch, why did you swing at it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams: ``He just doesn't hide his frustration as well as
everybody else, which I don't think is a bad thing; he'll probably
have less gray hairs than the rest of us, less ulcers.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said: ``I'm not the only guy who does this stuff. I
might be the only one who doesn't make it down to the tunnel where
you can't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Durwood Merrill, an umpire who happens to be working during this
division series, complained about O'Neill's body language at home
plate in a book published earlier this year. But the vast majority
of umpires seem tolerant of O'Neill. Sometimes he twists his head
in disgust on a strike call, and most umpires calmly explain the
location of the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   John Shulock, an American League umpire, interprets O'Neill's
outward demeanor as a reflection of how he is feeling about himself
at a given moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't begrudge us doing our job, he just gets
frustrated,'' Shulock said. ``He feels he should get a hit every
time up. He won't accept mediocrity. If I was a manager of a team
and I had six or seven like him, I'd be completely happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Something O'Neill will probably never be, until the year he bats
1.000. &QL;

FANS LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: SHOULD THE YANKEES LEAVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Yankee fans gathered Tuesday night for the team's
fourth straight year in the playoffs, some were already looking
past this season's performance to reflect on the team's future _
and whether that future would take place in the Bronx, in Manhattan
or somewhere across the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Whether moved by tradition or buoyed by the excitement of the
moment, most seemed inclined to think that the club should stay
put. Some cited a new plan by Borough President Fernando Ferrer for
a redesigned ball park as a good way to keep the team in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming to Yankee Stadium for 40 years,'' said John
Cott, 63, of the Bronx. ``George is doing the right thing _ he's
keeping quiet. But if he moves out of New York, he's lost four
loyal fans.'' Cott pointed to his family.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, has
been agitating for years for a new ball park, and the frequency _
and pitch _ of his demands has increased since the Yankees started
winning again. And this year, with the Yankees winning a lot, talk
of the stadium's future has infected New York City political
debates that on the surface have nothing to do with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ferrer offered a plan to modernize Yankee Stadium
that he said would ease traffic jams, add luxury boxes and spruce
up the surrounding neighborhood with new stores and parks. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani declared the plan dead on arrival and continued to
express support for a Manhattan ball park financed by taxpayers.
That plan is opposed by Peter Vallone, the Democratic nominee for
governor and speaker of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferrer's plans seemed to appeal to many attending Tuesday
night's game. Before the game, Dan Pagan, 23, was pasting bumper
stickers to his mountain bike reading, ``Keep our team in the
Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good plan,'' Pagan said. ``You can do a lot here. It
would look nice and bring jobs to the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stadium, Ed Assile said he felt strongly that the
Yankees should remain but that the neighborhood should be built up.
``I think they should do what they did in Baltimore,'' he said.
``If they rejuvenate the neighborhood, people will come.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Bill Meyer, also 50, was circumspect. ``I'd hate to
see them move out, but in the best interest of baseball, they have
to think about security.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men said police officers had told them not to stray too
far. ``They said don't go more than a block from the stadium, so we
stayed inside,'' Assile said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons Steinbrenner has rebuffed plans for a
renovation of Yankee Stadium or even for a new stadium in the
Bronx. He has flirted with New Jersey and shown obvious interest in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, Charlie Sullivan, 62, was having none if it.
``They can build a new stadium,'' he said, ``as long as put it
right here.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR WELLS, WHATEVER WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wells was calm enough Tuesday night that he
paused before facing the second batter of the game to wave to the
rowdy fans chanting his name in the bleacher section. It was
typical Wells. Why be overly concerned about Roberto Kelly at the
plate or Mark McLemore creeping off first base? Just motion toward
right field like always, and then get back to throwing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works, right? For Wells, it is about being comfortable
by being himself. If that means wearing a uniform jersey that looks
bulky enough to cover a pool, do it. If that means tweaking Joe
Torre a few days before Game 1 of the division playoff series for a
decision the manager made 12 months ago, do it. If that means
challenging an imposing lineup with a mixture of gutsy pitches deep
into the night, do it. This is Wells. The Yankees know him and
accept him.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells does as much as he did in a 2-0 victory at Yankee
Stadium Tuesday night, the Yankees also love him. Wells throttled
the Rangers over eight sharp innings, delighting the crowd of
57,362 with nine strikeouts and validating Torre's easy decision to
start him. Actually, it was the only decision Torre could have and
should have made. Wells deserved to be on the mound, and he showed
precisely why in limiting Texas to five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are nervous on both teams out there, so that
can help you out,'' Wells said. ``I don't get nervous. I get
butterflies, but I don't get nervous. I want that opportunity. I
want to pitch in these games.'' That was evident on a mild evening
in the Bronx, especially during the tensest moments.
</P>
<P>
   With the fans chanting, ``Let's go, Boomer,'' in the eighth,
McLemore was on second after Chad Curtis had misjudged a liner to
left field. But Wells battled Kelly for nine pitches before finally
striking him out, then retired Rusty Greer on a trickler to
shortstop on which Derek Jeter made an acrobatic play. Juan
Gonzalez was on deck _ gulp _ but he never got the chance to bring
McLemore home.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, two singles put runners on first and
second with two outs for designated hitter Mike Simms, and the
sticky situation made the Yankee fans queasy. Torre did not call
the bullpen. This was Wells' game, Wells' batter. Remember, he does
not get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   After jumping ahead of Simms with two quick strikes, Wells let
the count drift to 2-2. Simms fouled off two pitches and then Wells
threw a fastball that barely sailed inside. It was 3-2. Wells was a
pitch away from loading the bases, but he might as well have been
waving to the bleachers again as he pumped an outside fastball by
Simms. Wells used to be accused of quitting. Not this season. Not
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a tougher pitcher now,'' Torre said. ``He demands
more from himself. He's always had that great stuff, but he's never
gone beyond that. If it was a bad day for him, he accepted that.
Now he won't accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans were standing and screaming when Wells reached two strikes
on a Ranger as early as the second inning. Sure, it was the
postseason and there were valid reasons for them to be delirious,
but Wells added to that hysteria in his own brash way. He made
nasty pitches, he collected strikeouts and he gave the type of tidy
effort that made the Yankees look like the team that is expected to
stroll to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Wells, the favored Yankees could exhale Tuesday
night. They did not want to fall behind in the three-of-five-game
series, the sort of series Torre referred to as ``Russian
roulette.'' When you have won 114 games in the regular season, as
the Yankees did, it is imperative to begin a short series
successfully. The Yankees asked Wells to usher them through the
opener and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has already been a dream season,'' Wells said. ``What
we're trying to do now is an added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells stifled the dangerous Gonzalez, who did not hit a ball out
of the infield in three at-bats. The burly left-hander did not
allow a Ranger to reach third. He is now 5-0 with a 2.24 ERA in his
postseason career, and this season he is 12-1 at the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a decade, not just a year, since Torre kept Wells'
status as a postseason starter in doubt until late September
because he had faltered in six starts in a row. Eventually, Wells
rebounded, but he had not forgotten the perceived slight. Twelve
months, one perfect game and one magical regular season later,
Wells, without solicitation, recalled in a recent interview how he
had floated in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at last year,'' Wells said. ``He even doubted me
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Wells laughed sarcastically and claimed that Torre forgot
to check his postseason statistics last year. But Torre made the
right call Tuesday night in selecting Wells over David Cone, who
needs the rest, or Andy Pettitte, in whom the Yankees' confidence
is thin. After 135 snazzy pitches, that was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a little more hungry in the postseason than I am
in the regular season because this is what we play for,'' Wells
said. ``When you get here, you got to suck it up. Don't try to
change anything. Stay worthy, you know?''

   GORNJI OBRINJE, Yugoslavia _ The bodies of 15 women, children
and elderly members of the Deliaj clan lay slumped among the rocks
and streams of the gorge below their village in Kosovo province
Tuesday, shot in the head at close range and in some cases
mutilated as they tried to escape advancing Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   In village houses, three men, including Fazli Deliaj, the
95-year-old patriarch, who was paralyzed, were burned to death by
Serbs who torched the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Down the dirt track a few miles at Donji Obrinje, three more
elderly people lay dead on their backs in their gardens, shot in
the head as they apparently came out to plead for their lives. Ali
Kolludra, 62, still gripped his hooked walking stick Tuesday as he
lay dead on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Local villagers said the massacre took place on Saturday
morning, two days after the village came under siege by the
Yugoslav army and the police of Serbia, the republic that makes up
the major part of Yugoslavia and includes Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, monitors from the United States and the European
Union inspected the bodies of the Deliaj clan in the gorge. That
night they submitted a graphic written report of what they saw to
their embassies in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 21 dead in the neighboring villages, there were
other deaths four miles away in Golubovac. A survivor there showed
a reporter the pools of blood left by a separate attack on Saturday
that he said left 13 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The killings appeared to show as definitively as anything that
the forces of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, have been
conducting a campaign of terror and destruction against ethnic
Albanian civilians which is intended to intimidate them, but which
appears instead to be inspiring even stronger defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials in Washington and at NATO last week stepped up
their threats of military force against Milosevic and demanded that
his forces stop their rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government, whose driving force is Milosevic,
announced on Monday that it had ended its tank and artillery
offensive against separatist guerrillas in Kosovo. But ambassadors
visiting Kosovo Tuesday from Belgrade said they saw no sign that
the army and police had withdrawn to barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the lower Drenica Valley, where the Kosovo Liberation
Army has been most resilient, it appeared that the executions were
intended to send a particularly stark message of terror before
winter sets in and the Serbian forces face more difficulty in
moving around. The spate of killings on Saturday appeared to occur
as Serbian forces wound up their current operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official in Washington said that American
diplomats, including Defense Department personnel, had seen the
bodies and reported their observations, but that they ``are not
forensic experts.''
</P>
<P>
   The American special envoy for Kosovo, Ambassador Christopher
Hill, told CNN that ``there have been a number of these reports''
of massacres. ``This is a very brutal conflict,'' he said. ``It's
one more reason why we need to get international forensic experts
in there,'' to better judge the causes of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 ethnic Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs nine to one
in Kosovo _ have been forced from their homes since the spring.
Many of their homes were burned and looted by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and human rights groups say they cannot
definitively enumerate the number of civilians _ on either the
ethnic Albanian or the Serbian side _ executed since the start of
the conflict in March. But Human Rights Watch, a New York-based
group, is scheduled to issue a report that documents two major
incidents, in the villages of Prekaz, Likoshe and Cirez, where
Serbian forces shot 80 Albanian civilians in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of the other execution, in Golubovac, Adem Hoxhaj,
63, described to a reporter Tuesday how 13 men were lined up
against the fence of his house on Saturday morning and shot with a
machine gun from a mound of earth about 10 feet away. There were
separate pools of blood for each body along the fence Tuesday and
the casings of about 80 bullets on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhaj said the men, between 18 and 35 years old, were all
brought to his house by Serbian police from the nearby forest where
they had been hiding. The rest of the villagers were also brought
in from the forest but were herded into a house and detained, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhaj said he escaped from the house and could see the
execution from hedges on the other side of the garden. His
description fit closely with that given to diplomats Tuesday by
another survivor, whose account they said they considered ``very
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gornji Obrinje Tuesday, the bodies of the dead were slowly
being brought up from the gorge. Two of the ethnic Albanian men
arranging the burial wore holsters with pistols.
</P>
<P>
   From the way some of the bodies lay on a rocky path, it was
evident that the women and children had tried to escape and had run
straight into police. Zahide Deliaj, 27, lay on the rocks, shot in
the face, and behind lay her two daughters, Gentiana, 7, and
Donieta, 5, their yellow rubber boots still on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet behind Mrs. Deliaj, on the same path, lay Mejhane
Deliaj, 27, and her 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije. Behind her lay
Lumnije Deliaj, 30, who relatives said was seven months pregnant.
Her abdomen had been slit open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report by the diplomatic monitors, who include former
military officers, was very precise in its descriptions of how the
women and children were shot at close range.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors also said in their report that they found an
elderly couple ``heavily mutilated.'' The report said, ``The man
was decapitated, his brain removed and left `displayed' beside his
wife's corpse.'' The woman's throat had been slit and her left foot
mutilated in an apparent attempt to cut it off, the monitors noted.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a puddle of blood remained on the foam mattress
where the woman, Hava Deliaj, 68, was found, and the brain of
Pajazit Deliaj remained on the adjacent mattress. Both were buried
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clan's elders, Sadri Deliaj, 56, who managed to elude
the attacking Serb forces, described Tuesday how, last Thursday,
large numbers of Serbian troops, tanks and armored personnel
carriers that had been in the area surrounded the village. Armed
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, underarmed and outgunned,
apparently left the area, fleeing the Serbs, the monitors said.
</P>
<P>
   The more vulnerable members of the family _ about 16 women,
children, aunts and uncles _ were sent down to the gorge where it
was thought they would be safer. There they set up the tarpaulin
shelter for sleeping and fashioned a makeshift kitchen for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Deliaj said that on Saturday, both soldiers and police
approached the village. ``They came on foot and I heard armored
personnel carriers,'' he said. ``There were all kinds of
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliaj said that as the armed Serbs approached the gorge he ran
away. ``I heard the screaming, and I heard the shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the body of one victim was carried out of the rocks on a
wooden stretcher Tuesday, her niece, Halime Hajdari, 15, wept. ``I
always hated the Serbs and I hate them now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A young man, Arsim Deliaj, 19, also wept as the bodies of
Gentiana and Donieta Deliaj, who were his nieces, were arranged
side by side on a stretcher. ``If they found me, they'd cut me up
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was he angry that the Kosovo Liberation Army couldn't better
defend his relatives? ``Not at all,'' he said. ``They didn't have a
chance, they didn't have the weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim custom requires that the dead be buried as soon as
possible. In this case, the Deliaj family members said they had to
wait until the Serbian forces had left and it was safe to come and
look for the dead and the missing.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, 18 graves had been dug at the top of a shady
green field near the village. Enough blankets had been found to
drape around the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., they were burying the 14th body, the pregnant Lumnije
Deliaj, who was slid into the ground wrapped in a red throw and
then covered with the soft ocher soil.

 (Eds: Changes made throughout story to clarify and give additional
details.)  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management has provided a
rare chance to pull back the curtain on John Meriwether's
cloistered financial brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the veil, Meriwether and his Nobel Prize-winning
colleagues appear less the wizards that people once imagined, and
the levers they pulled seem rather ordinary. Awe has turned to
sympathy, even disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they were brilliant guys or something, but they made
some very ordinary trades,'' said Jon Najarian of Mercury Trading
in Chicago. ``They made the same dumb mistakes everyone makes, only
with a lot more money at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the mark of the ultimate salesman had once been the
guy who could sell ice cubes to Eskimos, then Meriwether may well
be remembered as the trader who taught banks about loans. By the
tens of billions of dollars, the best and brightest financiers on
Wall Street fed Long-Term Capital's insatiable appetite for
securities that, it turns out, thousands of other fund managers
considered easy and common targets.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether is still in day-to-day control of Long-Term Capital
after a rescue effort by a consortium of big banks that is now
valued at $3.6 billion. His new banking partners have signed
pledges of confidentiality when they review his books, but details
are leaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that though his financing was often
exotic, his trades were more garden-variety. Long-Term Capital bet
on minor price differences between similar sorts of securities that
financial history suggested should not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Like many arbitragers, it gambled that troubled mergers would
eventually be completed as planned. Meriwether underwrote a popular
form of insurance to investors worried that the stock market would
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing exotic about the trades,'' said a Wall
Street executive close to the Long-Term Capital rescue, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. The mystery, he said, was how Wall
Street agreed to lend so much money to a trader whose black box
looked much like their own. ``The question is simply why did we let
this happen. Why did the Street finance this guy to this extent?''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital did produce stellar returns for investors who
put money in at the fund's inception, in 1994. From then until the
end of last year, every dollar invested would have grown to $2.82,
the kind of profit that would take a decade in the strongest bull
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But given the end-of-August picture of Long-Term Capital's
trading portfolio, which put Meriwether's equity holdings at around
60 times his $2.2 billion in capital, the fund had access to a free
flow of bank credit that would make other fund managers salivate.
But some have been unimpressed that in its best years the fund
could coax 40 percent returns from leverage that amplified its
capital base several score or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the amount of money they had, 100-1 leverage, they could
have been doubling, tripling their money each year,'' said Andrew
Brenner, a director of Fimat USA, a New York trading firm.
``Where's the rocket science?''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket science, in turns out, was everywhere: Meriwether's
team was betting on all kinds of securities and on many different
markets, including some in which he had little or no known
expertise. What tied them together was that the emerging-market
turmoil sent securities plunging in tandem in August, knocking the
legs out from under the fund's highly leveraged positions.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's scattershot trading patterns, including signs that
it doubled up on many bets through derivatives, suggest that it
might have had trouble finding profitable uses for its flood of
bank capital.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that surprised people looking at Long-Term's trades
was the degree to which the fund had recently delved into equity
risk arbitrage. Meriwether's traditional expertise was thought to
be bond arbitrage _ seeking temporary price anomalies in the wide
universe of government and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities and other credit instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Long-Term Capital Management is said to have transformed
itself into one of the largest players in stock arbitrage on Wall
Street, investing as much as $1 billion in takeover stocks, as well
as derivatives tied to those investments. That may seem small
compared with the bets it made on bonds. But it is still surprising
that Long-Term Capital played the merger game at all, given its
bond specialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to do size and they wanted to do it in a rush,''
said one stock trader who asked not to be identified. Currently the
hedge fund has liquidated almost all of its equity arbitrage
positions, in part because they were forced to get rid of the most
liquid investment to raise cash quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Many were abandoned at an inopportune time. For example, the
hedge fund sold shares in MCI Communications the week after Labor
Day, only days before its deal with Worldcom was consummated,
sending its share price higher. Last week, Long-Term Capital was
thought to be behind a large-scale dumping of stock in American
Stores Co., bailing out before it completes a planned merger with
Albertson's.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term also took a beating, traders say, on its investment in
telecommunications equipment maker Ciena Corp., which was expected
to be acquired by Tellabs Inc. Traders say the hedge fund owned as
much as 2 million shares of Ciena and lost millions when they,
along with other investors, watched those shares fall from a high
of $92 in July to $13 the day the deal was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term also became a leading seller of a kind of option,
which is effectively an insurance against unusual swings in stock
prices. Through these options, Long-Term assumed the risk of
investors who feared that their stock portfolio, swollen by years
of strong gains, would fall victim to sharp falls in prices. The
business is a great one in a bull market, when investors pay big
premiums for that protection. But it is a potentially devastating
one when stocks turn south, as they did in August. Traders say
Long-Term was one of the biggest losers in that business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main undoing at Long-Term Capital was in its
core area of competence, bond ``convergence.'' In bets on Danish
mortgages, British interest rates, Italian and Russian bonds and
U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities, Long-Term Capital was
the 600-pound gorilla, buying tens of billions of dollars' worth of
bonds it viewed as cheap relative to government securities, the
main benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   In Denmark, for example, Long-Term Capital was known as perhaps
the single largest holder of mortgages. The bet was that the
relatively inexpensive Danish bonds would rise in price to match
those of neighboring Germany, especially because Europe is
preparing to adopt a unified currency.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Long-Term Capital had a big Danish position, it and
hundreds of other bond funds were making similar predictions buying
Italian, Spanish and Greek bonds: Those less stable European
government bonds would rise in value as European nations began the
first stage of monetary union in January.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital also rolled the dice in the United States.
Here, commercial mortgage-backed securities, traded versions of
loans made on shopping malls, offices and land, have usually sold
at a small premium to a benchmark bank lending rate called the
London interbank offered rate.
</P>
<P>
   If that spread of rates prevails, prominent hedge funds like
Long-Term Capital can borrow money from banks at smaller premiums
to the London rate to buy those mortgages. The profit margin is not
large, but the biggest hedge funds leverage their positions 10, 20
or, in Long-Term's case, perhaps 60 or 100 times, magnifying gains.
</P>
<P>
   Or losses. Turmoil in Asia, Russia and other emerging markets
turned such bets sour this year because the spreading loss of
confidence created an unwillingness among investors to take what
were previously considered low-level risks.
</P>
<P>
   Price alignments that Long-Term Capital uses to program its
computers have everywhere fallen out of whack. Spreads on bonds
meant to converge ended up diverging, sometimes by huge margins,
and they have stayed that way longer than most thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even ahead of European union, Danish bonds have sunk in value as
safer German bonds rise. U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities
have lost value relative to the London interbank rate, meaning that
investors are watching their portfolio of such bonds sink even as
banks demand loans back. Long-Term Capital had some winning
positions as well. But its bad bets overwhelmed its good ones, and
the heavy leverage proved deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was betting on convergence when the world was watching
historic divergence,'' one trader said. ``Many people made that
mistake. But they did not owe the banks as much money as Meriwether
did. That was fatal.''

WELLS, YANKEES STIFLE RANGERS IN SERIES OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dream season may be history, but those who made
it happen are intent on burnishing it. Tuesday night the
record-setting Yankees started the postseason the same way they
played during their 114-win regular season: with a big victory.
</P>
<P>
   Maestro David Wells was brilliant against one of the American
League's best offenses, holding the Texas Rangers to five hits over
eight innings. Closer extraordinaire Mariano Rivera mowed down the
heart of the Texas order in the ninth and the Yankees had a 2-0
victory in the opener of this best-of-five Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was overpowering through six innings, then survived on
guile, guts, and fumes in the seventh and eighth. Overall, he
struck out nine, a personal playoff best, in a heroic performance
which featured 135 pitches, 93 of them strikes. It was his highest
pitch count of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Only three Rangers reached second base, and Wells got help when
he needed it, mainly from Derek Jeter with a great play to end the
eighth on a slow roller to shortstop. Meanwhile, the less heralded
bottom of the New York order accounted for both runs in the second
inning, including one on a double steal thanks to a Ranger
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as good in defeat was Todd Stottlemyre, who settled down
after a shaky start and retired 15 of the final 20 batters he
faced, allowing six hits in eight innings. With his father, Yankees
pitching coach Mel, in the home dugout and his mother in the
stands, Stottlemyre fanned seven and gave the Rangers exactly what
they needed: long, quality innings. But on this night, that was not
good enough. Not against Wells, who prepares for games by listening
to such soothing groups as Van Halen, ACDC, and Metallica. (What,
no Megadeath?) It must work; he's 5-0 in the postseason and has
pitched 15 consecutive scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an all right pitcher, I think,'' Wells said. ``But when it
comes to playoff time, I get focused, mean, and I want my way. And
if I don't get it, I get (upset). I'm a fighter. A gamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crunch time,'' added Wells. ``I thrive on this kind of
stuff. I want to be the hero and the goat. I want to be the guy who
they blame when I get my butt kicked or the one they pat on the
back.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a lot of pats Tuesday night. It was a festive atmosphere
at the Stadium, and the crowd of 57,362 was the second largest in
the 23 years since the edifice was remodeled. The Yankees brought
out Elston Howard's daughter to sing the national anthem, and
late-season hero Shane Spencer got a rousing ovation when he was
introduced along with the other nonstarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost a run in the first when Chuck Knoblauch was
thrown out at the plate (a great relay from Royce Clayton) after a
Paul O'Neill double. But they clicked in the second. Jorge Posada
drew a one-out walk and went to third when Chad Curtis, starting
for his defense, doubled to right, just out of the reach of Juan
Gonzalez. Scott Brosius singled in Posada, and then came the key
double steal.
</P>
<P>
   With the count on Knoblauch 3-2, Yankees manager Joe Torre sent
Brosius. Knoblauch swung and missed, and Texas catcher Pudge
Rodriguez then rifled a throw to second, usually a no-no. Curtis
made a beeline for the plate while Brosius stopped dead in his
tracks. Curtis crossed the plate before the Rangers could tag
Brosius out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute very well,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates
said. ``I'm not sure what happened. I don't know if Pudge looked
the runner back. I'm not sure where the breakdown was. I'll have to
look at the video.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on, it was a great pitchers' duel. The meat of the
Texas order _ Rusty Greer, Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark, and Rodriguez
_ were a combined 2 for 16, with putative MVP Gonzalez looking
positively helpless against Wells. Stottlemyre allowed only three
hits after the second, none threatening, while limiting Jeter,
batting champion Bernie Williams, and Tino Martinez to one hit in
eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Wells labored through the seventh. In an epic duel, he fanned
Mike Simms to end the inning with runners on first and second. In
the eighth, he yielded a one-out double to Mark McLemore but caught
Roberto Kelly looking (another long battle), and then Jeter bailed
him out, just nipping Greer at first with an across-the-body
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you win,'' Oates saluted. ``You make those plays
day in and day out on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Yankees did in the regular season. Why stop now?

REAL ESTATE MARKET MAY BENEFIT FROM FED'S RATE CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut a key
interest rate by a quarter-point will likely further stimulate an
already hot real estate market, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage banking industry lowered its rates again last week
in anticipation of Tuesday's action by the Fed. The average rate
for a 30-year fixed mortgage is now at 6.64 percent, its lowest
level in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   This should help keep home sales strong through the fall, which
is when the market typically slows down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there will be much of a drop,'' said Randy
Willox, executive vice president at suburban Calabasas' Countrywide
Home Loans, the nation's biggest mortgage lender. ``September was a
very good month for us purchase-wise, and we think October and
November will be too. The rates are too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Countrywide's 30-year fixed rate was 6.34 percent
with one-eighth of a point and no origination fee.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cut also could encourage homeowners to refinance. The
rule of thumb is that homeowners should consider a refi if they can
save 1 percentage point and plan on staying in their home for at
least five more years.
</P>
<P>
   Realtors also thought the Fed's quarter-point rate reduction
would be good for business. Several said that sales started to
slack off at the beginning of the month but should perk up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to help us have an end-of-the-year sales
volume that's going to be extremely high,'' said Roger Hance,
president of R.R. Gable Real Estate Group in suburban Northridge.
``It's extremely positive for the real estate market.''

SETTLEMENT ENDS STAGEHANDS' STRIKE AT THE APOLLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A strike that shut down the Apollo Theater in Harlem
for five weeks ended Tuesday after management signed a one-year
contract with the newly formed bargaining unit that represents the
theater's stagehands.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the contract, the stagehands, who are paid
$15 to $20 an hour, will get a 5 percent wage increase. For the
first time, the employees will receive extra pay for overtime and
holidays and receive retirement and health benefits, said officials
of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   The theater's 34 stagehands, who are responsible for lighting,
audio and technical operations at the theater, approved the
agreement on Friday, said James J. Claffey Jr., the business
manager for Local 1 and the leader of the organizing drive.
</P>
<P>
   Claffey said that he would have preferred a two-year contract,
but that the Apollo Theater Foundation, which manages the
state-owned theater, wanted a shorter term.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, the chairman of the nonprofit
foundation, was in Puerto Rico on Tuesday and could not be reached
for comment, but his office confirmed that an agreement had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman did sign the labor agreement,'' said James
Capel, Rangel's chief assistant. ``He took an active role in making
sure that this happened, because of his longtime role in
association with organized labor. He believes that these people
should have these benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the striking workers had criticized Rangel during the
walkout, saying that he had initially recognized their union but
then turned the negotiations over to a lawyer who took a much
tougher line. The lawyer, Darrell Gay, did not return telephone
calls for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stagehands walked off the job on Aug. 24, just days before
Inner City Broadcasting Co. was scheduled to tape 12 episodes of
the television show ``It's Showtime at the Apollo.''
</P>
<P>
   The taping never took place, Claffey said. The theater also
canceled its weekly Amateur Night performances.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Tuesday when the theater's operations would
resume. An assistant to Grace Blake, the executive director of the
foundation, said that Ms. Blake had not been told of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Showtime at the Apollo'' is at the center of a state
investigation of the relationship between the Apollo Theater
Foundation and Inner City Broadcasting, the company that produces
the program. The state attorney general's office is trying to
determine whether the foundation allowed Inner City, which is owned
by Percy Sutton, a close friend of Rangel, to underpay the
foundation for the chance to tape the show at the theater.

TONI HOUSE, 55, JOURNALIST AND PRESS OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Wash., Md.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Toni House, an author and a longtime Washington
journalist who spent the last 16 years as the Supreme Court's
public information officer, died here Tuesday of lung cancer, the
court announced. She was 55.
</P>
<P>
   A former president of the Washington Press Club and officer of
other press organizations, Ms. House was a Washington institution
even before Chief Justice Warren Burger hired her for the anomalous
position of press officer for an institution that often appeared to
have an aversion to press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter and editor for The Washington Star for 15 years,
Ms. House had won visibility and success covering the District of
Columbia Police Department and local courts, one of the few women
at the time to work that beat. With a co-author, Chuck Conconi, she
wrote ``The Washington Sting,'' a book about an undercover police
fencing operation she had covered in the early 1970s. She was
deputy picture editor of The Star when the newspaper ceased
publication in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court's public information officer, Ms. House was
the court's public voice, although not, as she often stressed, its
interpreter. ``From the city that brought you the word
`spinmeister,' I am not one,'' she told the Atlanta Lawyers Club in
a speech several years ago, adding, ``I mean, if you don't like a
Supreme Court decision, who are you going to appeal to?''
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, she served on the board of the
American Judicature Society, a public interest group that strives
to increase public understanding of legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Aiello House _ she used the name Toni all her life _
was born on Jan. 5, 1943, in Washington, where her father was a
doctor. She graduated from American University here and lived in
Arlington, Va., with her husband, William Weller, whom she married
in 1990. Besides Weller, she is survived by a daughter from an
earlier marriage, Valerie Reuther of Seattle, and a brother, Dr.
Homer House of Sherwood, Md.

PETTITTE WORKS THROUGH SEASON OF STRUGGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
UPDATES 
 
By KATHY KUDRAVI 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although Andy Pettitte struggled all year, including
an un-Pettitte like 1-3 September, New York Yankees manager Joe
Torre had no qualms about starting him in today's Game 2 of the
Division Series against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff is as good now as it has been this season,'' Torre
said. ``I think the common thread is Andy striving for perfection
all the time and never really being satisfied with what he sees. We
may be satisfied, and we have been satisfied, especially over the
past three or four performances...
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect game is probably the only way he'll be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Rangers once this season, Pettitte allowed seven hits
in a 6-4 victory Aug. 14 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte tried working through his problems by focusing on one
part of his pitching in each start. And work with Yankees coaches
helped rebuild Pettitte's confidence to the point that his relief
appearance against Tampa Bay on Sept. 25 was comfortable for the
left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's been one of my problems whenever I've been
struggling the last month or so. I really don't know what the
problem was,'' said Pettitte, who is from Deer Park. ``I've been up
here four years and really haven't struggled until now. But I don't
get down on myself; it's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for Pettitte's struggles this season
could be that he has been buzzed by several balls hit right back at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more mental than anything,'' he said. ``Every time the
ball comes, you flinch more, and it can definitely affect you. I
didn't feel like it was, but maybe I was trying to finish in a
better fielding position.''

ADVERTISING: CAMPAIGN PROMOTES FUNNY SKIES OF DELTA EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Mo., N.C., N.Y., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humor is not a common element in airline advertising. Maybe that
is because so many travelers these days find nothing funny about
flying. Nonetheless, Delta Air Lines is using humor as the central
element in the first television campaign for its low-fare airline,
Delta Express.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which begins Thursday, parodies the classic
marketing technique, seen most often in packaged-goods advertising,
of secretly switching products on unsuspecting consumers and then
showing the results in commercials that use footage from hidden
cameras. The initial television commercial is by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
in New York, the agency for Delta and Delta Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta in the past has not done much with humor,'' said
Paulette Corbin, managing director for Delta Express in Atlanta.
``We took a look at our competition and all of their advertising,
and we pushed the envelope to try to make the ads humorous and
attention-grabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowded field against which Delta Express competes includes
airlines like Southwest, Kiwi and Airtran. Delta Express, which
will celebrate its second anniversary Thursday, flies to
destinations in Florida from cities including Albany, Boston and
Cleveland, serving 22 U.S. cities in all.
</P>
<P>
   The secret product switch is a time-tested tactic that has been
used for selling anything from soft drinks to detergents. Perhaps
the best-known campaign to employ the device was for the Folgers
coffee brand sold by Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. Commercials by what is
now N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in New York, part of MacManus Group,
showed the reactions of diners at fancy restaurants when told they
were drinking Folgers instant coffee rather than freshly brewed
ground coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Express commercial mimics the Folgers campaign in many
ways. The spot begins with an announcer whispering into a
microphone: ``We've secretly replaced this discount airline with
Delta Express to Florida. Let's go aboard, shall we?''
</P>
<P>
   As the announcer boards the plane, passengers ooh and aah over
Delta Express features. ``Wow, reserved seats!'' a man exclaims,
while a boy exudes, ``Whoa, a jet engine!'' The announcer then
asks, ``What if I told you this was really a Delta Express
flight?'' A woman is pleased because, she says, ``We get Delta Sky
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcer concludes, with corny, old-time advertising
enthusiasm: ``That's right! With Delta Express you really can fly
for less and still get that rich, full-bodied experience. But don't
take our word for it.'' A passenger proclaims, ``It's fab-ulous.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial ends with another announcer, a woman, asserting
that ``Delta Express is the difference between an inexpensive seat
and a cheap seat.'' That sentiment also appears at the bottom of
print ads.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is the third initiative for Delta from Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, since the agency was
awarded the Delta account in March 1997. Delta spends an estimated
$100 million a year on advertising; spending for the Delta Express
campaign was estimated at more than $1 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Humor, when used effectively, can be a great way to capture
viewers' attention,'' said Roger Rowe, executive vice president and
executive creative director on the Delta Air Lines account at
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, humor is particularly appropriate because it
captures the pleasant experience we promise on all Delta Express
flights,'' he said. ``Plus, it helps create a brand personality
that differentiates Delta Express from other low-cost airlines.''
(Though of course Southwest has long used humor as a selling tool,
particularly during its flights: pilots are known to tell jokes
over the public address system, and flight attendants engage in
zany banter with passengers, sometimes even dressing in costumes.)
</P>
<P>
   The commercial will run in such markets as Kansas City; Albany
and Buffalo, N.Y.; and Raleigh and Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the print ads that are part of the campaign, Delta Express is
compared to an off-price retailer. A label with the words ``Delta
Express'' in place of a clothing brand is shown above this
headline: ``Designer label. Discount price.'' The ad will appear in
newspapers in cities including Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Two radio commercials, which are similar to the television spot,
will run in markets including Cleveland; Nashville, Tenn.; and
Syracuse, N.Y.

WHERE VOICES STAKE A CLAIM TO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (About New York)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes, Mary Marshall Clark hears voices while
working in her office atop Butler Library at Columbia University.
She doesn't shame them into silence with a shush. They're
reassuring, even if they are in her head.
</P>
<P>
   She has not gone stack-wacky. The voices are also on tapes
stored in hundreds of boxes and among volumes of transcripts, part
of the university's Oral History Research Office Collection, which
celebrates its 50th anniversary next week.
</P>
<P>
   The university calls it the world's largest, with 15,000 hours
of interviews with the famous and obscure that are studied and
treasured by historians, writers, pop culture mavens and broadcast
producers.
</P>
<P>
   They include a history of American artisans, documentation on
how AIDS patients changed the course of medical treatment and a
history of the Black Panthers. The 7,000 interviews are
cross-referenced so you can choose, for example, an interview in
which Lauren Bacall talks about Humphrey Bogart or Adlai Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late at night, in this room there are 7,000 voices talking to
each other,'' said Ms. Clark, the archive's associate director. ``I
can get up and see the 55 places where Thurgood Marshall was
discussed. It's a gigantic conversation happening here all the
time. That's the closest thing to a collective memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection was started in 1948 to create an archive that
would be a record of the affairs of ``great men,'' and not of the
current salacious variety of presidential shenanigans. The idea was
to document the decision-making process in the words of the people
who made the decisions. Technology and time had thwarted that kind
of record-keeping, though, since people were talking on phones and
not keeping diaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Great Men Thinking Deep Thoughts About Big Stuff
approach was challenged during the 1960s, as scholars in the field
extended their microphones and questions to women, members of
racial minorities and regular people who were equally part of
history. Small things, after all, sometimes lead to big changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an idea that some people have no history,'' said
Ronald Grele, the archive's director. ``It's a distortion of their
lives, carrying with it an implication that these people are
history-less. That they are less than historical. People live in
history and do historic things.''
</P>
<P>
   Grele is not a psychoanalyst, although he does interviews on the
development of analysis. But he and his colleagues are seeking the
details of a life story and how it emerges through memories and
contradictions that form even a public figure's persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in the end of the story,'' Grele said.
``That's when you die, probably. I'm interested in the tension you
face in recreating yourself as something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. CLARK recalled an interview she did with Bella Abzug after
Ms. Abzug had left office, when she asked her when she became a
feminist. ``I was born a feminist,'' Ms. Abzug answered,
characteristically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I asked her why she ran for Congress,'' Ms. Clark said.
``Her face changed and became serene. `Well, I was deep sea
diving,' she said. She went through this long explanation that
there was nothing like deep sea diving, where she was totally calm
and serene and allowed to think and be like she was nowhere else.
That's when she decided to run for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   That introspective moment contrasted sharply with the feminist
pioneer who had been unkindly portrayed in the press as pushy, loud
and unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took time to deconstruct the way the media had constructed
her own identity,'' Ms. Clark said. ``We looked at how she saw
herself before all that attention. But that attention was also how
she constructed that public persona and that affected her own
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Grele sees a uniquely American quality surfacing in many of the
interviews. It is a democratic force, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can change and break boundaries, even though it comes at a
cost,'' he said. ``There is in American culture a very strong
ideology that you will change. That you will become a different
person.''
</P>
<P>
   And you will have a story, even if it's hard to get to, Ms.
Clark said. A few years ago, she helped a local nursery school
start a project on memories of babyhood. One boy insisted he
couldn't recall anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you remember anything?'' Ms. Clark nudged him. ``He
said: `There's one thing. I used to lie down a lot.' Everybody has
a story.''

L.A. MAYOR HELPED UNITE CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Bradley, who as the city's longest-serving mayor guided Los
Angeles through a dramatic transformation and some of its most
difficult moments, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Texas sharecroppers who became a Los Angeles
policeman, Bradley rose to political power in the 1960s as racial
tensions gripped the country. He was elected mayor in 1973 and
served five terms before retiring in 1993, a year after Los Angeles
was swept by racially charged rioting.
</P>
<P>
   During his 20 years in office, Bradley put together an enduring
coalition of business and labor that crossed ethnic lines while
overseeing the dramatic birth of the downtown skyline and the
subway as well as expansion of LAX and the harbor, opening Los
Angeles to international trade.
</P>
<P>
   An imposing 6 feet, 4 inches tall, Bradley became an
internationally recognized figure when Los Angeles hosted the
Olympics in 1984. He was the first African-American elected mayor
of Los Angeles and the first nominated by a major party to run for
governor of California, losing to George Deukmejian in 1982 and
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Tributes to Bradley poured in from around the country Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a builder, bringing a remarkably successful Olympic
Games to Los Angeles, encouraging a thriving downtown and improving
mass transit,'' President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who succeeded Bradley, called it a sad
day for the city but also a reason to celebrate Bradley's
accomplishments during his 50 years of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Watts Riot in the '60s, Tom Bradley came into office
and united a city that was divided,'' Riordan told the City
Council. ``He has left a great legacy for all Angelenos, from the
Olympics to the skyline to diversity that's united.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley died at 9 a.m. at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Los
Angeles, after he had apparently suffered a heart attack an hour
earlier, officials said. He had been in the hospital for about a
week undergoing tests.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bradley suffered a heart attack and a
debilitating stroke after undergoing a triple coronary bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite difficulty walking and talking, Bradley began to make
public appearances, and his face would light up when he saw
familiar figures.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said tentative plans called for Bradley to lie in
state Monday at First AME Church, 2270 S. Harvard Blvd., Los
Angeles. Funeral services were tentatively set for Tuesday. Further
details will be released this week.
</P>
<P>
   To most, Bradley came to epitomize the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 29, 1917, one of seven children of Texan cotton
sharecroppers, Bradley came to Los Angeles with his parents when he
was 7.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, he defied expectations and dealt with
racism and with political enemies with stoic dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Los Angeles public schools, Bradley won a
scholarship to University of California, Los Angeles, where he
became a track star.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Los Angeles Police Department, patrolling some of
the meanest streets in the city and rising to the rank of
lieutenant _ the highest post then ever attained by an
African-American. He went to law school in his spare time, as his
political ambitions began to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley drew his political support from the community, making
appearances at block meetings and in the churches. In 1963, he was
elected to the City Council where he was the second
African-American to serve on the body and the first to be elected
outright. Councilman Gilbert Lindsay had been appointed the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he offered was to articulate a vision for Los Angeles,''
said Ray Remy, one of several deputy mayors who served Bradley as
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Bradley was a symbol for urban cities across the country.
He was so liked and respected that you couldn't go anywhere in the
country without people coming up to him to meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Richard Lichtenstein said Bradley was
unique for having healed racial wounds that had crippled Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who bridged communities at a very difficult time
in the city's history, coming after the Watts Riot,'' Lichtenstein
said. ``East meets west, north meets south. The city came together
under Bradley. You look at some of his accomplishments and it's
incredible. This guy had a vision and he delivered on it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ All-star benefit concerts are often poorly organized,
long-winded affairs in which the talent is pulled out of a grab bag
and a restless audience longs for a director's blue pencil. That's
why ``My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies,'' a first-class
industrial show (for Continental Airlines) at Carnegie Hall on
Monday evening that also raised $50,000 for two AIDS charities,
came as a happy (and occasionally thrilling) surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, which brought out the cream of younger Broadway
leading ladies, along with such veterans as Elaine Stritch, Dorothy
Loudon and Liza Minnelli (in sad vocal disrepair), kept the remarks
to a minimum and the pace swift. The radiant hostess, Julie
Andrews, told one sparkling anecdote about working with Moss Hart
on ``My Fair Lady,'' and that was it for the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the evening, the singers, accompanied by a
well-rehearsed theater orchestra led by Paul Gemignani, offered a
fast-moving succession of star turns that ranged from the polished
to the dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   Women on Broadway have tended to fall into two types: brash
personality voices (Ethel Merman, Carol Channing) and semioperatic
ingenues (Ms. Andrews, Barbara Cook), with many shadings in
between. Generalizing about '90s leading ladies in comparison with
their predecessors, you might say that the personalities today
aren't as broad as they used to be, while on the semioperatic end,
the singing has technically improved, as frilly girlish voices have
given way to a fuller, more natural soprano tone.
</P>
<P>
   The one performer on Monday who seemed to embody everything that
is best about contemporary Broadway singing was the remarkable
Audra McDonald, who sang three numbers scattered throughout the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   In a version of Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg's ``Down With
Love,'' she accomplished the seemingly impossible, shading a rich
operatic voice into jazz and back without her singing sounding
affected or self-conscious. Delivering Jerry Herman's ``I've Never
Said I Love You,'' she wasn't afraid to break the rules of vocal
decorum to convey a bursting passion.
</P>
<P>
   Some other high points: Jennifer Holliday, elaborately coiffed
and unrecognizably slimmed down from her ``Dreamgirls'' days,
delivered a polished, sinuously jazzy ``If He Walked into My Life''
that found her working confidently far outside the growling and
grinding pop-gospel style that made her famous. (Later in the show,
her toned down ``And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going'' was less
successful.)
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ziemba, lithe and twinkling, joined a chorus line of 16
Rockettes in ``I Want to Be a Rockette,'' from the still-unproduced
Alan Menken-Tom Eyen musical ``Kicks.'' Rebecca Luker's sweet,
full-toned ``Falling in Love With Love'' was as flawlessly
delivered a traditional-style performance of the Rodgers and Hart
standard as you could hope to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests who re-enacted their Broadway show stoppers
were Faith Prince (``Adelaide's Lament''), Lea DeLaria (her
iconoclastic, bebop-flavored ``I Can Cook, Too''), Andrea McArdle
(now grown-up and glamorous, singing ``Tomorrow''), Linda Eder (a
Barbra Streisand-like ``Someone Like You''), Ms. Loudon (``Fifty
Percent'') and finally Ms. Stritch (a blistering, harshly funny
``The Ladies Who Lunch'').
</P>
<P>
   Producers and directors of future all-star concerts take note:
This is how it is done.

LOS ANGELES: ``on it.'' As racial tension seized the nation, Los Angeles erupted in 1965
with the Watts Riots. Bradley, like other city officials, stood by
helplessly watching the city burn.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It prompted him four years later to take a major step and
challenge Mayor Sam Yorty in what was to become a bitter, racially
divisive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lost but he did not lose his mayoral ambition, and he
used the four intervening years to build a coalition of minorities
and liberals that would serve to keep him in office for five terms
_ a record that will not be broken because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the 1973 mayoral election, Bradley became a national
figure as the first minority candidate to be elected in a white
majority city in America.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley sought to ease the fears of downtown
business leaders and began an aggressive program to modernize and
build up the city where, at the time, the tallest building was City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first elected, the city was deteriorating,''
Bradley said in the interview. ``It was dying at its heart.
Downtown Los Angeles was dead. Businesses were leaving in droves.
The infrastructure was deteriorating. And I made a commitment to
revitalize the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only revitalized downtown, we built a skyline _
something we never had. We established the importance of downtown
Los Angeles to the entire city.''
</P>
<P>
   That work included the creation of the Community Redevelopment
Agency, remodeling of Los Angeles International Airport, and
actively seeking federal funds for a variety of programs, including
the now much-beleaguered subway system.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Joe Cerrell credited Bradley with turning
Los Angeles into an international city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here since 1951 and there was a time that
everything _ everything _ was based in San Francisco and the Bay
Area,'' Cerrell said. ``It was Tom Bradley who made Los Angeles as
important as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Bradley managed a city with a boom
economy. Even with cutbacks forced by the 1978 passage of
Proposition 13, he managed to continue or expand city programs.
</P>
<P>
   His focus on the downtown area would later be used against him
by opponents who said he had neglected needy areas of the city and
allowed unbridled growth at the expense of quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said he believed his accomplishments helped set the
stage for Los Angeles to capitalize on its location as the gateway
to the Pacific Rim and that many of the city's problems could be
solved with the creation of jobs the development brought.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, Bradley had a new political ambition _ to be governor
of California. Easily winning the Democratic nomination, Bradley
went on to strongly challenge then-Attorney General Deukmejian. On
Election Day, Bradley actually collected more votes than
Deukmejian. But Deukmejian narrowly won due to an aggressive
Republican effort in getting absentee ballots to supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bradley would again challenge Deukmejian, but
lost by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   In between those defeats, Bradley oversaw what later he would
call his shining moment _ the 1984 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very special event,'' Bradley said. ``It was
literally a once-in-a-lifetime experience. What happened with the
magic of that event was unreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had policemen more concerned with trading Olympic pins than
stopping crime, because there was no crime. Crime took a holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   What was particularly fulfilling was that he and the city had
defied the experts and were able to stage an Olympic Games that
turned a profit even with the Soviet Union boycotting the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after the Russians pulled out, when people finally
realized the Games were going on, they said, We're going on,''
Bradley said. ``And then we had the torch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of that torch run captivated people and we had the
spotlight of the whole world focused on Los Angeles for those 16
days.''
</P>
<P>
   There were low points, too.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1989 campaign, Bradley was accused of financial
improprieties by accepting $20,000 in consulting fees from Far East
National Bank while it was seeking and receiving city deposits.
Bradley would later return the money and pay a $20,000 fine for
failing to fully disclose his finances, but he was cleared of any
criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two years of investigating by the FBI, the police, the
city attorney ... everyone and when it was all over, these
investigative bodies found just as I said _ there was no
impropriety,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the city again erupted into violence following the
acquittal of four police officers in the Rodney King beating in
Lake View Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked, saddened by it,'' Bradley said. ``We had a good
strategy to work with the community. We knew people would express
themselves, but we tried to contain it to verbal expressions. We
had people set to walk the neighborhoods to calm people. The rage
was understandable, the violence wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Years after that violence, Bradley said he continued to believe
the riots developed because police failed to respond immediately to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of the police to deploy their personnel and stifle
the incipient looting and burning that took place in the early
stages permitted it to get out of hand,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But through all the ups and downs, Bradley remained an
indomitable spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a day when I regret any one thing I've done,'' he
once said. ``This has been the greatest experience, the greatest
satisfaction, anyone could ever know.''

REGULAR-GUY WELLS MAKES RANGERS HITTERS LOOK ORDINARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wells may be the only Yankees star who can
actually disappear in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He peels off his double-X pinstripes, which can barely contain
that bulging body anyway, and suddenly he's the ordinary Joe at the
end of the bar, chin dripping grease from a double-cheeseburger,
ordering a shot and a beer and maybe a round for the house.
</P>
<P>
   Or he's the guy behind the counter, once-white apron stained and
dingy, pulling down a tall, foamy mug of brew, and swiping a wet
rag over the bar with a beefy arm before sending it sliding down to
a thirsty customer.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he's the dusty truck driver, just rolling in the door
after a long haul, so tired even his tattoos are aching.
</P>
<P>
   There was no disappearing act in Wells' repertoire last night,
though.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee's Round Mound of Frown, author of the most dominating
pitching performance of the 1998 season, pitched the Yankees to a
2-0 victory against the Rangers in Game 1 of the Division Series in
front of a raucous sellout crowd at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss makes a victory tonight by Rick Helling and the Rangers
imperative. They cannot afford to limp home to Texas, down 0-2 to
the Yanks in a best-of-five series, if they harbor any hope of
playing beyond the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers insisted that Yankees manager Joe Torre was playing
right into the Rangers' hands by starting Wells last night and Andy
Pettitte tonight in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat after me: The Rangers KILL left-handers. They eat 'em for
breakfast, hot off the griddle, like fresh flapjacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers led the majors with a .316 average off southpaw
chunkers. Left-handed starters were a pug-ugly 12-23 with a 6.49
earned-run average in 48 regular-season starts against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What could Torre possibly be thinking, sending a ``left-hander''
out to face the likes of right-handed power hitters Gonzalez,
Rodriguez, Kelly, Zeile and Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this wasn't just any left-hander. This was the Wells
who coughed up a seven-run lead against the Rangers in the first
week in May, then shut them out the next time he saw them.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 250-pound lover of hard rock who last season
threatened to kick Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's butt all the
way down to the Bowery and back.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 35-year-old southpaw who just happened to throw the
first regular-season perfect game in Yankees history back on May 17
on the way to an 18-4 record as the anchor of the Yankees'
spectacular starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Until Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa turned Roger Maris' home-run
record into jelly, that was the most fitting signature moment of
this wild and wacky season, a perfect game from the most imperfect
source.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Yankees last season, Wells has gone 34-14, and
his stock has soared with Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a battler now,'' Torre said. ``Now, when he's running on
fumes or doesn't have his good stuff, he finds a way to get people
out; he finds a way to stay in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   You saw him last night, an unkempt hulk of a man, the top button
of his jersey undone, his shirttail flapping, his grizzled
double-chin sagging, mesmerizing the Rangers' hitters with soft,
off-speed pitches outside and hard fastballs in on their fists when
they began leaning across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty he isn't, but he could run for mayor of New York City
today and Rudolph Giuliani, popular as he may be, would be out on
his ear in a Manhattan minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up. Gonzalez, Rodriguez, Kelly, Zeile and Simms? A
combined 2-for-18. Two measly singles. Five red faces.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' eight innings were marked by the Rangers' consistently
ineffectual hacks. They didn't get a ball out of the infield until
there were two out in the third. They didn't get their first hit
until Rusty Greer singled off shortstop Derek Jeter's glove in the
fourth. They never pushed a runner past second base and only got
that far twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has been a team that really gives me problems,'' Wells
said after running his shutout string against the Rangers to 19
innings. ``I have to study the (video) tapes hard when I face them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so complete and they have so many great hitters, I
have to keep them off balance. I just go out there, stay focused
and try to make good pitches. If my game is on, not too many teams
are going to score a lot of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his eight superb innings, Wells gave up five hits, walked one
and struck out nine. The Rangers actually seemed relieved when
flame-throwing Mariano Rivera came on for the ninth. Three outs
later, it was mercifully over.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of it is that the Rangers wasted Todd Stottlemyre's
scrappy six-hitter. They came here believing that if they could get
good pitching, they could win.
</P>
<P>
   But if they thought that's all it would take to make the Yankees
disappear, they'd best reconsider.

WHAT A WASTE! RANGERS BLOW A GREAT CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bats are never forever. Over the course of a baseball
season, they come, they go. Maybe you've heard: Good pitching will
cause wood to rot.
</P>
<P>
   For the '98 Rangers, of course, the bats have beaten the
percentages. This is a team that, over the six-month long haul,
finally rode a load of timber into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, however.
</P>
<P>
   The ride just got real short. It's either hit now or trudge
quietly into winter.
</P>
<P>
   The second-worst thing that happened to the Rangers here last
night was the brilliant shutout pitching by New York's David Wells.
The absolute negative, however, was that no run support wasted a
gutty eight innings from Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   A shock-the-world upset for the Rangers in this playoff series
is dependent upon stellar rotation work. They got it in Game 1, and
still didn't cash, falling, 2-0, to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief five-game series, that simply can't happen. It did,
and now the Rangers are in an early hole that wasn't exactly
unexpected, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical loss; any loss is critical in a short
series,'' said Rangers hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo in a
somber postgame clubhouse. ``Then again, we didn't exactly come
into this thing not expecting to see good pitching from the
Yankees. They didn't win 114 games without good pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we tip our hats to Wells. He was outstanding. But we
also move on and build on what we faced tonight. Our bats tend to
bounce back in a hurry. Good hitters rebound, and we do have good
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for solving Wells, which is a very strong exception, the
Rangers had a solid postseason debut. Stottlemyre was scrambling,
particularly early, but he made clutch pitches and had clutch
defense behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly, starting in center field, reached high over the
fence in right-center to knock a home run back into play. Tino
Martinez settled for a double and was left stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Stottlemyre should have surrendered only one run, but
catcher Pudge Rodriguez brain-locked on a double steal in the
second inning. His throw to second, without checking Chad Curtis
back to third base, allowed Curtis to trot home with the second run
of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Wells never had to sweat the tying runs being in
scoring position. Actually, Wells never sweated much. The Rangers
had runners at first and second only once in the game, and that
left Mike Simms with a two-out chance in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Simms had a great at-bat against Wells,'' said
Jaramillo. Wells had to use nine pitches on Simms after jumping
ahead 0-2 in the count. At 3-and-2, and with the runners moving,
Simms was suckered by a curveball, and fanned.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout by Wells in Game 1 created an unpleasant flashback
for the Rangers. Two years ago, in an entertaining and tight
playoff series with the Yankees, only Juan Gonzalez provided any
offensive muscle. Juan had a headline series with five homers and
nine RBI in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, however, Gonzalez was a weak 0-for-4, not that a
weak 0-for-4 was anything unusual in the Rangers' batting order.
Juan had three shots at Wells, including a runner at second in the
first inning and a runner on in the fourth, but the ball never left
the infield.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a foul pop to the catcher in the seventh was his
``longest'' blow. Otherwise, Gonzalez struck out and topped a pitch
two feet in front of the plate. Leading off the ninth against
closer Mariano Rivera, he flied out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want is for Juan to think it's either him or
we sink,'' said manager Johnny Oates. ``Juan can't do this alone,
and he hasn't this season. As great as he is, he's got to have help
from the rest of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Help never arrived against Wells. So without any other option,
the Rangers now have to fall back on the obvious crutch: They came
in here to win one of the first two games of the series. That is
still possible tonight against another Yankees left-hander, Andy
Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   The fact still remains, however, that Stottlemyre gave the
Rangers exactly what they needed in Game 1. That's why it's a loss
that makes them even a longer shot in this series.

NOWHERE TO RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The commitment was made when Ron Ponciano was
named head coach. Gun-slinging Cal StateNorthridge would run the
ball more often, create more balance on offense. Three games later
the philosophy remains intact, but the results aren't close to what
the Matadors expected.
</P>
<P>
   So after running for 59 yards on 37 carries in last week's win
against Eastern Washington, an evaluation of the running game took
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nowhere where it needs to be. It lags big-time,'' CSUN
offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie said after Tuesday's practice.
``We're looking at our last three games and seeing what Melvin
(Blue) does best and focusing our running game on those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to show a little multiplicity in the running game
and hopefully keep people a little bit softer by letting (wide
receiver Anthony) Ramos touch the ball. We're kind of isolating
what Melvin does. Averaging (less than 100) yards per game with a
potential NFL back is horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   With the detail paid to the running game in spring practice and
training camp, CSUN figured it would be better. Instead, the three
yards and a cloud of dust has been chopped to measly 2.2 yards per
carry, creating far too many third-and-long situations for a strong
passing game that ranks third in the Big Sky at 276 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, despite being 2-1 heading into Saturday's
nonconference game with Southern Utah, are less successful running
the ball this season than in their pass-happy days. They are
seventh in the nine-team Big Sky Conference in rushing at 99.7
yards per game and last with two rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a small improvement so far and we're only getting
better,'' Ponciano said. ``If you look, the only people that have
beaten (Big Sky power) Montana is people that have run the ball
well. Therefore, to beat the upper-echelon teams in any division,
you have to run the ball. We need to put some plays in there to
enhance our ability to run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Blue, who might have become the first collegian to set a
goal of running for 3,000 yards in a season, is finding the going
very difficult between the tackles. The youthful offensive line is
creating very few holes, and Blue hasn't exhibited the necessary
acceleration to get through some of the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Blue'saveraging 80 yards per game, but at a workmanlike 3.2
yards per carry. However, the CSUN coaching staff does like the
toughness Blue's shown to this juncture. He ran for 77 yards
against Eastern Washington, but 40 of those came after the first
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blue admittedly runs the ball better with more work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we run the ball enough in the first half,'' said
the 6-foot, 230-pound Blue. ``I like beating up on the defense in
the first half, running them over. Then in the second half, the
holes are there. They're not going to want to tackle me the whole
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're not afraid, but I see them. They don't want
to keep hitting me, so they try to go low, and once they try to go
low, you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, even with the emphasis and importance placed on
running the ball, CSUN is averaging only 1.1 more yards per game on
the ground this season than the Matadors did a year ago. But CSUN
is running the ball 12 more times a game this year, though most of
that is Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaul Bradley (nine carries, 14 yards) is the only other CSUN
running back to carry the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked in this year's paltry running statistics is
the sack factor. In college statistics, sacks count as rushing
yards lost, and quarterback Marcus Brady has been sacked 13 times
for 108 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And that comes back to an inexperienced offensive line that
starts a pair of freshmen _ Tim Shoffeitt and Keith Kincaid _ on
the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all reps, really,'' Shoffeitt said. ``I think
when we do get to our potential, we should be No. 1 (in the
conference in rushing). We have the best running back in the
league. And we should have the best offensive line in the league
when we can get more reps.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Notes: &UR; !off! &LR;  CSUN kick returner Marcus Bivines pulled up
lame during conditioning drills and limped off the field with a leg
injury. Ponciano said he was unsure of Bivines' availability for
Saturday's game against Southern Utah. . . . After last Saturday's
win against Eastern Washington, Blue and former Utah State teammate
Bashir Levingston, who caught three touchdown passes, got together.
``He said, `You just can't stop me. You're just not fast enough,'
'' Blue said.

UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON OFFERS ASTROBIOLOGY DOCTORAL PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Scientists searching for life on other planets will
soon be able to earn a Ph.D. while they're at it.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington plans to launch the first doctoral
program in the country to focus on the emerging field of
astrobiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that there is a good possibility that life exists
in the solar system outside Earth,'' James Staley, a UW
microbiologist and the lead researcher for the new astrobiology
program, said Tuesday. ``If that life does exist it would be
microbial, not the higher forms.''
</P>
<P>
   To hunt down those microscopic extraterrestrial life forms, if
they exist, will require a marriage of the physical and life
sciences. The new program, which is being paid for with a 5-year,
$2 million grant from the National Science Foundation and a
$500,000 grant from the University, will draw together 11 different
disciplines ranging from astronomy to microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   Students will get their doctorates in one of those disciplines,
but it will include an endorsement noting an emphasis in
astrobiology. Students will take coursework in a variety of the
participating departments, depending on their research interests.
</P>
<P>
   The degree program, which will support about a dozen graduate
students beginning the fall quarter of 1999, will produce its first
full-fledged Ph.D.'s in five to six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most, but not all, researchers in this interdisciplinary field
`believe' that life has probably evolved elsewhere in the universe,
possibly even elsewhere in our own solar system,'' said Richard
Gammon, a professor of chemistry and oceanography at the UW, and
one of the scientists who wrote a financing proposal for the new
degree program.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely places to start looking for new life forms are
Mars, where there is evidence of water, and Europa, the icy moon of
Jupiter, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the discovery of fossil-like impressions in a Martian
meteorite two years ago, scientists have been captivated with the
notion that there is life out there, said Woody Sullivan, astronomy
professor and adjunct professor of the history of science at the
UW, who is a co-investigator in the astrobiology program.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of life no longer seems far-fetched, he said.
``Nature is often far cleverer than we can be in our imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientific belief in the possibility of microbial life on other
planets has been building since the recent discovery of novel
microorganisms that thrive in extreme environments, such as deep
ocean vents, hot springs, or pools of brine within polar sea ice.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA _ the molecule that carries the hereditary information
of living cells _ of those organisms suggests a very ancient
lineage, which means they may be precursors of advanced life on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have microbial systems on Earth that are good models for
those on Mars or Europa, and those systems are poorly studied,''
Staley said. Understanding those systems better could give
scientists clues for where to discover life on other planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just scraping around on Mars doesn't tell you much at all,''
said Sullivan. ``Ten to 15 years from now, we'd like to be able to
drill down pretty far under the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA is planning missions within two decades that would give
scientists the opportunity to bring back such samples, Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding life outside of Earth would help human beings understand
our own biology better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more different systems you know about, the better we can
understand our own,'' he said. Being able to learn about the
weather on Mars, for example, has contributed vastly to scientists'
understanding of weather on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true of life too,'' Sullivan said. ``If we could just
find one other example.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the past three years, astronomers have been able to
observe planets going around stars other than our own sun. The
discovery of those new solar systems has also fueled speculation
about life on those new planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so on ours,'' he said, ``why not on others?''

YANKEES HOLD GONZALEZ IN CHECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago he was being called ``Senor Octubre''.
Last night he was just another easy out in the Rangers lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, who drove in 157 runs for the Rangers this year
and terrorized the Yankees pitching staff in the 1996 playoffs, was
rendered ineffective by David Wells and Mariano Rivera in a 2-0
loss last night.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez went 0-for-4 with a strikeout, a far cry from his
7-for-16, five-home run performance in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of expectations from myself,'' Gonzalez said.
``But I'm only one player; there are eight others. I tried the best
I can between the lines. That's all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's first at-bat was his only one with a runner in
scoring position, and it symbolized his frustrating evening. He
tried to check his swing on a slow curve and tapped the ball out in
front of home plate. Before he realized what had happened, Yankees
catcher Jorge Posada was on the ball and throwing him out at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed hits with men on base,'' Gonzalez said. ``We didn't
get them. But we had no chance against Wells. He's one of the best
left-handers in the game, and he threw a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells took the approach that most pitchers do with Gonzalez:
slow curves and changeups, try to get him to chase something out of
the strike zone. After Rusty Greer reached on a one-out single in
the fourth, Wells struck out Gonzalez. He got him to foul out to
Posada in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make good pitches to all their hitters, especially
Juan,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's fourth at-bat came against Rivera, the Yankees'
closer, leading off the ninth. Gonzalez got the ball out of the
infield, but it was nothing more than a routine fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good at the plate,'' Gonzalez said. ``But what can you
say except Wells pitched a great game: good changeup, good curve,
threw strikes. We had no chance. But this game is history. Tomorrow
is another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said: ``Certainly we depend on Juan
a lot, but we have two other guys with 100 RBI, and another one
with 80. Certainly Juan is a big part, but he can't do it all.''

WELLS DOMINATES RANGERS IN SERIES OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-three times the Rangers sent a player from
their dugout to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   This recurring procession in Game 1 of their best-of-five,
American League Division Series with the Yankees resembled pigs _
no insult or disrespect intended _ being prepared for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   That's because left-hander David Wells reduced the Rangers'
powerful lineup to little more than bacon bits during New York's
2-0 victory Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wells surrendered only five hits and one walk through eight
innings before being replaced in favor of right-hander Mariano
Rivera, who retired the side in order _ including a game-ending
strikeout of catcher Ivan Rodriguez _ to complete the Yankees'
dominating pitching performance.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who pitched a six-hit shutout Aug. 21 in the Yankees' 5-0
victory at The Ballpark in Arlington, threw first-pitch strikes to
21 of 30 batters and unveiled a curveball without peer in his duel
with right-hander Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw strikes and probably had the best curveball I've ever
seen from him,'' said first baseman Will Clark, who collected one
of the Rangers' four singles. ``We had a lot of good at-bats, a lot
of 3-2 counts and a lot of hitter's counts, but _ as with
Stottlemyre _ every time he needed to a make a pitch, he threw a
hellacious pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre _ who allowed only 10 base runners during his
121-pitch, complete-game effort _ pitched well enough to win most
nights, but not on this night, with his father, Yankees pitching
coach Mel Stottlemyre, sitting in the opposing dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Not once while on the mound did Stottlemyre glance at his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the rest of my life to look at him. I didn't even
think about looking at him,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I love him
dearly, but I'll be damned if I was thinking about him. I was
thinking about the Yankees' hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' two-run second inning proved labor intensive for
Stottlemyre, who threw 27 pitches to five batters. The right-hander
threw first-pitch strikes to four of those, but designated hitter
Chili Davis, catcher Jorge Posada and second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch worked their plate appearances for full counts.
</P>
<P>
   Posada drew a one-out walk and advanced to third on an ensuing
double by left fielder Chad Curtis, whose drive to right field
eluded the glove of Juan Gonzalez after a lengthy chase.
</P>
<P>
   Posada scored three pitches later on a single by third baseman
Scott Brosius, the Yankees' No. 9 hitter with the .300 batting
average. Curtis advanced 90 feet and later scored on the series'
first mental blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre retired Knoblauch on strikes, but Brosius ran on the
3-2 pitch. Rodriguez threw to second base, but he erred by not
freezing Curtis with a glance toward third base. Second baseman
Mark McLemore took the throw, and Brosius stayed in the rundown
long enough for Curtis to cross the plate without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the sign for Pudge to look the runner back and throw
through,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I'm not sure what
happened, but we didn't execute well. Pudge made a good throw. I'm
just not sure if he looked the runner back or not. I'm not sure
where the breakdown was.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells did the rest and came through twice during the latter
innings with seventh- and eighth-inning strikeouts of designated
hitter Mike Simms and center fielder Roberto Kelly, respectively,
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crunch time,'' Wells said. ``I thrive on this kind of
stuff.''

<P>
   LOBBY-II (Washington) _ Second of two articles on lobbying: From
the nondescript headquarters of his Houston construction firm, Leo
E. Linbeck Jr., is masterminding a crusade to overturn the nation's
tax system. Once, someone like him might have hired some of
Washington's ``Gucci Gulch'' lobbyists to prowl the marble
corridors outside Congress's tax committees. But Linbeck, with
Texas-style audaciousness, wants to engineer a populist uprising.
While he and his fellow investors in ``Americans for Fair
Taxation'' are unusual in the scale of their ambition, their
methods have become commonplace as lobbying has undergone a
revolution over the past decade. Rarely now does a well-connected
Washington lobbyist work alone to persuade power brokers in
Congress. Instead, the lobbyist has become just one of many players
running full-fledged national campaigns designed to create a
``grass-roots'' groundswell in support, or more often in
opposition, to legislation before Congress. By Alison Mitchell.

bellwether, a place that votes as America does for president, that
swung to the Republican presidents during the 1980s and to Clinton
in the 1990s, and from extensive interviewing here it is clear that
people still support the president. And while they are most
dramatically divided along party lines, they are also split in more
subtle ways. Just as there is a division between Americans living
inside and outside the Washington Beltway, there is a split here in

cut interest rates on Tuesday, almost nobody cheered. To stock

are as low as or lower than short-term rates. By Gretchen

PLAYOFFS START AND ALL WE GET IS MR. PEANUT

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Usually, as in since 1995, the baseball postseason has
presented Seattle with some pretty interesting autumn days.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the good ol' Yankees stop by for a little fifth-game,
winner-take-all, 11-inning engagement. Or that nice team from
Cleveland, the one with Omar and Mike Jackson, shows up for some
American League Championship Series contests.
</P>
<P>
   Once _ it was just last October _ Cal Ripken, Mike Mussina and
Eric Davis came through as the Orioles won two big ones in front of
monstrous Kingdome crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Seattle was starting to get hooked on the special taste of
the baseball postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was not one of those special days in Seattle. The
Yankees got the Rangers. Cleveland got Big Mo Vaughn and the Red
Sox. The Astrodome was all abuzz with the promise of Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle got Johnny Bench and Mr. Peanut.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer and the world's most famous goober made a
special appearance at F.X. McRory's. The Pioneer Square restaurant
turns hot spot whenever a big baseball game is going on across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was no such day. Bench and Mr. Peanut were in town
simply to conduct a search for the Most Valuable Peanut Seller in
all of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our postseason,'' said Rick the Peanut Man _ the
Kingdome's most famous vendor who is as dismayed as any Mariner fan
that autumn will be dead silent in Seattle while a 1998 postseason
that all but screams, ``Can You Top This?'' is played out in other
baseball cities.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the fact that the M's were not part of the postseason
accounted for the quiet lunchtime crowd at McRory's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell no one's into baseball around here right now,''
Bench said, trying to keep things lively as he conducted the upbeat
contest for the Most Valuable Peanut Seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they pay you to do a job, you've got to go out and do your
all,'' said Bench, who joked with contestants, signed autographs
and said he was not jealous that former Big Red Machine teammate
Joe Morgan was calling games for ESPN while Bench was hawking
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Peanuts, like baseball, is a cause that the Hall of Fame catcher
is passionate about ``because peanuts have always been a part of my
life,'' Bench said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From working in the peanut factories as a kid in Oklahoma, to
all my years spent in ballparks. I've seen some very talented
vendors who, just like ballplayers, work hard at their profession
and have a loyal fan following.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bench was pretty passionate during the lunchtime contest,
which was in full swing just as the Red Sox were wrapping up an
11-3 whipping of Cleveland, and just as Randy Johnson was trying to
keep up with San Diego's Kevin Brown, who turned in an awesome
16-strikeout win over the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   With playoff action kicking off in Houston, Cleveland and New
York, the TV is the only way Seattleites can get a look at the
other lucky teams and the other lucky cities who get to keep this
Mark McGwire/Sammy Sosa home-run-derby season going into late
October.
</P>
<P>
   The TV is the place where Mariner fans can look up and remember
when, in '95, it was Johnson and the M's who pounded the Angels in
that one-game playoff that brought Seattle its first American
League West championship.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that '95 experience that made any good Mariner fan
look at Cubs third baseman Gary Gaetti and think:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. That seems so familiar. The journeyman infielder
belts a homer to become the unlikely hero of the Cubs' win over San
Francisco, just like Luis Sojo ripped that hit down the line that
drove in all those Mariner runs to beat Mark Langston and those
swooning Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like the postseason, if you're in it,'' Bench
said Tuesday, after Bench crowned Rick the Peanut Man the MV Peanut
Seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different smell. Whole different feeling.
Everybody else is in a better mood. The Yankees won 114 games this
season. They could lose in five games to the Rangers and it's over.
That's the thing about the postseason. It's 0-0,'' Bench said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year I was MVP of the World Series, I didn't have a great
season. I was coming off surgery in '76, but when we got to the
playoffs it was a different story. I went about .400 in the
playoffs and .545 in the World Series. You just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the '98 Mariners, as for Seattle, we have reached the end
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our postseason,'' Rick the Peanut Man said, clutching
his MV Peanut Seller first-prize check for $500 and a round-trip
ticket to New York where, on Oct. 7, Rick ``The Peanut Man''
Kaminski will compete for the national peanut-seller title against
winners from nine other cities.
</P>
<P>
   How sad is it that the M's and Seattle are left out of the
postseason? How mad are some of the diehard baseball lovers?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wound up paying Heathcliff Slocumb $1 million per save,''
said Rick the Peanut Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of customers this season saying, `Let the Peanut
Man pitch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those Mariner fans were on to something. For now, Rick
the Peanut Man is the only one left playing.

MARINERS PICK UP OPTION TO BRING MARTINEZ BACK FOR 13TH SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The welfare of friends and family have been on his
mind, with Hurricane Georges raging through his native Puerto Rico.
So has impending knee surgery. But Edgar Martinez had one less
worry Tuesday when the Mariners picked up the option year on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will pay Martinez $3.5 million to return for a 13th
season in Seattle, assuring the two-time American League batting
champion of a chance to play at new Safeco Field, which opens next
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be back,'' the 35-year-old designated hitter
said. ``It's a lot of peace of mind to know I'm going to be with
the team. It is the only team I've played with. I'd like to keep it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In this age of transient big-leaguers, only four active players
have played longer with the same team _ Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr.
(18 years), San Diego's Tony Gwynn (17), Anaheim's Chuck Finley
(13) and Cincinnati's Barry Larkin (13).
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slow start this season, Martinez left the club with
little choice but to re-sign him by hitting .322 with 46 doubles,
29 home runs and 102 RBIs. It marked the seventh time in nine full
seasons in the majors that he has finished above .300.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners told Martinez a week ago they would pick up his
option, but, because of club policy, waited until the season ended
to announce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pretty easy decision to keep this guy around,''
said Woody Woodward, vice president of baseball operations. ``I can
honestly tell you I figured Edgar would hit .280 to .300. That's
been his history.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, that's going to slow down, but I don't think
we'll see it next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez briefly mulled retirement after the 1997 season, when
there was talk the DH would be eliminated, and again at midseason,
when his name was mentioned in rumored trades involving the New
York Yankees and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Martinez will have outpatient knee surgery and is
concerned about the recovery time, which could put him up against
the start of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been on the phone checking in with storm-ravaged
friends and family in Puerto Rico. He owns his family home there,
which he said received minimal damage. An aunt lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, who made $3.3 million last season, has job
security, at least for one more year. How much longer he can extend
his career is unclear. He smiled when asked if he could play as
long as Paul Molitor, who recently retired at 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends if I'm playing good and the team is doing well
and they want me back,'' Martinez said. ``We'll have to wait and
see.''

REIGN SEEK MORE OUT OF STARBIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kate Starbird is talking about last season, trying to
analyze what, in her words, ``did me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she reconsiders that choice of words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, not `did me in' _ I look at my stats, and I don't
think they were that terrible,'' said Starbird, who averaged 12.7
points per game for the ABL Reign in her first professional season.
``I learned a lot about passing and other things, getting the ball
in the post. But I wasn't able to do what I do well, and I want to
go back to being able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbird can be devastating on a court, something area fans have
known for years. At Lakes High School in Tacoma, she became the
state's all-time scoring leader. She followed that with a standout
career at Stanford, winning the Naismith Award as the nation's top
player as a senior in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But when she returned to the area as an ABL rookie last year,
Starbird didn't dominate. She was third on the Reign in scoring,
but at 6-foot-2, 150 pounds, Starbird was outmuscled and sometimes
an offensive afterthought. She scored 20 or more points five times
in her first 15 games, but not once in her last 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate that people put some type of unrealistic
expectations on anyone coming right out of college who doesn't
necessarily have a strong professional body at that time,'' said
Reign coach Tammy Holder. ``The physical play and the wear and tear
is something that would take some getting used to and be a
challenge for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was especially challenging for a two-guard like Starbird,
whose strength was her team's primary weakness. Starbird is best in
the open court, but the Reign had trouble executing their
transition game and struggled to a 15-29 record. After a midseason
coaching change, the Reign concentrated more on high-percentage
shots, giving more opportunities to post players and fewer to
perimeter players.
</P>
<P>
   Starbird, in turn, tried to gear her game away from what she did
best. After a while, she realized that with her size, she simply
can't do what bigger players do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let myself be held, and everyone was telling me you've got
to be physical and push people off, and that's not my game,''
Starbird said. ``What I have to do is be Reggie Miller _ he's not
going to push somebody off, but he's going to get open by being
quicker. So I've got to get back to my strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But while counting on fitting her game into the pro ranks,
Starbird acknowledged she had to get bigger and spent much of the
offseason trying to do so. She spent the summer lifting weights
three times a week and cut down significantly on her distance
running.
</P>
<P>
   The result? She's up to 158 pounds, and after two practices,
Holder has noticed more accuracy and strength on Starbird's passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gotten a lot stronger,'' said Reign guard Kate Paye, a
teammate of Starbird's for two years at Stanford. ``She was down in
the Bay Area working out, and she spent a lot of time in the weight
room. Physically, she looks bigger to me, and that should help her
strength on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reign welcome that, but they also plan to get the Stanford
Starbird back on the court. Holder and her staff have had time now
to craft their own offense, and the plan is to make Starbird a more
integral part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about this year, and the potential for this
season, is we are looking to bring a faster-paced tempo into our
game plan,'' Holder said. ``We will be looking to do more things
off the break, and that will accentuate what Kate Starbird can
do.''

 WSU's BIRNBAUM KEEPS STARTING ROLE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington State junior quarterback Steve Birnbaum
will retain his starting role and is expected to play the entire
game against UCLA on Saturday, Cougar coach Mike Price said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That means Price won't alternate Birnbaum with sophomore Paul
Mencke as he did last Saturday against California.
</P>
<P>
   Price said he has no plans to continue shuffling the two
quarterbacks and that an evaluation of both players showed Birnbaum
out-performed Mencke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback who gives us the best chance to win needs to
be on the field most of the time, and that's Steve Birnbaum,''
Price said. ``Steve is going to go the whole distance if that's
what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Price believes Birnbaum has performed better in game situations,
though Mencke hasn't had as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   After four games, Birnbaum has completed 59 of 122 passes for
824 yards, with a pass efficiency rating of 110.42. He's thrown
five touchdown passes and five interceptions. In the three games he
has appeared in, Mencke has completed eight of 20 passes for 133
yards, two TDs and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Against Cal, both quarterbacks threw for a touchdown, but each
gave up an interception for a touchdown in WSU's 24-14 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was obvious that both quarterbacks can and need to
play better,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING HORSES: Although he won't switch starting quarterbacks,
Price did announce a couple of offensive changes. Wide receiver
Jerry Roquemore and running back Kevin Brown, both junior college
transfers from San Francisco City College, will start in place of
injured receiver Nian Taylor (calf muscle, questionable for UCLA)
and fumble-prone running back DeJuan Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   Against Cal, Roquemore had a 29-yard touchdown catch, while
Brown gained 80 yards on 15 carries without fumbling the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown's best output since he gained 111 yards in the
season opener against Illinois. Gilmore (239 net yards rushing) has
one more yard than Brown's cumulative total, but he's fumbled four
times this season. Against Cal, one fumble killed a WSU scoring
drive on the first offensive series and another was returned for a
Bear touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Price also said free safety Lamont Thompson would see more
playing time at wide receiver. Thompson had one pass thrown his way
against Cal, but Price plans to use him in the offense on at least
five plays against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BYE: With UCLA (2-0) getting last weekend off when
Hurricane Georges forced the cancellation of the Bruins' game
against Miami, Price was asked how it might affect Saturday's game
against the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got them right where we want them,'' he joked.
``They lost a lot of momentum by not playing last week. They are
way too fresh, too healthy, with way too many good football players
to choose from. That will create indecision on the part of the
coaches. Boy, it's a mess, those poor guys.''
</P>
<P>
   On the serious side, Price offered his true assessment: ``They
are really healthy. They have a lot of players back now. They are
all really fresh, they've got their legs and have been practicing
the same stuff for two weeks now without anybody to bang them up.
They are probably licking their chops.''

CLINTON AIDES STEP BACK FROM AN ALLY'S PLANS FOR `WAR' AGAINST
GINGRICH

 By JAMES BENNETT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to reassure congressional Democrats that
President Clinton feels more contrite than belligerent about his
affair, the White House distanced him Tuesday from a declaration of
``war'' on House Speaker Newt Gingrich by James Carville, the
president's longtime political lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry also said a planned
advertising campaign by a group of labor representatives and other
traditionally Democratic supporters to buttress the president would
be better directed at helping Democratic congressional candidates.
But the group, People for the American Way, said it would go
forward with its advertising as soon as next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to the president also said plans to help raise
several million dollars for a separate pro-Clinton advertising
campaign had been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The White House moves were signs of nervousness over the shaky
support for the president among Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Democrats complained about the comments from Carville, in a
television appearance on Sunday, and also worried that the
advertising might siphon money from their cause. Carville, who
managed the president's campaign in 1992, has been an informal
unpaid adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The moves also underscored the trouble the White House is having
as it tries for the right political blend of contrition,
conciliation and attack.
</P>
<P>
   The president's aides and allies argue that in criticizing
Congress, Clinton is helping himself by helping his party in the
November elections. But at times, the president can sound like a
different man than the humble penitent who apologized to a roomful
of clerics three weeks ago. At a $10,000-a-plate fund-raiser here
Monday night, he argued that the furor over his affair with a
former White House intern might help Democrats by motivating
normally apathetic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity is our friend in the sense that at least everyone is
now thinking about the political debate,'' he said. ``I'd do nearly
anything to help the Democrats get elected, but this is a little
bit extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came a day after Carville announced that ``Corporal
Cue Ball Carville will be rolling into battle against Newt
Gingrich'' on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' Carville
called Gingrich a ``a sanctioned, certified, adjudicated and
confessed liar.'' He spoke after being read critical comments by
the Speaker about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House asserted Tuesday that Carville was not speaking
for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it quite clear that he will not be muzzled by
anybody,'' McCurry said of Carville.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also said he did not think Carville's attack on Gingrich
was ``particularly helpful, and I think there are others who share
that opinion here.'' But, he added, ``there may be some people who
think it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the president's judgment, McCurry said Clinton planned
to stick with ``the very careful, dignified approach that we've
been bringing to the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt called the White House on
Monday to criticize Carville's approach as counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic congressional aide said it might make Democrats
look overly partisan. Democrats in marginal districts want to be
able to assure both Clinton loyalists and people who favor
impeachment that they are intent only on fulfilling constitutional
obligations, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks as if they're somehow in collusion with a larger
partisan agenda that's being orchestrated by the White House,'' the
aide added.
</P>
<P>
   Carville said he was operating completely on his own, as he
served notice in an interview that he would not back down, citing
criticisms of the president by Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Newt Gingrich writes a letter of apology for calling
him a misogynist and a criminal, then I'll withdraw my battle
plans,'' he said. ``But until that time I'll proceed,
notwithstanding the judgment of some people in the White House.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's criticism of Congress for fighting him on issues like
education and health care will help Democrats, said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster who is informally advising the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think he's apologized enough,'' Mellman said. ``There
is a belief that this Republican Congress is more interested in
investigations and in partisan impeachment hearings than they are
in solving people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way said that despite White House
objections, it would proceed with television advertising attacking
the Republican Congress as obsessed with scandal. Nancy Coleman, a
spokeswoman for the group, said it was still raising money for the
commercials.

SEHAWKS' SIMMONS BACK IN LINEUP AS A RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ His knee is wrapped in a black protective
sleeve, weakened by a strange preseason tumble to the AstroTurf.
When he went down, Anthony Simmons was a starting candidate at
middle linebacker who had never been injured. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Back on his feet after a six-week layoff, the Seahawks' top
draft choice from Clemson finds himself shifted to outside
linebacker, stuck in a reserve role.
</P>
<P>
   Besides partially torn cartilage, what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, it appears, was headed for a new assignment even before
he went down in a heap, untouched, against the Dallas Cowboys. In
his brief audition in the middle, nearly a dozen plays, he
floundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get off to a good start,'' said Jim Johnson,
linebacker coach. ``He didn't look good in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than label him a bust, the Seahawks chose to give Simmons
less responsibility and a chance to flourish once healthy. His
speed was too good to waste. They took away the play calling. They
removed him from the two-sided assault. He was turned inside out.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the fleet-footed first-rounder _ labeled the
fastest linebacker in the draft _ has done well on the outside,
getting a handful of snaps against Washington and a dozen more
against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons showed his 4.45-second, 40-yard speed against the
Steelers on one particular play, running down a receiver on a
screen pass that had potential as a long gainer.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, the 6-foot-1, 230-pound defender, who was signed to a
six-year, $7 million contract, seems content in his new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to the staff, up to the coaches, in how they want to
do things,'' Simmons said. ``I'll play anywhere. They brought me in
to play football. They didn't bring me here to play one position _
I'm a linebacker. Wherever they want to put me, I'm happy to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons backs up outside linebacker starters Darrin Smith and
Chad Brown, his playing time sure to increase now that reserve
James Logan is out for the season after breaking a leg in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Simmons move also was encouraged after fellow rookie DeShone
Myles showed he could stand in there and handle the middle. Oddly
enough, Myles was a four-year college starter playing outside
linebacker, at Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough on him,'' Johnson said of Simmons. ``He goes
out six weeks and he doesn't know where he fits in. I think he's
responded well. I think he's got his confidence back. With the
injury, he wasn't sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was even more mystified by his injury _ a knee sprain
and partially torn anterior cruciate ligament. In high school and
college, he never had any kind of surgery, splint or stitch. He
never missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   Running the field against the Cowboys in preseason, he planted
and collapsed a good distance from any opponent. He later looked at
film to see what caused the mishap. No answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running and I fell,'' he said. ``I don't know how it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons sat out the final four exhibition games and the first
two regular-season contests. He went to meetings, lifted weights
and spent time in the training room. Everything except take the
field on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Simmons was the Seahawks' first-rounder, teammates
were eager to see what he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he can play,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair said.
``The only thing we wondered is when is he going to get a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, Seahawk coach Dennis Erickson made a point of
praising Simmons' play against the Steelers. Even with the loss of
Logan, Erickson suggested the club doesn't necessarily need to find
a linebacker replacement, so solid is the group on hand.
</P>
<P>
   As for Simmons, he won't be the man in the middle any more this
season. Next year might be different. Besides, not every linebacker
is cut out to play the position. Smith plays middle and outside,
but is best suited for the former. Brown is far more effective
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he stays outside, I don't know,'' Johnson said of
Simmons' middle linebacker aspirations. ``Some guys can do it, some
guys can't.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: Two linebackers are scheduled to work out for the
Seahawks Wednesday _ Ray Farmer, who was released by Philadelphia
earlier this month; and Toran James, who was released by San Diego
in August. The club also might bring in another linebacker or two
in its quest to replace James Logan, who broke his left leg in
Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. There is no urgency to sign someone
because the sprained knee that forced rookie DeShone Myles to sit
out the past two games has improved and he is expected to practice
Wednesday.

 McMILLAN NOW A SONICS COACH  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nate McMillan knew a few years ago he would become a
coach. It was almost as if he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   George Karl practically insisted. Tim Grgurich always encouraged
him. Tuesday, Paul Westphal snared McMillan, the Sonics' newest
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan, who retired last season after 12 years in the NBA,
joined Dwane Casey and Bob Weiss as assistants to Westphal. Not
only is McMillan eager to return to the sidelines, he feels
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've heard the last couple of years is that George
(ex-Sonics coach) wants me,'' McMillan said. ``Any time I was
injured I went to the coaches' meetings, and they had me
demonstrate drills. And there were times when I spoke out in
practice. They've been grooming me.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan admitted that it is strange that his first coaching job
is not with Karl, who accepted a job with Milwaukee after his Sonic
contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   But McMillan _ known as ``Mr. Sonic'' because he spent his
entire career in Seattle _ is looking forward to building a new era
with Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like a cool guy,'' McMillan said. ``He's a guy open
to suggestions. He's not a guy who has a certain philosophy in
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the NBA lockout has precluded the Sonics from filling
out their roster, the team has only six players under contract and
no system in place. McMillan is not sure what his role will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps me close to the game. I want to be in the game and
I'll be as close as you can get,'' said McMillan, who ranks in the
Sonics' top 10 in 10 different categories _ including the all-time
lead in assists and steals _ and played in more playoff games than
anyone else in team history.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said he always intended to remain in the organization.
He considered a public relations job, but knew coaching was an
option. McMillan was offered the assistant job once Grgurich
informed the Sonics in August that he would not return.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ON Sunday, after the Astros knew they would be facing the Padres in
the first round of the playoffs, somebody asked Moises Alou what
sort of advice he would provide his Houston teammates regarding
Kevin Brown, a Marlins teammate during Florida's rented
world-championship season of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alou shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these players have hit against him more than I have,''
he said. ``I don't know what I could tell them, except that he's a
great pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall Tuesday, Moises remained short a constructive
answer. And nobody else, save for perhaps Brad Ausmus, had sorted
out anything on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's imposing presence in a Houston uniform was supposed to
have given the Astros the kind of lineup that wouldn't go down
swinging _ and swinging and swinging _ futilely as the one last
fall did when John Smoltz completed a three-game sweep for Atlanta,
making an 11-strikeout beeline straight through the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   With Moises batting fifth, the Astros could bat Jeff Bagwell
fourth, behind Derek Bell. No longer would Houston be asking a Luis
Gonzalez to impersonate a cleanup man.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, having battle-tested the murderers-row concept with
considerable success throughout the regular season _ they hit .280
and led the National League in runs _ figured to be prepared for
anything or anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Except, apparently, Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   You think Smoltz smoked 'em? Forget it. Kevin's surname
notwithstanding, this was a full-blown blackout, not a mere
brownout. San Diego's Killer P, a B himself, met Houston's Killer
B's head-on and went through their bats like he was wielding a buzz
saw. Those closest to the field must have gagged on the sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   So masterful was Brown that when San Diego manager Bruce Bochy
elected to send in the NL's probable Cy Young Award winner, Trevor
Hoffman, to work the ninth, the Astros wanted to spray each other
with Dom. All Hoffman had done was go 53-for-54 on save
opportunities in 1998, but at least they might catch a passing
glimpse of his pitches as they whizzed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a nice feeling or what?'' Jeff Bagwell smirked. ``You
go from Kevin Brown to Trevor Hoffman, and you feel like you have a
chance. Scary deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros would, in fact, nick Hoffman for a run, ``bunching''
two hits with a Ken Caminiti throwing error to avert the shame of a
shutout. Alas, the Padres had already scored twice, and thus Randy
Johnson, the Lesser Unit this day, would lose 2-1 much in the same
fashion as Darryl Kile succumbed to Greg Maddux in last year's
playoff opener against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who threw a three-hitter, had set an NL Division Series
record with those 11 whiffs. Brown, brimming with one-upmanship,
set the major-league Division Series record with 16 K's and allowed
but two hits in eight innings, deftly mixing two- and four-seam
fastballs with a looping changeup Bagwell referred to as a
``Frisbee.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Ausmus slapped both of the singles Brown yielded and
twice wound up standing on third base, although you never felt he
had even a snowball's chance of advancing the last 90 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Killer Brad _ and, OK, Killer Billy (Spiers), who
doubled off Hoffman to start the ninth _ Houston's Killer B brigade
experienced only killer blahs.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall how Bagwell, Biggio and Derek Bell were a
collective 2-for-37 vs. the Braves last year. As for Tuesday, with
Alou in the mix allegedly making things so much better? Hmm.
Oh-for-10, with seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them by Bell, who will continue his Holy Grail-type
quest for a playoff hit Thursday. At 0-for-17, Derek is the
farthest B-hind the eight ball. His third strikeout, with two down
in the sixth, was particularly ill-timed, since Ausmus and Biggio
were in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, by the way, went 0-for-3 against Brown with two whiffs. We
will, however, remove his honorary Killed B designation in
recognition of his infield single that Caminiti threw away,
permitting Spiers to stagger home with the Astros'
too-little-too-late run.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, for one, contended afterward that comparing the Astros'
latest power outage with last season's is a meaningless endeavor,
that despite the day's considerable evidence to the contrary, it's
more a case of apples and oranges than, say, bagels and doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were in over our heads a little bit against
Atlanta,'' he said. ``Obviously, this team belongs. We just ran
into some great pitching today. But we're a long way from being out
of these playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, two more losses, to be precise. And should Andy Ashby
outpitch Shane Reynolds in Game 2, who's to say Bochy won't bring
back Brown on three days' rest Saturday to shoot for the sweep? He
could still start twice in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   I decided not to broach the possibility with any of the Astros.
They seemed dazed enough already.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Scheduling more favorable to television than baseball dictates an
early day off in the Astros' Division Series against the San Diego
Padres.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros would be wise to use today's break to search for the
hypnotist who must have made his way to their bat rack. For some
reason, the mere mention of the word playoffs seems to send the
Astros' bats into a deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Padres ace Kevin Brown was responsible for Tuesday's trance,
striking out a Division Series-record 16 batters while pitching his
team to a 2-1 victory before 50,080 glassy-eyed onlookers at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The expressions from the fans didn't come close to matching the
dazed looks on the faces of the Astros, who surrendered the
home-field advantage by dropping Game 1 of the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's collective bat freeze was eerily similar to that in
the 1997 Division Series, in which the Astros scored only five runs
in a three-game sweep by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Kevin Brown was throwing was nastier than anything we saw
from the Braves last year,'' said Astros right fielder Derek Bell,
who was 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. ``Fortunately for us, he
can't pitch every game.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were physically possible for Randy Johnson to pitch every
game, the Astros would certainly like their chances, especially in
the Astrodome, where he gave up only two runs in 43 innings this
season. But the Padres caught Johnson on a day when he had less
than his best stuff and matched that total in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed nine hits, struck out nine and kept his team in
the game, but it would have taken a near-perfect effort to beat
Brown, who received high praise from the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough for the performance Kevin Brown had,''
Johnson said. ``He never gave us a chance to get anything going. He
was in command the whole day, and when you start a game like that
and continue it, it really silences the offense on the other team
and sends a message. I pitched a good ballgame, but it wasn't good
enough to win. Kevin Brown pitched a much better game and shut down
a good offensive team in dominating fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Brad Ausmus had two singles against Brown, and
were it not for Ausmus, the Padres righthander would have taken a
no-hitter into the ninth inning. Instead, Padres manager Bruce
Bochy called on major-league saves leader Trevor Hoffman (53-for-54
in save conversions in the regular season) to protect a 2-0 lead in
the final inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor is the best closer in the game,'' Astros third baseman
Bill Spiers said. ``But Brown had our number, and I didn't mind
seeing the pitching change when I led off the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiers greeted Hoffman with a double to left, and it appeared
the Astros might be setting the stage for another of their
last-inning comebacks. After Bell flied out to right on a pitch he
said he ``just missed,'' Jeff Bagwell struck out, and Moises Alou
reached on a base hit down the third-base line. Padres third
baseman Ken Caminiti, a three-time Gold Glove winner, knocked down
Alou's hit but threw past first baseman Wally Joyner, allowing
Spiers to score from second base. Carl Everett flied out to center
to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it interesting at the end, but we didn't get it done,
and that's all that matters,'' said Bagwell, who was hitless in
four at-bats and struck out twice. ``We didn't mount anything when
Kevin was in there. We only had two hits, and both of them were by
one guy. We know we have to win (Game 2), and I truly believe we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson matched zeros with Brown through the first five innings,
working out of two-on jams in the second and fifth innings.
Meanwhile, the Astros had just two runners in the first five
innings, but they spent most of their time swinging at balls they
had little or no chance to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have chased some bad pitches,'' Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio said. ``But it's hard to lay off when a guy has stuff
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres used Tony Gwynn's sixth-inning leadoff double to left
as the spark for the first run. Gwynn, who later left the game
because of an Achilles' tendon injury, slapped a slider down the
third-base line just over the leaping Spiers and into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt like I should have caught that ball,'' Spiers
said. ``I didn't feel like I got off the ground good. It would have
been nice to just knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn eventually scored on Jim Leyritz's sacrifice fly to the
warning track in center field. Johnson retired five of the next six
batters he faced, but he surrendered a solo home run to Greg Vaughn
to lead off the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Astros relievers Jay Powell and Doug Henry kept the score close
in the ninth inning and gave the Astros a chance to attempt a rally
against Hoffman, but the effort came up one run short.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game doesn't dictate a series,'' Alou said. ``We know what
kind of team we have. We'll come right back (Thursday) and just
hope (Game 2 starter) Andy Ashby doesn't have the same kind of
stuff Brown had today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, it wouldn't hurt to have that hypnotist on
standby.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
RANDY Johnson threw heat. Kevin Brown left vapor trails.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson fired bullets. Kevin Brown aimed laser beams.
</P>
<P>
   Big Unit. Bigger gun.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was supposed to slam the door on the Padres. But Brown
used bricks and mortar to seal every crack and opening on the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   After all the hope and all the hype, there were the Astros on
the wrong end of another 2-1 loss in the opener of the National
League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   As Yogi once said, it was dj vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   As Jeff Bagwell said Tuesday, ``Familiar, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, it was fastballing Darryl Kile who lost an
opening-game duel with Atlanta's Greg Maddux. This time, it was
Johnson who crossed flamethrowers with Brown and got burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want me to answer the question about how dominating a
pitching performance that was,'' Bagwell said. ``Well, I've never
seen Kevin Brown pitch a bad game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it: Last year against Maddux, we put our bats on
the ball. We had our chances to score runs. Today, Kevin Brown just
dominated us. There didn't seem to be anything we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was everything Johnson was supposed to be _ poised,
confident and unhittable in the Astrodome, striking out 16 and
surrendering only two hits in eight shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros haven't looked this overmatched since Cubs rookie
Kerry Wood struck them out 20 times in May.
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't just confuse the Astros. He had them confounded,
bewildered, embarrassed, tied in knots like so many pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pitched a no-hitter last summer and earned a World Series
ring with the Florida Marlins last fall. But he might never have
been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to say I'll take today because of the situation,''
Brown said. ``The (no-hit) game last year was in the regular season
and didn't have the impact of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if he rode into town and stole the sheriff's horse. He
showed up at Johnson's big playoff dance and did a soft-shoe on the
head of a pin.
</P>
<P>
   Brown set up the Astros with a 93-mph sinker, tied them in knots
with a hot split-finger pitch and then busted them belt-high with a
four-seam fastball that cooked along at 96 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do with something like that?'' Craig
Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for the Killer B's, of course, was the same as last
year's playoffs as Bagwell and Derek Bell each checked in at
0-for-4 and Biggio went 0-for-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are going to happen,'' Biggio said. ``Last year
was last year, and that's long gone. This was just a dominating
performance by a guy who had all of his best stuff going, so you
tip your cap and go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that after the way Johnson had run up a 10-1 record since
joining the Astros and had not lost a game at the Dome, it was
supposed to be the Padres who were doing the cap-tipping.
</P>
<P>
   This was a different year and a different attitude the Astros
brought into this series, in part because of a more solid every-day
lineup but mostly because of the presence of Johnson in the role of
the terminator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Johnson hit the mid- to upper 90s in the first inning,
Brown continued to hit the accelerator through the day. His pitches
stayed hotter than Johnson's and had more bite. Brown was touched
for two singles by Brad Ausmus and gave up just two fly-ball outs.
He struck out the side in the third and eighth innings, fanning
five of the last six batters he faced before giving way to closer
Trevor Hoffman in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game Johnson could have and would have won if the
Astros' bats had produced the kind of offense that led the NL in
scoring this year. Yet it wasn't the game a crowd of 50,080, waving
its strikeout towels, came to see from him.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had the Astros talking to themselves in frustration.
Johnson had the Padres saying it was only a matter of time until
they got to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres did it in the sixth with an opposite-field double by
Tony Gwynn, an infield single by Greg Vaughn, a broken-bat flare by
Ken Caminiti and a sacrifice fly to the warning track in center
that Jim Leyritz just missed taking all the way. Vaughn then opened
the eighth by launching a slider into the orange seats in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   With Ausmus on third and one out in the third, Brown struck out
Johnson and Biggio. With Ausmus and Biggio on second and third with
two out in the sixth, he fanned Bell.
</P>
<P>
   One pitcher scuffled, and one sizzled. One guy scattered nine
hits. One guy scrambled brains.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson brought heat. Kevin Brown carried a blowtorch.

WELLS, CURTIS LED YANKS TO 2-0 WIN OVER TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: SUBS to add quotes, details, refine throughout.)

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankees Manager Joe Torre jogged to the mound in the
eighth inning Tuesday night and invaded the personal space of David
Wells, going chest to chest. Wells stepped backed uncomfortably,
but Torre moved forward, looking the pitcher directly in the eyes,
and asked, ``How are you feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   This was no time for deception, no time for reckless heroics.
This was Game 1 of the American League division series, the Yankees
leading Texas by two runs and Wells's pitch count nearing 130. How
was he feeling? He was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   But with corollary lobbying from his catcher, Jorge Posada,
Wells persuaded Torre to let him pitch out of trouble _ and did so.
Mariano Rivera closed out the Rangers in the ninth inning,
preserving the 2-0 shutout over the Rangers. A second-inning double
by Chad Curtis set up both runs.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the pitching depth the Yankees possess, the Rangers'
best chance in this series would have been to win one or both of
the first two games. Now the Yankees can seize control of the
three-of-five-game series at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night, when
Andy Pettitte faces the Rangers' 20-game winner, Rick Helling, in
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   True to his history as an exceptional playoff performer, Wells
threw a season-high 135 pitches, allowed just 5 hits and struck out
9 in beating the Rangers' Todd Stottlemyre and lowering his career
ERA in the post-season to 2.22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a classic one-on-one,'' said Torre,
referring to the duel between Wells and Stottlemyre. ``David was
running on fumes out there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wells, ``I strive for this kind of challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Torre placed Wells at the back end of the Yankees'
playoff rotation, a decision that still bothers Wells. Coming off a
'98 season in which he went 18-4 and pitched a perfect game,
however, Wells got the Game 1 assignment this year, and justified
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   With the top two buttons of his jersey undone and sporting a
hint of a goatee (to Wells, his war paint), the left-hander
challenged the Rangers all game, mixing fastballs, curveballs and
changeups, using all three pitches in pivotal moments. Remarkably,
Wells pitched into ball-strike counts that were favorable to
hitters _ 2-0 or 3-1 _ only three times.
</P>
<P>
   Wells fired first-pitch strikes to 21 of the 30 batters he
faced, reaching 2-0 counts only twice. Conventional wisdom
suggested the Yankees would not pitch to Juan Gonzalez, the
Rangers' massive cleanup hitter. To the contrary: Wells chased
after Gonzalez with inside fastballs and changeups away, and the
slugger went 0 for 3 against him, striking out, fouling out and
chopping a grounder that traveled about two feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No chance for us tonight,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Rangers got two chances, both coming long after
Curtis had spurred the Yankees' offense in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days ago, Wells gestured angrily on the field when Curtis
and two other Yankees botched a fly ball. Later, Wells sought out
Curtis to apologize. I can't do that, Wells told him, you guys win
games for me.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis batted .216 after the All-Star Game break, .146 in
September, pressing more with each at-bat. In particular, Curtis
was unable to cope with pitches thrown to the outer half of the
strike zone. But Torre started Curtis last night because he wanted
his best defensive left fielder to play behind Wells, who induces
fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   With Posada at first base and one out in the second, Curtis
reached out for a fastball, driving it to the opposite field.
Gonzalez, the Rangers' cement-shoed right fielder, lumbered back
and toward the right-field corner, the ball carrying over his
outstretched glove. Posada stopped at third, Curtis pulled into
second.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Brosius's ground single scored Posada and sent
Curtis to third base, Chuck Knoblauch battled Stottlemyre to a full
count _ the Ranger pitcher threw 27 pitches in the inning _ and
Torre ordered Brosius to break from first on the pitch. Knoblauch
swung and missed, a strikeout, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez fired a
throw to second in an attempt to intercept Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Rodriguez released the ball, however, Curtis broke
from third and Brosius stopped about 20 feet from second base.
``It's a set play,'' Curtis said. ``If we're going to make an out
in that situation, we want to make it at home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas second baseman Mark McLemore caught the ball with no other
choice but to chase Brosius in a rundown, after Curtis had slid
across home plate with the Yankees' second run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was still 2-0 in the seventh, when Texas put together a
couple of hits. With runners on first and second and two out, Wells
jumped ahead of Mike Simms, no balls and two strikes, the Yankee
Stadium crowd of 57,362 roaring. Simms fouled off a pitch, took two
balls, then fouled off two more pitches with good swings. Wells had
not allowed a three-run homer this year, and this did not seem like
the best of times for the first one.
</P>
<P>
   So Wells zipped a fastball inside, Simms staring at it, the
crowd exploding. Ball 3, said the plate umpire, Jim Joyce, and
Wells turned away disgustedly as fans screamed at Joyce. Posada
signaled for a change-up _ ``He just had a great change-up all
night,'' Posada said later _ and Simms swung and missed. End of
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wells returned to the mound for the eighth, fatigue setting in,
his arm lagging. McLemore doubled with one out, prompting Torre's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you feeling?'' Torre asked. O.K., Wells replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No _ how are you feeling?'' Torre asked, wanting to be
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Posada then stepped forward and said, ``Joe, he's got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre nodded and ran back to the dugout, from where he saw Wells
strike out Roberto Kelly. Rusty Greer bounced a broken-bat grounder
toward shortstop, Derek Jeter racing in, gloving the ball and
throwing to first for the third out. Wells pumped a fist.
</P>
<P>
   For the Yankees, a team seeking its place in history, one
victory down, 10 to go.

WOMAN SUES HOSPITAL, LAB OVER PRE-ABORTION DIAGNOSIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Texas, Mass.)  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman who had an abortion after a test showed that
her female fetus had a serious disease and would not survive
infancy is suing Lenox Hill Hospital and a laboratory over the
diagnosis, saying an autopsy found the fetus was male and perfectly
normal.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed earlier this month in Manhattan federal
court, the woman, Janet Sheikhan, charges that the hospital and
Genetrix, a laboratory in Yonkers, mishandled Mrs. Sheikhan's
amniocentesis _ a test routinely performed on pregnant women over
35 for genetic abnormalities _ possibly switching hers with that of
another pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lenox Hill and the lab defended their diagnosis Tuesday and
said the lab results were not switched.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, which was reported Tuesday in the Daily
News, Mrs. Sheikhan, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., learned she was
pregnant in March 1996 and was referred to Lenox Hill for the test
by her obstetrician, who is not a subject of the suit. The test,
which was performed by Drs. Judith Chernevak and Camillo Gugliucci,
showed that she was carrying a 16-week-old female fetus with
Edwards syndrome, a rare birth defect.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sheikhan, then 40, decided based on the report to end the
pregnancy and said that only when she became pregnant again in
January of the following year did she get the chance to read the
pathology report at her doctor's office. It stated that the fetus
was actually a normal boy, reading, in part, ``no external
abnormalities are seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Mrs. Sheikhan's lawyer was unable to
explain why her obstetrician, whom Mrs. Sheikhan would not name,
did not tell her of the report's findings after the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say such a pathology report would only have been
able to determine the sex of the fetus, not whether there was the
presence of Edwards syndrome. They said that even determining the
sex would be difficult in such an early pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Lenox Hill, upon learning of the suit, sent slides of the test
to a perinatal pathologist, who determined that the fetus, in fact,
was female, and that the original pathologist made an error. The
hospital did not say why it failed to try to resolve the
discrepancy between the amniocentesis and the pathology report
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenox Hill Hospital is confident that the original
amniocentesis diagnosis of a female fetus with Edwards syndrome was
correct,'' hospital executives said in a prepared statement. ``The
amniotic fluid was not mislabeled, nor were the lab results
switched. It is difficult for pathologists not specializing in
perinatal pathology to accurately identify the sex of a 16-week
fetus with Edwards syndrome because female genitalia may resemble
that of a male.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sheikhan, who is a labor and delivery nurse at St. Luke's
Hospital, would not comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Roderick Cassidy, a partner at the law firm Widowski,
Cassidy &AMP; Steinhart in Manhattan who is representing her, said,
``Since the filing of the lawsuit, they have determined that their
original report was erroneous and their new findings support their
position in the lawsuit. I believe their current position is
unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards syndrome, which affects roughly one in 8,000 births, is
a serious disorder that few afflicted babies survive. A baby with
Edwards is extremely mentally retarded, often with serious heart
and other defects. Most afflicted babies are born dead or die
within the first year of life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Schneider, a professor of pathology at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said that while it
was ``virtually impossible'' to see Edwards syndrome in an autopsy,
amnios pick up the disease with ``99 percent'' accuracy. ``The
physical findings are quite subtle,'' she said. She added that it
was very difficult to determine the sex of all babies at 16 weeks,
regardless of whether they have Edwards syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Marcie Campbell, a spokeswoman for Genzyme Corp., a
Massachusetts company that recently acquired Genetrix, said that
the company had concluded from an internal investigation that ``we
believe the original diagnosis is correct; the accuracy rates of
our tests are greater than 99 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the New York state Department
of Health, said that Genetrix had a good record and no prior
complaints against it but that the state ``is looking into the
situation.''

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Skeptical New Yorkers trying to find the black cloud in
the silver lining that was the Yankees' 114-win season _ after all,
isn't it really the postseason that matters? _ have a reason to
breathe a little easier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When all else fails, the Yankees have David Wells' left arm and
big heart.
</P>
<P>
   Scattering five hits over eight innings, Wells pushed the
Yankees past the Texas Rangers 2-0 in the opener of the teams'
best-of-five American League Division Series on Tuesday night at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd of 57,362 standing and at full volume on just
about every two-strike pitch, Wells struck out nine, his playoff
best, and gutted out tense moments in the seventh and eighth
innings before giving way to closer Mariano Rivera, who pitched a
perfect ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Wells walked only one _ the first batter he faced _ and allowed
just one extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``His curveball is as good as any curveball I've seen,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``It goes right off the table. It's in
the strike zone, out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that curveball before. The big thing tonight was
his straight changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells' effort was such that the Yankees could survive by
scratching out two runs in the second inning off Todd Stottlemyre,
who pitched with the tenacity he showed in helping the Rangers tie
down the American League West title last week.
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start, Stottlemyre, whose father, Mel, is the
Yankees' pitching coach, settled down and completed eight innings,
allowing six hits and striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about a courageous outing,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said of Stottlemyre's performance. ``And I'm not just saying
that because his father is my pitching coach. That was a classic
one-on-one matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't get a runner to second base against Wells
until the seventh, when Will Clark and Todd Zeile singled.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with his first real sweat _ two out and two on _ Wells
wound up in a protracted battle with Mike Simms, the Rangers'
designated hitter. Simms fell behind 0-2 and got the count to 3-2
before striking out swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simms, he's a strong boy,'' Wells said. ``He can hurt you in a
heartbeat. I got to 3-2 with him, gave him a changeup. I hung it
out, and he swung right through it. I felt a sigh of relief,
because that could have been the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth, the Rangers got their only
extra-base hit, Mark McLemore's double over Chad Curtis' head in
left field, and, again, Wells got a dramatic strikeout on a 3-2
pitch _ Roberto Kelly the victim this time. Rusty Greer then hit a
slow roller to shortstop Derek Jeter, who made a great pickup and
throw to get the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``David, running on fumes in the eighth inning,
managed to get the outs he needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells walked McLemore to open the game and then settled into an
untouchable groove. He retired the next 10 hitters he faced, with
only one hitting the ball out of the infield. He struck out four
during that stretch and got five groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fourth, Greer came up with the first Rangers
hit, a sinking line drive to the right of Jeter. Not that the
Yankees had anything to worry about. Wells got a called third
strike past Juan Gonzalez and then fanned Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre hit the Yankees' leadoff batter, Chuck Knoblauch,
and gave up a one-out double to Paul O'Neill. Knoblauch attempted
to score from first on O'Neill's hit, which landed in the
left-field corner, but a perfect relay from shortstop Royce Clayton
got the Yankees second baseman at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius drove in the Yankees' first run when he poked a
single through the right side of the infield with runners on second
and third and one out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   With one away, a 3-2 count on Knoblauch and Brosius on first and
Curtis on third, the Yankees tried a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hacked at a third strike, and Brosius dug for second,
drawing a throw from Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez. Curtis was
able to score before Brosius, who made a U-turn, was tagged out by
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was a gamble,'' Curtis said. ``If he (Rodriguez)
pump-fakes or lobs the ball to the pitcher, I'm out at third.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``We don't do that very often, but first and third
with a 3-2 count was a good spot. I have to compliment Brosius. He
went far enough to make (second baseman) McLemore think he could
tag him, then backed up.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner, the man who likes to make
headlines, was sitting next to Rupert Murdoch, the man who likes to
make headlines scream across the front page in boldfaced, 72-point
type.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitcher David Wells made both of their jobs much, much
easier.
</P>
<P>
   There was much anticipation in the Big Apple before Tuesday
night's American League Division Series, not so much for the
trouble the Rangers might cause but because of a widespread worry
that the remarkable year turned in by Wells might explode in the
Yankees' faces.
</P>
<P>
   These were, after all, the playoffs, where the 114-win season of
the Yankees was rendered meaningless. And this was Wells, the
wildfire one.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Wells might have been perfect in May _ 27 up, 27 down
against the Minnesota Twins _ but he still is Wells, the tattooed,
guitar-strumming, electric personality known to wear his emotions
not just on his sleeve but from head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Wells said. ``If I don't get my way, I get mad, and
you hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   The man on the brink was in the limelight, pitching at Yankee
Stadium on the brink of October. Some believed there was the
potential for a blowup.
</P>
<P>
   This was Wells amid the demanding, confetti-tossing,
beer-swigging, obscenity-shouting Yanks fans, who considered
Tuesday's opener the first step on the way to a sure World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Runnin' with Van Halen
</P>
<P>
   Emotions were high, and Wells probably was the most emotional
man in the building. But instead of blowing up, he used the energy
of the night to ignite a thrilling pitcher's battle, which, yes,
occasionally can still happen in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be the hero or the goat,'' Wells said. ``I'm
hungry for the big games. I want to get mean, and I want the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the ball, and he won a 2-0 match against the Rangers'
Todd Stottlemyre. Suggested headline to the New York tabloids: Rock
On.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wells somehow bridged the era of what he once was
_ volatile _ with what he has been in 1998 _ overpowering and in
control. Before Tuesday's game, Wells contacted Eddie Van Halen,
the guitar-gashing rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a jersey and told him to wear it,'' Wells said.
``Hey, I'm a headbanger. I told him, `Send out some vibes, man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vibes were electric. And the Yankees took a huge step toward
the title they believe should be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be beyond great,'' Wells said. ``We want to erase
last year's disappointment and be the greatest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after a disappointing first-round elimination at
Cleveland, Steinbrenner, several of his assistants and Yankees
coaches, including Torre, went directly from Cleveland to Tampa,
Fla., where Steinbrenner has a home.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was to come up with a blueprint for a return to
greatness. Steinbrenner ordered the roster trimmed of the me-first
players. One of the names batted about on that trip was Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was a man whose relationship with Torre could only be
called unique, while his relationship with Steinbrenner was at best
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Torre loved Wells' skills, particularly his grit. But Torre
could not relate to the time-bomb personality and the way Wells
often appeared to be detached from matters at hand, as if he were
preoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   All's well with Wells now
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the blaring hard-rock music Wells demanded to be
played in the Yankees' clubhouse before and after games. It was how
Wells long ago got his nickname _ Boomer. Torre could not
understand someone thumbing his nose at the hallowed Yankees
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steinbrenner could not relate to Wells, period. The
Boss and The Boomer repeatedly engaged in memorable shouting
matches and clubhouse scenes from the moment Wells became a Bronx
Brute one season ago, signing a three-year, $13 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steinbrenner and the Yankees traditionally have been
mysteriously drawn to such large figures and large personalities.
Reggie Jackson was one, Darryl Strawberry another. Thus, this
wildfire man, all 6-4 and 230 pounds of him, got a reprieve.
Steinbrenner stayed with Wells, though still occasionally calling
him an underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Then came last May 6, when Wells could not protect a 9-0 lead
against these same Rangers. Definitely a low point. Wells called
that game ``a nightmare,'' and it prompted Torre and Steinbrenner
to first call Wells into a private meeting, then look for some help
on the trade wire.
</P>
<P>
   But two starts after the Texas debacle, Wells was perfect
against the Twins. And now, some four months later, it was Wells
looming large in a critical game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as good as you'll ever see him,'' Torre said of Wells'
performance Tuesday night. ``That was classic.''
</P>
<P>
   As Torre spoke, somebody turned up the heavy metal rocking the
Yanks' clubhouse. We can only assume it was Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never get used to that noise,'' Torre said.

that the remarkable year turned in by Wells might explode in the
Yankees' faces.
</P>
<P>
   These were, after all, the playoffs, where the 114-win season of
the Yankees was rendered meaningless. And this was Wells, the
wildfire one.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Wells might have been perfect in May _ 27 up, 27 down
against the Minnesota Twins _ but he still is Wells, the tattooed,
guitar-strumming, electric personality known to wear his emotions
not just on his sleeve but from head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Wells said. ``If I don't get my way, I get mad, and
you hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   The man on the brink was in the limelight, pitching at Yankee
Stadium on the brink of October. Some believed there was the
potential for a blowup.
</P>
<P>
   This was Wells amid the demanding, confetti-tossing,
beer-swigging, obscenity-shouting Yanks fans, who considered
Tuesday's opener the first step on the way to a sure World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions were high, and Wells probably was the most emotional
man in the building. But instead of blowing up, he used the energy
of the night to ignite a thrilling pitcher's battle, which, yes,
occasionally can still happen in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be the hero or the goat,'' Wells said. ``I'm
hungry for the big games. I want to get mean, and I want the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the ball, and he won a 2-0 match against the Rangers'
Todd Stottlemyre. Suggested headline to the New York tabloids: Rock
On.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wells somehow bridged the era of what he once was
_ volatile _ with what he has been in 1998 _ overpowering and in
control. Before Tuesday's game, Wells contacted Eddie Van Halen,
the guitar-gashing rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a jersey and told him to wear it,'' Wells said.
``Hey, I'm a headbanger. I told him, `Send out some vibes, man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vibes were electric. And the Yankees took a huge step toward
the title they believe should be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be beyond great,'' Wells said. ``We want to erase
last year's disappointment and be the greatest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after a disappointing first-round elimination at
Cleveland, Steinbrenner, several of his assistants and Yankees
coaches, including Torre, went directly from Cleveland to Tampa,
Fla., where Steinbrenner has a home.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was to come up with a blueprint for a return to
greatness. Steinbrenner ordered the roster trimmed of the me-first
players. One of the names batted about on that trip was Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was a man whose relationship with Torre could only be
called unique, while his relationship with Steinbrenner was at best
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Torre loved Wells' skills, particularly his grit. But Torre
could not relate to the time-bomb personality and the way Wells
often appeared to be detached from matters at hand, as if he were
preoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the blaring hard-rock music Wells demanded to be
played in the Yankees' clubhouse before and after games. It was how
Wells long ago got his nickname _ Boomer. Torre could not
understand someone thumbing his nose at the hallowed Yankees
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steinbrenner could not relate to Wells, period. The
Boss and The Boomer repeatedly engaged in memorable shouting
matches and clubhouse scenes from the moment Wells became a Bronx
Brute one season ago, signing a three-year, $13 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steinbrenner and the Yankees traditionally have been
mysteriously drawn to such large figures and large personalities.
Reggie Jackson was one, Darryl Strawberry another. Thus, this
wildfire man, all 6-4 and 230 pounds of him, got a reprieve.
Steinbrenner stayed with Wells, though still occasionally calling
him an underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Then came last May 6, when Wells could not protect a 9-0 lead
against these same Rangers. Definitely a low point. Wells called
that game ``a nightmare,'' and it prompted Torre and Steinbrenner
to first call Wells into a private meeting, then look for some help
on the trade wire.
</P>
<P>
   But two starts after the Texas debacle, Wells was perfect
against the Twins. And now, some four months later, it was Wells
looming large in a critical game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as good as you'll ever see him,'' Torre said of Wells'
performance Tuesday night. ``That was classic.''
</P>
<P>
   As Torre spoke, somebody turned up the heavy metal rocking the
Yanks' clubhouse. We can only assume it was Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never get used to that noise,'' Torre said.

IMF MEETS WEDNESDAY, SEEKING ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ As the world's finance ministers and central
bankers gather in Washington Wednesday for the annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund, they face an intensifying global
financial meltdown that is spreading unmistakably to American
shores.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no small irony that the IMF, created from the rubble of
World War II to prevent another Great Depression, now finds itself
powerless to halt the financial carnage that has ripped through
Asia, toppled Russia, threatens to wreck Brazil and could throttle
the two economic engines where hope for global recovery rests: the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any ideas, for goodness sake, share them,''
President Clinton told the Council of Foreign Relations in New York
two weeks ago. What Clinton described a year ago as ``one small
glitch in the road'' he now calls ``the worst financial crisis in
half a century.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior IMF official conceded last week that the world economy
is ``in a mess.'' Goldman Sachs economists put the chance of a U.S.
recession within the next year at 40 percent. Japan's economy
shrank in the first quarter by 5.3 percent, and a top Japanese
official characterized conditions there as ``extremely severe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer it takes for Japan to recover, the more likely it
becomes that all the major economies will be going into recession
at the same time,'' said economist Andrew Bernard of the Yale
School of Management. ``At that point, it becomes very difficult to
solve.''
</P>
<P>
   While the spectacular $1.2 trillion near-failure of the
Connecticut hedge fund Long Term Capital Management _ and its
controversial rescue _ has caught headlines, a more subtle U.S.
credit squeeze is under way. New stock offerings, the chief money
source for Silicon Valley, have practically halted. Only top-rated
U.S. corporations can find buyers for their bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Attention at the IMF meetings will be riveted on Brazil, the
next teetering domino. Frightened investors are fleeing even
well-managed economies, putting Brazil's currency under severe
strain. IMF managing director Michel &UR;  &LR; Camdessus has pledged that
the the fund ``will not spare any effort'' to provide emergency
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan plans to announce this week an aid package to help Asian
nations dig out from under their debts. Britain and France are
floating proposals to revamp world financial institutions. U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has called for a ``new global
financial architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for an overhaul of
the global financial system that would allow it to respond to a
world where huge rivers of investor capital can shift abruptly and
capsize entire economies.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the IMF is trying to put out fires country by country,
while attacking the roots of the crisis: lax banking supervision,
inadequate bankruptcy laws, opaque accounting practices and ``crony
capitalism'' where governments direct investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a series of short-run crises they have to cope with,
but in the longer term, they have to think about reforming the
international financial architecture,'' said University of
California at Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen. ``The two
options we have available to us now _ ever larger bailouts and
doing nothing at all _ are unacceptable. We have to create a third
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve moved Tuesday to bolster the U.S. economy,
announcing a long-awaited interest rate cut. While the
quarter-point cut disappointed many, the Fed signaled that more may
be coming.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialized nations ``need to make sure the financial system
doesn't collapse inward on us,'' said Richard Medley, managing
partner of Medley Global Advisors. ``A Fed rate cut is the first
step in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries hit by the crisis have seen massive huge outflows of
capital as frightened investors fled to safe U.S. Treasury bonds.
Their currencies have collapsed, leaving businesses starved for
capital and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. interest rates would make U.S. Treasury bonds less
attractive and make it easier for developing nations to buy
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get those dollars to stay in Brazil,'' said Gordon
Richards, an economist at the National Association of
Manufacturers, ``Brazil is more able to keep its economy running,
which in turn keeps all of South America running.''
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. rate cuts only provide breathing room, analysts say.
Longer-run proposals for a ``new financial architecture'' remain
vague and _ despite withering criticism of the IMF _ highly
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no agreement,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of
Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. ``I don't know of a consensus
anywhere on what sort of institutional arrangements should
supersede what we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Many compare efforts to remake the IMF now to trying to
construct a new firehouse in the middle of a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took World War II to bring about Bretton Woods,'' where the
IMF was created, said Medley. ``I don't think we're quite there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many panicked developing countries aren't waiting. Watching
their economies crumble, some are reaching for protective remedies
_ this time to control capital flows _ reminiscent of 1930s trade
controls that intensified the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning free-market orthodoxy promoted by the IMF _ open trade
and free-flowing capital _ is now being widely questioned.
</P>
<P>
   While a massive influx of capital fueled a stunning rise in
living standards in once-impoverished nations, it is now clear that
its withdrawal can also make nations poor again. Highly integrated
world capital markets ruthlessly punish bad economic policies, but
investor panics also punish nations with sound ones.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, capital controls, which restrict the
movement of money over national borders, were widely discredited,
on a par with nationalized banks and telephone companies as quaint
remnants of primitive closed economies.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are seen by many, including some leading Western
economists, as a wooden stake to halt the Dracula-like speculative
attacks on developing country markets. Malaysia has banned all
trading of its currency; Russia has indefinitely suspended all
trading in rubles. Even France has proposed temporary currency
controls for some markets.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, acknowledging the human
devastation in Asia, warned that ``it would be an even greater
catastrophe if countries were to absorb the wrong lessons from
these crises'' by ``withdrawing from the global system.''
</P>
<P>
   As Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan noted last
year, the clock cannot be turned back to a simpler time, before
high-speed telecommunications forever altered the world financial
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technological progress is not reversible,'' Greenspan said.
``We must learn to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether world financial leaders can learn quickly enough remains
an open question.

EXOTIC STAR ZAPS RESEARCH SATELLITES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ An intense wave of X-rays and gamma radiation,
bursting from a huge magnetic flare on a mysterious star 20,000
light-years away, hit Earth's upper atmosphere last month and
knocked sensitive detectors askew on at least seven spacecraft as
the wave sped through the solar system, scientists reported
Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The radiation posed no health risks to humans or animals, but
for five minutes, as it reached the night side of the Earth, it
caused a powerful increase in the activity of the
electrically-charged ionosphere that is normally quiescent at
night, and it sharply decreased the range of many radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation detectors aboard satellites orbiting the Earth and
others exploring deep space measured radiation pulses so strong
that their instruments could no longer record them, ground
controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the tremendous radiation surge reached the Earth's
surface, however, because X-rays and gamma rays can barely
penetrate the ionosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The wave was first detected on the night of August 27 by a
Stanford University team that operates a string of very low
frequency radio transmitters across North America. The group is
headed by Umran Inan, a Stanford electrical engineer, and since the
discovery, scientists all over the world have been analyzing the
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely rare for an event occurring outside the solar
system to have any measurable effect on the Earth,'' Inan said.
``It was as if night was briefly turned into day in the
ionosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The radiation came from a newly discovered and truly
extraordinary type of star that astronomers have termed a
``magnetar.'' These stars are more massive than the sun, but their
dense superheavy matter is barely a dozen miles in diameter. Their
magnetic fields, more powerful than any thing else in the known
universe, is so intense that it powers a steady glow of X-rays from
the star's surface, according to National Aeronautics and Space
Administration astronomers at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's dramatic pulse of radiation originated in a sudden
rippling surge of energy that created a gigantic starquake on the
magnetar's surface, the astronomers said.
</P>
<P>
   The exotic star lies in the Northern hemisphere constellation of
Aquila, the Eagle, and is known as SGR1900. The first faint
stirrings of the wave were discovered last April when Kevin Hurley,
an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley, aimed a
Japanese astrophysics satellite at it and detected faint X-rays
pulsing from it every 5.16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, astronomers at NASA's Marshall and Goddard centers
aimed an Explorer satellite at the same star and saw that its
pulses were gradually slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   According to the astronomers, their findings indicated that the
X-ray ``magnetar'' must have a magnetic field 800 trillion times
stronger than Earth's and 100 times stronger than any other object
ever found in the universe, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Such magnetic X-ray stars have apparently formed from
supernovas, the explosions of very large ordinary stars. When the
stars collapse under their own gravity, they become neutron stars
with a rigid crust of atoms a mile deep, and an outer surface of
iron.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the nature of ``magnetars'' was proposed six years
ago by Robert Duncan of the University of Texas and Christopher
Thompson of the University of North Carolina. They predicted that
many might be found throughout the Milky Way galaxy and have
incredibly powerful magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``A magnet this strong could erase the magnetic strip on the
credit cards in your wallet or pull the keys out of your pocket
from a distance halfway to the moon,'' Duncan said Tuesday.

QUICK WAY TO DETECT `MAD COW' DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; Researchers at the University of California at
San Francisco say they have developed a highly sensitive technique
for rapidly detecting the infectious proteins known as prions that
cause ``mad cow disease'' in cattle and a variety of rare but
deadly nerve disorders in humans.
</P>
<P>
   And because the technique is scientifically both straightforward
and simple, the researchers say, it may well be applicable for
spotting many other human neurological diseases, even before
symptoms arise.
</P>
<P>
   Prions (PREE-ons) are curious microscopic protein particles that
exist in all mammals, including humans. When their normal molecular
structure mysteriously folds into new shapes, they become
infectious and cause diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the prion proteins and their role in disease won
the Nobel Prize only a year ago for Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner of
UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's journal Nature Medicine, a team of Prusiner's
colleagues at UCSF, headed by Dr. Jiri Safar and Dr. Fred E. Cohen,
describe how they developed the testing technique and how it could
be put into widespread use when it is perfected.
</P>
<P>
   A series of trials using hamsters infected with eight different
strains of the prions that cause disease showed that the technique
could accurately detect extremely low levels of the proteins within
eight hours, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, assays for the infectious agents have involved
injecting suspected tissue samples into the brains of laboratory
animals and then waiting for many months to see if the test animals
developed disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new test is based on an antibody to the normal prion that is
labeled to become fluorescent and light up when it encounters a
folded region of the dangerous form of the prion.
</P>
<P>
   Turning their laboratory method into a widely available test is
now merely a problem of development and engineering, Safir and
Cohen said, and it could readily be automated to detect the
dangerous prion forms for other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Practical applications, the researchers said, could include
automated testing of beef products when new outbreaks of mad cow
disease are suspected; routine testing of donated human blood or
blood products, and testing of donated human brain tissues that are
used in certain types of brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The prion diseases, whether human or animal, have major signs in
common: The brains of the victims become filled with spongy holes,
and the lesions result in staggered gait and dementia.
</P>
<P>
   One of those human prion disorders is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
which in most cases seems to arise sporadically but occasionally is
known to be inherited, or even more rarely, can become infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Dementia is also a common phenomenon in other brain disorders
like Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and recent research
indicates that although prions are not involved in those disorders,
they, too, may be caused by other proteins that become folded into
abnormal disease-producing shapes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cohen said in an interview, the test that Safar and
he have developed might also be adapted for the early diagnosis of
those and other disorders known collectively as conformational
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Many unsolved mysteries concerning these diseases remain for
brain researchers to solve, Cohen said, and one of the most
difficult questions is what causes the three-dimensional structure
of the normal proteins to fold over into new disease-causing
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers all over the world are tackling that puzzle, he
said, and ultimately a Nobel Prize may well await the scientist who
solves it.

 &HT;    Fires singed Florida tourism
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ After Labor Day and the end of the summer
busy season, Laura Pittman is accustomed to business slowing down
at the gift shop where she works.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the slowdown is troubling, because it comes after
a summer in which Florida's wildfire crisis devastated the normally
busy June-July period. Even after the fires were put out, many
visitors stayed away, thinking the area was in charred ruins,
business owners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night I worked from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. and didn't have a
single customer come in the door after 6 p.m.,'' Pittman said on a
recent weekday. ``It's really hurt business a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials hope to recoup some of the losses with several
big events this fall, but business owners fear it will be too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``October will be better than normal, but it can't replace
July,'' said Patrick Welsh, owner of the 10-room Beach House Motel,
which suffered a 50 percent loss during July. ``If you lose the
summer, it's really hard to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   While Daytona's biggest events come during the winter and spring
_ the Daytona 500 stock car race and Bike Week in February,
followed by Spring Break in March _ businesses rely on a steady
stream of summer visitors to round out their annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1998 began normally, with large crowds for the
Memorial Day weekend. By early June, though, wildfires had begun
popping up across the state as an unprecedented drought and searing
heat baked Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Western Volusia County is covered with large stands of pine
trees, most grown for timber and paper companies. Fires sparked by
lightning erupted there, sending firefighters scrambling to contain
the flames.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the situation took a dire turn, as fires marched
steadily eastward toward heavily populated suburbs. Gov. Lawton
Chiles called in federal help, and thousands of firefighters from
across the country rushed to Florida to fight the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   But things got even worse as the July Fourth weekend approached.
With fires surrounding several metro areas, Chiles and federal
officials took the unprecedented step of closing a 125-mile stretch
of I-95 between Jacksonville and Cocoa. They also ordered the
evacuation of an entire county, Flagler, just north of Daytona
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on business was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``July Fourth is normally our busiest week and we only had 12
guests in 50 units,'' said Barbara Beaudoin, a desk clerk at the
Dolphin Beach Club, a condominium complex. ``People couldn't even
get here because the highways were closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancellations mean loss
</P>
<P>
   Worse, officials had to cancel the Pepsi 400 stock car race,
which is normally the biggest tourist draw of the summer. The race
routinely attracts 150,000 visitors, most of whom book hotel rooms
for at least three nights and spend freely on meals and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our normal rates are $60 to $80, but during race week we get
$100 a night with a four-night minimum,'' said Janine Dabkowski, a
clerk at the 45-room Seascape Motel. ``Everybody here took a big
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials say sales tax receipts dropped 34 percent in
June and July over 1997 tallies.
</P>
<P>
   The fires were under control by late July, and while about 500
homes statewide were destroyed, the flames never reached the
tourist strip along the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But business owners say faraway visitors didn't seem to grasp
that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people calling from as far away as Germany and Canada
asking if we were on fire,'' said Welsh of the Beach House Motel.
``They were watching television and thought all of Florida was on
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Graziano, owner of Gator's Pizza, said it was his worst
summer in 15 years. He blames the media for hyping the story while
the fires roared, then never reporting the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never reported that on the beach side we didn't have any
damage,'' Graziano said. ``Some people think we're still damaged.
I've had a lot of customers saying they were surprised that the
beach side was so clean. People don't know it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hardest hit of all were several fireworks stores. State
officials banned all fireworks for July Fourth because of the
danger, and the stores simply closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our biggest month of sales,'' said Pat Moran, manager
of Phantom Fireworks. ``We do more than 50 percent of our business
for the year during the week before the Fourth. It's really put a
scar on our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials encouraged residents to shoot off their fireworks over
the Labor Day weekend, but Moran said his sales were nothing
compared to a normal July Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials are hoping to replace some of the lost revenue
with the rescheduled Pepsi 400 stock car race, which will take
place Oct. 17. They also have extended a fall motorcycle event
called Biketoberfest from three days to 10 days, hoping to draw
more tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners hope the events will help, but many have doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have their kids in school in October,'' Graziano said.
``They can't take a whole week off then. It won't be like July.''

   POLO, Dominican Republic _ As I trudged up a dusty street in
this impoverished town of ramshackle wooden houses -- where 30
people died, nearly one-fifth of Hurricane Georges' victims in this
small country -- I thought about my 9-year-old daughter, Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   For most of her life I have tried to impress upon her how
incredibly lucky she was to have been born an American. It's not
that I want her to feel superior, it's that I want her to realize
that when things seem difficult in her life -- if a meal is an hour
later than usual and she claims she's starving -- her minor
inconveniences pale against the sufferings of many in this world.
</P>
<P>
   In Polo, I gathered first-hand knowledge of that suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Following me up the hill were a score of children, many who
hadn't eaten a regular meal since Hurricane Georges paid its
howling late-night visit four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a small wooden house I sat with a woman who had lost a sister
and four members of her sister's family. The woman's 4-year-old
niece was still missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The only furniture in the house was a table and a few chairs.
The floor was a concrete slab. Unpainted walls were bare save for
two brightly colored prints -- one of a landscape, another a
religious icon. Overhead, a light bulb dangled from two wires.
</P>
<P>
   As I and another reporter spoke with the woman, more than two
dozen people clustered into the tiny room, smaller than the
smallest bedroom in my house. A young girl, no more than 5 or 6,
peeked shyly at me from around an older girl's legs.
</P>
<P>
   There was deep sorrow in this room, and fear for the future.
There was no food, no clothing, nothing to sleep on. The nearest
water must be fetched in plastic jugs from a pipe that sticks out
of a hill about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   To exist, they eat bananas and toronjas, a green-skinned fruit
about the size of a coconut, but with a similar look, feel and
taste to a not-quite-ripe orange.
</P>
<P>
   What concerned them most, however, was the loss of the local
coffee crop. Without it, their meager income appears doomed.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold for them, I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no future for this place,'' a woman said.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards outside the woman's house I stood at the edge of a
fresh ravine some 20 feet deep and about 100 yards wide. On the
other side of the ravine, what was left of a wooden house perched
precariously on the edge. Six houses once stood between me and the
shattered house -- the rushing floodwaters spawned by Georges swept
them away.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for me to tell my daughter about the poverty,
the heartache, the misery I witnessed. But that would be only part
of what I experienced in Polo, a community so small it is not on
many maps of this nation -- which shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw in Polo taught me something about humanity and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shared the sentiments of the woman in the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of Polo, small stores were open for business even
though they did not have electricity. The merchants apologized that
their drinks were warm.
</P>
<P>
   At the remains of a shattered wooden house nearly covered by
uprooted trees, I paused to watch three men hammering on its
twisted tin roof. What were they doing with the roof, I wondered?
</P>
<P>
   Taking it apart to re-use it to cover another house that had
lost its roof, I was told. Nearby, a man washed off a mattress.
Further on a woman was cooking beans over an outdoor fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a street, boys wearing baseball gloves played
stickball with a rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in this town who want to escape. They want the
government to move them some place else, an unrealistic hope born
of fear. But there are many more who plan to stay and rebuild their
lives. Fernando Feliz is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Feliz, 25, sought shelter with his wife and two children when
the hurricane swept through. They emerged to discover that his and
several other houses had disappeared, replaced by a gully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever I have to,'' he said of his plan to rebuild
his life.
</P>
<P>
   I'll probably continue telling my daughter that the world is
full of hardships, and I've seen some of them. But I'll also
remember, when things look bleak in my life, the lesson Polo taught
me about the resilience of the human spirit.

   CAMP MCGOVERN, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ For U.S. Army Pvt. John
Wilbur, the difference between Fort Hood, Texas and his new station
here is simple. In Bosnia, he has to sleep on a cot.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect this 17-year-old Albany, Ga. native, who's been
in the Army all of six months, to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sleep anywhere,'' Wilbur says in a Southern drawl, while
downing a pizza at the Rose Garden Cafe near the center of this
camp. ``I'm in the Army ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur is one of about 5,000 soldiers from the U.S. Army 1st
Cavalry Division at Fort Hood deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina last
month to relieve peacekeeping troops from a several U.S. bases in
Germany -- the majority of a total force of 6,900.
</P>
<P>
   While canvas folding cots may be the first thing Wilbur noticed
about his new assignment, bombed-out buildings and boredom may be
what he remembers most from his tour in this war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
   If he's lucky, he may get a break from radio duty once in a
while to go out on patrols of the area. The patrols roam villages
and towns along the Zone of Separation (ZOS), a narrow
three-mile-wide strip of land that winds through Bosnia and
separates the former combatants. Armed with M-16 and .50-caliber
machine guns mounted on Humvees, the patrols cover a 9,000-square
mile area about the size of Maine to reassure the masses that NATO
will not let a war start again here.
</P>
<P>
   Around Camp McGovern, there are reminders of the suffering that
was a way of life here when war gripped this country for years.
Entire neighborhoods in the ZOS still lie in ruins. And even
several miles away, in Brcko (pronounced ``Burch-Ko''), the nearest
city, the once thriving downtown is riddled with blown-out
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. soldiers are among 33,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia enforcing the military provisions of the Dayton Peace
Accords which, in 1995, ended the four-year ethnic war caused by
the break-up of Yugoslavia. Immediately following the U.S.-brokered
cease-fire in December 1995, the International Stabilization Force,
or SFOR, disarmed the three combatants -- the Bosniak Muslims,
Croat Catholics and Serbian Orthodox Christians -- and began
working to rebuild the war-torn country and re-establish peace in
the once multi-ethnic society.
</P>
<P>
   That job may have been made all the more difficult by the
elections in mid-September that resulted in anti-Western candidates
making significant gains in the Serbian state that surrounds the
40-acre Camp McGovern -- one of six in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- on
three sides.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wilbur doesn't get on a patrol now and then, he may spend
the next six months inside the camp, never even getting a peek at
the local politics or the fall-out from the elections.
</P>
<P>
   He, and his comrades from Fort Hood, also may not get a chance
to see how the locals feel about the presence of U.S. soldiers
here.
</P>
<P>
   The one group that seems to make the biggest impression on the
soldiers are the children. And like so many of the soldiers from
Fort Hood, Staff Sgt. Lonnie Radabaugh worries about the children
he sees when he's out on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the children all wave to us,'' he said during a
recent patrol. ``You wonder what they've gone through, how they'll
grow up in all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Few soldiers here who've been on patrol are not stunned by the
level of devastation. At the same time, however, they are just as
heartened by the efforts to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really interesting to see how hard these people are
working to get their lives back together,'' Pfc. John Brumley,
originally of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, said during a break on a recent
patrol. ``Every day when we go out on patrol, that's all they're
doing, working to rebuild their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   While some in the U.S. Congress argue about how long American
forces should stay in Bosnia, U.S. soldiers who have been living in
tents here since 1995 began to build wood huts a few months ago in
camps like McGovern. By the end of the year, Army officials here
expect to have the approximately 1,000 soldiers at McGovern living
indoors, just in time for the worst of the usually wet Yugoslavian
winter. (The remaining 4,000 Fort Hood troops are also expected to
move into wood huts.)
</P>
<P>
   The new officer in charge of the camp sees his mission as a
long-term one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just pull out, then general war starts again; and if
that happens and it starts spreading to other countries in Europe,
then we've got to come back in at great risk of loss of life,''
said Lt. Col. Mike Ryan, of New York City. ``It takes awhile. It's
not just cut and dried, 'OK, the war's over, now let's all get back
together.' It takes a long-term commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern isn't the only camp to get better accommodations for
soldiers in the past few months. Once President Clinton decided in
June to extend the troops' mission, the Army started improving
facilities all over Bosnia. A permanent dining facility is being
built at Camp Comanche, about 37 miles south of Camp McGovern, and
a larger and more permanent hospital facility at Eagle Base, the
main U.S. installation in Bosnia -- located in Tuzla, south of
Brcko.
</P>
<P>
   With the extension, Army officials said they're working hard to
keep the soldiers from getting too bored, or too homesick.
McGovern, for example, has a cafe, pool hall and gym. Soldiers,
also can take college courses and participate in basketball
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   There's no alcohol on the base, or at any of the U.S.
installations in Bosnia, however, so the soldiers have to settle
for the Army's idea of good clean fun. They can call home for 15
minutes every week for free and Ryan is having a computer room set
up so they can e-mail friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of young kids, separated from wives for first
time,'' said First Sgt. Kevin Kenneally, of Killeen, Texas, a
23-year Army veteran. ``Those are the ones you have to be careful
with. They will get bored if they don't do something.
</P>
<P>
   I've told my company, all staff sergeants and below will be
involved in correspondence courses,'' he said. ``It soaks up a lot
of their time, and it's good for their career advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limitations, most of the soldiers from Fort Hood
were surprised at how well they live at McGovern, compared to the
conditions for which they were trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as what we thought it would be,'' said Pfc.
Ernest Curtis, of Austin, Texas. He said the extra pay he gets for
being in a hazardous area, and the experience of serving in a
peacekeeping mission are probably the best aspects of being
stationed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bad things,'' he said, pausing to think for a
moment. ``Well, there are no dance floors, no country bars and no
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he plans to offer Curtis and the rest of the Fort Hood
soldiers a taste of home in the next few days by raising the Texas
flag under Old Glory.

<P>
   SARATOV, Russia _ The political and financial disorder of Moscow
seems faraway and irrelevant in this city on the mighty Volga
River, in the heart of Russia's southern farming and industrial
district.
</P>
<P>
   When the current economic crisis seized the country two months
ago, the regional governor of Saratov overlooked concerns of
national unity and put his 2.7 million people first.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Dmitri Ayatskov instituted emergency measures that
encouraged growers to keep their produce at home. Farmers were
allowed to sell to local consumers free of middlemen mark-ups and
other trade tariffs. The steps kept prices low and prevented
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatskov, 47, identified by President Boris Yeltsin himself as a
rising young star who may be president someday, warned that if the
national government cannot fix Russia's problems ``undoubtedly the
governors will unite their efforts to solve the problems
themselves,'' he told the Cox News Service in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The central authority of Moscow has been undermined by the
economic turmoil in Russia, prompting governors across the
country's 89 regions to usurp the role of the federal government --
and in some cases to defy it in mutinous fashion. Some regions have
threatened to withhold tax revenues from Moscow, print their own
currencies and commandeer
</P>
<P>
   industries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yvegeny Primakov summoned the
powerful regional governors to a meeting in Moscow and urged them
not to splinter the country. ``We must put an end to feudal
attitudes,'' Primakov told them, ``or we shall lose Russia as a
single state.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Russia break apart, as the Soviet Union did seven years
ago? The prospect seems unlikely, according to many political
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a rhetorical question increasingly pondered in Moscow.
The power shift has forced Primakov's still-fledgling government to
give regional governors -- who comprise the upper house of
parliament -- a more formal role in national policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings from the regions began even before the shock of
mid-August and have been plentiful amid the uncertainty and
hardships since the ruble and banking system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian consumers have been faced with massive price increases
and food shortages. The unstable ruble has plunged to half its
value since the crisis broke in mid-August. What's more, recent
government forecasts now show that inflation could reach 300
percent or more by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed, the retired army general and governor of the
huge Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, sent an open letter to Moscow
in late July demanding that servicemen at an intercontinental
ballistic missile base in his district be paid their back wages.
Lebed said he was ``seriously thinking'' of establishing
jurisdiction over the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Krasnoyarsk are not rich yet,'' he wrote, ``but in
exchange for the status of a nuclear territory we could feed the
formation and become a headache for the world community along with
India and Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed's younger brother, who is governor of the adjoining region
of Khakassia, was among at least six regional leaders who
threatened to withhold tax payments to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Samara Governor Konstantin Titov is building his region's own
gold reserve by bartering with the gold-producing Siberian region
of Sakha (formerly known as Yakutia), which in return gets food
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Russia's regions are poor, not rich. The number of
``donor'' regions -- those that contribute more to the federal
coffers than they get back -- fell from 20 in 1994 to eight this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the depressed Murmansk region of the far north, officials,
without consulting with Moscow, declared a state of emergency
earlier this month and appealed directly for international
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Already there have been pledges of food aid due to be sent this
month from Norway, Finland and Sweden designated for orphanages and
pensioners. The area has relied on food aid, which have been
falling steadily, since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said vice-governor Igor Chernyshenko, is that
Murmansk is in the far north with a short growing season. ``Besides
potatoes, there is little that can grow here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry is that Moscow continues its politics as usual while
the financial situation grows worse,'' added a Western diplomat in
Moscow. ``Were that to happen, I think we will see regions,
particularly the strong regions, attempting to assert their de
facto independence and the poor regions following them, not
Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Saratov has been a region of relative
prosperity thanks to Ayatskov's tireless pursuit of foreign
investment to revitalize decrepit Soviet-era factories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Case, the Wisconsin-based manufacture of farm
machinery, began negotiations in April with the regional government
in Saratov on a $140 million joint venture and, in the first step,
delivered 100 combines in June. But further progress on using a
factory
</P>
<P>
   in Saratov to assemble combines are on hold amid the economic
turmoil in Russia. ``We'd like to move forward as soon as we can.
The fit is right, but the economics are not,'' said Case spokesman
William Masterson.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Saratov is an attractive place for Western firms to do
business. But the economic crisis has for now forced Case to put
its plans on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatskov complains that the current crisis has cost his region
$800 million in foreign investment that now will not come. Yet
Ayatskov claims no desire for independence or more economic
autonomy, only for a strong and unified Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good politician, he seems to be reading his
constituency well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of animosity. There is even more despair,''
said Lilya Chudaeva, editor of a local Saratov newspaper, Pokrovski
Vesti. ``And a lot of it is aimed at Moscow.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After terrorist bombs exploded at two U.S.
embassies in east Africa, killing more than 250 people late this
summer, they set off demands for tighter security at American
outposts around the world and something else, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is raising questions about how American diplomacy
should be conducted in the age of faxes, e-mail and 24-hour news
broadcasts. Some experts are asking if the United States still
needs highly visible and vulnerable embassies in almost every
nation, regardless of size or influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world's only superpower, the U.S. needs to have a
presence in every country, but that does not mean having
full-fledged, costly embassies everywhere,'' said John Schall, a
senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The research center, with a steering committee that includes
several former cabinet officers and former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
is one of two groups expected to unveil proposals this fall on how
American diplomacy could jump from an embassy system rooted in the
horse-and-carriage era into the 21st-century of instant
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have recommendations on what we call 'right-sizing'
embassy staffs'' and much greater use of communications technology,
said Schall.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any attempt at a major overhaul is likely to meet
with resistance at the State Department, where the policy of having
an accredited embassy in every nation has long been treated as
sacrosanct when it comes to promoting U.S. interests abroad. In
addition, agency officials argue that it is not the
brick-and-mortar structure that is the true terrorist target, but
American ``ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the deadly Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nigeria
and Tanzania suggest that changes could be crucial, Schall said.
``The question is not only, 'Is the building sufficiently secure?',
but secondly -- and Washington hasn't begun to grapple with this
yet -- 'Maybe we had too many people as a big target?'''
</P>
<P>
   The United States now operates embassies in 162 countries in
addition to about 100 consulate and other smaller overseas
missions, for a cost of more than $2 billion a year. Rebuilding the
demolished embassies and reinforcing security for others is
expected to add $1.8 billion more in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, an embassy requires at least one building, a
contingent of U.S. Marine Corps guards, and a staff of up to
several hundred Americans, usually including intelligence agents
working either tacitly in the open or undercover. That's in
addition to support staff, drivers, a motor pool, and a doctor or
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The overseas presence has hardly been reduced in the past
decade, despite the end of the Cold War and its ideological
struggle against communism that once extended to the remote corners
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War we had to make a statement about who we were
so that we could win hearts and minds'' and the votes of every
possible nation in the United Nations, said Charles A. Schmitz, a
retired State Department diplomat. That meant providing Peace Corps
volunteers, scholarships to U.S. colleges, as well as aid and
advice on issues ranging from currency to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now an international business consultant and president of Global
Access Institute, Schmitz is among 63 experts who are developing a
blueprint for ``diplomacy in the information age'' to be issued
soon by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
private Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Embassies are ``bloated with functions and personnel'' and still
relying on out-moded cables for official communications instead of
computer e-mail, according to Schmitz. He said that the United
States has resisted new information technology that could reduce
overseas postings.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts have, in fact, forced the State Department to cut
its overseas personnel by more than 2,500 over the past decade. But
the total number of U.S. personnel abroad has remained static
because domestic U.S. agencies have simultaneously increased their
overseas postings -- by 25 percent between 1988-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement
Agency are increasingly going abroad to investigate crime and
terrorism. The Agriculture Department is sending more workers
abroad to push credit sales of U.S. farm products, and Commerce
Department officials assist U.S. business interests overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, these disparate functions are housed at the U.S.
embassies, such as the one in Mexico City, which has so many U.S.
agencies that it is now a microcosm of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Schall defended some of the expansion abroad as necessary, but
added, ``Certainly a portion of this is some agencies ...
turf-grabbing. There's some over-staffing, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas that reformers say would improve the efficiency,
and perhaps the safety, for U.S. diplomats:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Regional hub'' embassies that could serve several countries.
The United States has experimented with that idea in Barbados,
where the ambassador has responsibility for seven nearby Caribbean
countries. Also, the British have ambassadors accredited to four
countries apiece in Africa. ``These could serve as models for a
U.S. diplomatic reorganization in other regions beyond the
Caribbean,'' said Benjamin F. Nelson of the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the investigating arm of Congress, in a report last year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A gradual shift from full-service embassies to much smaller
and less visible missions for many developing countries, including
several in Africa. ``By having a building and making it a big
symbol of ourselves with the flag and Marines, we're creating a
hostage for terrorists,'' Schmitz said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use of the latest communications technology to gather much of
the information that was once done by embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats ``have only just scratched the surface of what
the information revolution makes possible,'' Schmitz said. The U.S.
government could hire private services to track developments in
smaller countries, rather than posting a highly paid foreign
service officer in an embassy to gather marginal information and
relay it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A new mobile diplomatic team that could be sent to reinforce
small missions in times of emergency. That approach would mirror
the rapid deployment forces used by the U.S. military, Schall said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scaling back big embassy staffs such as those in London and
Paris, now that the Cold War has ended some of the demand for
intelligence-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leaving non-essential functions to private enterprise. For
example, the United States Information Agency and other government
news operations were part of the Cold War effort to ``sell'' the
American way of life. Now citizens of countries around the world
are buying Hollywood's movies and music, adopting American clothing
styles and tuning into American television programs and CNN's
international newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Those studying such changes acknowledged that it would take a
major effort to enact them over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview last week(CQ), Assistant Secretary of
State Patrick F. Kennedy rejected most of the ideas being examined,
starting with suggestions for reducing the overseas presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see that the State Department staff could be any
smaller than it is right now,'' said Kennedy, who oversees embassy
properties and security. ``These other agencies (with overseas
officials) have a mission which promotes U.S. national interests''
such as trade assistance for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that the end of the Cold War meant adding more
embassies, 14 new ones for the countries that were in the old
Soviet empire. As for the suggestion that a lower profile for U.S.
outposts would be a reduced target for terrorists, Kennedy said,
``That's a ludicrous concept to say that size has anything to do
with it. Terrorists attack our ideals, and they will attack us
wherever we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy readily acknowledged that his department was
technologically backward, however. ``Over half of our computer
systems, our telephone systems, and our overseas radio systems are
antiquated,'' he said, adding that they would be updated as soon as
funding permitted.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of this backwardness, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited Moscow last year, she participated in an
interactive conversation with students on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is bringing us closer together,'' she wrote on the
computer screen, according to a news release. ``This will make us
all wiser, quicker to understand each other, and better able to
work together on the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that she was typing her message on computers that
belonged to the U.S. Information Agency because the State
Department's Moscow embassy had no link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Updating the information systems as well as other updates for
U.S. diplomacy could be slow coming. ``You're dealing with a
culture,'' said Schall, whose Stimson Center study will be released
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``The State Department needs to come
into the 21st century, and it's still in the 19th.''

AN ABSURDIST WHO SAVORS THE POETRY OF TECHNOLOGY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ann Wilson Lloyd is an independent critic and curator who last
wrote in these pages about Myron Stout and Provincetown in the
1950s.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The conceptual sculpture of the Canadian-based artist
Jana Sterbak has inspired reams of humorless, abstruse theoretical
writing that leaves none of her layered metaphors unturned. Yet Ms.
Sterbak's work _ seductive, intensely physical and edged with dark
absurdity _ delivers a mind-body frisson unknowable by intellect
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In art circles in the United States, she is perhaps best known
for what could be called a piece of wearable art. ``Vanitas: Flesh
Dress for an Albino Anorexic,'' from 1987, is an actual shift of
raw, sewn-together flank steak, which, when fresh, was modeled (but
not by the artist) and then left to hang, rank and wizening, in a
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A wider view of Ms. Sterbak's nuanced provocations will be
furnished in a mid-career survey of her work at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago, from Saturday through Feb. 21. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Flesh Dress,'' which will not be in the Chicago show, was
featured in several exhibitions about clothing and fashion or
mortality in the body-conscious climate of the late 80s and early
90s.
</P>
<P>
   It was discussed in numerous art journal articles about those
trendy subjects, thus fixing Ms. Sterbak within the camp of
feminist or body art. In truth, her oeuvre is more subtle and much
less categorical, ultimately stemming from the human condition as
seen through the eyes of a cultural nomad.
</P>
<P>
   Now living part time in Montreal and Barcelona, Spain, Ms.
Sterbak, 43, left her native Prague as a young teen-ager, but not
before absorbing an Eastern European mix of existentialist-informed
irony and a poetic touch with materials.
</P>
<P>
   The extremes of political ideologies she experienced at an
impressionable age, from that of dour, Communist-block
Czechoslovakia to that of cheerfully capitalist Canada, taught her
to buy into none of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her distrust of dogma fits perfectly into these
post-ideological times,'' says Amada Cruz, the former acting chief
curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, who organized the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has this weird combination of skepticism, which is also
very timely, and yet an incredible faith in humanity,'' Ms. Cruz
says. ``Although her work does have a very strong point of view and
does deal with issues that could be thought of as specifically
feminist, she also deals with things universal in terms of just
being a human _ desire, longing, the contradiction between one's
will and the limits to what one can physically do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sterbak agrees that her work comes more from life's currents
than current events, and that body- and AIDS-related art was a
trend many artists were shoehorned into by critics and curators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways this interest in the body is misguided,'' she
says. ``What people should have been looking at, not only in my
case but in that of other artists, is how the representation of the
human has changed over time. We are so far away from historical
perspective, into a kind of theoretical language, that historical
context is not discussed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Sterbak, the critical condition for humanity today is
that of the individual besieged by technology compared with, say,
the Greek model of the body filled with optimism, or the
Renaissance mix of religion and rationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work has to do with the limits of the individual, limits
that are defined as they always have been, and always will be, by
our mortality,'' she says. ``We have always tended to minimize this
mortality, and are now encouraged to do so by technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's medical advances that keep mortality at bay, or the
personal limitlessness proffered by cyber communications systems,
Ms. Sterbak says that technology also needs to be rescued from such
strictly utilitarian roles. ``For it to be mostly functional is
sad. Technology is in need of imbuing with a little poetry,'' she
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Literature and technology were both important to her early on.
``Corona Laurea,'' 1983-84, was an electrified stove-coil headpiece
based on the Medea myth. Since the late 1970s Ms. Sterbak's
polymath methods have included traditional and mechanical
sculpture, performance, video, photography and borrowed ready-made
objects injected into multimedia installations.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than art theory, she reads fiction and poetry and cites
an international range of favorites including Milan Kundera, Max
Frisch, Paul Bowles, Heinrich Boll, Octavio Paz and Emily
Dickinson, often including passages of their writing in her
exhibition catalogs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the language of fiction more subtle than what usually
gets written about artists,'' she says. ``In fiction and poetry the
meaning is communicated on many levels, and there is also craft, or
style _ both form and content, as in my work. Form facilitates the
ease with which a work of art can be approached.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Sterbak's early work seemed more personal, invoking
highly charged, clashing sensations, since ``Flesh Dress'' her art
seems to be increasingly extroverted, even lighthearted. Technology
is given a playful break with ``Baldacchino,'' a 1997-98
interactive work that will have its debut in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This head-high, metallic, mesh-veiled canopy on wheels moves
independently about the gallery, making seemingly random choices of
viewers to hover over and follow about. The hidden mechanisms have
to do with reflective properties; more than that the artist prefers
not to say.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece she is developing for a show at the Fabric
Workshop in Philadelphia involves a tent made from space-age fabric
that blocks all electromagnetic waves, literally sheltering
inhabitants from the pervasiveness of technology. &QL;
</P>

   Ms. Sterbak continues to be fascinated with electricity, a
perfect metaphor for danger and seduction. Many of her works
combine materials that conduct heat, light, electromagnetism or
mild electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
   A new incarnation of the Medea piece is ``Hot Crown,'' a metal
crown that becomes incandescent as viewers approach. Lower-tech
themes explore implied physical burdens and metaphors of wearisome
tasks. A group of late performance pieces involving husks or a
cocoonlike apparatus suggests metamorphoses a la her Czech
compatriot Franz Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absorption,'' 1995, is an art-historical conceit involving the
artist's desire to become a moth and consume all of Joseph Beuys'
felt suits, making the implicit point that men's clothing art is
regarded as humanist while dress-related art is seen as feminist.
It was inspired by an actual moth-infested Beuys suit she
discovered in storage at the Tate Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condition,'' a 1995 video performance piece, required a man to
walk in circles dragging a large wheeled contraption resembling an
insect exoskeleton. Portability is also a subtext, perhaps because
of her peripatetic life style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat Cricket Compartment,'' 1993-97, contains live crickets
in a small carved horn case, allowing the carrier to transport
cricket songs of love and war. In all her work, the compelling
object seduces, while the implication or action surprises, shocks
or amuses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Material presence is the way to know,'' she says. ``It's
important for my objects to have a definite physical presence, that
they are physical in the way that we are, and that presence is our
first access.'' Her materials, though as quotidian as flank steak
and crickets, disabuse us of assumptions that we mistake for
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   A quote by Emily Dickinson included in the catalog of her
forthcoming show offers a parallel in such everyday enlightenment:
``To live is so startling, it leaves little room for other
occupations.''

AH, FOR THE DAYS WHEN NEW MUSIC STIRRED THE BLOOD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a bad case of the post-avant-garde blues. Whenever I hear
people praise a new piece of music for being ``accessible,'' and
for nothing else, I long for the days when new music could strike
terror in the soul instead of just aiming to please.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the American music business has been dancing on
the grave of difficult music for the last decade, I often find
myself playing the role of the Ancient Mariner, spoiling the
festivities with obsessive memories of an episode everyone else has
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The avant-garde may no longer represent the music of the future,
but now that it has been out of fashion for a generation, it is a
good time to reconsider how it fits into the musical past.
</P>
<P>
   I should declare my own prejudices: my adolescent encounters
with the European avant-garde were among the most formative
experiences of my musical life. In 1959, when I was 14, the cover
of a record on display in a music store on Main Street in New
Rochelle, N.Y., caught my eye.
</P>
<P>
   The album contained performances of Karlheinz Stockhausen's
``Zeitmasse'' and Pierre Boulez's ``Marteau Sans Maitre,''
conducted by Robert Craft.
</P>
<P>
   The titles and the names of the composers, who were then in
their early 30's, were unknown to me, but the cover reprinted a
page from the Stockhausen score, and it was like no music I had
ever seen. Five staffs of music were notated in four different
tempos, with independently changing meters. Within the different
tempos each instrument was playing triplets, quintuplets or
septuplets.
</P>
<P>
   Dotted lines indicated approximate places where the lines
coincided. Because I was young, the mad-scientist aspect of the
score made it all the more irresistible, and I bought the record on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockhausen piece, with its sporadic blips, gurgles and
gushes of sound, proved as odd to the ear as it had to the eye, but
the life-changing revelation was the Boulez on the flip side.
Whereas Stockhausen's music was weird, Boulez's was sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Its scoring for alto voice, alto flute, viola, guitar,
vibraphone, marimba and percussion had the suggestive coolness of
Chet Baker, but the music wasn't jazz; it was wildly atonal and
arhythmic, a spray of unpredictable accents and fleeting colors.
Call me a nerd, but ``Le Marteau Sans Maitre'' knocked my teen-age
socks off more seismically than ``Hound Dog'' ever did.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 60s I lived in England, where Karlheinz Stockhausen
was the leader of the avant-garde pack, a position he never
attained in New York. Many English composers felt they were in a
hopeless state of catch-up with the Meister. Several had studied
with him, even lived in his house. They owned all of his scores and
could recite a litany of his innovations, from total organization
to total improvisation in the space of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   I heard ``Gruppen,'' Stockhausen's 1957 extravaganza for three
orchestras and three conductors, at Royal Festival Hall. (It has
never been performed in New York.) The hall was packed with
swinging Londoners who cheered as wildly for the composer as they
would for Pete Townshend or Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   But my most vivid Stockhausen memory is of a recital of piano
pieces by Aloys Kontarsky, at the German Consulate in London.
Running late, I tripped on the sidewalk, ripping my trouser legs
and some skin as well. I will forever associate the relentless
pounding clusters of ``Piano Piece X'' with the sting of blood
running down my leg; that was the way new music was meant to feel.
</P>
<P>
   Youthful enthusiasm is a historical accident, a random
convergence of affinities. I don't know why my hormones bonded me
to Pierre Boulez rather than Buddy Holly, but I was unconsciously
seeking a kind of musical rebellion not available in most concert
music of the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Craft, the skinny young man in a T-shirt who conducted
``Le Marteau,'' certainly looked more like a rebel with a cause
than Richard Rodgers or Aaron Copland did at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eisenhower years, American music was dominated by
composers like Gian Carlo Menotti and Samuel Barber, whose idiom
went back to the 1930s. Even ``West Side Story,'' which critics
today describe as groundbreaking, echoed two Depression-era works,
Copland's ``Salon Mexico'' and Marc Blitzstein's `'Cradle Will
Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   It was music, I felt, by and for my parents' generation. To my
ears only the wild and crazy new European music had the subversive
scariness of Abstract Expressionist painting or beat poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, unfortunately, much of the music is forgotten. Neither
``Zeitmasse'' nor ``Gruppen'' is available on CD in the United
States. Deutsche Grammophon has never reissued its vast catalogue
of Stockhausen recordings, and the fine series of new-music
recordings Earle Brown produced for the Time label has never
resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   While Stockhausen and Boulez remain canonical figures in Europe,
especially in Britain, performances of their music are rare on this
side of the Atlantic. Many critics and composers in their 30s,
blinded by their hatred of American ``academic'' music of the 1960s
and 70s, barely know this repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The music and ideas that emanated from Princeton and became
dogma in university departments for 20 years pursued certain
aspects of the European style, like electronic music and total
Serialism, in a sober, scholarly way. The academic scene was devoid
of vanguardist zeal if not entirely free of silliness and
posturing. It was a minor aftershock of what had been going on in
Europe since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Western Europe sought to create a music free of ties to
the Nazi era and distinct from Soviet Socialist Realism and its
American counterpart, the populism of Copland and Roy Harris.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany and Italy, government-sponsored radio stations and
festivals discovered an untainted and audacious new generation,
many trained by Olivier Messiaen. By the early 50s Boulez,
Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Luciano Berio and Bruno Maderna had become
the most pampered young revolutionaries of all time, free to pursue
their impractical dreams in the well-subsidized hothouse atmosphere
of new-music festivals in Cologne and Darmstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Although their music was termed post-Webernian, these composers
broke free of the inhibitions, refinements and Viennese trappings
of the Schoenberg school. Quickly assimilating the severely
organized pointillism of Webern's music, they were ready for more
radical speculation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Their music soon mixed science fiction with Dada; mathematical
manipulations of rhythm and pitch were pushed beyond the limits of
the ``playable.'' New instrumental techniques and notational
devices seemed to appear with every festival, leading to a
``breakthrough'' mentality that often turned into a parody of
itself but also produced innovations still being explored.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology of the tape recorder, which seems absurdly
low-tech today, made possible a tantalizingly dehumanized musical
expression, which Stockhausen vindicated with his tape masterpiece
``Gesang der Junglinge'' in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-60s, Stockhausen was eliminating notation altogether
and creating works for improvising musicians who had memorized most
of his previous works. When his improvised, intuitive work
``Stimmung,'' for eight singers who sustained a mystical chord for
an hour, appeared in 1967, the composer Roger Smalley compared it
to the opening of ``Das Rheingold,'' but Stockhausen's intentions,
to say nothing of his ego, seemed to dwarf Wagner's. Even the
Beatles paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is little awareness of new European music in this
country. (Quick, name a French, German or Italian composer under
60.) But Americans were deeply engaged in the European scene of the
50s, learning from it and influencing it.
</P>
<P>
   John Cage, in particular, had a traumatic impact on both Boulez
and Stockhausen. Although Boulez thought in the early 50s that he
was pursuing experimental aims similar to Cage's, he gradually came
to realize that Cage had less interest in sounds than in ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Le Marteau'' Boulez reaffirmed his own preference for the
minute shaping of rhythms and colors, a choice that prefigured his
later work as a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Stockhausen, by contrast, seized Cage's conceptualism and ran
with it. He played the fox to Cage's hedgehog. Where Cage left the
choice of notes to chance, Stockhausen increasingly assigned this
lesser task to assistants and acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cage was not the only American on the scene. Edgard Varese,
Stefan Wolpe and Earle Brown toured the festival circuit. Elliott
Carter's style changed sharply after he heard ``Le Marteau.'' His
Double Concerto of 1961 linked the stereophonic experiments of
Stockhausen's ``Gruppen'' and Boulez's ``Doubles'' to techniques of
American ultramodernists like Charles Ives, Henry Cowell and Conlon
Nancarrow.
</P>
<P>
   And the old master himself, Igor Stravinsky, gave his blessing
to ``Le Marteau'' and ``Gruppen,'' and even imitated Stockhausen's
notational idiosyncracies in his latest scores.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no new recordings of these works, I went back to
my well-worn LPs to see how the music holds up. Any successful
style, whether Neo-Classicism or Minimalism, eventually falls
victim to its own cliches, and I feared that these works would
sound as stale as their imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I felt again the old exhilaration. Not only does ``Le
Marteau'' still sizzle, but I can still sing the tunes. I listened
to two recordings, Craft's, and Boulez's CBS version from the 70s,
which I now prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Craft brought out the Stravinskian aspects of the score, making
it sound at times like ``L'Histoire du Soldat,'' with taut rhythms
and dry articulation. Boulez's recording reveals the work's French
roots, especially its connections to Debussy's Sonata for Flute,
Viola and Harp and to the Orientalist side of Messaien. The rhythms
are more flexible than in Craft's reading; the sonorities,
particularly the percussion, more sensuous.
</P>
<P>
   But revisiting this work in either performance reconfirms
Stravinsky's judgment that it was a masterpiece. It gives enormous
pleasure in its intricate details, in the way it varies and
elaborates its materials and in its dramatic form.
</P>
<P>
   Stockhausen's music remains more difficult to assess, because it
refuses to fit into any previous esthetic or expressive category.
But the young Stockhausen was full of beans, and the inventiveness
of ``Zeitmasse'' and ``Gruppen,'' their fearless discovery of
complex rhythms and colors, compensates for their apparent
rootlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The extravagant virtuosity of ``Zeitmasse,'' a woodwind quintet
with English horn replacing the traditional French horn, still
sounds marvelously fresh, and the piece has a succinctness rare in
Stockhausen's music. Rehearing ``Gruppen'' on an old Deutsche
Grammophon LP is a more mixed experience, though it may be unfair
to judge such a technically difficult work on the basis of a rough
performance in a bizarrely unbalanced recording.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously intended as a visionary work, ``Gruppen'' sends off
conflicting signals. Although Stravinsky wrote that its ``groups,''
or short phrases, were ``admirably composed,'' they often seem
haphazard in shape, color and sometimes even style.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of Webern and Schoenberg float by, but there are also
gestures that sound like Stan Kenton's ``experimental'' phase. And
then there are those strange passages for electric guitar and
baritone sax, which suggest that Stockhausen was listening to
rhythm-and-blues, but not closely enough.
</P>
<P>
   By definition avant-garde works have a short shelf life.
Whatever is merely new soon becomes merely old. Vanguard art
flourishes after events of political turmoil that make it seem as
if the past no longer existed, like the two world wars or the
Russian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   As the history of Italian Futurism shows, historical
developments can make artistic manifestoes seem naive if not evil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as their novelty fades, the works remain, and in the case
of the postwar European avant-garde, their youthful vehemence and
bravado was supported by musical talent and technique of a high
order. In an era of retro-this and neo-that, these works remind us
of a time when music looked toward its future with a sense of
infinite possibilities.

 &HT;    Austin Film Festival debates screen writing credits
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR 10/1
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSPIN, Texas _ Austin screenwriter Lawrence Wright recently was
sitting in a Dallas movie theater with his family when the trailer
for the film of his first produced script, ``The Siege,'' flickered
across the screen. After a scene in which star Denzel Washington
delivers a stirring speech, Wright's nephew turned to him and
asked, ``Did you write that, Uncle Larry?'&AMP;
</P>
<P>
   Wright recalls this with a tinge of disappointment because, no,
he didn't write that. Not exactly. Well, he did, but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the snarled conundrum of the modern movie screenplay.
Wright wrote the speech, but at least three other writers rewrote
it and most of the rest of the script as well. This makes things
rather ticklish when it comes to claiming writing credit.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his nephew's question, Wright says, ``How do you
answer that? I told him I sort of wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fifth annual Heart of Film Screenwriters Conference and
Competition gets under way, now is a good time to ask: What does a
screenwriting credit mean on a movie anymore?
</P>
<P>
   From the famous, if perhaps apocryphal, case of a 60-person
committee writing ``The Flintstones'' to ``Armageddon'' requiring
eight writers, it can be difficult to truly know who wrote what.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to measure,'' agrees Wright. ``The Writers
Guild (of America) makes an honest effort to apportion credit in a
way that's just. But it's almost impossible to do it fairly because
it's hard to quantify who wrote which parts. There are so many
variables.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guild maintains firm jurisdiction over these variables. For
instance, for a writer to earn a screen credit, he or she has to
have written 50 percent of the final version of an original
screenplay. Only a 33 percent contribution is required to get
credit for a screenplay made from other source material, such as a
novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These percentages gbviously cannot be determined by counting
lines or even the number of pages to which a writer contributed,''
states the Guild's Screen Credit Manual. If a second writer is to
get credit, ``his/her contribution must consist of dramatic
construction, original and different sequences, original
characterization and dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the clincher: ``There have been instances in which every
line has been changed and still the (Guild) can find no significant
change in the screenplay as a whole.'' Which means someone can
rewrite every line and still get no credit.
</P>
<P>
   These notorious rules often don't sit well with Hollywood
wordsmiths. ``It doesn't make sense that someone can put a
considerable amount of time to rewsite a screenplay and not get
credit, while the caterer gets a credit,'' says Wright.
</P>
<P>
   But it happens all the time, leading to arbitration between
Guild and scribe on a regular basis. The Guild manual notes that
more than 150 times a year it is asked to resolve credit
controversies. Here are just a few notable arbitration cases:
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Steven Soderbergh (''Out of Sight'') quit the
Guild in disgust over its decision not to give him sole credit for
his 1994 film ``The Underneath,'' which he filmed in Austin and was
based on the 1948 film noir ``Criss Cross.'' Soderbergh told us he
completely rewrote the original's script but was still denied full
credit. So$he used a pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   John Sayles wrote the entire last draft of ``Apollo 13'' yet got
no screen credit. A miffed Sayles told The Independent of London,
``The habit of Hollywood is to have serial writers, to use them a
bit like toilet paper. ... Your claim to a screen credit isn't
based on whether you make it better, but on the percentage of the
script you can prove you've changed. So if you make it 40 percent
worse, you're going to get credit, but if you make it 10 percent
better, you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   When an arbitration panel denied writer David Mamet a
first-position writing credit for ``Wag the Dog,'' director Barry
Levinson threatened to quit the Guild. Hilary Jenkin had adapted
her screenplay for the film from a novel, and Levinson claims Mamet
rearranged sequences, rewrote dialogue and added characters,
including key ones played by Dustin Hoffman and Woody Harrelson.
Mamet skirmished with the Guild again over credit for ``Ronin,''
the Robert De Niro film that opened last week. Director John
Frankenheimer told the Los Angeles Times that Mamet completely
rewrote J.D. Zeik's original script. ``We didn't shoot a line of
Zeik's script,'' he said. Mamet, he added, chose to use the
pseudonym Richard Weisz instead of taking second billing as a form
of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The names of three writers appeared in the credits for ``The
Mask of Zorro,'' but not that of David Ward, who director Martin
Campbell insists rewrote almost every line of dialogue. By not
getting his name on the film, Ward told the Los Angeles Times he
lost out on $150,000 in extra pay.
</P>
<P>
   Guild arbitration is rarely simple* Wright, who went through
screen credit arbitration for ``The Siege,'' which is scheduled to
open Nov. 6, ended up with first-position credit as well as the
line ``Based on a story by Lawrence Wright.'' That means he created
the story and characters and also owns the rights to them. It
doesn't mean he's completely comfortable with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange for me to read the shooting script and see my
characters say things I didn't write,'' says Wright, who is now
working on a script by Pat Conroy about a newspaper editor and is
the fifth writer on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Being rewritten ``is not a terrible thing,'' says Wright. ``If
you're an honest craftsman, sometimes it's better. You can learn
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most writers who have been rewritten generally are not ecstatic
with the results. Dale Launer _ who wrote the screenplays for ``My
Cousin Vinny'' and ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' and will appear on
a panel about Guild issues at 3 p.m. today at the Driskill Hotel as
part of the Austin conference _ had his script for ``Blind Date''
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's probably my worst film,'' he says from Los Angeles.
``I tried to get my name taken off it, but I couldn't. Because I
was guaranteed $125,000 or more for writing a script, the studio
can decide if you can use a pseudonymous name.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he says with a laugh, ``my pseudonym of Vidal
Grosswanker was rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Launer's theory about multiple screen credits is simple. ``Odds
are if you see a single credit on a movie, that person was the only
writer,'' he says. ``When you start seeing a lot of writers, it's
usually not that good of a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Often so many uncredited writers maneuver behind the scenes that
the audience may never know just how much brain power was exerted
to realize the final product. (Fortunately, the audience rarely
cares as long as the movie is good.)
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Daniel Petrie Jr. _ who is president of Writers
Guild of America/West and will appear with Launer on today's Guild
issues panel _ was nominated for best screenplay for ``Beverly
Hills Cop,'' even though it was a rewrite job for him. There were
three scripts before his that took a more dramatic tone and told
different stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio wanted something very different, starting from a
new outline,'' says Petrie from his L.A. office. ``My contribution
was to think about it in more comedic terms. I changed the entire
thing, from structure to characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrie did share ``Story by'' credit with the original writer,
and they sat together at the Oscar ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a New Yorker magazine staffer known largely for his
magazine journalism and books, was on the other end of the
screenwriting journey for his ``Siege'' script, which imagines
internment of U.S. citizens in the wake of a terrorist attack.
After he gave director Edward Zwick a first draft, Zwick asked for
a rewrite. Unsatisfied with it, Zwick took the script and worked on
it with Menno Meyjes. Finally, hot screenwriter Paul Attanasio
(''Quiz Show'') did what's called a ``production rewrite'' on the
script. His script doctoring will go uncredited. (But not
unrewarded: Script doctors earn up to $200,000 a week for their
handiwork.)
</P>
<P>
   The extremely massaged final script is altered but recognizable,
says Wright. ``The structure is very similar and the characters are
the same,'' he says. ``The dialogue is mostly changed, and they
changed the terrorists' weapon from nuclear to conventional. I'm
amazed there's as much of my story left up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though disappointed that he had to be rewritten, Wright is not
surprised. ``It's something every writer in this business
expects,'' he says.

 &HT;    Media coverage of the Big Kat back to football
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Like a turtle coming out of its shell after a
bad storm, Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer has slowly begun
to poke his head out to face the media he feels rained down hard on
him earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The storm erupted in the preseason when Katzenmoyer revealed he
needed to ace three summer school classes _ golf, music and AIDS
awareness _ to remain academically eligible. For the next several
weeks, there was nary an OSU story that didn't mention Katzenmoyer
and his academic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three games and 18 Katzenmoyer tackles later, the stories
on the linebacker have turned back to football. Perhaps no one is
more relieved than The Big Kat himself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, OSU's star linebacker continues to appear genuinely
surprised at the brouhaha that erupted over his eligibility status.
He places the blame for that squarely on the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys chose to make it my team, I guess, (because) I'm the
leader,'' Katzenmoyer told a group of reporters after practice at
the Woody Hayes Athletic Center this week. ``But it never really
was in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although the junior leads the Buckeyes in tackles and is
always a focus of the opposing team's game plan, he has, for now,
simply become another player on a star-studded, No. 1-ranked team.
Quarterback Joe Germaine, wide receivers David Boston and Dee
Miller, tailback Michael Wiley and cornerback Antoine Winfield, to
name a few, have all commanded comparable, if not equal, attention
with their play.
</P>
<P>
   And when OSU players chose their leaders this season, they
selected Jerry Rudzinski, Winfield and Germaine, not Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the Sept. 19 game vs. Missouri, teammates and OSU coach
John Cooper were left to defend the linebacker while he stayed away
from the media. They insisted the preseason scrutiny hadn't
affected him, that he was the same old player despite recording
just six tackles (fifth best on the team) in the Buckeyes first two
games. (He had twice as many in his first two games last season.)
</P>
<P>
   After he racked up 12 tackles against the Tigers in OSU's third
game, Katzenmoyer agreed to be interviewed. Like his teammates and
coaches, he said the preseason scrutiny hadn't affected his play.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits he still has a tough time dealing with the
attention he receives. ``I'm not a people person, I guess,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer is no stranger to Joe Paterno and his No.-7 ranked
Penn State Nittany Lions, who visit Ohio Stadium on Saturday.
Paterno said he tried hard to recruit Katzenmoyer and thinks highly
of the 1997 Butkus Award winner. Despite Penn State's reputation as
Linebacker U, Paterno said he can't remember any Nittany Lion
linebacker quite like the 6-4, 255-pound Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever had any (linebacker) that big and
strong,'' Paterno said. ``He's all business.''

 &HT;    Bengals rookie honored at Tar Heels stadium
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The timing of the bye week couldn't be better for
Bengals linebacker Brian Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   He'll go back to North Carolina and be honored during a home
game against ACC rival Clemson. His name will be placed in the
stadium's ring of honor near Tar Heels legend Lawrence Taylor of
New York Giants fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy about the things I did back there,'' Simmons said.
``But my main focus is to be the type of player here that I was
down there. With time, I think that'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 233-pound rookie is due to make the first start of
his NFL career against Pittsburgh on Oct. 11. He replaces Tom
Tumulty, who suffered torn left knee ligaments in a 31-24 loss at
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons probably would have started sooner, but his move into
the lineup was delayed because of surgery Aug. 27 for a slight
cartilage tear in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   He played briefly against Green Bay and had three tackles
against Baltimore, but didn't perform to the level he was used to
during his All-America career in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell I was rusty,'' Simmons said. ``Toward the end of
the Baltimore game, I started feeling better. I just had some bad
reads where you could tell I was sitting out for three weeks. My
conditioning is not where it needed to be. So this week, I'm
putting extra emphasis on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons joins fellow inside linebacker Takeo Spikes and
cornerback Artrell Hawkins as rookie starters on a struggling
defense ranked 27th overall, yielding 375.3 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Spikes leads the team in tackles (31) and sacks (2), while
Hawkins ranks sixth with 17 tackles. Hawkins got his first NFL sack
against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's my turn to go out there and get my chance to try and
make things happen,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans have stressed a sense of urgency for the rookies to
mature fast since training camp. Spikes ($7.53 million) and Simmons
($5.75 million) are signed for five years, while Hawkins has a
three-year, $1.65 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not paying you to come sit down and watch,'' Simmons
said. ``They want you to go out there and earn your keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being out there making plays. I consider myself a
playmaker. With the snaps I get at that position, I think I can
bring that.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Bengals president Mike Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simmons has to come on,'' Brown said. ``It's a heck of an
opportunity for him. He has all the physical tools. If he picks up
on it, he may be an excellent player and may make the team
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he's young. Yes, there will be times when he makes a
mistake he won't make a year or two from now. We just have to work
through that with him.''

 &HT;    Tuer to focus on speed, discipline, hard work and fun
 &HT;    By Ian Tennant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Speed. Discipline. Hard work and fun. Those are the
attributes Al Tuer wants to use this season as the new head coach
of the Austin Ice Bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a demanding person and a demanding coach,'' the
soft-spoken Tuer said at a news conference recently at the Radisson
Hotel downtown. ``I like to have my fun, but I also enjoy winning
and I enjoy working. I think the only way to have fun is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuer, 35, known as a hard-nosed defenseman during 10 years of
professional hockey, spent nearly 2,500 minutes in the penalty
boxes of various leagues and another 208 minutes in 57 National
Hockey League games, and he has a few scars to prove it. At around
six feet, the trim, blond Tuer (pronounced ``tour'') looks fit
enough to pull on a Bats jersey if need be.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself a coach who runs a disciplined team that
has ``an unmatched work ethic.'' Tuer was coach and general manager
of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the past five seasons and took the
Western Hockey League team to the playoffs three times.
</P>
<P>
   Tuer was a former teammate of Ice Bats General Manager Blaine
Stoughton and Vice President Paul Lawless. Stoughton tried to hire
Tuer in July, and although he was impressed with Austin and the Ice
Bats, Tuer returned to Saskatchewan for what looked like a
promising junior hockey season. But the board that operates the
community-owned amateur Warriors wouldn't let Tuer make some
personnel moves, Tuer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things fell apart for one thing or another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuer was on the phone to Stoughton in mid-August asking if the
contract was still on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shocked,'' Stoughton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that influenced Tuer's decision to move south from the
Canadian prairie city were the chances to focus only on coaching,
move up to the professional level and join a solid organization.
Since arriving last week, one of Tuer's first jobs has been finding
a home for his wife and three children, preferably one with a pool
to help beat the Austin heat. Tuer played in at least 11 U.S.
cities and appeared excited about moving to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of local turf the coach will have to get used to is
the aptly named Bat Cave, the Travis County Exposition Center. When
asked about the Ice Bats' quest to build a new home near downtown
Austin, Tuer said, ``It's a beautiful city, so it should have a
beautiful arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuer's presence behind the bench looks like a good fit for the
Ice Bats. Tuer and Stoughton have discussed players for a couple of
years, and the new coach has a roster stocked mostly with young
western Canadian players.
</P>
<P>
   Tuer acknowledged that his fingerprints are on the Bats. ``I
think we will be young and hungry this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach expects the third line of forwards, traditionally the
checking line, to push the first and second lines to work hard. The
Bats must have roster depth to win the Western Professional Hockey
League's President's Cup, but also ``a group of kids that want to
get there.'' Tuer looks for the Ice Bats to be a high-scoring,
aggressive team that also plays tough defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ice Bats management has cleaned house this summer, and so far
only three players are returning from last season _ Andy Ross, Ryan
Anderson and Mike Jackson. Former Bats player Jim Burton started
last season as coach but was fired Feb. 10, the day before a team
photo was taken, and replaced by Lawless. Burton is now coaching
the expansion Tupelo (Miss.) T-Rex, and Lawless returned to the
front office.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp starts Saturday at Chaparral Ice Center. The first
of four exhibition games is Oct. 8.

 &HT;    COLUMN: A book works magic on long car ride
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What looked like an interminable drive to Cleveland _ as
interminable as only four hours with kids in a motor vehicle can be
_ turned out to be a joy, thanks to one magic trick: a book.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the drive we read From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs.
Basil E. Frankweiler, the 1967 classic about a brother and sister
who run away from home and hide out at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, making amazing discoveries (about themselves and Michelangelo)
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yep _ books are the perfect prescription for the tedium of a
road trip, or just about anything else that ails you. Just ask
folks at the Children's Health Clinic at Children's Medical Center,
where books are quite literally what the doctor orders.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Reach Out and Read'' program, introduced last year,
clinic doctors fill out a prescription, which comes with a free
book, for every child from six months to five years who comes in
for a checkup. During the program's first year, about 2,000 books
have been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinic doctors hand out a neat white card with the
official-looking text: PRESCRIPTION FOR READING: WHAT TO DO: Share
a book with your child. TIMES: Every night at bedtime for 10
minutes every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes advantage of the relationship that already exists
between parent and pediatrician,'' said Dr. Maria Nanagas, director
of the Children's Health Clinic, who introduced the national
program to Dayton. ``The pediatrician is one of the few people who
has day-to-day contact with the parent from day one. We're in a
good position to offer advice to parents to read to their children.
It is taken more seriously, coming from the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reach Out and Read program started at Boston City Hospital
in 1987, based on the theory that failure in school can lead to
other problems such as teen pregnancy and substance abuse. It
became so successful that the American Academy of Pediatrics helped
to launch a national program.
</P>
<P>
   Kids benefit from lap time with Mom and Dad as well as from
having their own library _ a luxury some of Nanagas' patients can't
afford. ``If it's a choice between bread and books, you'll go to
the grocery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring last year from Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum,
Irina Voise, 68, of Riverside had one clear goal for her free time:
She wanted to read to children. (Now, that's my kind of woman.) She
became part of a corps of volunteer readers in the clinic's waiting
room.
</P>
<P>
   Voise loves working with the gifted children: ``I smile to
myself when I think of these children whose diction and mastery of
the English language is so impeccable, who deal with complicated
concepts at an early age with such ease and flair that I switch to
reading to these children from books written for much older
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe working with the average child is even
better: ``I can tell, from visit to visit, when these children
begin to enjoy being read to more and more. The hard-won successes
can be a lot sweeter than the easy ones.''
</P>
<P>
   No, no, after thinking about it, Voise knows what's the best
part of all: ``It is that moment when the parent comes to get the
child in order to go home and the child begins to cry because he or
she wants to be read to some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose she hires out for road trips?

 &HT;    I'm taking leave to take a chance
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   I returned his message on a Thursday morning. It was about 10
o'clock when I borrowed somebody's office, privacy seemed in order,
and dialed up this perfect stranger with the polished voice and the
212 area code.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, holed up in foreign work space, feeling a little _
OK, a lot _ like I did back in 1970 when I was trying out for
eighth-grade cheerleader. Shaking hands. Stomach in knots.
Imagination running full force.
</P>
<P>
   What did a famous literary agent from New York want with me?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, all right already. Maybe I should start at the beginning.
The day I got the phone call from the man who left his name but not
his number.
</P>
<P>
   There I was trudging into the office. It was April and we were
getting ready to pay our income taxes and it was hot outside and I
felt fat and I'd just quit smoking so I was a little nutty.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, another day, another dollar, I was thinking when I
checked my voice mail and some guy named Sterling Lord had left a
message.
</P>
<P>
   I figured he was calling to promote a book or something, so I
instructed my smart phone to save the message for seven days. Then
I proceeded to sit there and brood about the lack of nicotine and
money in my life. When I was done moping about that, I called and
got the local times for Weight Watchers meetings. I think I might
have done some work in between, but I'm only saying that because my
editor will read this.
</P>
<P>
   But the man's message, his smart tone, his lovely style, his
stated profession (I am a literary agent from New York City) kept
my imagination going. And days later, when I mentioned the call to
two people I work with, the woman next to me nearly lost her
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   She had heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out lots of other people had also heard of Sterling Lord,
a prominent New York literary agent who years ago discovered a
young talent named Jack Kerouac. Yes. Sterling Lord is the man who
sold Kerouac's famous On TheRoad. And he was calling me.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after I called my mother and my sister and my brother
and my best friend since kindergarten, after I hyperventilated
myself into what felt like a four-beer stupor, I got the nerve to
call 212 information, get his number and return his phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he often spends weekends in Palm Beach and was calling
to say that maybe, just maybe, he could help me get a book
contract, a little something he did in very short order after I
provided him with a few breathless ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. Good things can happen to chubby,
unsuspecting non-smokers who sit around and mope on company time.
Good things can just reach out from the 212 area code and damn near
grab you.
</P>
<P>
   So, I am taking a leave from my columnist job at The Palm Beach
Post, but just for three months. I will miss you, the calls, the
craziness, the regular purging of my soul with the honest thoughts
that have become both my professional tools and my personal
medicine. It's just that someone, somewhere, is paying me to
collect my thoughts on family and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, somewhere, thinks I can write a book. Some guy named
Sterling Lord.

 &HT;    Commentary: Holy war _ on contraception?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There they go again _ reminding Americans why, even with chagrin
over dumb things done in office, they don't regret having elected
Bill Clinton president.
</P>
<P>
   There they go reminding Americans, particularly women, of the
ballot alternative they had on one of the most fundamental issues
of all: family planning.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is policy makers who couldn't care less about
holistic family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: A group of Republicans led by Rep. Christopher
Smith of New Jersey and Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma is attempting
to revoke a policy approved by the House and Senate that would
allow federal workers' health insurance to cover prescription
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of covering contraception seems a slam dunk. It's
basic health care, basic common sense for an employer _ in this
case, you and me _ who wants to keep employees on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But, no. The Smith-Nickles group asserts that some of the birth
control methods are abortifacients _ meaning they would destroy
fertilized eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cover birth control pills, diaphragms,
intrauterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera.
</P>
<P>
   None of these are designed to be abortifacients. All are
designed to prevent conception. Yes: contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, lord. What the tunnel-vision set does to make the world of
public policy a more difficult place. Health insurance for public
employees is only one example. Here's another.
</P>
<P>
   Since abortion foes can't ban it here or anywhere, you'd think
they would commit themselves to preventing unwanted pregnancies.
But it's just the opposite. They target the agencies around the
world that do the most to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the House passed a foreign appropriations bill
containing an amendment by Rep. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., forbidding
U.S. family planning funds to organizations that ``engage in . .
.efforts to alter laws or government policies of any foreign
country concerning the circumstances under which abortion is
permitted, regulated or prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   This takes up a notch in absurdity a Reagan administration
wrinkle that barred family planning funds to international
organizations that did abortion, even if the funds did not go to
the abortion services. (It's long been against the law for U.S. tax
dollars to fund abortion. That was never the issue.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revoked that policy. Republicans have been trying to
revive it since. Now, in the Wicker amendment, they're talking not
just about forbidding U.S.-funded overseas agencies from doing
abortions but also from expressing views about abortion policies.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton promising a veto to this absurd rule, crucial
foreign appropriations, including reauthorized funds for the
International Monetary Fund, hang in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Republican anti-abortion budget riders have become to lawmaking
in Washington what burrs are to socks. The authors are trying to
make a point _ but what point? Generally these riders in some way
end up impeding birth control, which impedes unwanted pregancy,
which is why women have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this policy of destructive obstruction with Clinton's
common-sense policy aim to make abortion ``legal, safe and rare.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a motto that best fits the public mood and best deals with
reality. All Americans would prefer to see fewer abortions. But the
majority would not ban abortion. The majority would promote more
responsible choices.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled by anti-abortion crusaders who work to undermine those
choices? Look. There they go again.

 &HT;    The ball's in his court
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire's historic season ended Sunday in St. Louis. The
chase for his 70th home run started Monday in Fort Lauderdale on
the second floor of a Las Olas Boulevard bank building.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Law Office of David Kraythen, which specializes
in medical malpractice cases, suddenly became the negotiating
backdrop for perhaps the most prized piece of memorabilia in sports
history.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Kraythen connection is this: Philip Ozersky, the
26-year-old Missouri man who snagged McGwire's record-setting
homer, is a cousin of Kraythen's wife.
</P>
<P>
   So when a dive for a baseball landed Ozersky in a high-pressured
game of faxes, sports agents and seven-figure offers, the frazzled
research scientist called his cousin Francine in Florida for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they start talking about million-dollar offers and
drawing up insurance for the ball and if I need insurance for
myself, it's time to get somebody who knows about the law, somebody
you can trust,'' Ozersky said Tuesday in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was grateful to have someone I know I can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kraythen, a lawyer for 26 years, said he isn't charging
Ozersky a nickel. ``It's been mind-boggling to this kid. He has
been inundated. He had problems sleeping (Sunday) night. He turned
to his family for help. Hopefully we'll be able to make his life a
little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Making life easier for Ozersky this week has meant a much busier
and exciting week for Kraythen's office, just down the boulevard
from the offices of Florida Marlins owner H. Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraythen sorts out offers for the ball of up to $1 million
from professional memorabilia dealers, associate lawyer Mike
Freedlund spent part of Tuesday fielding calls from The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno, Today (Ozersky is tentatively scheduled to
appear Friday), and Late Show With David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   And the ball? It's in a safe-deposit box in a St. Louis bank.
It's next move may be across the street from where it was hit _
near Busch Stadium at the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame, which
hopes to open a temporary display of the ball in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky, a season-ticket holder for the St. Louis Rams football
team, decided at the last minute to attend McGwire's final game for
a chance to see history.
</P>
<P>
   History came screaming right at him in the seventh inning.
Ozersky, who was with friends in a party suite behind the
left-field wall at Busch Stadium, said he picked up the flight of
the ball ``just over the third baseman's head.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball kept getting bigger. ``People were screaming, `It's
coming here! It's coming here!' I was moving toward it, but you
didn't want to get in its way. It hit a couple of (other fans')
hands, and they're still black and blue today.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ball hit a wall and bounced under some bleachers,
Ozersky said he threw his body flat on the ground to get a better
look. ``And it was right there. I picked it up and said, `Oh, my,
God. . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky said he was not injured in the pileup. In newspaper
photographs the next day, he is shown holding the ball with what
appears to be a black-and-blue mark under his left eye. ``That's a
birthmark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals tried to pressure him into giving the ball to
McGwire, but Ozersky said he wasn't sure what he wanted to do and
wanted time to think. He tried to sleep Sunday night, with the ball
in a basket next to his pillow. ``I got maybe an hour's sleep. At
5:30, the phone started ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ozersky nor Kraythen will say how many offers have been
made. But St. Louis attorney Alan S. Cohen said he represents three
collectors who have combined to offer Ozersky $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the deadline on that offer is 4:50 p.m. EDT Thursday.
deadline was 72 hours after the end of SUnday's game which ended at
3:50 Central time/ deadline was extended a day because Wednesday is
Yom Kippur Ozersky said he won't be rushed into making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't a had a second to put some good thought into
it,'' he said. ``Before the game, people were saying, `If I catch
ball. . . .' I was like, `Right!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky laughed that he should have had a clue, when the game's
ceremonial first pitch was thrown by actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who is
known for his famous ``SHow me the money!'' line in the movie
``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the best piece of advice he's gotten so far was from
Krayeth who told him: ``It can have a positive change in your life
and it can have a negative change. Notoriety and `Fifteen Minutes
of Fame can do different things to differnt people. He needs to be
cognizant of that.''

 01-COX &HT;    Jailer hasn't missed a day in 16 years
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you think Cal Ripken is an iron man who
exemplifies the work ethic, check out Sgt. Curtis Ladewig of the
Travis County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's a real role model who deserves a spot in the Blue
Collar Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's major-league record of playing in 2,632 consecutive
baseball games came to an end a week ago Sunday, when he took
himself out of the lineup. Ripken's streak began on May 30, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, 1982, Ladewig began working for the sheriff's
office. And, according to Deborah Rich, the sheriff's personnel
coordinator, he hasn't taken a sick day yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's right, not even a sick hour,'' said Ladewig, 62,
a modest, soft-spoken guy who works the graveyard shift as a
supervisor at the Travis County Correctional Complex in Del Valle.
</P>
<P>
   Ladewig attributes his string to good genes and not wanting to
leave his fellow employees holding the bag while he's home with the
sniffles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an accident of genetics, I suppose,'' Ladewig said
of his longstanding good health. ``I had the foresight to choose my
parents wisely.'' A trim fellow, Ladewig also says he doesn't order
Big Macs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ladewig also attributes his streak to want-to and accepting
responsibility. Mothers, have your kids read this part of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder, `Man, if I could only get off today to do this or
that,' '' Ladewig said. ``But if you're not there, somebody has to
be. Somebody has to take up the slack and take your position. And
then you're altering somebody else's day.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy Dan Richards has been in law enforcement since
1969. He says he's never been around a string like Ladewig's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have met me a lot of cops, and I have logged a few sick days
myself,'' Richards said. ``And being a supervisor, I'm familiar
with the concept, `Oh, Sarge, I can't come in today. I feel so
bad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of feeling bad, Ladewig admits there were days when he
felt like taking himself out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not some kind of Superman,'' he said. ``I've had colds.''
He also admits to having been late for work a few times.
</P>
<P>
   So he missed the National Anthem now and again. Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's and Ladewig's careers are remarkably similar, with
Ladewig beginning his streak just a few months after Ripken started
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's kinda close,'' Ladewig said. ``Course, he kinda
voluntarily broke his string.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you compare their schedules, Ladewig's ongoing
accomplishment beats Ripken's record like a set of bongos. The
regular baseball season runs from late March or early April into
September and includes 162 games. But since they continually throw
people in jail out in Del Valle, Ladewig's season lasts all year.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to talk night games, Ladewig's current shift
starts at 10 p.m. and doesn't end until 8 the next morning. That's
worse than playing a night game in Anaheim, then catching the
red-eye for Kansas City. At least you can try to sleep on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working all night, you never get used to it,'' said Ladewig,
who began his career with the sheriff's office as a jailer at the
old county jail downtown, on top of the Travis County Courthouse.
``You're completely out of sync with everybody else. You're eatin'
supper when they're eatin' breakfast. But that's the nature of the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Ladewig going to take himself out of the game any time
soon? Sure doesn't sound like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably now that I've gone this far into the season,
I'll try to play it out as long as providence keeps me healthy,''
he said.

 &HT;    Unplanned growth can swamp small companies
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- Snagging a contract with a big company such as Dell
Computer Corp. or IBM presents two issues to a small business
owner.
</P>
<P>
   First, the small business owner must get in the door to make the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the owner must be ready for the sudden increase in
business with enough employees and money to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the other way around ?
</P>
<P>
   ``If an extraordinary large volume of new business comes in that
requires people and capital and it isn't planned,'' says Austin
business consultant Ron Walters, co-owner of R.D. Walters
Consulting &AMP; Associates, ``it can be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Saper, co-founder of Saper Media Group, used a combination
of contacts, luck and tenacity to nab some of his first big
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Saper Media got its foot in the door at Dell six months ago when
it partnered with T3, one of Dell's primary vendors, to develop
Dell's small business Web site. Saper had become friends with T3's
owners while he was working for AT&AMP;T. Saper Media has since won
contracts to build the Dell University Web site and is now
completing a Web site for its Brazil customers.
</P>
<P>
   Building a client roster that includes such companies as Dell
and Tivoli Systems helps Saper Media when it is trying to get the
attention of new customers, says Jeri Saper, co-founder of the
company. ``I think it legitimizes us,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helps us get appointments,'' adds Paul Saper, ``but it
doesn't necessarily help us close the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Good old-fashioned luck can also play a part in winning
important clients. Geofox Ltd., a British company that makes
hand-held computers, came across Saper Media's Web site a year ago.
Geofox happened to have an executive flying into Austin and
arranged to meet. A few days later they signed a contract. The
Geofox contract has led to a major relationship with Tivoli
Systems, now one of Saper's biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   Guts played a part in how Saper Media won the attention of
Samsung Austin Semiconductor three years ago. Paul Saper says he
was at a local copying store when he happened to see a Samsung
executive's business card lying on the counter. He quickly jotted
down the name and phone number and placed a call when he got back
to the office.
</P>
<P>
   He reached a key executive with Samsung and a member of the team
choosing a vendor. ``He said, 'Your timing is perfect. Can you send
over a proposal today?' '' Saper says that within two weeks he had
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Walters, the Austin business consultant, says small companies
eager to grow quickly must make sure they have sufficient resources
lined up before going for the big contracts.
</P>
<P>
   He says getting a large influx of business when a small company
isn't ready can create untold problems. If the employees, financing
and other resources aren't in place when the contract comes in, it
will undermine its reputation for doing quality work, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sometimes difficult for the small entrepreneur that is
working very diligently to grow their business to accept,'' Walters
says. ``Too much growth, too quickly can be as devastating as not
enough business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Triplett, co-founder of the Entrepreneurs' Association, says
small companies must also be ready to adapt their operations to
mesh with how the corporation wants to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things about working with a large company is when
they say 'jump' you say, 'how high,' '' Triplett says.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey August, who owns 5-year-old Lone Star Direct, says she
had lined up several hundred thousand dollars in credit at Frost
Bank and Compass Bank in anticipation of landing a major contract.
She says she followed Walters' advice to line up financing, even
though it still wasn't clear to her why she needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, ``Why do I have this huge line of credit ? I don't
even have the business,' '' she recalls. But when National Heritage
Insurance Co. suddenly placed a $70,000 contract with Lone Star
Direct, which is a direct mail and marketing company, it took every
bit of the credit she'd arranged.
</P>
<P>
   August says lines of credit are important for her company's
cash-flow when a contract with a large company comes in. She says
up to half of the contract can be the cost of postage. While small
customers can quickly write a check to advance her company money
for the postage necessary to process the orders, it can take much
longer to get these payments from large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is done on purchase orders. It may take 60 to 90
days to get paid because of the red tape,'' she says. ``I really
have to groom my clients and tell them why I need postage prepaid a
month from now.''
</P>
<P>
   She says Lone Star Direct's willingness to front postage costs
has helped it win contracts, as well as its flexibility in handling
sudden orders.
</P>
<P>
   She says an employee at Harte-Hanks Direct Marketing called Lone
Star Direct when the company couldn't find the quick help it needed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked for a miracle. She needed a job processed within 24
hours,'' August says. ``It was a three- to four-day regular turn. I
jumped to it and hired temporary workers and got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   August says Lone Star's relationship with IBM Corp. started
after she had approached nearly two dozen IBM executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the company's current vendor defaulted, they had
something on file on me,'' she recalled. ``They said, 'OK, you're
on.' '' Paul Saper, with Saper Media, has found that while it's
nice to win contracts with large customers, it is also important
that a company keep a good balance of smaller customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any small business, you have to be careful not to put too
many eggs in one basket,'' he says. He says Saper Media's largest
client represents less than 20 percent of its total revenues. ``It
means you have more interactions with more companies, but it
ensures no one company is driving your revenue base.''

 &HT;    Eaton to close plant in Austin
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eaton Corp., reacting to the prolonged
semiconductor slump, will close its 239-employee Austin
semiconductor equipment plant and transfer its operations to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will lay off 200 workers in Austin starting
Dec. 1. It will phase out production at the Austin plant, located
on Spectrum Drive near RM 620, by March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 workers will be asked to move to Beverly, Mass.,
where the company's semiconductor equipment business is based.
Another 30 Eaton employees will remain in Austin to support and
service Eaton equipment installed in local chip manufacturing
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of the restructuring of Eaton's semiconductor
equipment business that will include eliminating 275 jobs outside
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Eaton Corp. of Cleveland, will take a $42
million charge against earnings in the current quarter to pay for
the restructuring. The company expects to take additional charges
of about $4 million in each of the following two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, like other chip-equipment makers, is feeling the impact
of lower semiconductor sales around the world. Chip makers have
postponed new factories and expansions, which hurts demand for
equipment makers such as Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
Maureen Hart, an Easton spokeswoman. ``We don't see the market
coming back until the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to lose $80 million this year in its
semiconductor equipment business with revenue down 50 percent, Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin plant makes ion implantation equipment, which is used
to bombard silicon wafers with precise amounts of chemical
impurities -- called dopants _ to change their electrical
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million plant was completed in 1996 to accommodate the
company's business expansion in Austin, where Eaton has had
manufacturing operations for nearly two decades. Employment peaked
around 400 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton becomes the latest Austin casualty in the long-running
slump, which began late last year. Other semiconductor and related
companies cutting jobs include Applied Materials Inc., many of
Applied's suppliers, and Motorola Inc., which has offered a sizable
voluntary severance plan. Motorola is signaling to workers that it
will eliminate jobs if enough employees leave the company
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton officials said they examined other alternatives before
deciding to close. ``In the final analysis, we took the action that
we felt would best preserve our business for the future and be in
the best interests of our entire work force,'' said Mary Puma, vice
president and general manager of the Implant Systems Division.
</P>
<P>
   All Austin full-time workers will receive severance pay,
extended medical benefits and outplacement services.
</P>
<P>
   After it cuts 475 jobs, Eaton Semiconductor expects to have
1,050 workers worldwide. The company is the second largest maker of
ion implantation devices. It also makes other semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said companies like Eaton are making cutbacks now
because forecasts indicate that an upturn is at least a year away.
</P>
<P>
   Pathfinder Research of San Jose, Calif., said its latest
forecast calls for the chip industry revenues to shrink by 12
percent this year to $120 billion. The research firm says the
industry may grow modestly in 1999 if the world economy doesn't
weaken further.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company is a $7.6 billion maker of equipment for the
automobile, industrial, construction, commercial and semiconductor
markets.

 01-COX &HT;    ``I was only dying'': Feminist author chronicles campaign to
beat cancer
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marilyn French was supposed to be dead five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She heard the doctors diagnose her in 1992 with terminal
esophageal cancer, and give her a year to live.
</P>
<P>
   But the 68-year-old feisty feminist, probably best known for her
1977 novel, The Women's Room, is still alive, although neither she
nor her doctors can say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you really talk to doctors who are honest,
they will admit they don't know anything about it. They have no
idea who will die and who will live, especially with cancer and
heart attacks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for the spreading cancer was terrifying. French, who
has a home on Singer Island, struggled through horrendous radiation
and chemotherapy that broke her back (repeated radiation exposure
can damage the spine), weakened her heart and affected her brain.
</P>
<P>
   She survived a two-week coma.
</P>
<P>
   Having been through such an overwhelming, life-altering
experience, she performed almost a cleansing ritual: She documented
her journey in her newest book, A Season in Hell, a Memoir ($23,
Knopf.)
</P>
<P>
   French emerged from this journey with changed perceptions about
life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming sick, she had left written instructions _ a
living will _ that she didn't want any extraordinary means to keep
her alive. But her son, Rob, refusing to believe she wouldn't
recover from her coma, wouldn't authorize pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you've never been sick, the thought of being sick
is enough to make you want to die,'' she says of her reasons for
the living will. ``That you might not be able to digest your food
or excrete by yourself is so horrifying, you think you want to pull
the plug. When it actually happens to you, you have a different
view. Most of us cling to life ferociously.''
</P>
<P>
   And she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was quite prepared to die,'' she recalls. ``I had
some important work (already done), my children were grown and
didn't need me. But I didn't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, French would visualize herself free of cancer, a
process she credits with helping her make it through.
</P>
<P>
   She also credits heredity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's my father's genes and the love people gave me,''
she says. ``And if I had anything to do with it at all, it probably
was through my powers of visualization. But I'm not sure I had
anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   She is sure she had something to do with getting sick in the
first place. She had been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day since
she was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, doctors and friends urged me to quit,'' she writes,
``but I rationalized. There was no cancer on either side of my
family, and beyond that, I couldn't believe that an activity I
enjoyed so much could harm me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is grateful that she is relatively well today. But she
suffers many residual effects of her illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't walk very well. I don't feel my feet. It makes walking
a little tricky. My heart is not great, but these are things you
can really live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still do almost everything I wanted to do. One thing
that's sort of impossible is the kind of travel I like to do. My
immune system is compromised and there are lots of foods I can't
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has noticed that her children are progressively
forgetting more and more details of her ordeal as she continues to
remember with greater clarity.
</P>
<P>
   French has a simple explanation for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went through it so bravely, I don't think they can bear
to remember,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only dying. It is terrible to watch somebody you love
die.''

 &HT;    Nationwide Insurance accused of discrimination
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nationwide Insurance, the country's
fourth-largest insurance company, has illegally discriminated
against some Texans based on their race, ethnicity and age,
according to a state regulator who recently recommended a record
$10 million fine against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, which denied the allegations, sells auto, homeowners
and other insurance in the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San
Antonio and Waco-Temple areas. Last year, the Texas Department of
Insurance, prompted by lawmakers and an independent report on
insurance marketing, began investigating Nationwide's sales in all
of its markets except the Waco-Temple area, where offices only
recently were opened.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Haley, an attorney for the department, on Tuesday told
Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer that the Nationwide
investigation revealed that the company has denied auto insurance
to some Texans based solely on their age. He also said the company
has used a marketing strategy that ``systematically exclude(s)
minority customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Haley, Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, limits
the areas in which its agents can solicit business based on the
location of its offices. ``The effect of this market strategy is to
steer Nationwide agents away from sales in ZIP code areas where the
population consists predominantly of racial minorities ,'' Haley
said. ``The pattern is consistent in every Texas market where
Nationwide has made its products available.'' Haley did not provide
specifics. A check of Nationwide's Austin-area offices shows all
its Austin offices are west of Interstate 35. Most of the city's
predominantly minority neighborhoods are east of the interstate.
The company also has an office in Round Rock and one near
Pflugerville. Bob Sohovich, an Ohio-based spokesman for Nationwide,
said that before the state's investigation, the company began a new
effort to solicit business in urban areas of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not violated any Texas law,'' Sohovich said. ``We are
not ignoring the issue. We want to serve every section of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Sohovich added that Nationwide insurance can be purchased over
the telephone and is not limited to direct, agent sales. He said he
did not know whether agents' sales efforts were limited by
territory and could not find out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, Nationwide and its various companies covered 2.6
percent of the insured homes in Texas and about 2.7 percent of the
insured cars. That made the company the state's sixth-largest home
insurer and seventh-largest auto insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1993 state law, specifics about the insurance department
investigation are not public information. For that reason, the
department would not disclose in which ZIP codes it believes
Nationwide has discriminated against residents, the disparity
between the amount of coverage sold in non-minority areas vs. the
number of policies sold in minority-dominated areas or how long it
believes Nationwide has used a marketing strategy that results in
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Haley never used the term redlining, an illegal practice of
denying coverage based only on such things as race, ethnicity,
income and where a person lives. Allegations of redlining would
have to include proof that a company intended to deny coverage to
certain people. Allegations of discrimination can be proved
regardless of intent.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance department spokesman Jim Davis said there are limited
circumstances in which such things as income and where a person
lives can legally be used to determine coverage. The department's
allegations against Nationwide do not fall under those
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, head of the Southwestern Insurance Information
Service, an industry group, said he doesn't believe Nationwide or
any other Texas insurer uses redlining or discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flatly reject any allegations that we practice unfair
discrimination in the sale of our products,'' he said on behalf of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recommending a $10 million fine, Haley told Bomer
that he should consider modifying the fine if Nationwide could
prove it was spending money that directly resulted in more policies
being sold in the areas where discrimination has been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this action is to induce Nationwide to open its
business to everyone in the local markets where it does business,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Birny Birnbaum, an insurance data analyst for the
Center for Economic Justice, said the department's action proves
there is redlining going on in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum has been fighting for access to insurers' marketing
reports that he said would lend more proof to such allegations.
Industry officials have fought the release of the information,
saying it would negatively affect competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious why the insurers don't want it to be available,''
Birnbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's investigation, and calls for action from state
lawmakers, came after the center last year released a report on
redlining using information similar to that for which Birnbaum has
been fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they worked on the Nationwide case for
nearly a year and are negotiating for a settlement with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide has 20 days to formally reply to Haley's letter to
Bomer. If a settlement is not reached, the allegations would be
considered by a state administrative judge before Bomer could levy
a fine or take some other action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the commissioner acts quickly to stop Nationwide from
these discriminatory actions,'' Birnbaum said. The department also
has investigated five other companies. Action against two is
pending in the department's legal department. A seventh
investigation is ongoing.

 &HT;    Wright Glider replica erected at WSU
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's just wood, fabric and a little metal, but
the object that went on display in Wright State University's
Student Union started a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 1902 Wright Glider, or rather a faithful reproduction
of the glider that proved the Wright brothers' design for a flying
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Young of Richmond, W.Va., the glider's builder and pilot,
brought the kite-like craft to Dayton this week to display it
during the National Aerospace Conference. The conference runs
Thursday through Saturday morning at Wright State.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he also plans to display the glider Sunday afternoon
outside the Wright Cycle Shop, 22 S. Williams St., weather
permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really wonderful to bring this back to Dayton,'' Young
said Tuesday. ``This is the machine (the Wrights) patented. It's
fully as important as the Kitty Hawk Flyer,'' which made the
world's first successful powered flights in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he built the glider in 1978 and has flown it several
times for an IMAX film and public television specials about the
Wright brothers. He made the flights near Kitty Hawk, N.C., where
Orville and Wilbur Wright flew a series of kites and gliders before
flying a powered craft based on the 1902 machine.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was pleased to bring the glider here because
Dayton has never had much luck in having a replica of the 1902
machine on display.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrights abandoned the original 1902 glider at Kitty Hawk, he
said. In the 1930s, Army engineers at McCook Field, with Orville
Wright's help, made drawings of the glider and built a replica,
which was later demolished, he said. Another was later built, but
Young said it was donated to the Wright Brothers National Monument
at Kitty Hawk for a new visitors' center in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A new local group, the First to Fly Foundation, sponsored the
glider's visit in an effort to draw attention to its plan to buy a
set of rare documents from the Wright Co., the aircraft company the
Wrights founded. First to Fly member Nick Engler said a private
collector in Florida owns the documents; the group wants to raise
$900,000 to buy them for the Paul Laurence Dunbar Library at Wright
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``These papers cover a time period in the Wright brothers'
history that are not in any repository,'' said Dawne Dewey, head of
special collections and archives at Wright State. ``We would be
overjoyed to be the recipient of such a collection,'' she said, but
she added that Wright State is not involved in the fund-raising
effort.

 &HT;    Some good bad fun with Dan Jenkins
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The good news is that even though Dan Jenkins
has sworn off all the fun stuff that's bad for you, his fictional
characters have not. (One of the myriad advantages of being a
fictional character is you don't have to watch your cholesterol.)
The usual suspects in his new novel, ``Rude Behavior,'' have been
with him since 1972's ``Semi-Tough.'' And although they're older,
they're unrepentant in their personal habits: They smoke, drink,
inhale slabs of red meat, drive drunk and make ethnic jokes. They
litter.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a Fort Worth native who now splits his time between
Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., and Manhattan, has survived decades of not
dissimilar behavior. Jenkins was one of the handful of star scribes
that made Sports Illustrated a high-flying magazine. ``SI was a big
drinking place and we socialized a lot, and we had huge expense
accounts and ran around the world with rich and famous people and
it was fun,'' says Austin's Bud Shrake, a friend and former
colleague of Jenkins'.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is a little slower for Jenkins these days. He still
writes a column for Golf Digest and covers the major tournaments
for the magazine. Books have come out of him with regularity, too _
15 in all. ``Semi-Tough'' became the cornerstone of a trilogy, and
Jenkins isn't sure he's done with these characters yet. The book
follows Billy Clyde Puckett, now retired from both football and,
more recently, the broadcast booth, in his efforts to win an NFL
franchise for a team he dubs the West Texas Tornadoes. There is a
lot of cussing, a lot of impolite remarks, and a lot of the action
takes place in barrooms. That's how you can tell it's a Jenkins
book. Politically correct it's not, but then satire never is.
People are still hollering about a certain word Mark Twain used
abundantly in ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' after all.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Jenkins at his Florida home, the morning after
Mark McGwire's historic 62nd season home run. You could tell it was
a big deal, because Jenkins _ whose attitude toward baseball can
most charitably be described as ambivalent _ watched it. Or at
least parts of it. What follows is an edited transcript of that
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mark McGwire _ did you watch? Do you care?
</P>
<P>
   A: I flipped over every time he came up to bat. I was watching
tennis. So I saw him walk and hit a home run. That was a great
moment, really. I like baseball when they get down to it and
there's something special going on. And I don't care how many
steroids he takes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you feel about the new book?
</P>
<P>
   A: It took a little longer to do this one because I had some
health problems, but I like it. It's these characters I've had for
a few years. I started on this book four years ago, and I keep
going to golf tournaments, and then I had some health problems. I
had a bypass, had a gall bladder out and all those things that
happen to guys when they get older. It just delayed getting over to
the word processor. Novels are hard but fun. They're fun because
you don't have to ask anybody anything, unlike journalism. You just
make it up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've had these characters a long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: 1972 with ``Semi-Tough.'' These are characters I know pretty
well. I guess there's a lot of me in all of them. There are certain
ideas I like to express from time to time. There's probably more of
me in Big Ed. Everybody thinks I'm supposed to be Billy Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   Q: They're not exactly politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well they're not supposed to be. Political correctness is my
sworn enemy. But that's fun, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you worry about being accused of ethnic insensitivity, or
has it happened so often you don't notice any more?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never worried about that. You may find this hard to
understand, but I believe this book is more politically correct
than people think. The women are always smarter and the black guys
always win. One of the nicest compliments I ever got was when
``Semi-Tough'' came out and I got a note from Alex Haley, who said,
``I want you to know this is the most anti-racist book I've ever
read.'' I'm used to being called a racist. I know that going in.
But I usually get pretty good reaction from people I consider
intelligent. I hope people buy it because it's funny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the section on how to tamper with airplane lavatory smoke
detectors so you can sneak cigarettes taken from direct experience?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't smoke any more. I had to give it up. But I started
thinking, If I did smoke, what would I do? Although I did know a
Hollywood guy, an agent, who told me to take the cellophane and the
Scotch tape and put it over the smoke detector in the john.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of Hollywood, you've had some close calls. How does
a writer survive out there?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't. If they offer you money, take it. And you have no
control. Bud Shrake and I have had a lot of dealings with
Hollywood. It's been fun, but it's also been agony and you just
never win. They keep giving you money for development, and you just
think, (use) me again. Give me another $100,000 to not make my book
into a movie. But the thing about it is, it's all such a committee
deal out there. The only time the movie is yours is in the first
draft. But they've never shot a first draft of anything in the
history of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After so many decades and pieces, how is it you have anything
to say about golf?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do a monthly column and the four majors (tournaments) and
that keeps me off the streets. I get to go to the things and hear
lines I can steal for my books. I've now been to more major
championships that anybody that lived, I'm certain. I've been to 47
straight Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few of the old guard like Frank DeFord have returned to
Sports Illustrated. Would you ever consider that?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I left, I left. No, I'd never even consider it. It's not
run by intelligent human beings any more. It's not a writer's
magazine, it's an editor's magazine. We always thought we were
doing journalism when we were there. I don't know what they think
they're doing now. They target a younger audience. It's got that
comic book look to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what do you read?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read the New Yorker, I take Vanity Fair, I read almost
anything that'll help me impeach Clinton, I take The New York Times
_ Maureen Dowd is my favorite writer in America. I read a lot of
World War II stuff, anything I can get my hands on about the Civil
War, I read all the James Lee Burkes and all the detective writers
for fun, but I read for recreation. I re-read a lot too, people
like Raymond Chandler. I don't read literature. You'll never catch
me with a Cormac McCarthy in my hand, or Updike. I looked at that
Modern Library list (the controversial list of the 20th century's
100 best novels written in English) and figured I'd read about 11
of them and hadn't heard of about 20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much are you on the road?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I go to those golf tournaments, and we have an
apartment in New York, and we go back to Fort Worth. I travel more
than most people. The 23 or 24 years I worked for SI, I was gone
every other week. Having traveled all my life, it doesn't seem like
I'm traveling at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the road take its toll on you physically?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it did, but I'm 67 years old. I've had bypass, I've
had hernia operations, dental implants, eye problems, all that
stuff catches up with you. It kind of hit me all at once. You pay
for your sins _ you pay for your fun, really. So I'm leading a
clean life now, got my golf game back now where I can break 80.
Life is good. All I miss is cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People still think you live in Texas, even though it's been
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ten years after I left the (Dallas) Times Herald, guys still
talked about how I had a column there. Most people don't leave, and
they don't think anybody else leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the next book?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've read so many bad golf books lately. They're all full of
Zen. I'm gonna write a thin, funny golf novel. I wrote one comic
golf novel, ``Dead Solid Perfect,'' but it was before the golf
boom. And somewhere down the line I'd like to write a memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thanks for the time. Any parting shots?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nah. If you need anything else, just make it up.

 &HT;    Author Windle retraces Texas Hill Country steps
 &HT;    Embargoed for 10/1
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The cool, clear Blanco River and the limestone
bluffs of Central Texas provide a pleasing setting for Janice Woods
Windle's new historical novel, ``Hill Country.'' Her first novel
since ``True Women,'' this one takes up where that one left off.
Published by Longstreet, it's a seductive mix of family stories and
pure fact.
</P>
<P>
   The central character is the author's grandmother, Laura Hoge
Woods, who grew up in the pioneer days of the 1870s and lived to
age 93, long enough to see the son of her close friend Rebekah
Baines Johnson become President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The episodes in 'Hill Country' are true,'' said Windle,
speaking slowly and deliberately. ``The dialogue, of course, is
made up. There are a lot of thought patterns in the book. There's
no way of knowing what somebody is thinking. So that makes it
historical fiction, which is kind of its own unique little genre
and has the best of both. You can be very nonfiction and very
fiction _ whichever side of the rope you choose to jump on.''
</P>
<P>
   She jumps on both sides. Windle admits the first part of the
novel is more myth; the second part, historically accurate.
Interspersed with the story are family photos and some typed pages
left behind by Laura late in life. But how much is true?
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the scene where 14-year-old Laura meets
Herman Lehmann, a white boy captured by the Apaches who had spent
nine years with them before coming home. A romance begins as they
bathe in the dinosaur footprints of the Blanco River: ``Laura
lowered herself into the footprint. She was several feet away from
where Herman lay in the other footprint made by the monster's
passing, yet she felt connected to the wild boy by the light that
passed between their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a Herman Lehmann who lived with the Indians, and
Windle depicts him according to local legend. There are dinosaur
footprints in the Blanco River. Laura Hoge knew of Lehmann and
spoke admiringly about him. But did they ever meet? Was there a
romance?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had a real fascination with him as a young girl,
and they were about the same age,'' Windle said with a slight
smile. ``Now whether she had a big romance with him or not _ I
don't know that. Come closer in time and I can start to verify a
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   You may remember Windle as the accidental novelist who in middle
age started out years back to write a family cookbook and ended up
in 1994 with a best-selling book, followed by a TV mini-series. It
did not hurt that she spent her childhood reading historical
novelist Irving Stone.
</P>
<P>
   She has now taken what her first publisher, Putnam, edited from
that book, researched more and created this new novel based on that
storyline and her grandmother's autobiography. Her grandmother had
started to write a book and left it, typed on a blue Olivetti
purchased for that purpose, behind in a tin box marked, ``For
Janice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I first thought the book 'True Women' would end with Laura's
story,'' Windle said. ``I wanted to go all the way through Suffrage
and show women as active participants in Texas politics and
decision-making today.'' So what to the author seemed at first a
crushing defeat _ the paring of the Laura narrative from 'True
Women' _ she recreated as a longer, more imposing story. ``It's
good it worked out the way it did,'' she says, ``because I found so
many more things.''
</P>
<P>
   Windle is quick to share the credit with those who helped with
stories about her grandmother's life and the Blanco area. Though
the author lives in El Paso, she returned to the Hill Country to
talk about her book.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed at the historic Blanco County courthouse recently,
she introduced Foster Carroll Smith, a storyteller and former high
school teacher, who showed her the dinosaur footprints and told her
stories of Lehmann and of Al Lackey and how he came to be hanged on
a tree overlooking the road to Johnson City _ U.S. 281 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This old Lackey came home one day and his daughter was sitting
on the front porch nursing the baby. He shot his daughter _ the old
son of a gun did that,'' Smith said, ``and later he took his pocket
knife out and s throat, but he didn't cut deep enough. He
went out, got on his horse...then the posse got him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time my husband brought me to Blanco, we went out
the the old Woods home,'' said Windle's mother Virginia Woods, who
lives in Seguin and contributed to both novels. ``My husband's
sister Agatha was along and she showed me the old hanging tree.
'Remember how fast we used to run past it going to school?' she
asked him.''
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of the author, Doyle Hoge, has driven over from
Kerrville, to talk about Old Boomer, the gun Laura's mother wields
against the Indians in ``Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have that shotgun,'' Doyle says. He remembered his
great-grandmother, Laura's mother, telling about two Indian raids.
``The men were all out working horses, or were away from the
ranches,'' Doyle said. ``Little Mattie (Grandma) Hoge said they had
been instructed to go to the river, to hide in a cove down there
when the Indians came. It was just really interesting to hear that
from someone who was part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Blanco, Laura and Rebekah Johnson grew up across the river
from each other. They grew to be close friends, and this is an
important part of the narrative. Standing in front of what was once
Rebekah Johnson's home, Janice points down to where her grandmother
lived. ``If you cut across _ the Woods property ran down to the
river...''
</P>
<P>
   In the foreword to the novel, the author describes being a child
in Seguin in 1948 when Lyndon Johnson arrived in a helicopter:
``Each time the Johnson City Windmill prepared to land, Lyndon
would throw his hat to the crowd and his advance man Jake Pickle
would retrieve the hat by offering a dollar for its return. People
always gave the hat back. My grandmother Laura Woods is probably
the only one who did not.''
</P>
<P>
   For the latter part of the book, Janice's mother was a source,
as was the former first lady, Lady Bird Johnson. ``Mother and my
father were on the porch in Johnson City when LBJ decided to run
for office for the first time,'' Windle said.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who recently turned 60, said she was born when Laura
Hoge Woods was 66. ``I knew her very well and spent a lot of time
with her. She told me a lot about herself, and she left notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Janice Woods Windle's zeal for research and her
flair for dramatic incidents, and you have an engrossing novel that
could make the Hill Country even more of a tourist lure.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Announcer: We interrupt this program for
News Center 911's continuing coverage of ``Hurricane Georges _ Palm
Beach County Under Siege.'' Now, with the area's only Double-Dutch
Doppler, Accu-Tracku Pinpoint Weather, here are anchors Chandrell
Scratchit and Laurel Annoy. Scratchit: As Hurricane Georges pounds
the Mississippi Delta, Palm Beach County wonders, ``Are we out of
the woods yet?'' Hello, I'm Chandrell Scratchit. Annoy: And I'm
Laurel Annoy. Welcome to live, exclusive, continuing team coverage
of Hurricane Georges. Let's go right to the weather center with
John Tenderloyns, who's been up for six straight days now
monitoring this dangerous, monster storm. John: (unshaven, fidgety
and blinking furiously) As you can see from this satellite picture
taken in Deep Space, here's South Florida, and here's Biloxi,
Mississippi. It's easy to think of Hurricane Georges as 800 miles
away from us and fading. But if you look at this space picture, you
can see just how close we are to this killer storm. Sackitt: Sorry
to break in, John, but we have a live, exclusive report from
Tiffany Pie, who's battling breezes in Boynton. Tiffany: It might
look sunny and pleasant here, Chandrell. But moments ago, the wind
kicked up, registering nearly 17 miles an hour on my hand-held
anemometer. Annoy: Please, be careful, Tiffany. Tiffany: As the
camera pans behind me, you can see this house here has significant
palm frond damage. One of these fronds dropped in the past hour.
The sound was just . . . Scratchit: Excuse me, Tiffany. The lawn
seems pretty wet, too. Is that from a feeder band packing winds
with a powerful punch? Tiffany: No, actually, the homeowner was
running his sprinklers this morning. Annoy: Tiffany, we're going to
have to break away. Our team coverage continues with Rachele
Quixote, who is standing by outside Forest Hill High School.
Quixote: As you can see, the school is closed today, the parking
lot empty, and an eerie, eerie calm has descended here. Annoy: Wow,
that's eerie. Some might say that schools are closed today for a
Jewish holiday, rather than the hurricane. Quixote: That may have
played into the decision. But sources tell me school officials are
considering closing again this weekend. So concern is still a . . .
concern. Scratchit: Will we ever get free of the wrath of Georges?
For more on that, here's John in our Accu-Tracku Weather Center.
John: According to the cone of probabilities, and the lack of
upper-level shearing, we're still in a wait-and-see mode here.
These storms are very unpredictable and . . . Annoy: Excuse me,
John. We need to break in, as our live, continuing team coverage of
Hurricane Georges moves to reporter Juan Carlos Youngmother, who's
standing by with a live, exclusive interview at the Home Depot on
Lake Worth Road. Youngmother: I'm here with Jim Bob Gingivitis, a
Palm Beach County survivor of two near-misses. Mr. Gingivitis, you
were here during Hurricane Andrew six years ago and Hurricane Erin
three years ago. Gingivitis: Yeah, my plastic garbage can got
knocked over with Andrew, and the sky got pretty cloudy when Erin
missed us. Youngmother: And now, Hurricane Georges almost lashed
you with its tornadic activity and well-formed eye wall. Jeez!
Gingivitis: Listen, I'd like to talk, but I've got a bunch of
batteries and plywood to return, and the line's kind of long.
Scratchit: Excuse me, Juan. But we're going to break away to
Claudia Shefley, who's at Emerald Dunes golf course with the
county's emergency management director. Claudia: Bill O'Brien has
just shanked a five-iron shot into the those trees over there. He's
in the woods looking for his ball. Annoy: So there you have it: Not
out of the woods yet. Stay tuned for constant updates. Now, back to
our regular programming, ``Clinton: Presidency in Crisis.''

 &HT;    It pays to work for a company that's partnership-wise
 &HT;    By William Cooper Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When contract talks stalled on Palm
Beach County's welfare reform project, Lockheed Martin IMS got help
from a friend in the sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Dominicis, vice president of Florida Crystals Corp. and a
member of the Workforce Development Board, guided through a deal
that ended six months of negotiations on how to administer the
county's $4.1 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin reached out to Dominicis, executives there say,
because he works for a company that understands private-public
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Dominicis spoke up for Lockheed Martin when it appeared the
Workforce Development Board _ which oversees local welfare reform _
was setting the company's contract so low that it would cut into
Lockheed Martin's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get to the point where you're being unfair
to your partner,'' Dominicis said. ``You've got to come up with a
reward system that is going to serve as a strong incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin wanted to collect 61 percent of the money it
gets for each client before that client landed a job. The money
covers pre-employment services such as registering clients,
evaluating them and referring jobs to them.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin would collect the balance in phases once the
person got a job and stayed employed for six months.
</P>
<P>
   But the state said the company could get only 40 percent of its
money up front.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Montgomery, the Workforce Development Board's executive
director, thought Lockheed Martin should get the remainder of its
money in four increments: once a person found work and once he or
she stayed employed for 60, 90 and 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough. Lockheed wanted the entire 60 percent
once a client found work. Executives didn't want to bear the risk
of clients not keeping their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of talks, Lockheed Martin had grown frustrated.
Out of 10 welfare contracts around the state, Palm Beach County's
was the only one that was unresolved, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin began lobbying board members. It also brought in
corporate executives such as Gerald Miller, the designer of welfare
reform in Michigan who now leads the company's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Miller threatened to lay off employees because the local
committee kept pushing for a bare-bones contract. Lockheed Martin
argued that getting less money up front might lead to cash-flow
problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sept. 17 Workforce Development Board meeting, Dominicis
convinced Lockheed Martin to revise its proposal: It would still be
paid in four phases, but it would get more money for each phase.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Lockheed Martin executives wrote down the
amounts they wanted to receive for each phase. They handed their
proposal to Dominicis. While the board was discussing other
business, Dominicis walked the proposal over to several board
members, kneeling down and showing it to them. After making the
rounds, he brought Lockheed Martin's proposal up for a full board
vote.
</P>
<P>
   It passed.
</P>
<P>
   Dominicis believes the deal balances the Workforce Development
Board's interests with the company's desire to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're partners'' he said. ``Business people are used to
negotiating under tough conditions. This is compromise on a
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's not the deal the company wanted, it seemed the only
way to put an end to the lengthy negotiations, said Roger Carlton,
head of Lockheed Martin's Florida operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have time to argue,'' Carlton said. ``It's a
proposal that we think is fair.''

 &HT;    Defense contractor making big profit from welfare reform
 &HT;    By William Cooper Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Congress passed welfare reform in
1996, it opened up a $250 billion industry to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Its thinking: that companies could move people off welfare
cheaper and faster than government.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin IMS has turned that idea into a booming
business. In two years, the nation's largest defense contractor has
won 20 welfare contracts to move recipients into the workplace in
five states, including Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has been the most lucrative, awarding the company $54
million in contracts. That includes $4.1 million in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Lockheed Martin, the stakes are even higher here. The
company wants to take over the county's entire welfare system.
Lockheed Martin would calculate and issue benefits _ now done by
the state _ in addition to administering Palm Beach County's
welfare-to-work contract. Florida has applied to the federal
government on Lockheed Martin's behalf and is awaiting approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's efforts are being watched nationally: Private
companies haven't been in the welfare business long enough to
determine if they can, indeed, save taxpayers money. And if
Lockheed Martin gets the OK to run Palm Beach County's entire
system, it will be the first private company in America to do so.
subhead
</P>
<P>
   Under welfare reform, people can only stay on the rolls for two
consecutive years before they have to get a job. Otherwise, they'll
lose their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Lockheed Martin comes in. It says it can help
people get jobs by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Processing applicants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assessing their education and job skills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helping them get more education or job training.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving them job referrals and tracking their progress.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, the company could earn up to $3,338 per
welfare recipient doing that. It will get 40 percent of its money
up front; the remaining 60 percent will be paid out in increments
based on whether the person holds a job for 60, 90 and 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is not a complicated business,'' said Gerald
Miller, who leads Lockheed Martin's welfare-to-work venture
nationwide. ``Our success comes one person at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, Lockheed Martin hopes to work with 4,693
welfare recipients and 300 new applicants each month.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, it will handle about 70 percent of the state's
welfare clients. That includes Miami-Dade County, where it has a
$25 million contract to assess recipients' skills, find them jobs
and do follow-up training. That contract represents 25 percent of
the state's entire welfare population and is the country's largest
welfare-to-work contract. subhead
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West Palm Beach, said the success of
welfare reform shouldn't be measured by cost alone, and it's too
early to say whether reform is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception that when you change the function of
government, people think that it's going to be cheaper,'' said
Rossin, chairman of the Senate's children families and seniors
committee, which will review the impact of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, welfare costs taxpayers $250 billion annually.
Companies like Lockheed Martin hope to get a piece of the 10
percent that analysts say will pay for administering the
welfare-to-work effort. That could be as much as $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty obvious business decision to enter the market,''
said Courtney Purrington, a Harvard Business School researcher
studying the company's role in welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a move Lockheed Martin has been preparing for. The
company has spent the past decade moving away from defense and into
services, Purrington said.
</P>
<P>
   By winning contracts to manage municipal parking systems,
chasing ``deadbeat parents'' for child support payments and
operating highway toll booths, Lockheed Martin was perfectly
positioned for the political shift in welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The company has used good marketing and hired what Purrington
calls ``subject matter experts.'' He defines them as former human
services officials who are tops in their fields with
well-established contacts.
</P>
<P>
   That's why hiring Gerald Miller, the mastermind of welfare
reform in Michigan, was critical. He joined Lockheed Martin a month
after the president signed the welfare reform act.
</P>
<P>
   As former director of Michigan's Department of Social Services,
Miller crafted some of the first welfare reforms in the nation. He
later was appointed by former U.S. Senator Bob Dole to the Welfare
Indicators Advisory Board, which made recommendations to federal
lawmakers on national welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to welfare services also helps Lockheed Martin's
parent company, which specializes in military contracts, said Paul
Nisbit, a defense industry analyst. According to Nisbit, the
information services subsidiary _ which handles the welfare
business _ is Lockheed Martin's fastest growing division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high-growth business. It can be profitable, if run
well.''

offering the following articles for sale. Please contact us for
availability your country. Best regards, Karl Horwitz
</P>
<P>
   1. BLOOD MONEY : HOLLYWOOD'S FASCINATION WITH SERIAL KILLERS
When the film ``Psycho'' first appeared in 1960, moviegoers were
stunned by Norman Bates, the seemingly gentle, mother-obsessed
innkeeper who kept having fatal encounters with visitors to his
roadside motel. But nearly 40 years later, Norman Bates doesn't
seem all that odd - at least compared with his murderous friends at
the local multiplex cinema. Love it or hate it, the serial killer
genre is booming again, with a spate of new films in release,
production or active development. Perhaps most prominently,
Universal Pictures has scheduled a December release for Gus Van
Sant's remake of Hitchcock's ``Psycho,'' this time with Vince
Vaughn as Bates. By Pat H. Broeske. From The Hollywood Reporter.
1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   2. PRACTICALLY MAGICAL : SANDRA BULLOCK Anyone who felt sorry
for Sandra Bullock after the epic crash of ``Speed 2'' last year
should save their tears. Bullock rebounded nicely with this
summer's ``Hope Floats'' and is excited about her latest film,
``Practical Magic'' (she stars with Nicole Kidman as sisters who
have sorcerous powers and a family curse : Any man who falls in
love with either sister is guaranteed to die young.) In this
interview Bullock talks about the new movie, why she has only one
regret about ``Speed 2,'' how leaving Hollywood for Texas has
helped her get her act together and how she answers rumours about a
romance with her ``A Time To Kill'' co-star Matthew McConaughey. By
Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
FACE VALUE : BEWITCHING SANDRA BULLOCK Vance Lehmkuhl offers an
intriguing cartoon of Sandra Bullock, depicted as a
``Bewitched''-style witch in her upcoming film, ``Practical
Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   4. BILLY CRUDUP INTERVIEW Sex, tragedy and an Olympic athlete:
It's no wonder Hollywood loves legendary long-distance runner Steve
Prefontaine's life story (the athlete died in a 1975 car accident
at the age of 24.) Two films have been made about him in the last
two years. Actor Billy Crudup finds himself in the nerve-racking
position of starring in ``Without Limits.'' In this interview,
Crudup talks about his portrayal of Prefontaine, his fear of
attending the premieres of his films and his stage work. By Dana
Wood. W Magazine. 1,000 words + photo.
</P>
<P>
   5. BEN STILLER INTERVIEW Ben Stiller seems to be on movie
screens everywhere this year, in films ranging from the
controversial ``Your Friends and Neighbours'' to the riotous summer
hit ``There's Something About Mary.'' This month Stiller, best
known for his comic roles, delivers a searing performance in
``Permanent Midnight,'' the true story of a heroin-addicted
television writer in Los Angeles whose life spirals out of control.
By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   6. YEAR OF THE CROW As her third album, ``The Globe Sessions,''
hits record stores, singer Sheryl Crow is hard-pressed to match the
success of her first two albums which made her one of America's top
female pop stars. In this interview Crow talks about the new album,
the special song Bob Dylan wrote for it, why she's cutting back the
hard-partying lifestyle which she once enjoyed and how, at 36, she
finds herself dreaming of a family of her own. By Bonnie Siegler.
1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
LEELEE SOBIESKI'S DATE WITH STARDOM In a few short years - she's
only 16 - Leelee Sobieski has married Elijah Wood in ``Deep
Impact,'' co-starred with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley
Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and is now tackling her biggest role
in the Merchant-Ivory film ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.'' In
this interview she talks about her dazzling beginning, how she
handled her jitters during her first sex scene, why she's not
intimidated by the big name actors she has worked with and her
personal impressions of Cruise, Kubrick and ``Soldier's Daughter''
co-star Kris Kristofferson. By Jeanne Wolf. 1,400 words + photo.
(Not available in England.)
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
DEFINING THE DIVINE MISS M The song may be from 1935 or 1955 or
1998, serious or sad, but if Bette Midler likes it, she's going to
sing it and nothing is going to stop her. Where other artists might
lay claim to versatility, 'the Divine Miss M' simply defines it.
``I feel bad for people who only like one kind of music,'' she
says. By Steve Morse. BPI. 700 words.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently that neither President Clinton nor his
wife owns a home. But I have read elsewhere, maybe in The Wall
Street Journal, that Clinton's Hollywood friends had chipped in to
buy a home for him, and it was more than $1 million. Can you
clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: A rumor such as you describe was reported by gossip columnist
Liz Smith, who said that she could not vouch for its accuracy.
Given the mutual affection between Hollywood show business and
Clinton, such scenarios have been widely speculated upon in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Vernon Jordan and the fiance of Monica
Lewinsky's mother either are, or have been, business partners?
Couldn't this explain the
</P>
<P>
   connection between Jordan and Lewinsky other than through the
White House?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lewinsky got her White House internship through the
recommendation of family friend Walter Kaye, a retired insurance
executive who has donated more than $300,000 to the Democratic
Party. But, yes, there has been a connection between Jordan and R.
Peter Straus, the owner of radio stations and small newspapers in
New York state who married Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, earlier
this year. As reported in USA Today, Straus and Jordan joined
forces in 1983 in an unsuccessful attempt to buy a classical music
station in Washington. And Jordan was a eulogist at the 1995
funeral of Straus' first wife.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Vice President Al Gore ever held a job and been on a
payroll like an ordinary citizen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore served in the Army from 1969-71. He then operated a
homebuilding and land-developing business in his home state of
Tennessee, according to the Almanac of American Politics. From
1973-76, Gore was an investigative reporter for The Tennessean
newspaper in Nashville. He also has worked as a tobacco farmer. In
1976, he was elected to Congress for the first time, opening his
career as a federal officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that when Babe Ruth was playing baseball, a hitter
could bounce a home run out, but now it would be considered a
ground rule double? If so, did Ruth get some home runs like that
during his record season?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer to the first question is yes. Balls that bounced
over the fence in Babe Ruth's day counted as home runs instead of
ground rule doubles. But none of Ruth's homers during the 1927
season, when he hit 60, bounced over. They all cleared the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are gambling casinos in states like Mississippi required
to be on water?
</P>
<P>
   A: States like Mississippi and Iowa, which permit casinos, were
looking for ways to boost tourism and generate money to run their
governments. Proponents harkened back to the days of riverboat
gambling on the Mississippi River as a natural tourism draw, said
Charles Patton, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. Basing casinos on water creates a zoning tool that
allows governments to keep gambling houses off land, Patton said.
In Mississippi, for example, casinos must float on the Mississippi
River or its tributaries, or in the Gulf of Mexico. Casino
applications are reviewed by local governments as well as the
state-run Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) launched an aborted effort to
impeach Kenneth Starr. As I recall, he himself was impeached as a
federal judge. Can you refresh my memory about that case?
</P>
<P>
   A: The House impeached Hastings in 1989 for ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' in connection with an alleged bribe of $150,000
while he was a federal judge. He then was convicted in the Senate,
which found that he had engaged in a ``corrupt conspiracy.'' It was
the only time a federal official was removed from office for a
crime of which he had been found not guilty by a trial jury.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings challenged his conviction, saying the full Senate must
hear the evidence and return a verdict, instead of a 12-member
Senate committee whose work was ratified by a Senate vote. In
September 1992, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, in agreement,
reversed the Senate's conviction. Lawyers for the Senate argued
that Sporkin lacked authority to review the Senate's action, but
the judge disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Hastings was elected to Congress. In 1993, he
was quoted as saying, ``I'm not a vengeful person; I get on with
life. I didn't come here with my arms and my elbows flying. I came
here to work. . . . I've met with nothing but pleasant exchanges. .
. . I bring with me the added notoriety of being impeached and
removed by the same body that I now get to serve in. That in and of
itself is a made-for-TV movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to cruise ships in the Caribbean when a
hurricane is in the area? Do they change their itineraries?
</P>
<P>
   A: The modern technology for tracking weather patterns is so
advanced that cruise companies are able to monitor the situation
and make any necessary itinerary adjustments before ships leave
port, said Meredith Marks, spokeswoman for Cruise Lines
International Association in New York. So the ships are unlikely to
be caught in open water with a hurricane brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the last Major League baseball player to achieve the
Triple Crown?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has been more than 30 years since anyone has won the
Triple Crown (leading a league at the end of the season in the
three major hitting categories in official records: batting
average, runs batted in and home runs). He was Carl Yastrzemski of
the Red Sox in 1967. The last one in the National League was Joe
Medwick of the Cardinals in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the son of Fox News anchor Brit Hume
recently committed suicide, but I didn't see anything in the news
about it. Do you have any details about his career and about his
death?
</P>
<P>
   A: The suicide of Sandy Hume, 28, at his apartment in Arlington,
Va., occurred the night of Feb. 22. It was reported in the
Journal-Constitution and elsewhere Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   An article April 27 in The New Republic sheds some light on his
situation. A reporter at The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, Hume
became famous when he detailed the attempted coup against House
Speaker Newt Gingrich last summer. Acclaimed as a rising star by
The New York Times, Hume was offered a job by U.S. News &AMP; World
Report and The Weekly Standard.
</P>
<P>
   According to The New Republic, Hume was a recovering alcoholic
who kept a photo from when he had hit bottom to remind himself of
what he once had been. The night before he died, he was reported to
have been drinking with high school friends. While speeding home he
was chased by police, caught, and jailed. When he tried to strangle
himself at the jail, he was taken to D.C. General Hospital, where
he convinced the staff to let him go. When he returned home, he
wrote a note saying how sorry he was, and shot himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Journal-Constitution, Gingrich, after Hume's
death, released a statement saying the young reporter had
``remarkable talent and unlimited potential'' and possessed a
``rare ability to make people want to open up to him.'' That,
Gingrich added, was why so many people respected him as a reporter
``and loved him as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent Miss America pageant has me wondering about Bess
Myerson. What has become of her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps the most celebrated Miss America of all time, she was
a graduate of New York's Hunter College when she won the pageant in
1945. Though she faced anti-Semitism herself, she spent her year as
Miss America campaigning against prejudice in schools. In 1947, she
performed as a concert pianist in Carnegie Hall, and she went on to
have a high-profile political career, serving as consumer affairs
commissioner for New York City from 1982 to 1987. She has been
hailed as a generous donor to the Holocaust Museum of Jewish
Heritage in New York, donating more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But her life hasn't been trouble-free. In 1988, Myerson pleaded
guilty in Williamsport, Pa., to shoplifting $44.07 worth of
merchandise from a department store. She was fined $100 plus $48.50
court costs. That same year, she was acquitted by a New York jury
of bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges that claimed she had
improperly influenced the judge presiding over the divorce case of
her lover, Carl Capasso. In addition, she was acquitted of an
obstruction of justice charge. She also has endured surgery and
chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Myerson was married and divorced twice, and has a daughter and
granddaughter. Now 74, she rarely ventures into the public eye,
giving occasional university lectures and doing charity work,
mainly on behalf of Jewish causes. ``This way I feel I am putting
my celebrity to use,'' she once told a reporter. ``Nothing I've
done in the past is as nourishing as my Jewishness. I never left
it, but now I can do it full time.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   UNDATED: Q: The recent Miss America pageant has me wondering
about Bess Myerson. What has become of her?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the make and year of the automobile on a $10 bill,
and what is the building behind it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The car is generic, and of no specific make or model, said
Claudia Dickens of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The
building is the Treasury Department at Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th
Street N.W. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did the public opinion polls show for President Richard
Nixon's job performance around the time of Watergate, and again
around the time of his resignation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The break-in at the Democratic Party headquarters in the
Watergate building complex occurred June 17, 1972. The scandal
engulfed the Nixon administration during 1973 and most of 1974.
Nixon's approval rating, as measured by Gallup polls, had reached a
high point of 68 percent in late January 1973 after the Vietnam
peace settlement. In Gallup surveys conducted April 6-9 that year,
before Nixon's April 17 news conference at which he said he had
discovered ``major developments'' in the Watergate case, the
approval rating had dropped by 14 points to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll published June 24 showed a 44 percent approval
rating, the same as it had showed in interviews taken May 11-14 and
again June 1-4. At the end of 1973, his popularity rating slipped
another 2 points, to 29 percent. By late July 1974, as the House
moved closer to a vote on impeachment, Gallup's poll showed still
more slippage, to 24 percent. That was the lowest level. On Aug. 8,
Nixon announced his decision to resign to the American people on
nationwide TV, and he submitted his resignation the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the accusations against President Richard Nixon in
the articles of impeachment against him?
</P>
<P>
   A: In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee adopted three
articles of impeachment. The first described Nixon's role in the
Watergate coverup, accusing him of obstructing justice. The second
detailed other abuses of power by the president. And the third
charged Nixon with contempt of Congress for his failure to honor
the Judiciary Committee's subpoenas, mostly for certain tape
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A mentioned recently that a $10,000 Federal Reserve note is
the largest bill in circulation. I thought I once read about a
$100,000 bill. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The largest note ever printed by the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These
notes were printed from Dec. 18, 1934, through Jan. 9, 1935, and
were issued by the treasurer of the United States only to Federal
Reserve Banks against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the
Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal
Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the public. And as we
said before, the $10,000 Federal Reserve note and several other
large U.S. bills have been in the process of being withdrawn from
circulation since 1969. The $100 note is the largest being issued
now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is St.-John's-wort?
</P>
<P>
   A: Also called hypericum, it's the name of a group of about 300
species of herbs and shrubs. The name also is applied to a popular
herbal remedy for depression. The ``herbal Prozac'' made the news
recently when the Los Angeles Times reported that several brands
are not as potent as advertised on their labels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a list of Conference USA members, Q&AMP;A referred to the Army
Cadets. Isn't the team called the Black Knights? A knight wearing
black armor rides a mule at the games.
</P>
<P>
   A: Either nickname is acceptable, said Diane Baker of the U.S.
Military Academy's sports information office. The team is referred
to as the Cadets by Sporting News, Sports Illustrated and CNNSI,
and even the Army ``A'' line (914-938-2769) with recorded
information refers to the Cadets. If you prefer the nickname Black
Knights (or Black Knights of the Hudson), however, you wouldn't be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't read or heard much about John Glenn's training for
his upcoming space mission. Can you provide an update?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glenn, first American to orbit Earth and soon to become the
world's oldest spaceman at 77, has been immersed since August in a
busy routine at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Among other
things, he's practicing what to do in an emergency, familiarizing
himself with the space shuttle Discovery and its payloads,
preparing for his medical experiments, and tackling the intricacies
of computers. One of Glenn's crucial projects will be to log
medical data into the laptop computers aboard Discovery _ 16
laptops, more than usual because of all the research on the mission
_ to provide a full account for NASA doctors doing the first
geriatric study in space.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Glenn admitted that he isn't as flexibile
as he used to be. ``I'm slower than them (the six astronauts who
will accompany him) and I don't bend the same directions they bend.
. . . Where they duck and go through, I'm crawling through on hands
and knees to get through certain portholes and things like that,
for access to the orbiter. But that's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is scheduled to be launched from the Kennedy Space
Center at 2 p.m. Oct. 29, with landing scheduled for 12:04 p.m.
Nov. 7. The mission will include solar research and experiments for
planned upgrades of the Hubble space telescope. Glenn, a Democratic
senator from Ohio for 24 years, has said he will retire from
politics two months after the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Shirley Chisholm once ran for president, but
she wasn't listed by Q&AMP;A. Can you refresh my memory about her
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: As stated, the list was a sample of past women candidates of
their parties. While Chisholm did campaign for the 1972 Democratic
presidential nomination, she didn't win the nomination, so her name
wasn't on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm undeniably made her mark in politics, however. She
served in the New York State Assembly from 1964 to 1968, and in
1969 became the first black woman in Congress, serving until 1983.
When she sought the Democratic nomination for president, Chisholm
put together a coalition of blacks, feminists and other minority
groups, but the effort failed. She failed even to win the support
of the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the convention rolled around, a loss already was
assured. Chisholm went to the convention with 24 delegates. In the
end she got 151 votes, released to her by Hubert H. Humphrey and
other candidates who had given up on trying to stop George
McGovern. Despite the reversal, Chisholm and others considered that
her bid could have had a positive impact on future black women
candidates. She compared herself to Al Smith, a Catholic who ran
for the presidency in the 1920s, paving the way for John F.
Kennedy's 1960 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I remember correctly, after Ronald Reagan left office, a
Japanese company paid him $2 million to make a commercial. What was
that company, and what was its product?
</P>
<P>
   A: When he was actor Ronald Reagan, long before he occupied the
White House, he also was a pitchman for General Electric. But he
didn't do celebrity endorsements after leaving office. You may be
remembering that he accepted $2 million from a Japanese company,
Fujisankei Communications, to give two speeches in Japan, which
resulted in a lot of bad press.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians, however, have appeared in ads, including
Geraldine Ferraro (Pepsi), George McGovern (Bic razor), Alexander
Haig (Trump Shuttle, an airline operation later taken over by US
Airways) and, most notably, former House Speaker Tip O'Neill
(Quality Inns, Commodore's Amiga computers, Miller Lite beer, Hugh
Puppies shoes, American Express and the Bank of New England).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the members of Congress who voted to release
President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony, and how did
each of them vote? How can we get their addresses?
</P>
<P>
   A: The House Judiciary Committee, with 37 members, voted along
party lines Friday to release the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans: Henry Hyde (chairman; Illinois); James
Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin; Bill McCollum, Florida; George Gekas,
Pennsylvania; Howard Coble, North Carolina; Lamar Smith, Texas;
Elton Gallegly, California; Charles Canady, Florida; Bob Inglis,
South Carolina; Robert Goodlatte, Virginia; Steve Buyer, Indiana;
Ed Bryant, Tennessee; Steve Chabot, Ohio; Bob Barr, Georgia;
William Jenkins, Tennessee; Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas; Ed Pease,
Indiana; Christopher Cannon, Utah; James Rogan, California; Lindsey
Graham, South Carolina; Mary Bono, California.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats: John Conyers Jr. (ranking minority member; Michigan);
Barney Frank, Massachusetts; Charles Schumer, New York; Howard
Berman, California; Rick Boucher, Virginia; Jerrold Nadler, New
York; Robert Scott, Virginia; Melvin Watt, North Carolina; Zoe
Lofgren, California; Sheila Jackson Lee, Texas; Maxine Waters,
California; Martin Meehan, Massachusetts; William Delahunt,
Massachusetts Robert Wexler, Florida; Steven Rothman, New Jersey;
Tom Barrett, Wisconsin.

 &HT;    Sexy or sublime, courses are title contenders
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ E.T. and crazy women and rock music.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, University of Texas students are challenging more
than the usual fluff courses of Linear Optimization and the Design
and Analysis of Algorithms.
</P>
<P>
   Peruse the UT course schedule, and you may fall off the couch
reaching for the phone to enroll late in some cool and hot classes.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, as in Professor Paul Harvey's (no, I'm not kidding)
``Search for Extraterrestrial Life.'' Watching a few episodes of
''X-Files'' should give you a head start.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, as in ``Rhetoric of Sexy Girls.'' Got to be curious about
that one.
</P>
<P>
   And what would any self-respecting college student be without an
American Studies class called ``Women and Madness'' or civil
engineering's ``Theory and Behavior of Pavements.'' Imagine calling
Mom and Pop _ the money trees _ and saying, ``Hey, I'm learning why
women are mad and how pavement behaves.''
</P>
<P>
   For a flashback to disco fever, how about ``Earth, Wind, and
Fire'' in the Department of Geological Sciences. Imagine, the 1970s
rhythm and blues group's ``Shining Star'' blaring on the speakers.
Hold on to your Angel Flights, it turns out the professor talks
about global warming, earthquakes and volcanoes. Cute title,
though.
</P>
<P>
   The sociology course ``Proposal Preparation'' must be for single
guys who don't have a clue how to pop the Big One. Paul Castaneda,
editor of the 289-page UT course catalog, however, says the class
teaches students to write proposals for dissertations or grants for
funding research.
</P>
<P>
   Boring.
</P>
<P>
   Some course titles have more pizazz. Like ``Rhetoric of Sexy
Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the course description reads: ``What is a sexy
girl? Who gets to decide? . . . Despite 20th century America's
statutory rape laws, and its loudly proclaimed moral horror at
child molestation, the sexy girl _ from the Guess? Jeans girl to
JonBenet _ continues to fascinate both men and women. This course
proceeds from the assumption that there is no single concrete thing
about a girl that is sexy. Instead, this course proposes that when
we look at, or read about sexy girls we are part of an audience
that can be persuaded, seduced, manipulated, bullied, or excluded .
. . ``
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title is concise and accurate,'' says Alyssa Harad, an
assistant instructor who is teaching the class for the first time.
``Of course, the title is also an example of this rhetoric and its
power.''
</P>
<P>
   UT officials concede that catchy titles titles help market the
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a catchy title,'' says assistant professor
Brenda Kirkland George, who teaches ``Earth, Wind, and Fire'' with
professor Sharon Moser. ``Wind is climate, fire is volcanoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey says while his astronomy class ``Search for
Extraterrestrial Life'' attracts attention, it's serious. ``It's
not pop culture stuff about UFOs and alien abductions. We look at
how our solar system evolved and the formation of life on Earth. We
do discuss the possibility of other life out there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other courses are enticing.
</P>
<P>
   A certain Bill might be interested in the speech communication
class ``Lying and Deception.'' Or, the sociology course
``Deviance.'' And while he's at it, he might want to check out
``Male-Female Communications'' in Women's Studies.
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of drama, a linguistics course called ``Language,
Myth and Vampire Legend'' sounds interesting. The Department of
Rhetoric and Criticism shines in this area, according to course
descriptions. ``The Rhetoric of Horror'' looks at why we pay good
money to be frightened, shocked and sickened. ``The Rhetoric of the
Grotesque'' examines why people like Jeffrey Dahmer and ``events
like carnival freak shows and news reports of gory deaths hold our
attention despite our apparent revulsion for them.''
</P>
<P>
   UT, like every other college, also offers the head scratchers.
How many people, if they had a choice, would take ``Fault Tolerant
Computing'' or ``Pseudorandomness.''
</P>
<P>
   Must be for the techies.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS

   UNDATED: Q: The recent Miss America pageant has me wondering
about Bess Myerson. What has become of her?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the make and year of the automobile on a $10 bill,
and what is the building behind it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The car is generic, and of no specific make or model, said
Claudia Dickens of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The
building is the Treasury Department at Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th
Street N.W. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did the public opinion polls show for President Richard
Nixon's job performance around the time of Watergate, and again
around the time of his resignation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The break-in at the Democratic Party headquarters in the
Watergate building complex occurred June 17, 1972. The scandal
engulfed the Nixon administration during 1973 and most of 1974.
Nixon's approval rating, as measured by Gallup polls, had reached a
high point of 68 percent in late January 1973 after the Vietnam
peace settlement. In Gallup surveys conducted April 6-9 that year,
before Nixon's April 17 news conference at which he said he had
discovered ``major developments'' in the Watergate case, the
approval rating had dropped by 14 points to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll published June 24 showed a 44 percent approval
rating, the same as it had showed in interviews taken May 11-14 and
again June 1-4. At the end of 1973, his popularity rating slipped
another 2 points, to 29 percent. By late July 1974, as the House
moved closer to a vote on impeachment, Gallup's poll showed still
more slippage, to 24 percent. That was the lowest level. On Aug. 8,
Nixon announced his decision to resign to the American people on
nationwide TV, and he submitted his resignation the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the accusations against President Richard Nixon in
the articles of impeachment against him?
</P>
<P>
   A: In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee adopted three
articles of impeachment. The first described Nixon's role in the
Watergate coverup, accusing him of obstructing justice. The second
detailed other abuses of power by the president. And the third
charged Nixon with contempt of Congress for his failure to honor
the Judiciary Committee's subpoenas, mostly for certain tape
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A mentioned recently that a $10,000 Federal Reserve note is
the largest bill in circulation. I thought I once read about a
$100,000 bill. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The largest note ever printed by the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These
notes were printed from Dec. 18, 1934, through Jan. 9, 1935, and
were issued by the treasurer of the United States only to Federal
Reserve Banks against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the
Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal
Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the public. And as we
said before, the $10,000 Federal Reserve note and several other
large U.S. bills have been in the process of being withdrawn from
circulation since 1969. The $100 note is the largest being issued
now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is St.-John's-wort?

   A: Also called hypericum, it's the name of a group of about 300

and even the Army ``A'' line (914-938-2769) with recorded
information refers to the Cadets. If you prefer the nickname Black
Knights (or Black Knights of the Hudson), however, you wouldn't be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't read or heard much about John Glenn's training for
his upcoming space mission. Can you provide an update?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glenn, first American to orbit Earth and soon to become the
world's oldest spaceman at 77, has been immersed since August in a
busy routine at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Among other
things, he's practicing what to do in an emergency, familiarizing
himself with the space shuttle Discovery and its payloads,

</P>
<P>
   Discovery is scheduled to be launched from the Kennedy Space
Center at 2 p.m. Oct. 29, with landing scheduled for 12:04 p.m.
Nov. 7. The mission will include solar research and experiments for
planned upgrades of the Hubble space telescope. Glenn, a Democratic
senator from Ohio for 24 years, has said he will retire from
politics two months after the flight.

Fujisankei Communications, to give two speeches in Japan, which
resulted in a lot of bad press.

Haig (Trump Shuttle, an airline operation later taken over by US
Airways) and, most notably, former House Speaker Tip O'Neill

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A week before their 30th wedding anniversary, a
man decides to give his wife a personalized collection of the songs
they listened to when they first met. With a few clicks on a Web
site, he compiles a custom CD, picks the song order, titles and
decorates the disc, and pays for it. By the time of the celebration
they're dancing to the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the world's greatest bar band rolls into town. The
nightclub's sound man plugs a cable into the mixing board, sending
a live feed from the concert onto the Internet, giving anyone with
a computer and a connection a prime seat as the band sizzles
through three sets.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, band members tell newly converted fans their Web
site address. At the site, the faithful can check tour dates, buy
the band's music and T-shirts, listen to live recordings, and hook
up with other like-minded listeners.
</P>
<P>
   While the talk has been about television and the computer,the
Internet and the digital revolution behind it are turning the music
world on its ear. Internet ``radio'' services, for instance, offer
genres of music never heard on a broadcast station, while other
sites feature jam sessions and live concerts, broader visibility
for unsigned bands or the chance to rediscover long-out-of-print
music by better-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   But for every new winner in a revolution, there's an old loser.
Record company and retail store executives are worried about losing
money to online competitors and to piracy as note-perfect illegal
copies can be shipped in a heartbeat around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they reason, there's nothing stopping them
from cashing in _ if they can just figure out how.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen by itself, but musicians have to
realize we're in a digital age,'' said Wendy Hafner, Intel Corp.'s
director of music marketing. ``One hundred million PCs will be
shipped this year all over the world. It's a huge, huge opportunity
for the music business to take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   NEED FOR SPEED: The explosion in Internet music the past year
has been driven by a series of improvements in technology: faster
Internet connections, better compression programs and players,
higher-quality computer sound cards and speakers. The result is
sound quality at least as good as FM radio and approaching that of
CDs, with access to a dizzying variety of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I enjoy about working in this field is how
quickly things have progressed,'' said Nicholas Wild, director of
technology at the House of Blues new media division, which Netcasts
three live concerts and up to 10 album ``listening'' parties every
week. ``When I started first using the Net, I was downloading text.
Now you see video getting integrated into Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep ahead of the changes, the House of Blues is installing
full digital production studios at all six of its clubs so it can
easily create broadcast-quality concert videos anywhere, Wild said.
For all its quick adoption of technology, it still may not be able
to keep pace with all the changes, company executives say.
</P>
<P>
   On Websites like MusicMaker.com, a visitor can page through more
than 100,000 legally licensed tracks by a wide range of artists,
pick out favorites and have the Internet company create a
made-to-order CD.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites will sell a legal, digital copy of music that will
play on their computer using technology such as Liquid Audio or A2B
that encrypt the music so it can't be duplicated. And if they have
a recordable CD drive, they can even create their own custom CDs
with the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to re-create some of the magic of the
1950s, when you had a hit single and could break a record in a
region,'' said David Kessel, a musician and CEO of the Internet
Underground Music Archive, whose Web site features music by and
information on unsigned bands.
</P>
<P>
   A BOOST FOR RADIO: ``Radio'' has blossomed on the Internet, too,
including Net-only music programmers _ such as Spinner.com in
Burlingame _ that don't even broadcast over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner, for instance, slices more than 100,000 tracks of music
into 104 genres, including many that just can't be found in
American broadcast radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to go to any market in this country and get a
Delta blues format, or a Celtic format, or an all-Baroque format,''
said Scott Epstein, Spinner's vice president for marketing and
content.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein said the Internet has fast becomea home for music for
three simple reasons: ``control, variety and simplicity.'' For the
first time, music fans can easily decide when they want to listen
to their favorite kinds of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget having four or five rock stations in a market,'' said
music consultant Ted Cohen. ``You're going to have hundreds or
thousands of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more musical choices will abound when record labels
start putting their massive back catalogs of out-of-print music
into digital format and make it available for purchase online,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach solves the industry's unwillingness to print
CDs of old music, only to have it gather dust on warehouse shelves,
while allowing fans to custom create CDs of their own design, Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S SOME DISCONTENT: Music industry leaders acknowledge
digital music's many possibilities, but cite some deep concerns in
the next breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the technology,'' said Michael Greene,
president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
``Fifty thousand albums are released a year. We know there's a lot
of great music out there that consumers can't get to. The next
three to four years provides amazing opportunities for individual
labels and groups that radio has ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Kessel's IUMA, Scour.net and the Ultimate Band List
already provide fans with ready access to thousands of bands whose
music they otherwise might never hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to allow people more information about every single
piece of music product they can get their hands on,'' said Tom
Roli, publisher of the online magazine WebNoize, which will sponsor
a three-day seminar on digital music in Universal City in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for a rebirth of the music industry,''
Roli said. ``It's the best thing for everybody, demand programming.
What you want when you want it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greene and others in the record business fret over piracy _
illegal, high-quality copies of music that can be easily duplicated
and distributed through the multiplicative magic of a wired world.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an intellectual property perspective, all of our
traditional concerns are multiplied by a thousand on the
cyberfrontier,'' Greene said. ``As (Electronic Frontier Foundation
co-founder) John Perry Barlow put it, we are used to protecting not
the wine, but the bottle it comes in. So what happens now that we
are selling wine with no bottles?''
</P>
<P>
   PIRATES AHEAD: People like Greene are afraid of people like
Chris Ward of Valencia, a Northwestern University student and big
fan of the MP-3 computer audio format, which creates a
high-quality, highly compressed file that can be easily stored or
transferred over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   College students in particular use freely available software to
encode a standard CD song into the MP-3 format on their computers.
Hundreds of sites have copies of illegal MP-3s available for
downloading, which takes seconds on a college campus' high-speed
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Ward paid for none of the 50 MP-3 songs on his computer, but
says he wouldn't have bothered to buy most of them otherwise. He
did find MP-3s of a new favorite band, Guster, that in turn led him
to buy a CD of the band he didn't already have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like is you can decide you like a song, spend
maybe 10 minutes on the Web looking for it and if you can find it,
great. If not, OK,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   To stamp out access to illegal MP-3s, the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) uses automated software that snoops
through the Internet looking for sites offering hundreds of illegal
songs each, said Brandy Thomas, whose Virginia company, Online
Monitoring Services, does the cyber-sleuthing for the RIAA, the
Association of Songwriters, Composers, Artists and Publishers
(ASCAP) and other large entertainment organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Once found, large sites' owners face legal action and shutdown,
Thomas said. Those threats have driven most of the big pirate sites
underground.
</P>
<P>
   ASCAP, which represents about half of all music publishers and
songwriters, is more concerned about getting sites to pay license
fees than stop using music, Thomas said. His company's software
will issue licenses to Web sites using ASCAP-owned music, and set
up a billing process.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Thomas said, it helps ensure people in the music
business still have a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our main concern, retention of all rights,'' said
producer Jeffrey Weber, co-owner of a small Beverly Hills label,
Weberworks. ``We spend a lot of money making music. We don't want
people getting it for free.''
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING BONANZA: At the same time, many bands are giving music
away on the Internet, or at least samples of it. That makes it
easier to get noticed, though it doesn't guarantee success, some in
the business point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reducing the barriers of entry, but once you're in, it's
the equivalent to being the opening slot of a 10-band bill,'' said
Cohen. ``If you just hang your shingle up and say, `Hi, I'm here,'
it's the equivalent of playing in a parking lot in the middle of
Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Stonefield of Global Music Outlet, a Culver City company
that sells music online, said getting known is still a challenge,
but ``the Internet is like a living color brochure for a band.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some notable musicians and bands are using the Net to
promote their music or reward loyal fans. Beastie Boys, Hole, Live,
Massive Attack, and Jesus and Mary Chain have given away tracks in
recent months through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Black, a former member of the Pixies, is selling his
entire new album, ``Frank Black and the Catholics,'' on the
Internet through Goodnoise, a new Palo Alto-based label dedicated
to selling music in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving people instant access to what they want,'' Cohen
said. ``We've been at the mercy of whoever's programming our life.
The whole thing is to turn people on to music. I don't know of
anything else that's come along that could do that.''
</P>

CLOSE PROGRAM BOX GIVES PC USER CONTROL WHEN MACHINE MESSES UP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In Windows 95, when one enters Control-Alt-Delete on the
keyboard, a window called ``Close Program'' comes up. Can you
kindly tell me what exactly is contained in this window? I have not
been able to find any detailed explanation in any of the Windows 95
books that I have. Are these programs that have been loaded into
memory? Are they running (there's no evidence of this in some
cases)? Are they in RAM but dormant?
</P>
<P>
   A: That window does indeed show the programs that currently are
running in your system's memory. But, don't be surprised if you
aren't familiar with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-Windows 95/NT days, doing a Control-Alt-Delete (also
known among the grizzled, old compu-guard as the ``three-fingered
salute'') was used to reboot your system. Now, it gives you access
to the programs running on your system, and in Windows NT it's also
used to log on to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   From the Close Program dialog box you can, of course, close any
of the programs you see there. Just click on the one you want to go
away and click the End Task button. You also can shut the entire
computer down from here.
</P>
<P>
   The real purpose of it arises when a program misbehaves.
Sometimes, a Windows 95/98 program will just stop working, while
the rest of your PC hums merrily along. If you bring up the Close
Program box, you'll likely see the words ``Not responding'' next to
the name of the program. Your best bet is to close that program
using the End Task button.
</P>
<P>
   You may get a secondary window that pops up asking whether you
want to wait a bit longer, or just kill the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things you see listed in the Close Program dialog
box may not be familiar to you. They are programs running in the
background, or components of Windows itself. For example, one of
them is SYSTRAY. This stands for System Tray _ the area on the far
right of the Windows taskbar that contains the clock, the speaker
icon and possibly other icons.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Logitech mouse, one of the items will be
``emexec'' _ this is the program that controls some of the mouse's
special features, such as a wheel or a third mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   One of the items also will be Explorer. Some people will
occasionally use End Task on the Explorer if the Windows desktop
starts behaving oddly.
</P>
<P>
   When you do this, however, any program icons that normally
appear in the tray will disappear. That means you'll have to
restart them in order to regain access to their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just upgraded to Windows 98 from Windows 95, and I like it
pretty much. However, for some reason Windows 98 dropped a Network
Neighborhood icon on my desktop. I don't have a network connection
_ just a dialup connection to the Internet. I can't delete the icon
by dragging it to the Recycle Bin; Windows won't let me. I've
discovered TweakUI from your column and tried to use it, but I get
a warning that there may be problems if I delete it. What should I
do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Go ahead and let TweakUI remove the Network Neighborhood icon
from your desktop. I've never had a problem using TweakUI in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   One precaution, though: Check and record your dialup networking
settings before you do this. Look in the Network module in the
Control Panel, as well as the Connection/Settings area in the
Dialup Networking folder.
</P>
<P>
   After you've removed Network Neighborhood, sign on to your
Internet service provider and make sure everything works. If not,
go back and reset your original settings.

MARKET FOR CHIPS BELONGS TO BUYER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competition is a wonderful thing, and nowhere is that more
evident than in the personal computer business. It's brought PC
users breathtaking innovation and power at ever-lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is particularly strong in the microprocessor market.
If you're interested in buying a new computer that uses Microsoft's
Windows 98 or NT as its operating system, you've got an excellent
selection of chips from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. is the market leader. Its competitors develop
powerful processors that undercut Intel's prices in an attempt to
steal some market share. Intel, in turn, has responded by slashing
the prices on its products and producing others that compete
directly in the low end of the chip market.
</P>
<P>
   You, the PC buyer, are the delighted beneficiary. Here's a look
at today's processor landscape:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pentium MMX: Adios, mi amigo! This Intel chip is a case study
in computer-industry obsolescence. Just 18 months ago, this was the
second coming of the Pentium processor. Today, it's yesterday's
news.
</P>
<P>
   Pentium MMX processors are found in some portable computers
running at a maximum 266 megahertz, and in the sub-$1,000 desktop
market with maximum clock speeds of 233 megahertz. They are
perfectly capable of running most software available today, and are
an excellent choice if all you do is word processing, connect to
the Internet and juggle the family finances on your PC. They also
handle most children's educational programs with ease.
</P>
<P>
   But the next generation of high-end games and graphics software
coming in 1999 will bog these chips down. If you're a serious
gamer, or want to manipulate images on a PC, you'll want something
more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pentium II: This is the Intel's current, state-of-the-art
processor, and a compelling choice if you've got the cash. The
newest versions of the chip run at a top speed of 450 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   This is the chip of choice for power users, hard-core gamers and
those who want to be as far ahead of the curve as possible. It's
got the MMX instruction set _ extra code to help with audio and
video _ and a 512-kilobyte cache, a buffer that helps speed data
into and out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentium II will undergo a major change early next year.
A new version of the chip, code-named Katmai, will debut in the
first quarter of 1999. With initial speeds of 450 and 500
megahertz, it will include code that will help improve 3D graphics,
but only if software developers write programs to take advantage of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming next year in the Pentium II family _ chips at speeds
of 600 megahertz and beyond, with larger built-in caches and
increased system board speeds. Current Pentium IIs are plugged into
system boards that send data from other devices to the main
processor at 100 megaherz _ a boost from earlier boards that worked
at 66 megahertz. Sometime in 1999 you'll see system boards that run
at 133.
</P>
<P>
   _ Celeron: These chips got a bad rap when they initially were
offered by Intel, and deservedly so. They lacked a built-in cache,
making them pitifully slow.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest versions, which run at 300 and 333 megahertz, now
have a 128-kilobyte cache. There are other improvements that result
in excellent performance. In fact, this may be one of the best
processor bargains out there.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find these newer Celeron chips in systems in the $1,000
price range, making these great machines for gamers on a budget.
The new Celerons handle power-hungry games like Unreal and Quake II
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Celeron chips to accelerate to 366, then 400 megahertz
next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ AMD K6/K6-2: The K6 chip is Advanced Micro Devices' answer to
the Pentium MMX from Intel, and the K6-2 is a newer version that
addresses some of the shortcomings of the K6 design in an
interesting way.
</P>
<P>
   The K6 is not as good as Intel's chips at handling
floating-point math calculations, which are used in some 3-D games
and applications. But AMD has jumped ahead of Intel by including a
set of 3-D instructions called 3D Now! _ similar in concept to
Intel's Katmai product _ that developers can exploit. AMD is now
trying to get software programmers, and particularly those who make
3-D games, to take advantage of 3D Now!
</P>
<P>
   To show the possibilities, AMD worked with id Software to create
a special version of Quake II that uses the 3D Now! features. Tests
with this version show that, depending on other variables, the K6-2
chip can outperform some Pentium II systems when 3D Now! is
invoked.
</P>
<P>
   The K6-2 is found in systems that are priced equal to or
slightly less than those that use Celeron or Pentium MMX chips,
making it another good bargain, particularly for gamers. However,
with speeds of up to 350 megahertz and faster versions on the way,
it's also an excellent chip for general computing.
</P>
<P>
   _ MediaGX/MII: Cyrix, now owned by National Semiconductor, has
been selling for some time a chip called the MedixGX. It's
equivalent to the Pentium MMX, and it's found in many sub-$1,000
and even sub-$500 systems. However, I can't recommend this chip.
</P>
<P>
   The MediaGX steals two megabytes from the system's random access
memory for use as video memory. That means if you buy a low-end
system that comes with only 16 megabytes of RAM, you actually are
only able to use 14 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Given that you can spend a couple hundred dollars more and get a
system that doesn't play cheap tricks with memory, it's best to
stay away from PCs that use this chip.
</P>
<P>
   The MII, however, is another story. It's essentially a beefed-up
version of Cyrix's 6x86 chip that runs at speeds of up to 333
megahertz, with 350 megahertz models on the way. Cyrix has priced
it to be competitive with Celeron and K6 processors, so you're most
apt to find it in sub-$1,000 systems.
</P>
<P>
   While I haven't tried a system that uses this chip, the reviews
of it look good.

PHONE LINE DOESN'T CUT IT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a 56K modem, but I can only get it to
sign on at 28.8 or less. I confirmed that my modem and Windows 95
settings are correct. U.S. Robotics support determined there is
noise on my telephone line preventing a 56K connection. The phone
company will only guarantee a 14.4 connection. They sent out a
technician who determined my phone line met their specifications
for noise. Is there anything else to check? If there isn't, why
aren't consumers warned about this ``conflict'' with telephone
companies? I can't believe I'm the only one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Baudly Frustrated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FRUS: Yes, you ARE the only one. The phone company has
singled out you _ and you alone _ for harassment. The rest of us
aren't having any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Your alternatives aren't very attractive: You could move closer
to the phone company's switching station. You could switch phone
companies. You could rewire your house with better telephone cable.
All that still may not fix the problem. I'm sure that the phone
company would be happy to let you pay more for a data-grade or ISDN
line, though. Why else would it be acting like the south end of a
northbound horse?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just finished reading the letter from the
person who heard creepy sounds while on the Internet. I, too, have
heard creepy sounds. Mine is a door slamming, and/or a squeaky
door. It doesn't happen regularly, just often enough to keep me
wondering when it will happen again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Haunted II
</P>
<P>
   DEAR II: Not to worry. That's just the escaped mental patient
who's been living in your crawl space waiting for just the right
moment to murder you in your sleep. Your computer is perfectly OK.
You must be really relieved!
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, you guys have all seen one too many ``X-Files.'' Look for
some rational explanation, like the couple next door having a
Hillary-size door-slammer of a fight. Or sound clips that are
programmed to play at certain points. As my computer tells me all
the time, you carbon-based units are way too suggestible.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Seems like the only way Microsoft
engineers and developers get credit for something is when they
sneak their names into the product in places only they would know
to look. A reader who prefers to be known only as Cigar Boy _ for
legal reasons, he says _ earns a tip o' the homburg for this
Internet Explorer 4.0 trifle:
</P>
<P>
   Open the Help menu and click on About. Hold down Control and use
the mouse to drag the Explorer ``E'' over the picture of the globe,
then ram it against the ``Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0'' text,
which should retreat from the screen, exposing an Unlock button.
Click the button, which starts the globe shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Drag the ``E'' on top of the globe, which should start expanding
to fill the window. Close that window and another opens with a
scrolling list of hundreds of Microserfs, many of whom are still
chained to their cubicles. To break up the monotony, the
programmers also slipped in a couple of jokes. At least I think
they're jokes. It's so hard to tell when a geek is trying to be
intentionally funny.

SYNCHRONIZE YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKLE   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frequent readers of this column know that I've been spending a
lot of time experimenting with cellular telephones. One thing
that's made this task particularly difficult is the electronic
phone book that each of these phones contains. A built-in address
book can be both a timesaver and a moneysaver. Unfortunately, the
tiny keyboards and cryptic user interfaces that these phones all
share makes programming more than a few names and phone numbers
into the phones quite an arduous task.
</P>
<P>
   For years I've been telling Motorola and the other cell phone
vendors that they need to create some way for people to edit their
address books from a desktop computer, as well as to download a
list of names and numbers from the computer into the cellular phone
and upload it back. The manufacturers have been slow to respond.
After all, the lack of telephone management software hasn't really
hurt their sales, has it? Thankfully the wireless communications
marketplace is now going through a period of hyper-competition, and
some vendors have realized that integration with computers is a
competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The first crop of wireless integration tools combine telephones
and two-way pagers with the 3Com PalmPilot. This is a curious
choice, considering that there are more than 100 million desktop
computers in the United States alone and less than 2 million Pilots
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first integration products to hit the market is a
nifty little device called the Snap-On. Manufactured by Option
International, a Belgian company, the product lets you control a
telephone using the GSM standard (Europe's standard for digital
cellular service) from a PalmPilot. In the Boston area it's being
sold by OmniPoint, a digital cellular carrier that uses the GSM
technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems in building integration software is that
every cellular phone has a different arrangement of contacts across
its bottom. Option solves this problem with a variety of cables
that let you connect the Snap-On with more than 22 different GSM
handsets. You can find more information at
http://www.option.com/snapon.htm.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the Snap-On with an Ericsson 788 GSM phone. The
Snap-On's Phone Manager software let me view both the GSM
telephone's phonebook and the second phonebook that's stored inside
the GSM telephone's built-in smart card. I could move address-book
entries between the Pilot and the telephone, or edit the numbers in
place. Believe me, using the Pilot is a lot easier than trying to
deal with the 788's user interface.
</P>
<P>
   But the Snap-On provides a lot more than simple address book
synchronization. The system's enclosed Short Message Service
software lets you use GSM's built-in paging capability to send
short messages to other GSM users (or to Internet e-mail
addresses). Normally, sending a page from a cell phone is quite
difficult, but when you can compose the message on your Pilot it is
quite easy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Snap-On comes with an application that lets you use
your GSM telephone as a wireless modem. With the software,
originally designed for the Minstrel wireless modem, you can use
the Pilot/GSM combination to browse the Web, check your e-mail, or
send full-blown e-mail messages. You can even synchronize your
Pilot with your desktop computer over the air, provided you have a
modem on your desktop machine and have set it up for remote
synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that's developed some exciting PalmPilot
software for wireless devices is Texas-based JP Software. Called
BeamLink, the program lets you send pages and update the address
book in the new AccessLink II two-way pagers manufactured by
Glenayre. These pagers work with the SkyTel nationwide two-way
paging service.
</P>
<P>
   As its name implies, BeamLink makes use of the infrared port
that's built into both the new Palm III and the AccessLink II
pagers. The infrared system avoids the need to carry around another
cable. Although it's a lot easier to compose a long message on the
Palm Pilot than on the pager's tiny six-button keyboard, the real
benefit of this software is for businesses: Using BeamLink, a
company can download the same address book into 10 or 20 pagers at
the same time, guaranteeing that each member of an organization
will have the same copy of the address book.
</P>
<P>
   BeamLink is still a little rough around the edges _ and the
rough spots are instructive for others who are thinking of
developing software for the two-way wireless market. For example,
while the software can download names, pager numbers, and e-mail
addresses to the two-way pager, it doesn't let you upload the
information from the pager into your Pilot. As the folks at Palm
Computing have known for years, synchronization is the key to
making mobile computers with relatively limited user interfaces
extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious problem with BeamLink has to do with the
software's registration procedure. When I first started up the
program, BeamLink asked me for my serial number; it then sent a
two-way page with my number to JP Software. Although it's
understandable that JP Software wants to track the use (and
possibly the unauthorized use) of its software, a feature like this
one that transmits information over a network without the user's
permission sets a dangerous precedent. Computer users have the
right to use software without revealing information about
themselves to the people who wrote the software.
</P>
<P>
   Users have a right to expect that their personal information
will be kept secret. It's all too easy for software that integrates
computers with two-way wireless communication devices to become
automated surveillance tools. The way to stop this Orwellian
possibility is to loudly protest the companies that are taking the
first steps today.

A 'VIRTUAL MURDERER' STRIKES AT SOCIAL SECURITY FILES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
 c.1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Naples, Fla., woman had applied for a loan, but
bank officers
</P>
<P>
   told her there was one problem. According to Social Security
records, she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration eventually uncovered a case
of ``virtual murder,'' acting inspector general James Huse Jr. told
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday as part of
the panel's continuing investigation of whether private information
is safe on government computers.
</P>
<P>
   Huse said Jorge Yong, a mid-level claims agent at the agency's
Belle Glade, Fla., district office, had had a cyberspace fight with
the unidentified woman that led to his being banned from an
Internet chatroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He admitted that he had used a co-worker's terminal to make
the date of death input into the victim's record,'' Huse said.
</P>
<P>
   Yong resigned, Huse said, and after pleading guilty to one count
of falsifying personal data, was placed on probation for a year,
ordered to pay $700 to his victim and fined $100 by the U.S.
District Court in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security computer system contains personal
information on virtually every American,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., the committee chairman. ``If the computer system is
compromised, information about every single one of us in this room
is available for the picking.''
</P>
<P>
   In coordination with the hearing, the General Accounting Office,
the auditing arm of Congress, issued two reports that Thompson said
``raise serious concerns about risks to the public resulting from
information security weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators, the reports said, were able to easily hack
their way into computer systems at both the Social Security
Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which
runs the nation's largest health care delivery system and
guarantees loans on about 20 percent of U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hacking software has become highly sophisticated and is
readily available off the shelf,'' said Gene Dodaro, the GAO's
assistant comptroller general. ``Even if you had never seen a
computer before, I could show you how to get in by pressing one
(mouse) button,'' he told Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Dodaro testified that ``sensitive information in the VA's
systems, including financial transaction data and personal
information on veterans' medical records and benefit payments, is
vulnerable to inadvertent or deliberate misuse, fraudulent use,
improper disclosure or destruction _ possibly occurring without
detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Huse reviewed the results of ``Operation Pinch,'' which battled
a recent effort to subvert the Social Security Administration's
employees by a ring of ``West African credit card thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   The thieves were aided by federal employees who downloaded
identity information on about 20,000 persons whose credit cards
``were then fraudulently activated by the criminals,'' leading to
bank losses of $70 million, Huse said.
</P>
<P>
   The credit cards were authorized, via toll-free phone lines,
after the information thieves used the card holders' Social
Security numbers, date of birth and mothers' maiden names.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the internal investigation has to the conviction of 12
Social Security employees and three contract security guards. In
return for guilty pleas, all were granted suspended sentences,
including, in some cases, periods of home confinement, and made to
pay only nominal fines.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the law needed to be changed to provide stiffer
sentences in such internal corruption cases.

POTENTIALLY BIG SECURITY FLAW FOUND IN NETSCAPE SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A potentially serious security flaw has been
discovered in the programming language used in the Navigator and
Communicator software of the Netscape Communications Corp., with
the defect possibly allowing an outsider to read information on a
personal computer user's hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness, which was disclosed in Usenet online discussion
groups on Friday by Dan Brumleve, a 20-year-old independent
computer consultant in Sunnyvale, Calif., can be exploited by the
Javascript programming language, which is widely used by World Wide
Web page developers for a variety of common tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Brumleve said that he had tested the attack on a range of
Navigator and Communicator programs, up through the most recent
test version of Communicator, 4.5, and found the flaw in all of
them. The vulnerability does not affect the Microsoft Explorer
browser and e-mail program, Brumleve said.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to take advantage of the vulnerability by writing a
30-line piece of Javascript code that is able to capture and copy
information automatically from the so-called cache, or temporary
storage area, on a PC's hard disk. The captured information can
reveal which Web sites a computer user has recently visited.
</P>
<P>
   The captured information could also include data that a computer
user might have created when communicating with a Web site _
including personal data typed in when registering at a site or
conducting a retail transaction. Credit card information, however,
would not be revealed, because it is protected by separate security
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me, because it means that a high-traffic Web site
might use this to find out what other Web sites their visitors are
going to,'' Brumleve said in a telephone interview Sunday. He said
that the flaw could also be used by an employer to see if employees
were searching for pornography, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no evidence that the security flaw has
actually been exploited by someone with harmful intent, the gravity
of the threat was noted by other computer security specialists.
They noted that a user's vulnerability extends beyond visiting a
hostile Web site that might exploit the flaw. The flaw could also
be exploited through e-mail received using Netscape's software,
they said, by sending an intended victim an e-mail message that
would secretly force the user to run an illicit Javascript program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty scary,'' said Richard M. Smith, president of
Phar Lap Software Inc., a software development company in
Cambridge, Mass. ``In some sense the cache on your computer tells a
lot about your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy of personal information on the Internet has become an
increasingly sensitive issue in recent years as many Web sites have
begun systematically collecting demographic information on Internet
users. But this newly discovered flaw could enable an unscrupulous
person or organization to basically read a person's full Web
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge privacy issue and it goes directly to the
current lack of adequate technical standards to protect privacy on
line,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a public policy group in Washington. ``There's
even a question of a company like Netscape might be liable for the
improper disclosure of private information.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape said Sunday that it was still assessing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a look at the bug, which appears to have privacy
implications,'' said Eric Byunn, a Netscape product manager. He
said that the company would make an announcement soon about its
plans for responding to the flaw.

<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ In an experiment that is half business model and
half populist movement, a small company called Red Hat Software is
charging $50 for an operating system called Linux that anyone can
get free on the Internet, and it is paying programmers decent wages
to write code that it will give away.
</P>
<P>
   While that might seem the most contrarian of business plans, Red
Hat is attracting blue-chip investors to the notion that free can
be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, known alternately as free software and open
source, is built around freely distributing source code, the basic
commands that programmers write. Publishing these instructions
before they are compiled into the binary language of computers
offers other programmers the chance to examine the code and suggest
or actually write improvements.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the movement's proponents say, open source could
harness the collective wisdom of the world's best software
designers for social good, undermine Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
monopoly and propagate an operating system that does not crash.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of their passion is inspired by Linux, a version of
the Unix operating system developed by Linus Torvalds of Finland
and numerous collaborators worldwide. Linux (rhymes with
``cynics'') has attracted a cult-like following among programmers
and systems developers who say it is a more secure, flexible and
economic alternative to Microsoft's industrial-strength operating
system, Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that kind of following, the business-model half of the
Red Hat experiment strikes many people as counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Young, the chief executive of the three-year-old company
in Durham's Research Triangle Park, insists that open-source
products can make money. And although he has nothing against
contributing to a utopian vision of software development in the
process, his pragmatic focus has lately attracted interest from
venture capitalists and corporate backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software industry is built on intellectual property,''
said Young, a 44-year-old Canadian who used to run a
computer-leasing business. ``You own your technology, and if you
get it widely disseminated you can coerce your user base into
buying new releases. We give up that control _ and those profits _
but that is exactly what is going to drive our success, because
that is what's best for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Red Hat's potential corporate backers are Intel Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp. An announcement is expected as early
as Tuesday, when Young is scheduled to appear with executives from
both companies in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Such support, particularly from Intel, whose close ties to
Microsoft have recently shown signs of fraying, would lend
considerable credibility both to Linux and to Red Hat's plans to
build a business by providing customer service and technical
support for the free operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Recent support for Linux and other open-source projects seems to
suggest a growing acceptance in the software industry of an
alternative to the tradition of proprietary code.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, recently licensed Apache, a popular program
for serving up World Wide Web sites. Like Linux, Apache is a free,
open-source product.
</P>
<P>
   And Netscape last February published the source code to its
Navigator browser for navigating the World Wide Web. Forced to stop
charging for Navigator by Microsoft's free distribution of its
competing browser software, Explorer, Netscape gambled that going
one step further and releasing its code would give Navigator a
competitive advantage over Explorer in the long run by spurring
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source has already radically changed the computer
industry,'' said Tim O'Reilly, whose publishing company, O'Reilly &AMP;
Associates, makes money producing user manuals for free software.
``In the first round, open-source software will not beat Microsoft
at its own game. What it is doing is changing the nature of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds, who wrote Linux in 1991 when he was a student at the
University of Helsinki, licensed it in a way that allows anyone to
submit improved code and redistribute it at will. Since then,
thousands of programmers have volunteered elaborate improvements of
their own design for no more reward than the respect of the geek
subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Submissions to Linux's core code, or kernel, are subjected to
instantaneous electronic peer review, a technological meritocracy
that has so far insulated Linux from the kind of fragmentation that
has befallen other operating systems built around the international
Unix standard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the operating system's reputation for power and
reliability, corporations have been reluctant to use Linux because
nobody owns it. That is why the emergence of companies like Red Hat
and Caldera Systems Inc. _ a Linux distributor with a business plan
based on corporate training, services and support _ is considered
crucial to the success of the free operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bolstered by commitments from companies like Oracle,
Netscape, Intel, Informix and Corel, all of which have announced
plans to support Linux in recent months, Red Hat and Caldera are
getting more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But their business plans are fragile. For instance, since Red
Hat wants whatever code it writes to become part of the Linux
kernel, it must be published under open-source rules. That means
that www.cheapbytes.com can, and does, sell Red Hat's entire Linux
package for $1.99 _ $48.01 less than Red Hat's customers pay.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat's Young estimates that as few as 1 in 10 of the people
who use Red Hat have paid him for it. But that is one of the
paradoxical pillars of charging only for support and services, not
for intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to compete with Microsoft,'' Young stresses.
``It's to lower the value of the operating system market. Microsoft
makes $5 billion in operating system sales. If I get that market, I
automatically make it a $500 million market.''
</P>

<P>
   Skeptics are quick to note that the technology companies lining
up behind Linux, with its estimated 7 million users, have their own
competitive reasons to oppose Microsoft, which has 300 million
users for its Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the skeptics point out, no one knows how long
Linux's labor-of-love development by programmers will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``An operating system is a living thing,'' said Carl Shapiro, an
economist at the University of California at Berkeley and a
co-author of ``Information Rules,'' a book to be published this
week by the Harvard Business School Press. ``Ongoing investment and
upgrades are essential to attract customers. Nice cooperative
thoughts are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, use of Linux is growing by more than 40 percent a year,
according to IDC, a research firm. And a 1997 survey by another
research firm, Datapro, found that Linux scored higher with users
than any other operating system. Dell Computer, which last year
began offering Linux to customers who ordered at least 50 computers
a quarter, said that more interest had been expressed in Linux in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   James Love, director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on
Technology, which has encouraged the Justice Department to
investigate Microsoft's Windows licensing deals with computer
manufacturers, said his office had found it impossible to buy Linux
already installed on a PC from a major commercial vendor. But he
managed to install it on his own computer, and he was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've seen an industrial-strength
product developed without a corporation behind it, and we think
it's amazing'' Love said. ``If the operating system is in fact a
natural monopoly, then what could be better than having an
operating system that nobody owns?''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that Linux poses a threat to Microsoft right now.
But at a time when the next version of Windows NT appears
indefinitely delayed by a complexity that has grown unmanageable,
Linux enthusiasts are beginning to find back-door ways to introduce
the operating system into their corporations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Randy Kessel, a manager for technical analysis
at Southwestern Bell, part of SBC Communications, installed Red
Hat's Linux on the 36 desktop personal computers that monitor
network operations in Kansas and Missouri, it was done on something
of a dare.
</P>
<P>
   After poor results testing a memory-intensive application with
Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT, a colleague had asked Kessel
why, if he thought Linux was so great, he did not try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we took a mission-critical operation and we deployed a free
operating system there,'' Kessel said. ``And now we spend a tenth
of the administration cost for those desktops that we do for the
rest of the 315 we use.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he met resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal department says, `When it fails, who do we sue?' ''
he said. ``The IT department says, `It's not a proved product.'
Corporate security says, `It's hackerware.' But it's the only thing
that worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent Linux converts include the movie director James
Cameron's special-effects company, Digital Domain, which used the
operating system to help create the illusions in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the city of Medina, Wash., was overwhelmed by documents
_ including the four file cabinets filled with paperwork on the
mansion built by Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates _ it installed an
electronic document retrieval system that runs on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Jones, president of Archive Retrieval, which installed the
system for Medina, said he was aware of an irony in his choice of
an operating system. But he recalled feeling vindicated when a bug
arose in the scanning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked a question on the Internet, and within a couple of
hours we had an answer,'' Jones said. ``I fixed it myself with
three lines of code. With a commercial product I'd have had to wait
for Microsoft to fix it _ if it ever did. This way, the whole Linux
community benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ewing, 29, who started Red Hat in 1995 because he found
downloading the various pieces of Linux a major headache, said
developing software in isolation _ without public contributions _
``would be like typing with one arm.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet for Linux to ever compete with Windows, it must be
easier to use. Now users must control Linux with a complicated
syntax of arcane commands. So Ewing oversees six programmers
working on a project called Gnome, an effort to hide the nuts and
bolts of the operating system behind the kind of graphical
interface familiar to users of Macintosh or Windows machines.
</P>
<P>
   While they sleep, other groups elsewhere in the world are
getting up to work on Gnome. Often by the next morning, someone
will have translated the code into Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   But Torvalds, who now works for a chip design company in Silicon
Valley, insists that the true strength of an operating system is
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use a Windows machine and the golden rule is: Save, and
save often,'' Torvalds said. ``It's scary how people have grown
used to the idea that computers are unreliable when it is not the
computer at all _ it's the operating system that just doesn't cut
it.''

GOLDMAN, SACHS SHOWS THE RISK OF FORECASTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Those who still believe the stock market is based on
expert knowledge need look no further than this week's cancellation
by Wall Street's leading investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs, of
a multi-billion dollar share offering to realize how wrong they
are.
</P>
<P>
   Long regarded by their peers as the financial world's most
astute bankers, the firm changed its mind at the last minute
because of unstable market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But if Goldman, Sachs didn't recognize earlier the signs of
economic trouble waiting to spring, who could have?
</P>
<P>
   A friend who retired last year after a long career on the London
stock exchange told me that he had no more idea of why markets go
up and down than he did when he started out 45 years ago. ``It's
all basically a mysterious phenomenon,'' he contended. ``Experience
doesn't help much.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good point to remember when, as now, there is constant
discussion of the so-called global economy which half of the
``experts'' warn is headed for a severe recession while the rest
insist such fears are grossly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve lowered the cost of borrowing
money in the United States by one-quarter of a percentage point.
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan explained the step was taken not so
much to help the still strong U.S. economy as to give a boost to
the flagging global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But does a worldwide economy in that sense really exist?
</P>
<P>
   Asia has been at the epicenter of the financial and economic
turbulence of the past 14 months. Yet, even there, many differences
are evident. For example, Taiwan and Singapore have escaped
relatively unscathed; Hong Kong shows signs of a more vigorous
recovery than initially expected. Australia, now very much part of
the Far East economic network, is doing well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities are nervous about a monetary crisis in Brazil
which could produce an adverse effect on the dollar and to some
extent hurt American exports. However, even in the best of times,
Brazil is susceptible to financial frenzy, its currency bouncing up
and down like scantily clad Rio carnival performers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the rest of Latin America is, on average, doing
better than it has since 1945. Mexico, in particular, has displayed
marked resilience following its peso crisis of five years ago _
possibly because it now seems to have a relatively honest
government.
</P>
<P>
   The recent plunge of the ruble was never much more than an
artificial scare, given Russia's tiny share of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Europe continues to insist its economy is picking up
and will go on doing so, as long as the United States doesn't
stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the United States is confronted by the potentially
overwhelming problem of Japan and its sagging banking system. If
the latter collapses, the term ``global economy'' will acquire a
devastating meaning. But U.S. and other western officials appear
more confident than they were just a few weeks ago that Tokyo will
devise an 11th hour rescue.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guarantees, of course, that a global recession
won't take place.
</P>
<P>
   It simply means that when it does occur, it will probably strike
at a time and from a direction unpredicted by anyone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving millions of tons of earth around the Black Thunder coal
mine in Wright, Wyo., has come to resemble playing a video game,
except that the score is kept by military satellites high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cab of each behemoth D11 Caterpillar, a computer
screen displays a little bulldozer plowing through virtual dirt _
red for what needs moving and blue for what needs covering. As a
global positioning system, or GPS, receiver on the roof tracks the
dozer's movement across the screen, the operator's job, explains
Jim Long, the mine's chief surveyor, is to ``push the red to the
blue,'' creating the color green for the desired grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really slick,'' Long said. ``They don't even have to
look out the window _ except to keep from running over somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Thunder, a division of Arch Coal Inc. of St. Louis, will
produce 47 millions tons of coal this year from this one mine,
about 5 percent of U.S. production. And at a time when coal prices
are at a historic low of less than $5 a ton, the GPS gear, linked
to a computer-designed mine plan, helps the company achieve crucial
new levels of efficiency _ whether building roads across the
nine-square-mile site, uncovering coal seams or reconstructing the
original prairie contour once the coal is extracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the company first put GPS units on its bulldozers in July
1997, we had some increases of 30 percent in productivity,'' Long
said. ``That's a pretty amazing number. It's not that the guy is
moving any more dirt. He's getting it to the right place the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Arch Coal is just one of thousands of U.S. companies putting GPS
to work, appropriating a system originally intended for military
navigation and using it for such commercial purposes as mapping
delivery routes, tracking products all the way from factory floor
to retail shelf, and monitoring the whereabouts of mobile workers.
</P>
<P>
   Available for limited civilian use since 1984 but fully
operational only since 1995, GPS technology has become so important
to industry that many businesses now consider it a utility like the
Internet _ an element of information technology helping fuel
America's economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department study (infoserv2.ita.doc.gov/ot) released
this month estimates that worldwide GPS equipment sales will reach
$4 billion this year, and will double by 2000 and double again, to
$16 billion, by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Japan and Europe, where car-navigation systems
are the main use of GPS technology, the commercial market in the
United States is dominated by mapping and geographic information
systems like that employed by the Black Thunder mine. Even though
GPS gear is installed in virtually all U.S. military vehicles, and
the satellite system is run by the Air Force Space Command in
Colorado Springs, military purchases for GPS now represent just a
fraction of industry sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military uses are swamped by civilian use,'' said Joe Canny,
deputy assistant secretary of transportation and the principal
staff person on the government's Interagency GPS Executive Board,
which sets the nation's GPS policy.
</P>
<P>
   No one has estimated the impact of GPS on the nation's gross
domestic product, but the figure is presumably ``enormous,'' said
Scott Pace, an analyst at the Rand Science and Technology Policy
Institute and a co-author of the Commerce Department study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add up the critical industries _ oil and gas, financial
networks, transportation _ you find that GPS is an embedded
assumption in the functioning in every one of those things,'' Pace
said.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, time.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying atomic clocks that are corrected daily to Naval
Observatory standards, the 24 GPS satellites that orbit the Earth
some 11,000 nautical miles above the Equator are the largest source
of accurate time in the world. Much of the nation's power grid, and
all of its long-distance telephone networks, as well as paging and
mobile phone systems, are kept synchronized via software that
periodically downloads GPS time, said Dennis McCarthy, director of
the Directorate of Time at the Naval observatory in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval observatory's time data is available over the Internet
(www.usno.navy.mil) and from computers around the country that
periodically correct their clocks when an orbiting satellite passes
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   And GPS time has become a crucial component of securities
trading and many other forms of financial transactions. The Nasdaq
trading system, for example, relies on a master clock kept in synch
by a satellite dish in Trumball, Conn., which allows every Nasdaq
trade to receive an official time stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial receiver in 1984 cost $150,000, weighed 100
pounds and was accurate to within 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Today a hand-held GPS receiver costs as little as $100, and the
semiconductor chip sets are small enough that the technology is
finding its way into cell phones. And error-correction techniques
have advanced so that specialized GPS devices can be accurate to
the width of a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Such advances have brought all sorts of new GPS commercial and
industrial uses. Backpack GPS units have revolutionized surveying
of construction sites, power lines and boundaries. Creating
accurate control points for such jobs in 1986, for example,
required two workers: one to hold a marked rod and the other to
site direction and elevation through a transit, at a cost of
$10,000 a point. Backpack units worn by a single worker have
reduced the cost to $250 a point, according to the Commerce
Department study.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, the business trend in GPS has been away from
the navigational question ``Where am I on earth?'' and toward the
more managerial interrogation ``Where on earth are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, for instance, has installed GPS units on its
1,600 long-haul trucks, to track their movements and arrival times.
The trucks' locations are beamed to satellites every 10 minutes,
and computers route that data to destinations so that workers there
can be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Before the GPS units were installed two years ago, Federal
Express made ``educated guesswork,'' according to Charlie Hicks,
who is in charge of ground freight. ``Because of our service
commitment,'' he said, ``it is very important to know when things
are going to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar system, sold by Highway Master Corp. of Dallas for
$2,000 a truck, has been installed on 100,000 trucks around the
nation, including the fleet of Wal-Mart Stores; it can keep track
of average speeds and miles per gallon. The Highway Master system
also incorporates cellular telephones to let fleet operators stay
in even closer touch with their drivers.
</P>
<P>
   GPS is by no means a commercial cure-all. In Denver, where
Yellow Cab, a subsidiary of Stamford Capital, installed a $100,000
GPS-based dispatching system in 1996, at an average cost of $350 a
cab, the company has not yet seen any improvement in dispatching
efficiency, said Michael Brown, the company's director of
information systems. So far, the system mainly just lets
dispatchers know how many cabs are stacked up at Denver
International Airport, Brown said. He added that it probably would
not have much impact on costs and revenues until a related
``closest cab'' dispatcher software program is installed a few
months from now.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver system has had at least one tangible benefit,
however. When a customer tried to steal a cab while the driver was
in a store, the dispatcher radioed the police with the cab's
location and the cab was stopped within two blocks.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Gulf of Mexico, many of the petroleum industry's floating
oil rigs are kept in place over their wells with the aid of GPS
signals. John E. Chance &AMP; Associates Inc., a division of Fegro of
the Netherlands, moves rigs into place using GPS signals, and sets
up on-board computers that keep watch over a rig's precise position
and automatically fire underwater thrusters to move it back into
position if it drifts away.
</P>
<P>
   The labor required to position a rig has been cut in half, said
Jim O'Neal, general manager of Chance's marine group.
</P>
<P>
   Rising civilian and commercial demand for GPS has prompted the
government's interagency board to approve tripling the number of
civilian radio signals coming from the military satellites. The
decision was announced earlier this year, but carrying it out has
been at least temporarily delayed by technical questions, costs and
competition for space on the radio-frequency spectrum. Canny said
the additional signals were expected to be available on new
satellites by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest users of the new signals will be airlines,
employing the Federal Aviation Administration's new Wide Area
Augmentation System. The system is supposed to allow pilots and air
traffic controllers to determine an aircraft's location to an
accuracy of within 25 feet _ enabling planes to save fuel and time
by flying directly between airports rather than along strictly
controlled corridors as they must do now to avoid risk of
collisions. Using existing GPS signals and ground-reference points,
the first phase will be introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood has embraced GPS.
</P>
<P>
   In Sylvester Stallone's movie ``Daylight,'' with its climatic
escape from a flooded Holland Tunnel into the Hudson River, the
main characters were shown bursting through the river's surface
from the dark depths below.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Ron Goodman, president of Spacecam, a
special-effects film company in Los Angeles, the river was shot
during the winter without the actors present. A helicopter camera
panned down from the New York skyline as two GPS units, one near
the camera and one on the helicopter's tail, recorded the exact
spatial orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The camera angle and orientation were later duplicated over Lake
Casitas near Los Angeles to film two stunt doubles emerging from
the water. Only later did the actors bubble up in a nice warm
studio tank _ leaving the rest to the special-effects magicians.

TECHNOLOGY: STANDARDS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most ominous trends in Washington is a growing belief
that private industry, particularly any technology-based industry,
is better suited to serving the public interest than are elected
lawmakers and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a recent speech on digital television, William
Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
said that the government should encourage industries to set their
own standards and should be involved only ``when arguments are
distorted by the prism of self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, distorted self-interest is a pretty
accurate description of the slow-motion train wreck that has been
the digital television standards-setting process of the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   And for some who took part in the process, the recent spate of
complaints from TV industry executives rings disingenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the adoption of the new digital TV standard,
members of the Advanced Television Standards Committee
(www.atsc.org) _ whose proposals were adopted almost verbatim by
the FCC _ engaged in a long and vicious battle with digital
technology experts over technical features.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee, which was heavily populated by
broadcast-industry representatives, argued against making
television more friendly to the display of computer-generated
images and text. In the early days, when the debate was only about
high-definition television, they even debated whether the standard
should be analog or digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even brought in a demonstration of the first Internet
browser back in 1993 or 1994,'' said Richard Solomon, an image
specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped
develop the first HDTV camera with Polaroid. ``The computer people
got it right away, but the TV people just didn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Liebhold, former director of Apple Computer's broad-band
multimedia research group, said his inclusion of educators, print
publishers and medical people in early discussions with the
standards committee ``was characterized as computer industry
interference'' and was ``pretty much ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dust finally settled, the TV people appeared to have
won virtually every point. In fact, the announcement of the new
standard on Dec. 26, 1996, noted with pleasure that ``the specific
video formats to be used for digital broadcast television will be
the subject of voluntary industry standards.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``voluntary industry standards'' set by the television
industry are precisely what that industry is now complaining about.
</P>
<P>
   The digital TV standard as proposed by the committee and adopted
by the FCC supports at least 14 different scanning formats, the
technical specifications that describe how a television picture is
created, broadcast and displayed. These formats encompass standard
and high-definition television, as well as what the FCC calls
computer-friendly formats.
</P>
<P>
   But the new digital TV standard does not require programmers to
broadcast any single specific format, as is the case with today's
broadcasts. Neither are equipment manufacturers required to build
receivers that receive any specific format.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, both the television industry and the critics who
accuse the FCC of adopting an overly broad standard acknowledge
that the resulting market chaos will put consumers in an untenable
position. They might have to buy separate receivers to view a wide
variety of programming. In addition, upgrading to more capable
systems is likely to be exponentially more expensive than simply
buying a new television set or set-top box.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the key role that television plays in world culture,
critics say, the willful creation of such chaos does not serve the
public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   William Schreiber, a television and film pioneer who was
director of the Advanced Television Research Program at MIT until
his retirement in 1990, has been active in the digital TV standards
process since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   In a detailed document (available at
www.nytimes.com/tech/schreiber.html), he describes the problems at
length, including, he says, the domination of the standards process
by television broadcasters and TV-set makers. He also asserts that
the FCC has acted against the public interest by not opening the
process to independent evaluation and selecting a single,
technically superior standard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, the commission's chairman, responds that the broad
range of formats embraces both the computer industry and
broadcasters, ``at least preserving the possibility that the
marketplace might not be dictated'' by any single industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC was caught in the position where Congress had decided
to give away spectrum to existing broadcasters in exchange for them
making the transition to HDTV,'' Kennard said. The spectrum would
remain free, Congress said, only if it were used exclusively for
high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's position, Kennard said, was, ``Who are we to dictate
what this technology should be used for?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Liebhold, Solomon, Schreiber and other critics are
disappointed that the digital TV standard has not achieved their
technical ideals, the television industry ``stopped the train from
barreling down the tracks, and they won, though they may not want
to admit it,'' said an industry insider who spoke in exchange for
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this process,'' this insider said, ``the
broadcasters thought they had it completely locked down. Now either
they will step up to the task or morph into a completely new
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: In a world where the forward march of
technology often serves only to create chaos, is the public
interest better served if standards are set by the government or by
the marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the really important question that has not yet been
answered,'' the insider said. ''If we give broadcasters the
spectrum for free, what does the public get back in return?
Separate from developing new services and products, `public
interest' obviously needs to be redefined. If it's just about
pretty pictures, why bother?''

HOW TO VIEW E-MAIL AT WORK USING HOTMAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID EINSTEIN   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I signed up for free e-mail with Hotmail. I've been told I
can use it to access messages from my account at work. How do I do
that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Hotmail, as well as most other free e-mail services, can be
used to access mail from any account that uses the POP3 protocol.
This includes almost all ISP accounts and most corporate accounts.
The only problem would be if your company has thrown up a fire wall
to prevent outside access.
</P>
<P>
   To configure Hotmail to get your POP mail, you'll need a little
information from your systems people at work: the name of the
incoming mail server (also known as the POP server), the ID you use
to access your mail at work, and the password. One other thing:
Hotmail has an option box labeled ``Leave messages on POP server.''
If you want to be able to view messages from your computer at work
after you've read them using Hotmail, select it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; According to my computer, I connect to the Internet at
115,200 bps. Because I have a 56K modem, I know that can't be so.
What's causing the Dial-Up Networking feature to give me the wrong
information, and how can I tell my actual connect speed?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The 115,200 represents the speed at which the modem is
talking to the computer. It has nothing to do with the phone
connection. The most likely explanation is that you've got the
wrong modem driver installed. (A driver is a software file that
controls how the computer works with a peripheral, such as a
modem.) It could be one designed for the brand of modem you have
but not the exact model. Or it could be a generic driver that
happens to work with your modem.
</P>
<P>
   In your situation, it's hard to determine the true connection
speed. You could change drivers and see if that solves the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the modem icon in the Windows Control Panel to find out
which driver you're using, and if it isn't the one for your modem,
try reinstalling the modem using the driver that came with it. If
you don't have that software, go to the Web site of the company
that made the modem _ or the PC if the modem came with the system _
and you should be able to find a driver there.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of modem speeds, a bunch of readers wrote saying they
went to the 3Com Web site but couldn't find the feature I mentioned
that lets you check whether your phone line can handle 56K speeds.
So here's the exact address: www.3com.com/56k/
need456k/linetest.html.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; A while ago, you gave directions for getting rid of the URL
trail in the Address bar of Internet Explorer. Can you tell me how
to do the same thing in Netscape Navigator? I don't want others to
know where I've been going on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Just to refresh everyone's memory, if you click the arrow
to the right of the address space in your browser, you'll see a
list of URLs that you've entered in order to visit Web sites. In
Microsoft Internet Explorer, deleting the list is simply a matter
of clearing the History. (The history is the entire record of where
you've gone on the Web, including all the places you've visited by
clicking your mouse on a hyperlink.)
</P>
<P>
   In Netscape Navigator, clearing the history doesn't empty the
address list (which Netscape calls the Location list). If you want
to remove the addresses, you'll have to do it manually. Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   _ Open the prefs.js file in your user folder inside Netscape.
You can do this in a couple of ways. My favorite is to use Windows
Explorer and click through the directory tree, going to Program
Files, then Netscape, then Users, then finally your own user
folder. Double-click the prefs.js file, and when you're asked which
program to use in opening it, choose Notepad _ a simple
text-editing tool that doesn't add unnecessary formatting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right near the top of the file, you'll find the list of
Internet addresses. In fact, they should be numbered URL1, URL2,
and so forth. Go ahead and delete all the lines that include
addresses, being careful not to erase anything else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Save the prefs.js file and get out of there.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK

   Want to follow the playoffs on your computer? Several Web sites
provide pitch-by-pitch coverage of Major League Baseball, along
with continually updated box scores. Two of the best are ESPN's
SportsZone (www.espn.com) and CBS SportsLine (www.sportsline.com).
Another good option is Stats Inc. on AOL (keyword stats).

TINY NEW CHIP COULD PIT PROTECTION OF PROPERTY AGAINST RIGHT OF 
PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Rowley seems uncomfortable in the role of braggart. A
sheepish look comes over his face when he tells you, ``We're going
to change the way people live.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rowley's assertion is not to be taken lightly. For one
thing, he said those words once before, in the early 1980s, when
the innovation he was introducing was a concept he called voice
mail. For better or worse, he did change the way we live.
</P>
<P>
   The product that inspires his boast today is a humble-looking
chip, about the size of a postage stamp and no thicker than a
nickel. When attached to a computer, it reads fingerprints with a
precision that meets the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
standards for personal identification.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early next year, consumers will see the fingerprint
chip introduced in notebook computers, then in desktop devices.
Every major manufacturer of computer hardware in the United States
is believed to be in some stage of testing or developing products
using the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it is all but certain to be embedded in door and car
locks, bank cards, cellular telephones, driver's licenses and the
sundry other mundane objects that identify us as consumers and
citizens and give us access to places and money.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley is the chief executive of Veridicom, a tiny start-up
company in Santa Clara, Calif. He is backed by venture capital
from, among others, the Intel Corp., which recognizes the chip's
potential to open vast markets in consumer electronics, and Lucent
Technologies, which owns the patents accrued by Bell Laboratories,
where the chip was invented in the early and mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Although the product, known as OpenTouch, is cutting-edge
technology, it is low-tech by silicon standards, making it
inexpensive to manufacture in large numbers. The Korean and
Taiwanese companies under contract to produce it see Veridicom's
chip as a way to milk a few more years from old fabrication plants
that have already been fully depreciated and might otherwise be
closed as obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that the fingerprint chip, is going to be
very inexpensive _ probably less than $10 per chip within 18 months
of its introduction, and eventually even less, industry experts
said. A low price means that it is almost certain to become far
more widely used than voice mail, whether as OpenTouch, which
Veridicom will introduce in November at the Comdex trade show, or
as another company's competing product.
</P>
<P>
   Far less certain is the social and political impact of the
fingerprint chip. It certainly can greatly enhance personal
security. But depending on how it is used, it could have a profound
impact on privacy, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The paranoid will no doubt see in this chip a conspiracy by the
government or another Orwellian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The real threat, though, is not from Big Brother but from a
legion of what a colleague refers to as ``little brothers,''
business interests ranging from magazine publishers, to banks to
indemnity companies that want to track our every move, profile our
every passion, anticipate our every need either to persuade us to
part with our money or to assess us as risks for credit or
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Credible identification cuts two ways when it comes to security
and privacy. The same fingerprint reader that gives us secure
access to our home or car can be used to trace our movements
through office buildings, stores, schools and airports. That can be
good or bad depending on the circumstances and what we are up to.
</P>
<P>
   I may not want anyone to know that I am in Room 1705 of the Acme
Professional Building visiting my lawyer or psychiatrist or heart
specialist or interviewing for a job _ unless the person tracking
me is a fire marshal clearing a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   But if I lose my notebook computer on a flight to Seattle, I
want to know that no one will be able to rifle through my files,
because the manufacturer has frozen the code that reads the
fingerprint chip so deeply in my computer's electronics that no
amount of tampering will allow another person to boot it or to
unscramble the data on my hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, without safeguards, the same
fingerprint-identified passport that will be useless to a thief
will allow governments around the world to track my every move.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ambiguous line between privacy threats and
security will be the use of Veridicom's technology on the Internet.
In many ways, it will be the ultimate ``cookie,'' those files that
Web sites place on our hard drives to identify us, or at least our
computers, when we point our browsers in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this is beneficial. If the fingerprint reader on
my computer serves as a certificate of identification when I buy
something on line, the seller does not know my credit card number
or whether I am paying with credit or cash.
</P>
<P>
   The seller may not even know my identity. Veridicom's chip
assures the seller that I am who I claim to be without revealing
who I am.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when used as an encryption key, the chip will
guarantee that no one can unscramble and read my e-mail or other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are already using cookies to create personal profiles
of Internet users by aggregating every piece of information we
surrender on Web sites. The very kinds of sites we visit reveal a
great deal about us to those who want our money, and when we buy
products or enter contests or register to use a site, we reveal not
only who we are but a great deal about how we live.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a study released this summer by the Federal
Trade Commission revealed that most businesses on the Web did not
tell visitors how the information they surrendered would be used.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, the study found that companies sold information
that they had promised users would be kept confidential. The
Clinton administration insists that for now, the infant
electronic-commerce industries be allowed to police themselves in
matters of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That is frightening enough when our cookies give up information
dropped on our treks through cyberspace. When everything we do on
line can be tied to our credit and bank cards, driver's licenses
and passports, the extra security we have gained might well be
outweighed by the privacy we have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Tom Rowley spends most of his time these days
trumpeting the potential benefits of his chip, but he does not deny
its potential for mischief. After all, he admits, at times even
voicemail ``is a real pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The social stakes this time around are a lot higher.

Seismic device warns of tornadoes 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The South is all too familiar with the devastation tornadoes can
wreak. Parts of metro Atlanta and Hall County were battered earlier
this year by twisters _ the most powerful and violent atmospheric
storms the planet produces _ that caused 14 deaths and $163 million
in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can prevent nature's fury, but an early-warning device
in the running for a $100,000 Innovation in Communication prize can
help those in a tornado's path get to relative safety before the
proverbial freight train thunders overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Seismic Tornado Detector System ``feels'' a twister after it
hits the ground. The device can detect seismic signals from the
storm from between 8 and 17 miles away. A network version has been
designed already, and an in-home version similar to a smoke alarm
will provide a warning time of two to four minutes _ enough for
residents to reach the safest part of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The STD is vying with 10 other ``world-changing ideas'' in the
inaugural award competition, sponsored by global communications
giant Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. A yearlong search garnered entries from 27
countries and resulted in 11 finalists being picked. Some of the
entries were prototypes, some were practical applications and some
were available devices.
</P>
<P>
   The judges include Apollo 11 moon-walking astronaut Buzz Aldrin
and novelist William Gibson, whose influential 1984 novel
``Neuromancer'' coined the term ``cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other finalists are a hand-held translating pen, a
vision aid for the blind that lets them ``see'' with sound waves,
much like a bat does, and a ``critical mass communicator'' designed
to bring communications to those who have no phones and are not
literate.
</P>
<P>
   The prize will be awarded Oct. 30 at the State of the World
Forum in San Francisco. Those with access to the Internet can find
detailed explanations and animated demonstrations of all the
finalists at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .saatchi-saatchi.com.
</P>
<P>
   New phone flips out
</P>
<P>
   Nextel has a little something to say about wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based company is offering a new pocket-sized
digital phone that packs a raft of features into a package only 4.5
inches long, 2.2 inches wide and 1.2 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   The new i1000, manufactured for Nextel by Motorola, also sports
a see-through flip cover that lets the user access several
functions and initiate or receive calls without opening the cover.
</P>
<P>
   The device offers a speakerphone for hands-free operation,
Caller ID, vibration alert, three-way calling for conference calls,
an additional line and nine selectable ring styles.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features are Nextel's Direct Connect two-way
radio function, digital cellular, voice mail, and text and numeric
paging.
</P>
<P>
   The i1000 comes with a standard lithium ion battery, giving the
phone a weight of just 5.78 ounces. If that's still too heavy, a
slimmed-down battery is available that lowers the weight to 5.4
ounces. With either battery the phone will work for 180 minutes of
talk time or 50 hours of standby time.
</P>
<P>
   The i1000 has a regular retail price of $399, but will sell
initially for a special promotional price of $299.
</P>
<P>
   On the home front
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers with computer connections have had their own
home and garden consultant since 1991, when HouseNet had its
beginnings as an electronic bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   HouseNet since has graduated to the World Wide Web and AOL, and
offers tips or calculators on everything from how many gallons of
paint it will take to cover a wall to managing a household budget.
The free site now receives more than 400,000 visits each month.
</P>
<P>
   The site has just added a Smart Savings content area that
created a virtual neighborhood in which visitors can swap
cost-cutting tips and offer advice over HouseNet's bulletin boards
and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   HouseNet also has content areas on home improvement, home
decorating, lawn and garden, and online shopping. The areas are
continually updated with the latest information.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather pay someone else to do the work, HouseNet offers
information from ImproveNet, a Web-based service that keeps and
updates the legal, license, credit and job performance histories of
virtually every one of the nearly 600,000 contractors in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Check out HouseNet at http://www.housenet.com, or type the
keyword ``HouseNet'' on AOL.

Literature sites shed light on the South 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich legacy of Southern literature is thriving on the Web.
Choices range from thoughtful, intelligent sites dedicated to some
of the South's most famous authors to journals and publications
dedicated to publishing new authors and fresh looks at the South
moving toward the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   WaySouth (http://www.waysouth.com) describes itself as ``an
Internet journal of original essays and stories from a unique
Southern perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   True to its word, WaySouth stays away from ``magnolia-ridden
cliches.'' Current stories document the hip-hop scene in Atlanta,
the nuances of the Southern accent and a thought-provoking essay
from publisher Grayson Hurst Daughters about George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   WaySouth is clearly in ancient stages of development, but the
e-zine looks as if it could eventually become a must read for
lovers of literature and the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Brightleaf Review (http://www.brightleaf-review.com/) is the
online version of the print publication. The quarterly publication
features fiction, essays and photographs from well-known and
not-so-well-known Southern writers.
</P>
<P>
   Brightleaf is beautifully designed for the Web with copy and art
in just the right measure. There is also a section of current news
and features planned for upcoming issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you'd like to subscribe to the offline publication or
order back issues, you can print out a form to fax or mail back.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Mississippi _ known as Ole Miss in the South _
has an astonishingly complete Web site devoted to the grand old man
of Southern literature, William Faulkner
(http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/(tilde)egjbp
</P>
<P>
   /faulkner/faulkner.html).
</P>
<P>
   An excellent resource for both scholars and fans, this
comprehensive site includes everything from a RealAudio greeting
from Faulkner to bibliographies, frequently asked questions,
details of Faulkner's Hollywood years and even a weather report for
the author's fictitious Yoknapatawpha County (it's actually a link
to the Weather Channel's forecast for Oxford, Miss., but why
quibble.). Students will love the extensive commentary and plot
descriptions of all Faulkner's works, trivia questions, parodies
and a wide variety of other information.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also has an
extensive Southern literature project online called Documenting the
American South (http://sunsite.unc.edu/docsouth/).
</P>
<P>
   The DAS database contains resources on Southern history
literature and culture from the colonial period through the early
part of the 20th century. Available for online perusal are slave
narratives, first-person narratives and a large block of Southern
literature.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to navigate the site is to search the collections
by author, even if you are searching for first-person narratives.
The collection is still in the process of being digitized for the
Web, and this seems like the best way to find out what is available
online.
</P>
<P>
   A quick author search turned up narratives with titles such as
``A Virginia Girl in the Civil War,'' and ``Life of George M.
Horton. The Colored Bard of North Carolina: 1797-1883.'' While the
DAS database isn't cleverly designed or easy to navigate at times,
the glimpses of Southern life it provides make it a site worth
investigating.

HOW MUCH DO COMPUTERS HELP STUDENTS LEARN MATH?

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)

 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first large-scale examination of how computers affect the
learning of mathematics in American classrooms found that when used
selectively by trained teachers in middle schools they can
significantly enhance academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also indicated that their value in elementary
school is far more limited and that when used primarily for drills
and practice at either level, which is common, or when students
spend long periods of time using them, computers in schools can be
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The results imply that school districts should spend more on
computers in middle schools than elementary schools and should
focus attention on professional development for teachers to make
sure they know how to use the computers effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called ``Does it Compute?'' released Tuesday, was
carried out by a researcher at Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J. and sponsored by the journal Education Week and the
Milken Exchange on Education Technology, which promotes the
effective use of computers in the classroom. It took the scores of
thousands of fourth and eighth graders on the 1996 math portion of
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, the most
widely cited test given to samples of students across the country,
and examined them based on surveys of students and teachers
regarding classroom computer use.
</P>
<P>
   Among eighth graders, it found that when students used computers
for more complex mathematics like simulations, which measure
changing variables, or applications, where data are manipulated and
analyzed, gains of more than a third of an academic year were
registered. For fourth graders using computers for mathematical
games, the gain was a tenth of an academic year, or a few weeks'
worth of instruction. The study divided computer use into four
categories: drill and practice (common but least effective),
demonstration of new topics (seldom used), as well as mathematical
games, and simulations and applications.
</P>
<P>
   By using a large sample size and controlling for such factors as
socio-economic background, teacher preparedness, class size and
school environment, the new study offers insight in the heated
debate over the cost-benefit of the $5 billion spent annually on
school computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When computers are used to perform certain tasks, namely
applying higher order concepts, and when teachers are proficient
enough in computer use to direct students toward productive uses
more generally, computers do seem to be associated with significant
gains in mathematics achievement,'' concluded the report, written
by Harold Wenglinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``The effects of technology appear to be much smaller
in the fourth than the eighth grade, and so may not be
cost-effective. To the extent that the primary benefit of computers
lies in applying higher order skills, there may not be much
opportunity to benefit from using computers before middle school.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumscribed and mixed nature of the findings, they
are likely to be used by both sides in the debate over whether the
investment has proven itself. In 1983, there was a computer for
every 125 students whereas in 1995, the ratio was 1 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells me is that under certain conditions, uses of
technology with certain kids in certain subjects at certain times
will be effective,'' said Larry Cuban, an education professor at
Stanford University and a longstanding skeptic toward the value of
computers in schools. ``That kind of conditional statement can be
made about virtually any approach to teaching. The question I
continually ask is how else we could achieve the same results in a
less costly way.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have advocated increased investment in education
technology say they feel vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unprecedented about this study is the way it takes a
broad cross section of schools,'' said Christopher Dede, a
professor of education and information technology at George Mason
University in Virginia. ``It turns out that if you are at all in
the ballpark about using technology correctly, there are some
things that are happening that are good. It is not idiosyncratic to
one teaching style or software vendor but something fundamental.
Technology permits different kinds of pedagogy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report describes technology uses among the 6,627 fourth
graders and 7,146 eighth graders who took the core NAEP assessment
in mathematics in 1996. It sought to avoid pitfalls of earlier
studies on computer use by, for example, asking not about ratio of
computer to student but frequency of use since in many schools
computers may be available but unused.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that eighth graders and fourth graders use
computers in school at about the same frequency. Less well off
students have as much access to computers as better off students
and, in fact, poor students had higher levels of computer use than
their better off peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to white, non-poor, and suburban students, those who
are minority, poor and urban find at least as much opportunity to
use computers in school,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added, ``It seems that policies to promote computer access in
school have succeeded in eliminating inequities of this sort; yet
inequities in teacher preparedness and what is taught using
computers remains.''
</P>
<P>
   The report measured teacher preparedness by whether teachers had
received training in computer use but it did not distinguish
between a weekend seminar and a semester-long course. Any teacher
who had any training was counted as prepared.
</P>
<P>
   It found that when computers were used largely for drill and
practice in eighth grade, there was lower academic achievement. For
fourth graders, mathematical games were positively related to
academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledges that its method allows for possible
cause-and-effect confusion, saying that strong students may use
computers in more complex ways. But by controlling for background
and student work the previous year, the study concluded that
computers were the likely source of the positive results.

STUDY SAYS COMPUTERS MAY HINDER STUDENT PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL DOUGAN   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Students who spend too much time trying to learn
their lessons at computers may end up with lower scores on tests,
according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Education Week magazine, indicated
that fourth- and eighth-grade students who spent too much class
time learning math at a computer screen generally had poorer
grades. The reason: some computer time is devoted to goofing
around, according to Craig Jerald, project coordinator for the
magazine's ``Technology Counts '98'' survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be adding a lot of aimless activities that have
entertainment value but not education value,'' Jerald said. The
study noted a 20 percent drop in test scores for fourth-grade
students who used classroom computers more frequently. Frequent use
of home computers resulted in a 26 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that some types of computer training
enhance test scores while others diminish those scores, Jerald
said. Generally, the better the teachers were trained, the better
more the students learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What mattered in technology was whether teachers had training
in computers and the way they used computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the study said the average American school has 17 students
per classroom computer. The highest rated state was Alaska, with 9
students per computer, while Louisiana had 25. And 44 percent of
the nation's schools had links to the Internet.

EXPERT FOR MICROSOFT HELPS FIGHT ONE OF ITS SUBPOENAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The software industry is a notoriously fast, fluid business,
with today's friend becoming tomorrow's foe. So too, it seems, for
the industry's most famous defendant, Microsoft Corp., in its
pretrial preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft recently selected Richard Schmalensee, a distinguished
economist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, as its expert witness to explain why the huge software
company is a national asset and not a monopolistic predator. He
will testify before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court in Washington, who will hear the antitrust case filed against
Microsoft by the government and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee is also helping to fight a subpoena filed last
week by Microsoft's lawyers in preparation for the trial, scheduled
to begin Oct. 15. MIT and Harvard University filed a motion on
Friday in a federal court in Boston to stop Microsoft from
obtaining the interview tapes and transcripts for a book written by
two business school professors, one from MIT and the other from
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   As the acting dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management,
Schmalensee told Michael Cusumano, a Sloan professor of management
and co-author of the book, to fiercely resist the Microsoft
subpoena. ``He put on his dean's hat and advised me not to hand
anything over,'' Cusumano said.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to Schmalensee said Tuesday that he was unavailable
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The book research sought by Microsoft involves nearly 200 hours
of tape-recorded sessions and more than 2,000 pages of interview
transcripts with current and former executives of Netscape
Communications Corp. The Microsoft legal team wants the materials
to try to show that Microsoft's rise in the market for Internet
browsing software was more a result of Netscape's mistakes than of
any alleged misconduct by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling on another subpoena, Microsoft won a round Tuesday.
Jackson ordered that Oracle Corp. had to hand over to Microsoft
documents concerning agreements it has with other companies,
including Apple Computer, IBM and others. Microsoft is seeking the
information to try to show that Microsoft meetings the government
has characterized as efforts to thwart competition are actually
commonplace in the industry, where competitors often cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which will be shipped by Simon and Schuster to stores
within days of the start of the trial, is titled ``Competing on
Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with
Microsoft.'' The other author was David Yoffie, a professor at
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The book does document Netscape's missteps, but Yoffie said he
also thought that Microsoft's extremely aggressive business
practices in the Internet software market had almost invited a
strong reaction from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that he was not making a legal judgment, Yoffie
said, ``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it
did without crossing the line as much as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the federal courts to decide whether Microsoft
violated any laws. But legal experts said that pointing out the
mistakes of competitors is a standard line of defense in antitrust
cases. It was used successfully in private antitrust cases by Xerox
in the 1970s and Eastman Kodak in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the shot-yourself-in-the-foot defense,'' said Stephen
Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator. ``Microsoft will argue that
it is not a predatory monopolist but that Netscape was its own
worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the court will have a great measure of discretion on how
much of a role competitor information will play in the case. It
could weigh heavily, or the court could decide that the real issue
is not Netscape's mistakes but Microsoft's use of its market power,
Axinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and MIT assert that Microsoft's subpoena of the writers'
materials poses a threat to the First Amendment rights of the
authors and to the integrity of academic research. The Harvard
Business School curriculum, Yoffie observed, is based on case
studies of corporations. The quality of that work, he added, rests
on the ability of the researchers to assure corporate executives
that confidential information will remain confidential.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our whole research process at Harvard is put at risk by
this,'' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft obtained a copy of the manuscript in early September
through a subpoena issued to Netscape. The authors had given a
couple of Netscape executives copies of the manuscript to read and
review confidentially. On Sept. 18, Microsoft asked the authors to
hand over their tapes and notes voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response was, `Not on your life,''' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the authors did offer a compromise: Allow a third party
to review the tapes to verify the accuracy of the quotations from
Netscape executives. Microsoft rejected that proposal and
subpoenaed the materials four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft will prevail remains uncertain. Massachusetts
has a ``shield'' law that affords writers some protection for
confidential sources and unpublished research materials. But that
protection is generally less for academics than it is for print
journalists, and legal experts describe the law as weak.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, legal experts added, will try to override the shield
law by saying that the authors' research is crucial to its defense
and cannot be obtained elsewhere.

<P>
   Under Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, I foresee
an unreasonable financial policy aimed at pumping the economy with
empty rubles. I'm convinced that no structural economic changes
will be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the communists have become the ruling party. They have
all the levers of influence on the country's social and economic
life. So far the only things they haven't gotten their hands on are
the people's basic rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party would love to introduce censorship, and
that's what it will try to do. The communists dream of having
political control over the power ministries and they will spare no
effort to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that two years ago Boris Yeltsin became president
under the banner of fighting communist restoration, yet by now he
has voluntarily handed over the economy to them. But Yeltsin has
grown weak. His main task is to hold onto the presidency and
preserve himself as a guarantor of at least those rights and
freedoms that society managed to achieve since the reign of Mikhail
Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Yeltsin wasn't the kind of person to assume such a
modest role. But people change. Age, health and a person's
surroundings take their toll. By dismissing the ambitious reform
government of Sergei V. Kiriyenko, Yeltsin in effect laid down his
powers as the head of state responsible for Russia's social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the communist cabinet Primakov has formed will
last long. Primakov, formerly foreign minister and one-time head of
Russia's foreign intelligence service, most likely is around for
the long haul, but his ministers aren't. Primakov is a smart and
talented man who, in moving from the Politburo to Yeltsin's
Kremlin, shows he has learned lessons from life's experiences. I
don't think he'll tie himself to the policies his cabinet will be
conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Certain deputies and ministers will be kicked out of the
Primakov government, and they will be held personally responsible
for the collapse of financial, social and industrial policies. This
is a tactic that Primakov knows well, and is most likely one he
will stick to.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we will see the level of stealing and corruption rise
sharply; budget money will be allocated to departments and
enterprises in an irrational manner. The bankruptcies of many banks
and small and medium-size businesses will leave hundreds of
thousands of qualified people unemployed, and this includes Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The people will be running away from the ruble, and its rate to
the dollar will be unpredictable. The government will try to fix
it, and in so doing it will generate a hard-currency black market.
The rate will jump up and down, and speculators will make a fortune
off it while ordinary citizens will plunge deeper into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the communist authorities' obsession with printing
new money, next year inflation will fluctuate from 100 percent to
1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The communists could use the people's protests to dislodge
Yeltsin. But right now he isn't controlling the country's social
and economic situations. He is not responsible for wages, pensions,
benefits and the military's salaries. Yeltsin will not be actively
involved in any kind of economic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If the communists do manage to dislodge Yeltsin, this will
inevitably bring back censorship and control over the most
influential ``renegade'' ministers through political torture and
terrorism. The people can be incited to demand Yeltsin's dismissal
by blaming him for the social and economic problems, but from now
on, in fact, the communists are the ones who are responsible for
setting the country on its course.
</P>
<P>
   In his final speech, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
whom Yeltsin had tried to bring in to replace Kiriyenko, said the
whole situation would end with the power going not to the
communists, but to the radical ultranationalists. This is possible.
It will all depend on the amount of the communists' madness per
unit of time. If the average month salary drops to $3 and the
streets are filled with millions of homeless people, it's very
probable. If we have a more or less balanced policy, we can avoid
the brown shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Initially Yeltsin fought for Kirikenko; he had a hard time
convincing the Duma to accept Kiriyenko and bringing him to the
political stage and so he linked his own fate with Kiriyenko's.
</P>
<P>
   But after Yeltsin himself sacked the Kiriyenko cabinet and
practically kept out of the process of endorsing a new premier, he
made it clear that he is voluntarily tapering his duties.
</P>
<P>
   I consider the Kiriyenko government to have been the best
qualified in all Russia's years of reform. We had a chance to
minimize the financial crisis, but not to avoid it altogether.
Right now, one of the greatest hazards for the country is to
default on the estimated $180 billion in foreign debt. In other
words, for the government to turn its back on its obligations to
the Paris and London clubs of government creditors, the IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This default could have been avoided under the Kiriyenko
government by immediately holding talks on the process of
liquidating debts. Under Primakov's leftist, or communist,
government, default is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Kiriyenko regime was entirely capable of conducting
structural reforms, including the implementation of major
investment projects. It was also capable of making the investment
climate more attractive by improving the tax system and protecting
owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   These are ideas that will be removed from the lexicon of
Primakov's rule. I think that with Yeltsin's support, the Kiriyenko
government would have been able to hold out, not without a certain
amount of tension and provided that it corrected its mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   I feel that it was a huge mistake on the part of the president
to dismiss the Kiriyenko cabinet. But right now Yeltsin's position
is such that he is unable to provide political protection. And it
was because of this, unfortunately, that the Kiriyenko government
was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is rapidly approaching the abyss of a national disaster.
Elections to the Duma are not scheduled until December 1999. In the
meantime, we must be prepared for everything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Boris Y. Nemtsov, first vice premier in charge of industry in
the Russian Federation under Sergei V. Kiriyenko, was also the
governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region and a post-Soviet, liberal,
free-market reform member of President Boris Yeltsin's early
administration. This commentary is adapted from an interview
conducted by Alexander Bekker, a correspondent for the Moscow

   Initially Yeltsin fought for Kirikenko; he had a hard time
convincing the Duma to accept Kiriyenko and bringing him to the
political stage and so he linked his own fate with Kiriyenko's.
</P>
<P>
   But after Yeltsin himself sacked the Kiriyenko cabinet and
practically kept out of the process of endorsing a new premier, he
made it clear that he is voluntarily tapering his duties.
</P>
<P>
   I consider the Kiriyenko government to have been the best
qualified in all Russia's years of reform. We had a chance to
minimize the financial crisis, but not to avoid it altogether.
Right now, one of the greatest hazards for the country is to
default on the estimated $180 billion in foreign debt. In other
words, for the government to turn its back on its obligations to
the Paris and London clubs of government creditors, the IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This default could have been avoided under the Kiriyenko
government by immediately holding talks on the process of
liquidating debts. Under Primakov's leftist, or communist,
government, default is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Kiriyenko regime was entirely capable of conducting
structural reforms, including the implementation of major
investment projects. It was also capable of making the investment
climate more attractive by improving the tax system and protecting
owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   These are ideas that will be removed from the lexicon of
Primakov's rule. I think that with Yeltsin's support, the Kiriyenko
government would have been able to hold out, not without a certain
amount of tension and provided that it corrected its mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   I feel that it was a huge mistake on the part of the president
to dismiss the Kiriyenko cabinet. But right now Yeltsin's position
is such that he is unable to provide political protection. And it
was because of this, unfortunately, that the Kiriyenko government
was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is rapidly approaching the abyss of a national disaster.
Elections to the Duma are not scheduled until December 1999. In the
meantime, we must be prepared for everything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Boris Y. Nemtsov, first vice premier in charge of industry in
the Russian Federation under Sergei V. Kiriyenko, was also the
governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region and a post-Soviet, liberal,
free-market reform member of President Boris Yeltsin's early
administration. This commentary is adapted from an interview
conducted by Alexander Bekker, a correspondent for the Moscow
News.) &LR;

DRIVING MY LIFE AWAY FROM TEXAS TO NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I started out in the newspaper business as a sportswriter. My
career goal was to cover major-league baseball, to travel from city
to city with the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness I was a lousy baseball writer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this an official tip of the cap to baseball writers,
baseball players, baseball groupies and all other individuals who
spend days and weeks on the road in pursuit of their livelihoods or
hobbies. I just came off an 18-day road trip; I'm exhausted and
disoriented, not to mention dazed and confused.
</P>
<P>
   I traveled by car. Big-time sportswriters usually get where
they're going by airplane. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure
which is worse.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to fly. Too crowded on the planes and in the airports.
Too much time on the ground before.
</P>
<P>
   But cross-country driving has become a challenge of inhuman
proportions. Highway reconstruction. Bad drivers. Overly aggressive
drivers. Road rage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm getting too old to be putting 4,000 miles on the ol'
Buick in a single trip. Maybe I've lost the edge that makes
spending more than 60 hours behind the wheel seem like a really fun
way to fritter away three weeks in September.
</P>
<P>
   I took a similar trip once before, in 1989, for the same reason:
to watch Miss Texas compete in the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic
City, N.J. Memory tells me that the drive to the ocean and back was
more enjoyable that time, but I wouldn't swear to it.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm starting to whine now. My reason for commenting on the
challenges of roaming the nation's highways and byways is to warn
fellow travelers: Do not, under any circumstances, count on finding
a place to sleep in Arkansas on a night when a hurricane is about
to strike Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Because I left Illinois later than I should have on Saturday, I
decided that I would stop about halfway to Fort Worth and spend the
night. My chosen destination: Forrest City, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Having traveled Interstate 40 through eastern Arkansas on many
occasions, it was my distinct impression that a person could stop
at just about any motel along the way and have no problem finding a
room. I saw no need whatsoever to make a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   But when I asked about a room at the Holiday Inn in Forrest
City, the desk clerk told me that there was no room in the Inn _
and or in any other inn in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to keep going and stop in Little Rock. When I got to
President Clinton's former place of residence, however, I was wide
awake. I have no idea if there were any hotel rooms available
because I didn't bother to inquire. On to Texarkana.
</P>
<P>
   As I pulled into town, I noticed a small pickup on the ramp
ahead of me. I followed the truck as it darted frantically from one
motel to the next, the driver jumping out and dashing into the
lobby and then dashing back to the pickup and speeding to the next
motel.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly became obvious that there were no rooms in these
inns, either.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Shell station just off Interstate 30 on Route 71, and
I stopped there for gasoline and coffee. The attendant, who was in
the second half of a double shift, said he could call a friend at a
nearby motel and try to secure a room for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can usually roust up something,'' he said, ``but I don't
know about tonight. It's been crazy around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Texarkana flooded with hurricane evacuees, he said,
but the rodeo had been in town that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I declined his offer to help me find a room. He bought me an
extra cup of coffee and urged me to be careful. I motored on.
</P>
<P>
   It was 8 a.m. or so when I finally rolled into Fort Worth.
Counting coffee breaks and a nap at a rest stop, the 13-hour trip
had taken about 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, folks. I used to think this stuff was fun.

FINDING HOPE IN A WALL OF MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tuesday, over the rumble of late afternoon
traffic, the brass blare of ``Taps'' rang out over a field of
sun-soaked green grass beside the Hudson River. Names had been read
into a microphone. Flags had been lowered. Tears had been wiped
away. And now the wall was moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Not the real wall, of course. That occupies a corner of the Mall
in Washington, just past a powerful bronze statue of grunts in
jungle gear. The real wall is carved black marble, roughly twice
the size of the replica that moves from city to city around
America. The moving wall was last in this town 12 years ago. I went
to Washington to see the real wall in 1983, the first summer it was
open to the public. I found some familiar names on the roster of
58,000 dead _ guys I'd known in high school, one from college.
</P>
<P>
   But I went to Tuesday's ceremony in an effort to find still one
more name. Some months back _ before the first of the year, anyway
_ a woman had called me. She said she'd read in my column that I'd
gone to Temple University in Philadelphia. From my picture, she
said, I looked about the right age to have known her brother, Bill
Geary.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I said, I had. Temple was then and is now a huge, teeming
urban university with tens of thousands of students. But I'd been
an editor on the Temple News, and Bill Geary had been active in
student affairs. He was a tall, ruddy, good-looking guy, immensely
likable.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're Bill's sister,'' I said. ``What's he doing with
himself these days?''
</P>
<P>
   He was killed in Vietnam, she told me. He'd joined the service
right after graduation as an infantry officer. He'd lasted only a
few months. So, there it was _ still one more person I'd known
who'd died in that war. And here I was, 30 years after the fact,
hearing about Bill Geary's death for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't fight in Vietnam. I spent active duty in an Air Force
uniform stateside, putting out a military newspaper. I viewed that
war then and now as the product of tragically flawed thinking. If
there'd been a genuine threat to this country's safety, as there
had been in my father's war, they couldn't have handed out the guns
and the uniforms quickly enough. As it was, many people my age saw
Vietnam as a towering mistake, which it indisputably turned out to
be.
</P>
<P>
   But many people saw things differently then _ most, in fact.
Fathers and sons were, as fathers and sons always are, forged by
different experiences. Today, the fiercest conflict between the
generations focuses on the relative merits of the Rolling Stones
and Marilyn Manson. Three decades ago, we lived in grimmer times.
</P>
<P>
   Kids today just don't know _ not the way their fathers and
grandfathers know. To be young today is to live in a fabulous era.
The economy is soaring. Even the poorest among us enjoy a level of
luxury and comfort that no other generation could even imagine.
Most crucial, though, young men aren't being dragged off to
pointless, futile struggles with the Ho Chi Minhs of the world.
They don't even have to troop off to just and unavoidable war
against the likes of an Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   That wall is important for a good many reasons. It represents
honor and patriotism and sacrifice. But it also represents the
needless loss of nearly 3 million years of human life. I took
comfort in only one thought Tuesday, as I tried and failed to find
Bill Geary's name among the missing multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   My son is a college senior. As a middle-aged man, he'll conduct
no such search of his own.

 MODERN WORLD CAN LEARN LESSONS FROM 1930s APPEASEMENT  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sixty years ago, Great Britain and France signed
the Munich Pact in an attempt to appease Nazi Germany by selling
out Czechoslovakia in exchange for peace. A few months after the
agreement was signed, Adolf Hitler's Panzer divisions rolled into
Poland, launching World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Munich Pact failed so abysmally to prevent war, its
primary lesson has always been the danger of appeasement. Indeed,
appeasement, which used to mean ``peaceful reconciliation'' _
something noble and positive _ became, after Munich, a dirty word,
so that today appeasement means caving in to a bully, usually out
of cowardice but sometimes simply out of stupidity or naivete.
</P>
<P>
   But the lessons of the Munich Pact go far beyond the obvious
hazards of appeasement. They are embodied in the words of Neville
Chamberlain, the British prime minister, and the driving force
behind the accord. It was Chamberlain who, three days before
signing the agreement in Munich, Germany, dismissed the troubles in
Czechoslovakia as ``a quarrel in a faraway country between people
of whom we know nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The world would pay a steep price for this arrogant
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The ``quarrel'' between Germany and Czechoslovakia, simmering
for some time, came to a boil on Sept. 12, 1938, at the annual
Nuremberg Rally. Here, under the usual spotlights and before the
usual shrieking crowds, Hitler made an impassioned and threatening
speech, screaming that Czechoslovakia must hand the Sudentenland
over to Germany or face war. Violent street-fighting broke out
throughout the Sudentenland the following day, urged on by the
resident Nazis; the Czechs sent in troops and declared martial law.
Hitler looked ready to march straight into Prague, and Europe
looked ready to plunge into its second war in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   At this point _ Sept. 15 _ Chamberlain intervened, offering to
fly to Germany and meet with Hitler at Berchtesgaden.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain eventually made three trips to Germany, each time
assuring Hitler that while Great Britain would look unfavorably
upon a German invasion of Czechoslovakia, there would be no problem
with a negotiated settlement. In other words, Hitler could have
whatever he wanted as long as he didn't go to war to get it.
</P>
<P>
   France, which actually had a military alliance with
Czechoslovakia, eagerly seconded him. Arrogance and indifference to
the Czechs won out, and the Munich Pact was signed by Hitler,
Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini of Italy and Premier Edouard Daladier
of France just before 2 a.m. on Sept. 30, while Europe slept.
</P>
<P>
   Munich was the final nail in the Czechs' coffin. Less than six
months later, Hitler took over what bits and pieces of
Czechoslovakia remained after the loss of the Sudentenland and
absorbed them into the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Czechoslovakia disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain had what they wanted: peace.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. By showing Germany how far they were willing
to go to keep themselves out of war _ so far as to swallow the loss
of a friendly, though ``faraway,'' country _ Britain and France had
merely encouraged Hitler to find other countries to pillage. Next
up was Poland. This proved to be one faraway country too many for
France and Britain; they supported their ally, and World War II
began on Sept. 1, 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The Munich Pact sacrificed a nation whose only crime was that it
was weak, threatened, and far away. Today such countries abound,
especially since the fall of the Soviet Union. No nation _ not even
one as powerful as the United States _ can plunge aggressively into
every regional conflict. At the same time, Munich teaches us that
an arrogant disregard for the fate of ``faraway countries'' because
of preoccupation with other concerns _ the economy, presidential
scandals, military timidity _ can be expensive, not only in terms
of war and peace but also in terms of (if it still matters our
national honor.

 McGWIRE, SOSA `TIE' IS IN THE STARS  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Star bright, star light. First star I see
tonight. Wish I may, wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.
</P>
<P>
   In about a month I will mark my 49th birthday, an age that
should make me an unlikely candidate for sing-songy childish rhymes
and wishing on stars. But the fact is, I still recite that rhyme in
my head whenever I see the first star of evening. (A stack of hay
bales compels me to a similar, though decidedly Midwestern chant.)
</P>
<P>
   The only difference now is, instead of wishing for a movie-star
husband, a mansion or world peace as I did when I was a kid, I wish
for little things that don't quite qualify for an official prayer.
Things that would just make me smile if they came true.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the month of September, my star wishes (and hay
wishes) were for one thing: That the professional baseball home-run
race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa would end in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the final weekend, it looked as though my wish might
be granted: both men had 66 dingers each. But, apparently, the
baseball gods are on a different frequency than hay bales and the
first evening star. McGwire won it outright with 70 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I love ties. They're one of the few experiences in life
in which two entities can bust their butts against each other _ yet
one doesn't have to end up being ``the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that pro football and maybe society in general would
be better off if all that ``sudden death'' _ what a perfectly nasty
term _ were banished forever and tie games were reinstated. Yes,
yes, yes. I know that means we could end up with two Super Bowl
champions. Like that would really sully the purity of the event,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Even when I was writing about sports for a living and pretending
to hate ties (Who could afford to be a woman and a sissy?), I
secretly despised the tired cliche: ``A tie is like kissing your
sister.'' It's such a narrow-minded, exclusively male view; nobody
ever says a tie is like kissing your brother. And it objectifies
and puts down females: The whole analogy presupposes that your
sister is standing there, passively offering herself to be kissed.
</P>
<P>
   But as early as 1966 I learned not to talk that way because real
sports fans are supposed to hate ties. In an unofficial national
championship game that year, Ara Parseghian, the revered football
coach at unbeaten Notre Dame, chose to carefully grind out the
clock and take a 10-10 tie with unbeaten Michigan State rather than
risk a possible interception and loss.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Parseghian was thoroughly vilified. Many of the
nation's sports writers labeled him a coward and, for awhile, his
name was synonymous with no-guts play. Anyone who took a
chickenbleep route to victory was said to be ``doing a
Parseghian.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest I mislead, I'm not lobbying for a world of nothing but
ties. The entire baseball season might consist of about 11 games if
we did that. I just wish that when they occur within the original
rules of a game, we'd have a celebratory attitude about them; we'd
see them as a good thing, not some missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to say that McGwire and Sosa have managed to promote
this spirit more than any athletes I have ever witnessed. Because
they were both so hard-working, gracious and generous during their
contest _ and so lovable in their different ways _ no favorite
emerged. Much as you liked McGwire and wished him well, you didn't
particularly want to see him succeed at Sosa's expense. Or
vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the home-run derby wound down to its last weekend, I
was amazed and delighted to find all sorts of people talking about
a tie, hard-core sports fans _ men even _ speaking aloud about
their hope that somehow both the Cardinal and the Cub could
``win.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who knows? Maybe this past September, as the first evening
star rose and shone all over the USA, I wasn't the only aging
boomer looking up and asking for a little mojo action in the
majors.

desert oasis with the greatest concentration of endemic species in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While threatened birds such as the bald eagle, white-faced ibis,
Western burrowing owl and peregrine falcon are known to haunt this
refuge, the endangered wildlife star here is the pupfish. Three
types of this tiny fish, which tops out at 3 inches long, are found
within the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers direct visitors to the springs where pupfish can be
viewed. The shallow springs are fed with fossil water so clear that
it reflects the blue of the sky and the green of the algae on which
the small fish feed. During breeding season in the spring, the male
pupfish are a striking blue.
</P>
<P>
   At the refuge headquarters, a raised boardwalk takes visitors
through a desert marsh to Crystal Springs, where the fish are so
small that most fish-spotters walk away frustrated. The fragile
plant life of this area also gives cover to many types of birds
including ducks and quail. And almost everywhere you look hides a
rabbit's tail.
</P>
<P>
   No admission is charged at Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge.
The park is open dawn to dusk, and it does not permit overnight
camping. Visitors can swim and picnic at Crystal Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   For information, write to Refuge Manager, Ash Meadows National
Wildlife Reserve, P.O. Box 115, Amargosa Valley, Nev. 89020; or
call 702-372-5435.

<P>
   DEATH VALLEY, Calif. _ When the sun finally inches over the
horizon on a recent crisp morning, a classic scene is revealed. The
apexes of a dozen honey-colored sand dunes are topped with
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to go to work at Death Valley National Park; the
light is changing, and swiftly. From an amber glow to the brilliant
sparkle of gold dust, the sky's light evolves. Distant mountains
appear black, then rusty and red. It's lavender and pink, too,
before the sun bakes the hills to a color of corn.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of clicking shutters herald dawn. A body will rise.
Click, click. The photographer then settles back onto the sand to
await the next graduation of color. Click, Click. It is a clicking
chorus in the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   In these seemingly wide-open spaces, latecomers are not
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move along,'' says a dune-top photographer to a
camera-wielding tourist who has stumbled into his perfect picture.
Some of the photographers wave wildly at the post-sunrise
intruders; others offer exasperating sighs that, in the still of
the morning, echo across the sand and warn away the tardy like a
coastal foghorn.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ad hoc club: a click clique. Its members the
curmudgeons who made pre-dawn pilgrimages into the desert. Having
staked their claim _ at least temporarily _ these amateur and
not-so-amateur photographers guard their ground with the ferocity
of the miners who, a century earlier, scooped silver and other
metals from this land.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cranky, pre-dawn photographers, Death Valley has never
been known for its hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, midday temperatures average more than 110
degrees. The average yearly rainfall is less than 2 inches. The
area's chief inhabitants are kangaroo rats, rattlesnakes and
ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Death Valley is becoming a year-round vacation
spot. Superintendent Richard Martin said more than 75 percent of
the park's visitors come from abroad and ``many come specifically
to experience the extreme heat in the valley during June, July and
August.''
</P>
<P>
   Different heatstrokes for different folks.
</P>
<P>
   November through March are the most comfortable months for
visitors, with daytime temperatures ranging from 65 to 80 degrees.
Nighttime lows, accompanied by an explosion of stars, hover in the
low 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its reputation as a desert wasteland, Death Valley
actually boasts diverse habitats and experiences for visitors. To
really explore its more than 3.3 million acres, vacationers should
allow three or four vacation days for the park.
</P>
<P>
   At the main ranger station at Furnace Creek, information is
available about evening programs, guided walks, day hikes and
driving tours. A small museum also explains the area's complex
geology. (Death Valley is not really a valley but a graben, created
by movement along fault lines. Some movements create mountains; at
other times grabens are formed.)
</P>
<P>
   Hiking and biking are extremely popular, but the
less-than-athletic can find ample opportunities to explore the
diversity of the largest national park in the lower 48 states
through a series of driving tours. A four-wheel-drive vehicle can
enhance your visit, as many roads are unpaved and require high
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to heed park safety regulations and suggestions. The
terrain and temperatures of Death Valley do not accommodate
foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights of a visit to Death Valley National
Park:
</P>
<P>
   _ Death Valley Scotty may be the most flamboyant character in
this history of Death Valley. His real name was Walter Scott, and
during his life he pursued many careers, including work as a cowboy
in a wild west show and as a gold prospector.
</P>
<P>
   His lasting legacy is Scotty's Castle, although Walter Scott
never put a penny of his own in the place. The $2 million home was
built in the late 1920s by Chicago businessman Albert Johnson, who
invested heavily in Scotty's gold-mining adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers dressed in period costumes share many of the
fascinating stories about the friendship between the colorful Scott
and the devout Johnson. The rangers assume the roles of characters
in Scotty's life as they guide visitors through the mansion. A
short, steep walk leads to the graves of Scotty and his beloved
dog, Windy. The dust-blown gravesite overlooks ``his'' castle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mind your step at the Devil's Golf Course, a salt flat that
has earned its name from a suggestion that ``only the devil could
play golf'' on its sharp white crust. It is 200 spiny miles of
sodium chloride, the remnants of a shallow lake that evaporated
about 2,000 years ago. Nearby is a shallow salt-flat pool known as
Bad Water. At 282 feet below sea level, it is the lowest point in
the Western Hemisphere. Take a walk out into the flats to ponder
the the park's desolate vistas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among remnants of Death Valley's silver mining days are the
Wildrose Canyon charcoal kilns. These large beehive-shaped
structures _ about 25 feet high and 30 feet around _ were used in
the production of charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   The coal was shipped out of Wildrose Canyon about 25 miles to
the west side of Panamint Valley, where the Minnietta and Modock
silver mines were located. The miners needed the coal to use in the
smelting process.
</P>
<P>
   Snow often blankets this part of the park until mid-April,
making the road to the kilns impassable.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Salt Creek, a boardwalk accommodates a half-mile
interpretive trail that zigzags over a shallow stream. Here
visitors can see the endangered pupfish and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The pupfish is the sole survivor of the evaporation of the great
lakes that covered this area more than 20,000 years ago. Nine types
of pupfish can be found in Death Valley. Each type has a special
adaptation that has allowed it to survive in its niche of the park.
</P>
<P>
   As salty as the ocean, the water at Salt Creek gets as hot as
100 degrees in the summer and cools to near freezing during the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Volcanic deposits ``paint'' the rock at Artist's Palette,
which is accessed on a lovely one-way and often steep drive. Iron
salts yield the reds, pinks and yellows in the vista; decomposing
mica generates the green cast; and manganese provides the purple
hues.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, the drive also reveals blankets of wildflowers.
The Panamint daisies are particularly pretty against the black soil
and rock. All the little yellow faces pointed toward the sun
resemble worshipers in a cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   _ Death Valley may be best known for its borax mining industry.
The free Borax Museum is located at the Furnace Creek Ranch
complex. The museum is housed in the oldest wooden building (1883)
in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of boron, sodium, oxygen and water, borax is found in
dry lake beds. It has been used for centuries in the manufacturing
of glass and enamel; it also makes a good cleanser.
</P>
<P>
   Harmony Borax Works was a large operation that included many
stone, adobe and wooden structures, a boiler and many
crystallization tanks. The mining operation ended in 1888, but
remnants can be seen in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable among the artifacts in the park are the huge wagons
that were pulled by teams of 20 mules. These 20-mule teams pulled
wagons loaded with 10 tons of borax and a 1,200-gallon tank of
water. Their route was a harsh 165 miles, covered in 10 days, to
the rail town of Mojave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be put off by cranky photographers. Death Valley's sandy
dunes are too terrific a site to bypass, and the velvety mounds of
gold offer hidden treasures to the keen eye.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the tracks of the park's many full-time residents:
bobcat, raven, coyote, lizard and road runner. Thousands of tiny
trainlike tracks crisscross the dunes. They are the tracks of a
tiny beetle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps the most popular spot in Death Valley National Park is
Zabriskie Point. It also may be the most photographed. Its
mustard-colored hills, wavy rock and glorious sunrises make it a
favorite with those early-rising photographers. By the time the sun
peaks over the horizon, dozens of tripods line the viewing wall.

A LATE STORM MAY ENGULF CHRETIEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ He's the man who blithely led Canada to the brink of
collapse, pooh-poohing the threat posed by Quebec's separatists
right up until the stunning 1995 referendum in which the
French-speaking province came within a hair's breadth of seceding.
</P>
<P>
   He's the man who in recent weeks has responded with a shrug as
the value of the Canadian dollar went south with a vengeance,
plunging to its lowest depths in history.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Chretien, Canada's 64-year-old prime minister, is also the
man who has turned his back on many of the important pledges that
propelled him to the helm of government in 1993, refusing to
abolish the despised federal sales tax and committing the country
to the North American Free Trade Agreement that he so vehemently
assailed while seeking office.
</P>
<P>
   So, are outraged Canadians baying for his political blood?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Or, at least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years, and he's still riding high,'' said Bob Richardson,
senior vice-president of the Angus Reid Group, a Toronto-based
polling firm. ``He's certainly enjoying the longest run of
popularity of any prime minister in this half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   But now a tempest is brewing in Parliament that might engulf the
folksy little guy from Shawinigan, Quebec, as Canada's most durable
politician loves to style himself. Opposition figures from both the
left and right are furiously seeking to transform an obscure
dust-up between Mounties and protesters at an international summit
in British Columbia last year into a full-blown assault on
Chretien's judgment and principles.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs they might succeed. Chretien, like his American
golf buddy besieged in the White House, is suddenly coming under
daily attack on front pages and on Parliament Hill not for his
policies but for his character.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that his apparent instructions to the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to rigorously suppress any protests against
Indonesian dictator Suharto at the 1997 Asian Pacific Economic
Co-operation, or APEC, summit at the University of British Columbia
last November represented a serious violation of Canadian
constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom to
express political views.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders were arrested simply for planning peaceful
protests. And those who attempted to hoist placards deploring
Suharto's oppressive rule were subdued with pepper gas and chased
away. The crackdown has become the focus of a massive federal
inquiry that shows sign of switching focus from the actions of the
Mounties to questions about Chretien's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This being Canada, there will be no sex scandal, no lurid
expose of our top politician's private life, no minute examination
of his moral fitness to hold high office,'' declared the Ottawa
Citizen in a front page analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister's political enemies, the article went on
to say, are determined ``to put the lie to Mr. Chretien's image as
a competent manager and kindly favorite uncle, revealing what they
see as the real Jean Chretien: an incompetent, heartless, arrogant
bully.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order. No other leader has flourished in Canadian
national politics for so long and so prominently as Chretien, a
Liberal Party stalwart first elected to Parliament when John F.
Kennedy was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1963. Since then, Chretien has held nearly every
important cabinet post. He became prime minister for first time in
1993, after the Liberals not only defeated but virtually destroyed
the only other major party in Canada, the Conservatives. His
government won reelection last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stock just keeps getting higher and higher, at least among
ordinary Canadians,'' said Senator Sharon Carstairs of Manitoba, a
longtime political ally. ``He possesses prodigious energies, and a
genuine common touch.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been controversies aplenty during Chretien's five
years in the top office. Until now, however, none has personally
targeted Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the blasts came hard and fast as critics assailed
the prime minister's alleged orders to suppress protests at the
economic summit ``at any cost'' in order to spare Suharto
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the prime minister trample on the political rights of
Canadian citizens in order to protect some Asian dictators?''
demanded Preston Manning, leader of the opposition Reform Party.
``Canadians want answers.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't necessarily so. If APEC-gate, as the controversy has
inevitably come to be called, has anything in common with the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, it is that most Canadians seem indifferent
to the affair, dismissing it as just the usual noxious political
noise emanating out of Ottawa. Public opinion surveys give Chretien
approval ratings of 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority like him, warts and all,'' stated prominent
political columnist Jeffrey Simpson in the Toronto-based Globe &AMP;
Mail. ``This kind of assault hasn't succeeded yet, and likely won't
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, Chretien may be subpoened and forced to testify
before a commission investigating the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Chretien is in many ways the most unlikely of political
leaders. Deaf in the right ear, afflicted by a facial paralysis
from childhood that gives his expression an almost sinister cast,
he speaks out of one corner of his mouth in a syntax that might
most kindly be described as garbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people just seem comfortable with him,'' said Richardson,
the pollster. ``He doesn't seem splashy or on the make. He's a
low-key guy who seems to get the job done. Canadians see Jean
Chretien as a guy they could invite over for a back-yard
barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien was born and grew up in the gritty mill town of
Shawinigan, in Quebec's blue-collar French heartland, the 18th of
19 children born to Wellie Chretien and Marie Boisvert-Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint practicing law in his hometown, Chretien was
elected to Canada's Parliament at age 29. When he took his seat in
the House of Commons he spoke hardly a word of English.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ironies, even tragedies, of Chretien's career is that
he is today admired and even loved throughout English Canada, but
despised in his native Quebec, partly for his bumpkin image but
mainly because the ardent federalist is perceived as a betrayer of
the centuries-old separatist dream of a French-speaking republic
straddling the St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian commentators regularly carp that Chretien seems to have
no vision for Canada, no set of policies that reflect any values or
dreams to distinguish him even from his Conservative Party
predecessor, Brian Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balancing the budget deficit was worthwhile, but dreams and
visions need braver dimensions,'' said historian and author Peter
C. Newman. ``There is no sense of expansiveness ... in his social
and political horizons. Nada.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chretien is the prime minister upon whom history has thrust
the chore of guiding Canada's through what may be remembered as the
country's most perilous passage.
</P>
<P>
   There will likely be another Quebec referendum on independence,
and a victory by the separatists _ thought to have at least a 50-50
shot _ would split the country in two.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even if Quebec stays in the fold, Canada is a country
that is dangerously fracturing along regional fault lines.
Chretien's Liberal Party may hold the majority of seats in the
House of Commons, but that's only because the party so totally
dominates the most populous province, Ontario, which guarantees it
enough seats to control Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Liberals are in rout or barely holding their own
while the Conservative Party _ Canada's equivalent of the
Republicans _ is in tatters, a minority party controlling just 20
seats in the national body.
</P>
<P>
   The western provinces, represented by the American-style
conservatives of the Reform Party, which has virtually no support
outside British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Most Quebec
seats are held by the Bloc Qubecois, the national arm of the Quebec
independence movement, dedicated to tearing Canada apart. The
impoverished maritime provinces, profoundly alienated from the
political mainstream, are represented by a hodgepodge leftwingers
of the New Democratic Part, the few surviving Conservatives and
some Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is a far more decentralized country than the United
States, and these days some of the country's great institutions are
foundering, from the disgraced military to the economically
debiliated national health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well and good to talk about leading the country
forward,'' said Carstairs. ``But Jean Chretien's more pressing
challenge is just holding Canada together under a federal
government.''

WHY WASHINGTON IS STUCK ON FLYTRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone in Washington has a theory about why we are frothing
about a scandal that no one else much cares about.
</P>
<P>
   I have counted at least 20 of them, speculation about everything
from Washington's innate prudery to its unconscious desire for
parliamentary government.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the theories, or at least most of the convincing ones,
fall into one of five categories, presented here in ascending order
of relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Law: In a recent National Journal article, Jonathan Rauch makes
the case that Washington's Flytrap rage partly stems from our legal
culture. The majority of D.C.'s opinion elite, I would bet, holds
law degrees, and legalism is the city's lingua franca. This makes
D.C. especially susceptible to Flytrap, because the scandal looks
worse to lawyers than to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lied under oath: In legalistic D.C., that is more than
enough cause to damn him. The rest of the country, which doesn't
share our legal fixation, has the good sense to recognize that some
kinds of lies (even under oath) are more innocent than others.
</P>
<P>
   Moral One-Upmanship: In its soul, Washington is no more upset
about adultery and fooling around with interns than the rest of the
country is. But we are extremely sensitive to charges of moral
laxity: We're terrified of being depicted as licentious, godless
hedonists who tolerate a Caligula. So we fake outrage, certifying
our moral credentials by acting holier than thou.
</P>
<P>
   Geography: Or, rather, proximity. At a distance, the Clinton of
Flytrap is an everyday sinner. But at a pore's-eye view, with six
years of his lies fresh in your memory, he seems pathologically
manipulative, deceptive, and sex-crazed. The more we learned about
Flytrap--cigars, phone calls, etc.--the worse he seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthurmore, elite Washington, by virtue of proximity to
Clinton, takes Flytrap personally. Outside the Beltway, no one
knows who John Podesta is or cares that Clinton lied to him. But in
Washington, Clinton's lies to aides were a slap, a betrayal of one
of us.
</P>
<P>
   Economics: Flytrap serves Washington's economic self-interest.
As Watergate made the careers of scores of pols and journalists, so
investigative reporters (Michael Isikoff), editorial writers
(Howell Raines), pundits (you name 'em), and politicians (any
Republican on the House Judiciary Committee) have hitched their
wagons to Flytrap. Hence, we have every incentive to keep the tar
boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sociology: The least appreciated reason for D.C.'s Clinton mania
is the city's peculiar social organization. Nicholas Lemann, who's
writing a book on elites, argues that Washington in the '90s is
America in the '50s. The rest of the nation has become
entrepreneurial and individualistic, but Washington, says Lemann,
is still home to the organization man. In D.C., we work for big
institutions, believe in them, and expect wisdom from the smart,
honorable people who rise to the top of them. By Washington's
standard, then, Clinton's greatest crime is not that he lied or
leched. It is that he shamed our institution. If government and the
presidency are embarrassed, then we are diminished. Our self-worth
depends on the worth of our institution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, fortunately, couldn't care less. They are too
busy getting and spending for themselves to worry much about the
respectability of Clinton and the strength of his organization.
It's not their institution that's being disgraced. It's not their
loyalty that's being tested. It's not their problem.

GREENSPAN'S UNSURPRISING MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point in the last couple of weeks, it became a foregone
conclusion that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee would
announce an interest-rate cut Tuesday afternoon. In fact, it became
such a foregone conclusion that investors began speculating
about--and in some cases anticipating--that the rate cut would not
be a mere quarter-point cut, but rather a half-point cut. Hopes of
that probably contributed to a run-up in stock prices Tuesday, and
to a more generally bullish tone on the Street in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were, of course, dashed at 2:15 p.m., when the FOMC
announced that, as expected, it would be trimming the Fed Funds
rate by a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the half-point cut were essentially idle ones, since
Greenspan's reputation for caution is well-deserved and since the
Fed remains populated by inflation hawks, even in these
deflationary times.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, there was an unhealthy undertone to much of
the pleading for a larger rate cut. This undertone suggested that
the Fed would be well-served to give U.S. stock prices a boost in
these turbulent times, and that a half-point cut would send the
signal that the bull could resume its run.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Greenspan has no interest in propping up still
historically-high stock valuations, and the dreams of a rate-cut
rally smacked of the lamest sort of pie-in-the-sky thinking.
</P>
<P>
   From one angle, in fact, if the Fed had instituted a half-point
cut (or if it had cut the discount rate instead of the Fed Funds
rate), investors would have a better reason to sell than with the
quarter-point cut. A half-point cut, after all, would have been a
sign that the Fed thought real trouble was just around the corner,
and that only a flood of credit into the economy could save it from
recession.
</P>
<P>
   What the quarter-point cut sends instead is the message that
we've grown accustomed to Greenspan sending: Things are dicier than
they've been, but the United States is still in good shape. It's a
message you can disagree with, but it's not a message anyone should
have been surprised to hear.

HOWARD STERN IS OBSOLETE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY GOLDBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year, I've learned three new things about Howard
Stern: He's possibly the tallest Jew in the world; he carries a
gun; and, as a cultural phenomenon, he is very much over.
</P>
<P>
   For this last, most pertinent, fact, he has the Office of the
Independent Counsel to thank.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's new TV program, ``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' which
appears Saturday nights on an ever-shrinking number of CBS-owned
and affiliated stations, is a nonstarter. (Two stations--one in
Arizona and one in Texas--have dropped the Stern show since it
premiered Aug. 26, citing offensiveness. Its ratings hover just
above zero.)
</P>
<P>
   The show's problems go deeper than bad writing or crappy
production values. Imagine watching Lenny Bruce perform in 1990.
That's what it's like listening to Stern today. He was the Vasco da
Gama of porn radio, a man who sailed fearlessly into the uncharted
sea of lesbian mud wrestling and jigaboo jokes. He was--and this
seems so quaint--enemy No. 1 of the Federal Communications
Commission and of middle America.
</P>
<P>
   But time has passed him by. What Starr can say, Stern can't. Now
that the insertion of cigars into female genitalia is a
prosecutable offense, sex is no longer funny. And if sex is no
longer funny, Stern is no longer funny.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's technique is to bully second-tier celebrities into
revealing embarrassing facts about their sex lives; Starr's
technique is to bully Starr-created celebrities into revealing
embarrassing facts about their sex lives in exchange for
transactional immunity. It is the promise of immunity, I think,
that makes Starr's interviews so much more raunchy.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the Clinton deposition videotape aired, I
watched on tape this exchange between Stern and a woman named
Kendra, described by Stern as ``the chick in the tabloids who slept
with Jerry Springer'':
</P>
<P>
   Stern: You grabbed his crotch?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: Over his pants?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: You didn't put your hand down his pants?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: Oh, that's so sexy. You are a bad girl. ... Did he put
his hand under your dress?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yeah, I think so.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an exchange between President Clinton and a member of
Starr's staff, Solomon Wisenberg (far too weighty a name for a man
engaged in such bawdy proceedings):
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: The question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that while
you were in the Oval Office area you touched her breasts, would she
be lying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: That is not my recollection ...
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: If she said that you kissed her breasts, would she be
lying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: I'm going to revert to my former statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: OK. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in
the Oval Office area you touched her genitalia, would she be lying?
And that calls for a yes, no, or reverting to your former
statement.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw of Stern's show is not that it's offensive but that
it's boring. The problem is apparent early on: It's impossible to
listen to Stern in a stationary position. Like many bands--have you
ever tried to listen to Aerosmith in your living room?--Stern can
really only be enjoyed while driving or doing something else, like
washing your car.
</P>
<P>
   But about the gun, which brings us to the outmoded idea that
Stern is a dangerous force in society:
</P>
<P>
   Early this spring, while I was transacting a piece of
journalistic business at New York Police Department headquarters,
the police commissioner, Howard Safir, asked me if I wanted to meet
Stern. I was raised on Long Island, and the only island celebrity I
had previously met was Dee Snider from the band Twisted Sister, so
how could I say no to Stern?
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a buzz of anticipation running through police
headquarters--New York City cops, particularly those residing on
Long and Staten islands, make up the hardest core of Stern's fans.
But police brass, like most conservative, middle-aged men, tend to
</P>
<P>
   view Stern as a subversive force worthy of surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I say to this guy?'' the commissioner asked me, as if
I should know. It turned out that Safir was only vaguely aware of
Stern's mission, which was to thank the NYPD for renewing his gun
license.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was escorted into the commissioner's office, and the two
men shook hands. Stern looked, not to put too fine a point on it,
dirty, and I noticed that Safir steered him clear of the shiny oak
desk once used by Teddy Roosevelt. I also noticed that Stern is
incredibly tall, taller even than Safir, who was, at that point,
the tallest Jew I thought I had ever met. Height, a first name and
a tribe are all they had in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you get your license?'' Safir asked Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good. No one can blame me,'' Safir said, and you know he meant
it.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was rattled: ``I get all nervous around here. Lot of
cops,'' he told the commissioner. Stern explained that fear of
unstable fans had led him to seek a gun permit. They talked for
another minute, and then Stern escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the elevator, the commissioner said, ``I half expected
that guy to show up in handcuffs,'' and he was serious. I could
tell that Safir, like many other adults, misinterprets Stern's role
in society. Stern is not a subversive but a clown, and a tired
clown at that. To him, sex is a joke. The real subversives are
those who use sex to destroy people's lives. Howard Stern can't
compete with that.

SWAMI PREACHES MESSAGE OF LOVE, COMPASSION, SEXUAL CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the 1960s when he was a student leader at Princeton
University, Hindu Swami Krishnapada, then known as John E. Favors,
would survey the crowds as he spoke at civil rights rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be looking at the audience and thinking about who I was
going to have sex with that night,'' Krishnapada said, during an
interview in Boston, where he was offering spiritual teachings.
</P>
<P>
   He was student body president and a leader in the Rev. Martin
Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. His renown,
he says, made sexual conquests fairly easy. ``I was very
promiscuous,'' Krishnapada, 48, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   One day, however, it occurred to him that his sexual escapades
were ``hypocritical.'' He said he realized that ``as a leader I was
supposed to serve people and not have people serve me or take
advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was about 25 years ago. He has not had sex since. His
embrace of celibacy was part of a spiritual transformation for
Krishnapada that has made him into a popular spiritual teacher who
is constantly on the road preaching a message of love, compassion
and sexual control.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest problems in the world today is the
impotence of our leaders at all levels of society,'' Krishnapada
writes in his recently published new book, ``Spiritual Warrior II:
Transforming Lust into Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the book grew out of the charges of sexual
misconduct against President Clinton levelled by Paula Jones, and
became rather more timely once Clinton's sexual indiscretions
snowballed into the crisis threatening his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders, Krishnapada writes, ``have been unable, or unwilling,
to conquer their lust. In particular, they have not learned how to
use sexual energies in a constructive way and so cannot master the
self-serving attachments that stand in the way of a more selfless,
spiritual expression of love.''
</P>
<P>
   He disputes suggestions by some political pundits that Clinton's
private matters have little to do with his public behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private life of a leader is more important because it's a
more accurate reflection of who he is and what his values are,''
argues Krishnapada who has discussed spiritual matters with several
world leaders, including South African President Nelson Mandela.
``His public life is more of a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishnapada grew up in a devout evangelical Baptist family in
Cleveland. Although he was a psychology major in college, he said
he became frustrated with the discipline because it could not
provide him a clear understanding of human experience.
</P>
<P>
   So Krishnapada spent a year meditating, reflecting and exploring
different religious sources. Eventually, he found spiritual comfort
in the 5,000-year-old Bhagavad Gita. He also became a follower of
Swami Prahbupada, founder in 1966 of the Hare Krishna movement.
</P>
<P>
   Krishnapada quickly found success in his new spiritual niche and
rose to the the level of swami _ a term referring to someone who
mediates between the worldly and the divine. As a swami,
Krishnapada was required to become celibate.
</P>
<P>
   ``True celibacy is one of the greatest expressions of freedom,''
he says. ``When one is no longer controlled by one's senses or
genitals it's amazing because you can begin focusing not on your
needs but on the needs of others. It's given me a better ability to
serve others.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishnapada also is the only African-American guru in Vaishnava,
a branch of Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   He makes clear that he isn't opposed to sex. He just believes
that society today equates sex with love. And lust is dangerous, he
says, because it goes beyond just a craving for sexual
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   A key teaching in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishnapada notes, is that
lust, whether it be a desire for sex, money or power, is the cause
of all the world's problems. It can lead to war, human oppression
and the downfall of leaders and nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lust, the relentless pursuit of personal gratification at all
costs, which is promoted by the mass media, is destroying
humanity,'' Krishnapada said.

   Jeff Bitzer wrote to comment on our recent column on a book
written by Luna Tarlo, ``The Mother of God,'' which is critical of
her son, Andrew Cohen, a spiritual teacher who lives in Lenox.
Bitzer writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had the good fortune of knowing Mr. Cohen for many
years and wanted to add my voice of praise for him to that of New
York City psychologist Elizabeth Debold whom you quoted in your
article. Contrary to Luna Tarlo's portrayal, Andrew Cohen is a man
of unparalleled integrity, possessed with a passionate and wholly
unselfconscious care for the welfare of others. He is also well
known and respected within the spiritual world for his vocal and
public stand against corruption and abuse of power among spiritual
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, with respect to Luna Tarlo's depiction of him in her
recent book, I can only say that nothing could be farther from
reality. Your readers should definitely proceed with caution.''

BANKBOSTON STICKS TO LATIN EXPANSION STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAO PAULO _ Amid the imposing skyscrapers that line Avenida
Paulista sits a small, elegant building that looks like a small
version of the White House flanked by palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-catching structure stands out on the crowded avenue, one
of Sao Paulo's most coveted addresses. But it is also noticeable
because of the large green sign above it that bears the open-winged
eagle logo of BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Opened two weeks ago, the building is the newest BankBoston
branch here and a visible symbol of the bank's presence in Latin
America's largest country, a stake that is growing despite a world
economic crisis that threatens to spread to the region and has
already frightened investors here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bank does well in crisis because our income sources are
diversified and because people here see us as a prestigious and
safe American bank,'' said Geraldo Carbone, president of
BankBoston's Brazil operation.
</P>
<P>
   The branch on Avenida Paulista _ across the street from the
Central Bank of Brazil and a block from the Sao Paulo Museum of Art
_ is one of 52 BankBoston branches in Brazil. The bank has been
opening new locations throughout the country at the rate of one a
week, mostly in upscale commercial and residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Such rapid growth is in keeping with the aggressive $100 million
strategy aimed at strengthening the bank's operations in Brazil and
other Latin American countries. The plan, announced a year ago by
BankBoston president Henrique Meirelles, who had run its Brazilian
operation, has focused on building retail business and new
fee-based services like financial management in underserved markets
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But while BankBoston earns about 20 percent of its profits from
its extensive Latin American business and forecasts increases for
1998, its stock has taken a pounding. Fearful investors are fleeing
emerging markets in the face of the economic contagion that has
spread from Asia to Russia and now threatens Brazil and other
countries in the region. BankBoston shares have dropped 37 percent
since July, shrinking the market value of the stock by nearly $6
billion. The stock closed Tuesday at 35 5/8, up 5/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Brazilian stock market has lost more than 30
percent of its value since the beginning of the year, and more than
$20 billion in foreign capital has left the country in search of
safer harbors.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston officials say that despite concerns of financial
instability in Latin America, they are following a more
conservative expansion strategy compared to other, larger banks.
</P>
<P>
   Like other foreign institutions, such as Citibank and Spain's
Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, all of which have been
expanding their lending and retail business here, BankBoston's
strategy in Brazil has been to target an upper middle class that is
small but growing.
</P>
<P>
   In order to open an account, customers must have a minimum
salary roughly equivalent to $4,000 a month, more than twice the
country's median wage. Credit card and loan applicants must have
extremely strong credit histories and assets that demonstrate an
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target customers give us four times more revenue than the
typical bank customer in the mass market,'' said Marcio A.T.
Linares, vice president of retail banking.
</P>
<P>
   In return, BankBoston's 360,000 customers here get a level of
service unusual for banks in this region: sparkingly clean branches
with marble staircases, dozens of personal bankers and financial
advisers, and tellers reserved for BankBoston depositors. (In many
Latin American banks, tellers also serve noncustomers who use banks
to pay utility bills.)
</P>
<P>
   The bank also has imported concepts such as automatic teller
machines and telephone and computer banking. It recently began
offering car financing programs through selected dealers and a
shared credit card with General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston is also developing a mutual fund business that
invests mostly in Latin American firms using local currencies, a
service that has given the bank a strong indigenous brand name. The
bank manages about $5 billion in assets in Brazil and another $1.3
billion in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key in emerging markets is to be disciplined and to
realize you can't be everything to everyone,'' said Ricardo Augusto
Gallo, BankBoston's executive vice president for investment banking
in Brazil. ``We're not a typical type of global bank that's spread
out in hundreds of countries because we're concentrated here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank opened its first Latin American office in Buenos Aires
in 1917 to help New England wool merchants and has maintained a
strong operation in Brazil for more than 50 years. Today, it has
over 150 locations in Central and South America and in the
Caribbean that generate nearly $1 billion in revenue. But even
analysts who generally support the bank's expansion in Latin
America caution that there are risks.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's middle class has blossomed since the region's
last financial crisis in 1994, thanks to relatively stable
currencies and lower inflation. But the deepening world economic
crisis threatens to cast the region into turmoil again.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by the Institute of International Finance, a
Washington, D.C.-based banking industry group, predicts that Latin
American deficits will surge this year to $70 billion from $57
billion last year mostly because of the economic downturn. The
Inter-American Development Bank also estimates Latin America's
regional gross domestic product will fall to 3.5 percent this year
from 5.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, some observers expressed concern about
BankBoston's future earnings in the region. ``We need reassurances
that the earnings will be there while they're on the express track
to rapid deployment,'' said Thomas McCandless, senior banking
analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer &AMP; Co, Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But McCandless and others say the bank appears well-positioned
to withstand the current economic turmoil just as it has endured
past crises in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in Latin American for a long time,'' McCandless
said. ``I think they know what to expect in situations like this.
They've been able to weather the storms in the past. There's no
reason to expect it will be different this time.''

POLLUTION FLOWS AT US-MEXICO BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AGUSTIN, Mexico _ Some &UR;  &LR; nights the stench of sewage and
chemicals from the canal running through this dusty border town is
so nauseating that Manuel Robles and his family cannot sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all kinds of dead fish in there,'' Robles, 57, a
teacher-turned-environmental activist, said of the leather-colored
water that flows swiftly from the factories and neighborhoods of
Ciudad Juarez, about 15 miles away. ``Government people come here
and talk about cleaning it up. But it's still here, where everybody
can smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of environmental problem that government
officials in Washington and Mexico City promised to address five
years ago when they were promoting the idea of a North American
Free Trade Agreement among Mexico, Canada, and the United States.
To prove their commitment to clean up the border, negotiators
signed a separate environmental agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But along this stretch of the Rio Grande and through most of the
2,000-mile US-Mexico border, it is hard to find much improvement.
Instead, several residents, activists, and government specialists
acknowledge that in many ways the border is worse off today than it
was before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I'd say the promises made for cleaning up the area
have not been fulfilled, and one area that has really suffered has
been the area around Juarez,'' said Richard Boren, 41, coordinator
of the Southwest Toxic Watch, an environmental group based in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt NAFTA has brought more economic activity to
Mexico, even from faraway places like Massachusetts. Last year Bay
State exports to this country rose to more than $440 million, up 33
percent since 1993, the year before NAFTA went into effect,
according to a report prepared by the Washington-based Trade
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious sign of the new business wave is among the new
factories owned by or performing work for US corporations. Known by
their Spanish name, ``maquiladoras,'' these factories benefit from
cheaper labor costs and provide jobs for thousands of Mexican
citizens. Although these ``twin plants'' existed long before NAFTA,
their popularity with multinational corporations has spawned
hundreds of facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But their explosive growth, along with the arrival of thousands
of new immigrants to the border region looking for jobs, has hurt
an environment that was, by most assessments, damaged before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA proponents argued that the agreement would encourage more
companies to build these assembly plants in Mexico's interior. But
largely because of its proximity to the United States, where the
finished products are sent, the border has absorbed most of the new
maquiladora construction.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-mile border area holds about two-thirds of Mexico's
4,010 maquiladoras, according to figures from the country's
commerce and industrial agency. The remaining third are in interior
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ciudad Juarez, for example, is Mexico's fourth-largest city with
a population of about 2 million people and sits adjacent El Paso,
Texas. The city is home to about a quarter of Mexico's
NAFTA-related factories, but it still does not have a water and
sewage treatment system.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's raw sewage and runoff from the factories flow
into six open canals. It is believed another 50 million gallons of
untreated waste is dumped every &UR;  &LR; day into the Rio Grande.
Government officials say plans for a new treatment plant
were &UR;  &LR; approved four years ago, but were postponed because of the
economic crisis that hit the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A design for a $30 million plant has just been approved. But one
local government administrator, mindful that the Mexican peso again
has shown signs of volatility, wonders whether history might repeat
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy if we have to cut the budget again and
stop this project,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We're at the mercy of our peso, but I don't know how
much longer people can wait for clean water.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also said the two agencies created by NAFTA to develop
more binational cleanup projects have done little to help. The
Border Environment Cooperation Commission, which is headquartered
in Juarez, Mexico, has been slow to approve initiatives. Meanwhile,
the Texas-based North American Development Bank, which is run by
Treasury officials of both nations, has been hamstrung by internal
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at both agencies insist that more cleanup projects
are on the way. Eleven environmental initiatives totaling $3
billion _ most of them for waste and water treatment _ have secured
financing or are already under construction, according to NADBank
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand people's desires to see things done quickly, but
we'd rather see projects that are planned and built carefully,''
said Linda Taylor, a New Mexico environmentalist and member of the
BECC board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say the border environment has worsened,
especially with the maquiladoras, but I think there'll be
improvement in the future,'' she added, referring to 23 projects
the commission has certified.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA supporters also said tougher environmental laws that took
effect with the agreement have helped improve some border
communities. In Matamoros, a Mexican town across the bridge from
Brownsville, Texas, an area once dubbed ``Chemical Row'' has
improved gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing outrage from activists and community leaders, the
area's worst polluters were driven out and many remaining companies
have installed their own treatment systems. Even some of the newer
factories in Juarez have new recycling programs and are teaching
employees better ways to dispose of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the problems along this corner of the border appear to
outnumber the solutions. There is the electrical substation outside
El Porvenir, Mexico, where drums of toxic fluids and old
transformers sit unwatched near a residential neighborhood. There
is the landfill in Sunland Park, N.M., only a few miles from the
border, where residents say dumping goes unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the danger, many residents say, that this part of
the border is drawing more waste rather than eliminating it.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca, Texas, a sleepy town of 700 residents that lies
in a desert valley 80 miles east of El Paso, is home to the
nation's largest sludge dump. About 250 tons of waste arrive almost
daily by train, much of it from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the area's dry terrain, Texas has also proposed a
low-level radioactive waste site 5 miles away, 15 miles from the
Mexican border. The waste would come from Texas, Vermont, and
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the planned waste site say the dump will not harm
the environment. But opponents say the site lies near an earthquake
fault line and that its presence would reinforce the idea that
poorer and mostly Hispanic border residents can be exposed to such
a risk.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has drawn together an unusual alliance of Mexican
and US residents in opposition to the project, which has been
approved by Congress and is awaiting final word from President
Clinton and the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission will make
its final decision on the waste dump on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Mexican government officials had offered only
minor resistance to the proposal. But earlier this month, Mexico's
environmental secretary, Julia Carabias, asked US officials to
reconsider the site's location.
</P>
<P>
   That is little comfort to Robles, the environmental activist,
who still runs San Agustin's only library and museum, even though
his government pay was cut off in February. He believes the act was
in retaliation by local government officials angry with his work
with the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole area is like one human body,'' Robles said while
moving along the foul-smelling canal. ``The parts of this body are
getting sicker. And unless something happens soon, the whole
beautiful body will suffer terribly.''

A BRITISH VOTE FOR CLINTON'S SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are 70,000 Albanian villagers, from newborns to frail
elders in their 90s, huddled in the soon-to-be-snow-covered hills
of Kosovo, fearing slaughter by the Serb ethnic-cleansers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warns it may shortly bomb the marauding army of Slobodan
Milosevic, Europe's latest Ghengis Khan. There is a new man taking
over the show in Germany, Europe's most important economy. Japan?
Still in the ditch. The rest of Asia? An economic basket case.
Iraq? Stiffing UN weapons inspectors. The other terror regimes? On
the move again.
</P>
<P>
   Russia? That wobbly giant is decomposing again, with nukes and
nuke-makers up for grabs. When it comes to all this and Northern
Ireland, the Middle East, or rescuing the International Monetary
Fund's vital role in propping up the planet's shakiest national
economies, the one man with most potential to determine the outcome
is otherwise occupied with Monica-business.
</P>
<P>
   With the practiced understatement for which Great Britain's
diplomats are noted, the British ambassador to the United States
Monday chose his words carefully for a Kennedy School lunch at
Harvard: ``Your friends and allies abroad would wish this thing
would pass rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes two of us, Mr. Ambassador. In an interview earlier,
Sir Christopher Meyer expanded on the theme: ``I think it is
perfectly possible for President Clinton and his people to give
leadership and be active in foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a relief. Because with Boris Yeltsin in his usual
position, on the ropes; with Japan's government paralyzed as usual,
with Asian prospects melting down, and with Helmut Kohl's election
defeat in Germany, the world's supply of leadership is at a low
ebb.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who had been defeated Tory Prime Minister John Major's
press spokesman before being drafted for ambassadorial duty in Bonn
and then Washington, says his government's thorniest problem with
the United States in bilateral terms is the airline beef about
landing rights at Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain sees Europe's biggest problem right now as the
70,000 endangered refugees of Kosovo. He recalled the Russian term
for the bitter weather that has dictated events to generals and
diplomats in Central Europe for centuries: ``General Winter.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jim Morrison and the Doors would say, ``Winter's coming on.''
The world can't stay on hold while the Republicans in Congress try
to fricassee the Clinton presidency. Her Majesty's Government,
Meyer said drily, would ``not want appalling scenes of refugee
misery in the snowy hills of Kosovo and Albania.'' With a UN
Security Council vote last week upbraiding the Serbs for
intercepting refugee aid. ``NATO is now organized to act militarily
on very short notice indeed,'' warned Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair is on the phone so frequently
with Clinton, shrugged Meyer, that the Downing Street demand for
diplomatic follow-up is ``insatiable.'' As the man called upon to
explain to Blair's regime what is going on in Washington, Meyer
appropriated the Yogi Berra aphorism that ``it's never over till
it's over.'' In D.C., said Meyer drolly, ``It appears to be never
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheerfully embracing the traditional definition of an ambassador
as ``an honest man sent to lie abroad for his country,'' he
recalled for host Joe Nye, the Kennedy School dean, how he had been
a fellow 10 years earlier at Harvard's Center for International
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   An ambassador is supposed to be ``a pundit, a saloon-keeper, and
a lobbyist,'' said Meyer, and he expanded on the ambassadorial role
in the Internet age. The lines between foreign and domestic policy
are blurred in all the industrial nations. Economics and diplomacy
are now similarly parts of the same whole, with traditional
distinctions blurred.
</P>
<P>
   And much of what used to be the traditional bilateral diplomacy
_ one country dealing directly with another _ has given way to
multilateral negotiations where whole armfuls of nations have to be
consulted on thorny technical matters involving trade, the
environment or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was upbeat about Northern Ireland's peace prospects. ``I
don't quite see what the deal will be _ but I think there will be
one. There would be a huge reaction from both sides if the
politicians screw this up.''
</P>
<P>
   The decommissioning of arms caches hidden by the paramilitaries
will be a thorny task for the Irish and British governments, said
Meyer. There was a difference between how Major and Blair
approached the problem. For Major, demanding the IRA give up its
weapons was ``an iron condition,'' but for Blair, who defeated
Major in a landslide election (179-seat majority in Parliament)
that left doubt of Labor's mandate, coming to terms with an IRA
that had surrendered all its weapons was ``not an iron condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he is still ``astonished'' at the progress that was
made in Ireland with the good offices of America's George Mitchell
as umpire of the talks. And he suggested that Bill Clinton remains
a pivotal figure in world economic and diplomatic affairs, despite
the political Monica Meltdown in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke Monday, Clinton was brokering another
Israeli-Palestinian summit in the White House office his enemies
want him to vacate early. Your president, Meyer reminded Americans
wryly, is still the figure who can make other nations do what they
would otherwise not do on their own.

NEW YORK SENATE FIGHT BECOMES A BATTLE FOR UPSTATE VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEEKSKILL, N.Y. _ Alfonse D'Amato has figured out how to win
re-election to a fourth term as US senator from New York State _
attack New York City.
</P>
<P>
   For a Brooklyn native, it seems a strange stratagem. But it just
might work.
</P>
<P>
   When most Americans think about New York politics, they picture
liberal Democrats, blacks, Jews, and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is quite otherwise. The decisive
constituency here tends to be conservative, Republican, white,
Catholic, and is based in large part outside the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   This electoral gulf between New York City and the rest of the
state is as vast and virulent as any geographic, political, or
cultural divide in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to understanding everything in New York,'' pollster
John Zogby emphasized, ``is understanding that, historically,
culturally, we are two warring nations: upstate on one side, New
York City on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's idea for beating his challenger, US Representative
Charles Schumer, a Jewish Democrat from Brooklyn, is to intensify
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's response has been to join the fray. The resulting
contest, which recent polls peg as too close to call, could be the
bloodiest here in years.
</P>
<P>
   Its direction became clear in a TV commercial D'Amato aired last
week, but only ``upstate,'' outside New York City and its
surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, blaring the music from ``Jaws,'' shows a school of
sharks swimming past the Manhattan skyline, headed upstate. ``The
New York Democrats just picked New York City liberals for every
statewide office,'' the announcer broods. ``You know what that
means, increased taxes for us, increased spending for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In another ad, Schumer is described as a ``Brooklyn liberal
Democrat,'' who has no interest in anything west of the Hudson
River.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem an odd move for D'Amato, who retains his Brooklyn
accent though he lives in suburban Island Park. But the message
resonates among its target audience, whose ideology D'Amato mainly
shares.
</P>
<P>
   It is a brand of voter you do not have to venture far outside
the city to find. Peekskill, a town of 20,000 people, is just 50
miles north of New York City, hardly fitting most definitions of
``upstate.'' But when it comes to how people think about issues,
life, and, more to the point, about New York City, Peekskill might
as well be on the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Wood, a waitress at the Royal J Cafe, has lived in
Peekskill for 21 years, but boasts she has never set foot in New
York City. ``It seems to me we've been carrying that city,'' she
moaned. ``They wanted to split off a while ago. We should have let
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Steffens, a taxi driver, said much the same: ``We look at
New York City as users, leeches, the squeaky tire. New York City
always seems to get what it wants, while we're treated as
second-class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate has long seen New York City as a drain,'' noted Hank
Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant in Manhattan. ``People
there believe the only reason they're paying such high taxes is for
New York City welfare clients.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, a new study by the Rochester-based Center for
Governmental Research concludes New York City pays more in state
taxes than it gets back in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the perception is powerful. New York City has nearly
three times as many welfare recipients as the rest of the state.
Meanwhile, upstate towns are in far worse economic condition. The
Wall Street boom that lifted the city out of recession did little
to revive upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Some see an ethnic element sharpening this resentment. ``When
D'Amato calls Schumer a `Brooklyn Democrat,''' Sheinkopf commented,
``he knows the common view is that two kinds of people live in
Brooklyn _ black people and Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party has responded to the shark ad by
purchasing air time to show it on New York City stations, with a
label reading, ``The ad Al D'Amato doesn't want you to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schumer will have to take the brunt of his battle into
the heartland, because upstate is where the votes are.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, noted, ``There used to be a rule of thumb. If a Democrat
carried New York City by 500,000 votes, he was home free.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1994 governor's race, Democratic incumbent Mario
Cuomo won New York City by 600,000 votes, but lost the election to
Republican George W. Pataki, whose previous job was mayor of tiny
Peekskill.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed in the last decade is that fewer people in New
York City are voting. Frank Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy
Institute, near Albany, said, ``Turnout has declined so much, it's
boosted the importance of the rest of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 election, New York City, with 40 percent of the
population, provided just 28 percent of the voters. Upstate
supplied 42 percent of the voters, and the increasingly Republican
suburbs 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That election marked another watershed. It turned the
upstate-downstate divide into a political powderkeg. Not only did
Cuomo win big in New York City, he lost big every place else,
carrying just one of the state's 57 other counties, Albany, and
there just barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pataki's election,'' Mauro said, ``shows it's possible to win
without doing well in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's shark ad suggests he has learned that lesson.
</P>
<P>
   A poll, released last week by Quinnipiac College, shows, in the
state overall, Schumer with 44 percent and D'Amato with 42 percent
_ basically, because the margin of error is 4 percent, a tie.
</P>
<P>
   However, in New York City, Schumer trounces D'Amato, 60 to 31.
Upstate, D'Amato wins but not so decisively, 46 to 36. In the
suburbs, where D'Amato lives, he leads by a bit more, 50 to 37.
</P>
<P>
   An important detail in this poll is that, in New York City, only
6 percent of respondents have not made up their minds. However,
upstate, 16 percent are still undecided. And the political wisdom
says the best way to win them is to foster their deep resentment of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why D'Amato has started these ads saying Schumer
wouldn't know anything above Yonkers if it bit him,'' Carroll said.
``The problem is that Schumer really is not your standard knee-jerk
New York City liberal, which is why D'Amato is trying to paint him
as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is fighting back on this front, too, releasing ads, all
over the state, calling D'Amato a ``liar'' on both of their
records, a charge that has raised eyebrows for its bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   This is a race that has won the tag as ``The contest of the two
`L' words: liberal and liar.'' Whoever wins will likely represent a
state in which the fissures that long have divided New York State
are deeper and more jagged than ever.

CLINTON ADVISER HAS PREACHED THROUGH THE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ At age 4, when many boys were playing with
trucks and pop guns, Gordon MacDonald was playing in the pulpit of
his father's Baptist church _ pretending to be a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is fitting that the same boy grew up to be pastor of
one of New England's most successful churches, Grace Chapel, where
as many as 4,000 people pass through the doors on Sundays and cause
near gridlock on the surrounding streets following
standing-room-only weekend services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like I was bred to be a pastor,'' said
MacDonald, 59, sitting in the spacious corner office inside the
building that houses the church's staff of 36.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald and Grace Chapel have been thrust _ somewhat
reluctantly _ into the national spotlight now that MacDonald has
agreed to be one of President Clinton's three spiritual advisers.
Seeking solace and restoration within his Southern Baptist roots,
Clinton sought out MacDonald in part because the two men share a
similar painful experience _ a fall from grace caused by an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to screw up, and I also know what it's
like at the deepest, darkest moment in your life to sense God
saying, `You want to come back and try again?''' said MacDonald,
shortly before dashing off Friday to catch a flight to Lancaster,
Pa., for a speaking engagement. He has declined to discuss his
conversations with Clinton, but says he will be meeting with the
president or talking to him by phone at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   As MacDonald begins his effort to counsel the president, he is
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may seem calm to you, but I'm honestly pretty scared,'' he
said, because of the public scrutiny he, his family, and his church
could become subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island, N.Y., native had for years enjoyed renown
beyond Grace's walls, emerging as a national leader among
evangelical Christians and as a highly sought-after motivational
speaker who regularly hits the road to preach.
</P>
<P>
   These days he is much in demand among a decidedly different
crowd, the news media. MacDonald guesses he has turned down more
than 100 interview requests from journalists who want to know what
it is like to be spiritual counselor to the president.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald used his own experience of wrongdoing, repentance, and
sin as the basis for a 1988 book, ``Rebuilding Your Broken World,''
which has become a primer in the Christian world on how to overcome
personal failure. It was through the book that Clinton came to know
and befriend MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   At Grace Chapel, MacDonald has helped build an
interdenominational Christian church nationally known for a high
level of lay involvement, a strong emphasis on following Jesus and
the Bible, &UR;  &LR; and a deep commitment to social justice, borne out by
the more than $1 million the congregation grants every year to
dozens of ministries, ranging from soup kitchens to homeless
sheters.
</P>
<P>
   But MacDonald resists any portrayals of him as a gifted
Christian leader or pastor. He credits the church's success to the
people who keep Grace humming seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here was like getting on top of a horse that just
wanted to run,'' he said. ``This is a lay person's church. It has
my fingerprints on it, but it's the laity that provide the energy.
It takes 1,100 volunteers a month to keep this place going. I would
be a fool if I took credit for what this church has become.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's modesty aside, many people at Grace say the pastor
has had a major impact on the church's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Holly O'Toole, 39, of Bedford, says MacDonald's powerful sermons
linking Scripture to contemporary issues helped make her become an
evangelical Christian two years ago when she first attended a
Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
   ``God used Pastor MacDonald in a very powerful way in my life,''
said O'Toole, who gave up a six-figure salary at John Hancock
Insurance Co. to work at Grace Chapel as director of ministry
mobilization. ``I was very lost, very confused, and feeling very
dissatisfied with my life. And God used Pastor MacDonald through
his preaching to draw me into the light of God.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a difficult road back to the pulpit for MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, his world fell apart after he publicly admitted that he
had committed adultery, an offense that has brought public disgrace
to many evangelical leaders in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, MacDonald left as senior minister at Grace
Chapel to take on more high-profile roles in evangelical
Christianity as president of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and
chairman of World Vision, an international relief agency.
</P>
<P>
   But revelations about MacDonald's infidelity left him without a
job, humiliated, and with little hope of reclaiming his status as a
Christian leader.
</P>
<P>
   It was the congregants at Grace Chapel, who had hired MacDonald
as a 32-year-old visionary in the early 1970s, who reached out to
bring MacDonald back into the Christian fold, first by providing
rigorous counseling, and then by asking him to become, once again,
the church's senior pastor five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald rebuilt his career through the support of three
spiritual advisers who were chosen by the elders at Grace Chapel.
Among evangelical Christians, such counseling, widely known as
``accountability circles,'' is commonly used to pray for and
support people in trouble, usually men.
</P>
<P>
   Now MacDonald is part of Clinton's accountability circle, &UR;  &LR; along
with the Rev. Tony Campolo, a professor at Eastern College in
Pennsylvania, and the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor of the United
Methodist Church where the first family often worships.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's ordeal and the way he was willing to face his
crucible and emerge a stronger and more faithful Christian has
earned him widespread respect not only among congregants at Grace,
but among many Christians nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the brightest, clearest-thinking people I've ever
worked with,'' said Paul Borthwick of Lexington, an adjunct
professor of Christian mission at Gordon College in Wenham who
worked at Grace Chapel for 18 years. ``He's able to connect with
the person in the pew. When he speaks to a large group, say 1,000
people, 1,000 people might think he's their best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rebuilding Your Broken World,'' MacDonald acknowledges that
``for the rest of my life I will have to live with the knowledge
that I brought deep sorrow to my wife, to my children, and to
friends and others. ...'' His marriage survived the affair, and he
characterizes his relationship today with his two children as
``stronger and filled with more love.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's friends say his travails have helped make him an
even better minister. ``He's brought an atmosphere of mercy to
people who are seeking, people who are broken, without compromising
the clear teaching of Scripture,'' said Mary Ann Mitchener,
minister of urban outreach at Grace Chapel and a friend to
MacDonald and his wife, Gail, for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald knows there are critics who say he, Campolo, and
Wogaman are being manipulated by the president for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   But he, and those who know MacDonald concur, is not about to
offer Clinton quick absolution. Without going into details,
MacDonald suggested he will treat Clinton as he would anyone in
trouble who seeks &UR;  &LR; his counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person needs to go backwards and understand what are the
pathways that led him to commit this action,'' MacDonald said.
``When we talk about healing and restoration, we also have to deal
with how does a person get forgiveness. Does it require loss of a
job, financial restitution, some kind of probation? It doesn't
happen with the snap of a finger, and it requires a lot of work and
commitment.''

THE SLOW GRIND OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- In the city and county of San Francisco, jury
duty is not easy to avoid or endure. Motions, objections, and
exhibits flow across the jury's ken like molasses or mucilage. The
few advantages include missing national legal moments more
titillating and more depressing.
</P>
<P>
   For months, I have been a bystander, opinionless among the
teeming crowds running toward the defense or prosecution of
President Clinton. I am merely puzzled at how this man causes so
much adulation and so much anger.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed solutions to his woes are more interesting and more
revealing of the national character than the president's
``inappropriate conduct.'' More than 200 newspapers have called
upon him to resign, an astonishing number. This editorial rush to
judgment rejected the presumption of innocence. Disgust defeated
discretion and prudishness overwhelmed prudence, all stirred by the
American libido for hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy is often messy and ponderously slow. ``Delay is
preferable to error,'' Thomas Jefferson told George Washington in
1792. But today's Americans prefer tidiness and speed. This
explains another extraordinary delusion known as ``Censure Plus,''
a hygiene product that could have been marketed by Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairness to the president'' is the motivation behind this
hasty move. But was Clinton being fair when he lied for seven
months? ``Make this go away'' is the mantra. ``I think it's
debilitating for this country,'' says Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa,
defending the president. But the Founding Fathers were not
squeamish about impeachment. They thought it could be invigorating
and cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution designed its checks and balances to be slow and
cumbersome, not anticipating television's need for a sound bite.
The Censure Plus caucus seeks to avoid impeachment hearings. Are
the charges trivial or serious? The House Judiciary Committee will
decide first, its 37 members deliberating in public, bound by the
necessity to seem fair. Republicans will have the incentive of
their leadership's suicidal tendencies in recent years. Democrats
will have the incentive of the November elections, which will
likely mean fewer Democrats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee members do not prosper in the food-fight
environment of television talk shows, but in doing their
constitutional duty, they can. The committee shone in the
impeachment hearings on President Nixon in 1974. ``If we aren't
credible, what we're doing amounts to nothing,'' chairman Henry
Hyde said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Television can distort judgment. I did not watch the famous
videotape of President Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony before a federal
grand jury. People who saw it told me ``he looked good.'' He always
looks good on television, especially when his co-stars are the
cronies of his favorite foil, Kenneth Starr. His testimony had all
the anticipation and excitement of a playoff game. Its afterglow
boosted his poll ratings (as widely watched televised performances
by presidents usually do).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's demeanor changed from contrite to chipper, based on
this temporary wave of emotion. And it is temporary, because he
will not publicly answer questions on this subject again for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   That time could be during the ``closer look'' that Hyde promises
in the impeachment hearings. That's what the Constitution calls
for, the law moving slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil trial here, every day seemed like a month in San
Quentin. When the judge asked about prior courtroom experience, I
said I had been a litigant many times but never a plaintiff. Still,
I was chosen to serve.
</P>
<P>
   In the jury room, the plaintiff's frequent lawsuits suggested
that he seemed to treat litigation as a hobby. We deliberated 11
minutes before finding for the defendant, a corporation he sued for
unconvincing reasons. The law may move slowly, but justice delayed
is justice denied.

CELLUCCI HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tell it to the employees of Gillette in South Boston, Governor
Cellucci. Or to the computer workers just pink-slipped from ADE of
Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the hundreds of former Digital workers in
Marlborough. Or to the 350 people laid off from Stratus Computer in
the same town.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the factory workers at Raytheon in Andover. Or to the
675 computer-chip makers facing layoffs by Intel in Hudson, your
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Tell all the newly unemployed workers at Teradyne in Boston
about the vigorous economy in Massachusetts and the state's
record-low unemployment rate. Take a page from your stock campaign
speech to reassure all the freshly ``downsized'' employees from PRI
Automation in Billerica that the Commonwealth is bursting with new
job opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
   On a single block of my suburban town alone, no less a corporate
giant than Sam Goody is in search of salesclerks; no less a growth
concern than CVS Pharmacy is in need of register ringers!
</P>
<P>
   In Cellucci campaign circles, the Commonwealth is still
experiencing the Massachusetts Miracle, an economic recovery
impervious to a skittish stock market, a national political
scandal, and overseas economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is so good, the strategy seems to be, that there is
little need to discuss it at all. Why not make the race for
governor of Massachusetts this fall a referendum on the death
penalty or a plebiscite on mandatory testing of public school
teachers, instead?
</P>
<P>
   Two new economic studies released in recent days suggest exactly
why not. Both studies contend that the gap between rich and poor in
Massachusetts is growing.
</P>
<P>
   US Census figures released last week show an increasing number
of people in the state slipping into poverty, data that are
especially alarming given just how low a family's resources must
fall before the federal bureaucracy will classify a family as poor.
The poverty line is drawn at the absurd level of $13,650 for a
family of three, $16,400 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   No one reasonably believes that any family living in Boston
could meet its basic needs with an income so low. A new study by
The Women's Educational &AMP; Industrial Union in Boston found
low-income families were forced to spend half of their income for
housing and child care alone. At least 40 percent of those families
were unable to earn enough money to come close to achieving
economic independence _ the much-touted goal of the Cellucci
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's neglect of the child-care needs of
low-income working parents, especially working mothers,
demonstrates the governor's failure to address some of the most
fundamental issues facing poor women. An estimated 13,000 children
continue to languish on waiting lists for chronically underfunded,
state-subsidized child care. An administration that prides itself
on having forced poor mothers out to work still can't find the
resources to help them care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Paul Cellucci's campaign against Democrat Scott
Harshbarger, a commitment to affordable child care, health care,
and further education for low-income wage earners takes a backseat
to calls for an income-tax rate cut designed to benefit more
affluent voters.
</P>
<P>
   The general election cycle completes its turn in five short
weeks, though the Commonwealth's voters seem to have barely
registered the fact that there is a gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   We can spend the next several weeks debating the emotional, the
marginal, and the polarizing. We can trash our teachers, clamor for
capital punishment, demand a tax-refund check. Or we ask some
tougher questions about where we are and where we are headed in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Who is going to re-train the semiconductor industry's laid-off
workforce now that the international demand for computer-chip
equipment has slowed because of the Asian financial crisis?
</P>
<P>
   How are we going to address the housing needs of working
families who find themselves priced out of the market in one
community after another?
</P>
<P>
   Where are laid-off manufacturing workers going to find jobs with
comparable salaries in an economy with a surplus of minimum-wage
work for salesclerks and waiters?
</P>
<P>
   What kind of economic-development planning is being done to
ensure that entry-level workers, whether welfare mothers or high
school graduates, acquire the necessary skills to share in good
economic times?
</P>
<P>
   Sometime before Nov. 3, do tell us, Governor Cellucci.

IF YOUR NAME IS MONICA, YOU ARE NOT AMUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Until now, it was such an obscure name in America.
Quick: Name another famous stateside Monica. Monica Seles, the
tennis player, is from Yugoslavia. The late Monica Dickens, the
novelist, was English. St. Monica, the mother of St. Augustine,
lived in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an uncommon name and I was always very proud of it,''
says Monica Kearney, a 44-year-old administrator. ``The reaction of
other people was usually `Oh, that's an unusual name. How
lovely.'''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Kearney replies darkly, ``it's trash.''
</P>
<P>
   These are indeed unsettling times for many women with the Monica
moniker. Monica Veneziano, a mind-body therapist, drives into an
auto body shop and the proprietor declares loudly, ``Hey, you've
got that name!'' Monica Megivern, a psychologist, orders groceries
and the clerk offers sympathy because Megivern has ``that terrible
bad girl's name.'' And Monica Constantini, a preschool teacher,
asks for a friend on the phone and hears the wise guy on the other
end announce that ``it's Miss Lewinsky on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks are even making remarks to 82-year-old Monica Piacentini.
``They'll say something like `Oh, are you related to her, dear?''
laments Piacentini, who was named for her grandmother. ``Then
they'll laugh. It used to be it was a name you never heard of,
because they're weren't many Monicas. Now there's one too many.''
</P>
<P>
   One non-Monica is so outraged by what she calls ``the pangs and
arrows of outrageous fortune'' that have befallen these ``innocent
good women'' that she has formed a support group for them. L. Mandy
Stellman, along with another Milwaukee attorney, Alan Eisenberg,
has founded Monicas With Attitude to help resurrect what the pair
feels is a good name gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from maybe 100 Monicas around the country, and an
overwhelming number want to participate in whatever we do,'' says
Eisenberg, who describes himself as a lawyer, real estate broker,
author, and radio broadcaster (as well as a former comedian and
nightclub singer). ``People are making jokes about Monica
(Lewinsky), but I don't hear other Monicas laughing. It's a form of
woman bashing, and it's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   And the thing is, as Monica McDermott points out, Monica was
just beginning to come into its own as a name. McDermott cites the
fact that two current television shows, ``Friends'' and ``Touched
by an Angel,'' have lead characters named Monica. (Meanwhile a
17-year-old singer named just plain Monica _ like just plain
Madonna and just plain Cher _ has a hit album.) ``The name was
starting to become more popular, like a trend,'' says McDermott,
who is a goldsmith. ``Now, I'm not so sure. But maybe any kind of
publicity is better than no publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's definitely not the opinion of Monica Armstrong, an
engineering administrator. Armstrong declares herself annoyed both
by the sudden infamy of her given name as well as by the kind of
low-level humor that accompanies its mention these days. ``It's
nothing graphic,'' she says of comments she has to endure. ``Mostly
it's little side remarks, or men who want to tell me the latest
Monica joke that's a shade off-color.''
</P>
<P>
   Most comments indeed seem to be harmless, if a little dopey.
``They usually come from older men, and they're usally
`nudge-nudge' types of things,'' explains Monica Parker, a
29-year-old public relations consultant. ``It's usually `Hey, it
must be kinda hard to have that name, eh?' Nudge-nudge. But the
husband of a woman I work with did make up a nasty little rhyme:
`Monica, Monica, come play my harmonica.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Monicas, however, think Monica Lewinsky has done them
wrong. ``I like the attention,'' says Monica McClaren, a substance
abuse counselor. ``People might make little jokes about sex, you
know, but I don't mind. In fact, I think this is definitely the
year of the Monica. I think lots of people will be naming their
daughters Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be the test, of course. Check in with your local
kindergarten in five years to see if there are many _ or any _
little Monicas running around the room. ``My own feeling is that
people won't be naming their daughters Monica for a while,'' says
Monica Graham, a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not many ever did,'' adds this particular Monica.

MORE CIVILITY? ACTUALLY, WE NEED LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has become commonplace to bemoan the lack of civility in our
society. Congress, hilariously, convened a retreat on the subject.
A wealthy New England family has coughed up $35 million to endow
The Institute for a Civil Society, in darkest Newton. I attended a
lecture by the Institute's president a few months ago. She wanted
us all to get along. She sounded very sincere.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with modern society is that there's too much
goddamned civility. And the worst culprit is the lily-livered,
libel-fearing, invective-free press. Where are the thunderers of
grand, denunciatory prose, like H.L. Mencken? What pre-millennial
scribbler could even clip the quill of today's column subject, the
greatest newspaperman who ever lived _ Ambrose Bierce?
</P>
<P>
   When did I first fall in love with Bierce? Probably under the
pen of the great Carey McWilliams, whose 1967 biography of the San
Francisco calumnist, sorry, columnist is periodically re-issued. I
fell in love again while unwinding at Stanford University two years
ago. Perusing a monograph of the university's founder, the robber
baron/railroad magnate Leland Stanford, I learned that Bierce
routinely vilified him in the San Francisco press as ``$tealin'
Landford.'' How apt. How naughty. How Bierce.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than eager to air out his enemies' dirty laundry,
Bierce guarded his own privacy and left no autobiography. Now,
David Schultz and S.T. Joshi have arranged fragments of Bierce's
writings into an autobiographical narrative. I am borrowing wildly
from their new book, ``Ambrose Bierce: A Sole Survivor,'' just
published by the University of Tennessee Press.
</P>
<P>
   There are simply too many reasons to love Bierce. A prolific and
brilliant newspaper writer, he also compiled the magnificent
``Devil's Dictionary.'' (Sample definition: ``Saint; a dead sinner,
revised and edited.'') Bierce was also a successful short story
writer and cold-eyed chronicler of the horrors of the Civil War.
His famous, chilling report, ``What I Saw of Shiloh,'' anticipates
Hemingway, Robert Graves, Paul Fussell and even ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' Bierce's most recent biographer Roy Morris Jr. calls it
``the working prototype of all modern war literature, at least as
seen by Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierce loved to inveigh. He loathed California's ``rail
rogues,'' and after hectoring Stanford to his grave, Bierce started
in on his partner, Collis P. Huntington. Dispatched by Harvard
dropout William Randolph Hearst to Washington, Bierce led a
battalion of Hearst writers, photographers and cartoonists on a
campaign ``of unremitting ad hominem assaults on Huntington,''
according to Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Huntington had journeyed to the nation's capital to seek
Congress's forgiveness of his railroad's $75 million debt. Once
Bierce's broadsides started to sting, the railroader offered to buy
him off, noting sardonically that ``every man has his price.'' ``My
price is $75 million,'' Bierce retorted. ``You may hand it over to
my friend, the Treasurer of the United States.'' No Archer Daniels
Midland endorsements for my man Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mencken, Bierce despised Boston (``the anus of America,''
quoth the Sage of Baltimore). A wounded Civil War hero and veteran
of its bloodiest campaigns, Bierce reviled Boston's literary
tastemakers as pasty-faced parlor pansies who sat out the defining
conflagration of their time. He derided Atlantic Monthly editor
William Dean Howells and Henry James as ``Miss Nancy Howells and
Miss Nancy James ... two eminent triflers and cameo-cutters in
chief to Her Littleness the Bostonese small virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, Bierce was jealous and dismissive of
Stephen Crane, hailed as the definitive interpreter of a war that
ended before his birth. Likewise, he never had much use for the
non-combatant Mark Twain. (Like Howells, Twain admired Bierce.) He
joined Twain, Winston Churchill, and my friend John Spooner in the
ranks of writers who reviewed their own books, under a pseudonym _
but with a twist. Bierce trashed his own book as ``a high-handed
outrage, a criminal assault upon public modesty, an indecent
exposure of the author's mind.'' (!)
</P>
<P>
   It is said that if you stand at the river bank long enough, you
will have the satisfaction of seeing your enemies' corpses float
by. Such moments afforded much ghoulish satisfaction for the
contentious Bierce. He came to despise his longtime publisher,
Frank Pixley, who committed two cardinal, Bierce-ian sins. Pixley
lied about his Civil War record, and he owed the writer money. When
Pixley died, Bierce dispatched him with the shortest, nastiest
obituary on record: ``Here lies Frank Pixley _ as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Come back, Ambrose. We need you, now more than ever.

AIR FORCE OFFICIAL WARNS OF CRITICAL PILOT SHORTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force faces a serious shortage of
experienced pilots, and it may take a decade to correct the
problem, a top defense planner said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in four Air Force pilots have taken lucrative bonuses
to stay in the service. At this time last year the Air Force had
just 48 fewer pilots than needed. That number has now grown to at
least 700.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated overseas tours and the allure of high-paying jobs at
commercial airlines are most often blamed for the shortage. The
shortage could grow to nearly 2,000 pilots by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're going to a situation that is four times worse
than we've ever seen in the history of our modern Air Force,'' said
Col. Jim Green, director of assignments at the personnel center at
Randolph Air Force Base near San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the pilot shortage is ``serious. It's real serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed
Services Committee Tuesday that the military services face critical
personnel shortages and budget problems, Green laid out a grim
scenario for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The service expects to lose 1,951 pilots by 2002, reducing its
strength to about 11,000 fliers. More than a third of those leaving
will be fighter pilots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Air Force will train 900 active-duty pilots this
year, 1,025 next year and 1,100 into the next century, the new
fliers will have less experience than those quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Retention rates for enlisted personnel, who make up 80 percent
of the Air Force, also have slipped. Green said ``they're at the
caution-light level right now, not at the red-light level.''
</P>
<P>
   Green stressed national security will not be jeopardized by the
loss of veteran pilots such as aircraft commanders and flight
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Air Force squadron has 18 fighters and 25 pilots.
Though full squadrons will continue to fly, he said, they may not
be staffed at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been mandated to keep the cockpits full and we've been
successful doing it. But what we're worried about is being able to
continue doing that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of bodies,'' he added. ``Something's going
to have to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives such as Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, have
called for an infusion of military spending to reverse the nation's
readiness problems. Speaking Tuesday after Senate passage of a
$250.5 billion defense appropriations measure, she said: ``I remain
very concerned about the overall state of readiness of our military
forces, and this bill does little to address the problem
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   While top Pentagon leaders have called for boosting the
Pentagon's budget by as much as $15 billion in the new fiscal year,
the Air Force faces a different numbers game.
</P>
<P>
   The service can neither produce enough new pilots nor convince
its veterans, most of whom have eight to nine years' experience, to
stay in uniform through their 14th year of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see us getting healthy again until the 2010 time
frame, and maybe not even then,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   To entice aviators to remain in the service, the Air Force has
reduced the amount of time pilots are temporarily deployed overseas
and boosted bonuses to $110,000 over five years. But the Air Force
is still seeing its best cockpit commanders bail out.
</P>
<P>
   Many are leaving for the chance to cash in on the commercial
airline industry, where there is a major demand for experienced
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Green considers airline hiring the major factor in the loss of
Air Force pilots, but conceded that a four-fold rise in overseas
deployments also was playing a role.

SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH OFFICIAL BACKS WHITE HOUSE POLICY ON
METHADONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco health official welcomed a new
White House initiative to expand methadone treatment for heroin
addiction, saying it is in line with the city's own goals.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the city Board of Supervisors passed a resolution
asking the federal government for a waiver so that doctors, with
training, could prescribe the synthetic narcotic designed to reduce
the craving for heroin. Currently, strict regulations prevent
anyone but specially-licensed clinics from dispensing it.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, said
Tuesday there are plans to begin training programs for physicians
to become accredited to prescribe methadone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area where there are too many regulations,'' said
Barbara A. Garcia, director of community substance abuse services
for the San Francisco Department of Public Health. ``This puts us
in a very, very opportune situation in terms of our ability, on a
local level, to push this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,800 people are being served at five methadone clinics in
the city, each governed by a complex web of state and federal
regulations. Another 415 are on a waiting list for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   More people will choose methadone, Garcia said, if they know
they can get it confidentially through their own doctor. It could
also lead to better medical care for conditions that often crop up
in injection drug users, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garcia anticipates it will be at least a year and maybe
longer before regulations can be rewritten on both a state and
federal level to make methadone access easier.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Institutes of Health issued as
sharply-worded report saying the nation's heroin addiction policies
are outdated and that plenty of evidence exists that methadone
works well.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment remains controversial, however. New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has said it only swaps one addiction for another
and announced a plan in that city to get users to quit. A few
states have no methadone clinics at all.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly cost for treatment is usually about $3,400 a year
per person and involves frequent visits to the clinics. Medi-Cal,
California's health insurance for the poor, pays for its members to
receive methadone, but some people pay for it themselves, Garcia
said. She said they are able to do that because methadone
stabilizes addicts and allows them to retain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, San Francisco intends to provide treatment,
including methadone, on demand for all addicts. That goal remains
years away, Garcia said.

POLLUTION FLOWS AT US-MEXICO BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AGUSTIN, Mexico _ Some &UR;  &LR; nights the stench of sewage and
chemicals from the canal running through this dusty border town is
so nauseating that Manuel Robles and his family cannot sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all kinds of dead fish in there,'' Robles, 57, a
teacher-turned-environmental activist, said of the leather-colored
water that flows swiftly from the factories and neighborhoods of
Ciudad Juarez, about 15 miles away. ``Government people come here
and talk about cleaning it up. But it's still here, where everybody
can smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of environmental problem that government
officials in Washington and Mexico City promised to address five
years ago when they were promoting the idea of a North American
Free Trade Agreement among Mexico, Canada, and the United States.
To prove their commitment to clean up the border, negotiators
signed a separate environmental agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But along this stretch of the Rio Grande and through most of the
2,000-mile US-Mexico border, it is hard to find much improvement.
Instead, several residents, activists, and government specialists
acknowledge that in many ways the border is worse off today than it
was before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I'd say the promises made for cleaning up the area
have not been fulfilled, and one area that has really suffered has
been the area around Juarez,'' said Richard Boren, 41, coordinator
of the Southwest Toxic Watch, an environmental group based in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt NAFTA has brought more economic activity to
Mexico, even from faraway places like Massachusetts. Last year Bay
State exports to this country rose to more than $440 million, up 33
percent since 1993, the year before NAFTA went into effect,
according to a report prepared by the Washington-based Trade
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious sign of the new business wave is among the new
factories owned by or performing work for US corporations. Known by
their Spanish name, ``maquiladoras,'' these factories benefit from
cheaper labor costs and provide jobs for thousands of Mexican
citizens. Although these ``twin plants'' existed long before NAFTA,
their popularity with multinational corporations has spawned
hundreds of facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But their explosive growth, along with the arrival of thousands
of new immigrants to the border region looking for jobs, has hurt
an environment that was, by most assessments, damaged before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA proponents argued that the agreement would encourage more
companies to build these assembly plants in Mexico's interior. But
largely because of its proximity to the United States, where the
finished products are sent, the border has absorbed most of the new
maquiladora construction.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-mile border area holds about two-thirds of Mexico's
4,010 maquiladoras, according to figures from the country's
commerce and industrial agency. The remaining third are in interior
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ciudad Juarez, for example, is Mexico's fourth-largest city with
a population of about 2 million people and sits adjacent El Paso,
Texas. The city is home to about a quarter of Mexico's
NAFTA-related factories, but it still does not have a water and
sewage treatment system.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's raw sewage and runoff from the factories flow
into six open canals. It is believed another 50 million gallons of
untreated waste is dumped every &UR;  &LR; day into the Rio Grande.
Government officials say plans for a new treatment plant
were &UR;  &LR; approved four years ago, but were postponed because of the
economic crisis that hit the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A design for a $30 million plant has just been approved. But one
local government administrator, mindful that the Mexican peso again
has shown signs of volatility, wonders whether history might repeat
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy if we have to cut the budget again and
stop this project,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We're at the mercy of our peso, but I don't know how
much longer people can wait for clean water.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also said the two agencies created by NAFTA to develop
more binational cleanup projects have done little to help. The
Border Environment Cooperation Commission, which is headquartered
in Juarez, Mexico, has been slow to approve initiatives. Meanwhile,
the Texas-based North American Development Bank, which is run by
Treasury officials of both nations, has been hamstrung by internal
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at both agencies insist that more cleanup projects
are on the way. Eleven environmental initiatives totaling $3
billion _ most of them for waste and water treatment _ have secured
financing or are already under construction, according to NADBank
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand people's desires to see things done quickly, but
we'd rather see projects that are planned and built carefully,''
said Linda Taylor, a New Mexico environmentalist and member of the
BECC board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say the border environment has worsened,
especially with the maquiladoras, but I think there'll be
improvement in the future,'' she added, referring to 23 projects
the commission has certified.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA supporters also said tougher environmental laws that took
effect with the agreement have helped improve some border
communities. In Matamoros, a Mexican town across the bridge from
Brownsville, Texas, an area once dubbed ``Chemical Row'' has
improved gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing outrage from activists and community leaders, the
area's worst polluters were driven out and many remaining companies
have installed their own treatment systems. Even some of the newer
factories in Juarez have new recycling programs and are teaching
employees better ways to dispose of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the problems along this corner of the border appear to
outnumber the solutions. There is the electrical substation outside
El Porvenir, Mexico, where drums of toxic fluids and old
transformers sit unwatched near a residential neighborhood. There
is the landfill in Sunland Park, N.M., only a few miles from the
border, where residents say dumping goes unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the danger, many residents say, that this part of
the border is drawing more waste rather than eliminating it.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca, Texas, a sleepy town of 700 residents that lies
in a desert valley 80 miles east of El Paso, is home to the
nation's largest sludge dump. About 250 tons of waste arrive almost
daily by train, much of it from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the area's dry terrain, Texas has also proposed a
low-level radioactive waste site 5 miles away, 15 miles from the
Mexican border. The waste would come from Texas, Vermont, and
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the planned waste site say the dump will not harm
the environment. But opponents say the site lies near an earthquake
fault line and that its presence would reinforce the idea that
poorer and mostly Hispanic border residents can be exposed to such
a risk.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has drawn together an unusual alliance of Mexican
and US residents in opposition to the project, which has been
approved by Congress and is awaiting final word from President
Clinton and the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission will make
its final decision on the waste dump on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Mexican government officials had offered only
minor resistance to the proposal. But earlier this month, Mexico's
environmental secretary, Julia Carabias, asked US officials to
reconsider the site's location.
</P>
<P>
   That is little comfort to Robles, the environmental activist,
who still runs San Agustin's only library and museum, even though
his government pay was cut off in February. He believes the act was
in retaliation by local government officials angry with his work
with the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole area is like one human body,'' Robles said while
moving along the foul-smelling canal. ``The parts of this body are
getting sicker. And unless something happens soon, the whole
beautiful body will suffer terribly.''

THE WORK OF `60 MINUTES'; A WORKDAY OFF, FOR VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spawn of ``60 Minutes'' is all across the prime-time
landscape this season, with one TV newsmagazine after another
popping up on the tube. In that context, a piece in the October
issue of Brill's Content should open some eyes by revealing how
many showbiz values surround even the best broadcast journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lando, who left ``60 Minutes'' in 1997 after working there
for 27 years as a producer, crosses swords in Content with Don
Hewitt, executive producer of the venerable CBS newsmagazine. It
gets nasty and personal, with charges of breach of duty and
who-makes-how-much flying around, but it begins on a matter of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Lando argues that ``60 Minutes'' employs the same ``devious
system'' as the one that blew up in CNN's face last summer with
``Tailwind'': namely, using famous correspondents as window
dressing on stories that are largely discovered, reported, and
written by producers. ``You'd think that the show that prides
itself on revealing hypocrisy and cant, on uncovering deceptions,
would be all for truth in packaging when it comes to itself,''
Lando writes. ``It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the fabled ``60 Minutes'' interviews ``are often pure
shadow play,'' Lando writes, with correspondents feigning shock at
revelations about which they have already been briefed by
producers. Lando calls on ``60 Minutes'' to explicitly acknowledge
_ on the air _ the ``key reporting role'' played by producers and
associate producers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt talks back in Content, with his usual gusto. In
between some personal shots at Lando, Hewitt points out that ``60
Minutes'' correspondent Mike Wallace fully detailed the role
producers play in his book ``Close Encounters'' 13 years ago, and
notes that ``60 Minutes'' was the first broadcast to credit
producers at the beginning of each story rather than the end.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's hard to disagree with Lando's overall point,
which is that ``60 Minutes'' _ and other TV newsmagazines _ are
happy to leave the impression that all those hard-hitting exposes
are the work of their million-dollar correspondents.
</P>

<P>
   On primary day, after a long day at work, I headed directly to
my local polling place, only to arrive just seconds after the polls
had closed.
</P>
<P>
   My own fault, of course. I shouldn't have waited till the last
minute to vote, one of the solemn duties of citizenship. But, as
happens to a lot of us these days, life got in the way. Anyway, the
experience left me receptive to Martin P. Wattenberg's modest
proposal _ advanced in the October Atlantic Monthly _ that election
day be made a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In giving people more time to vote, Wattenberg writes, ``This
would send a strong signal about the importance our country
attaches to voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, his proposal seems radical, and might be seen as just
giving apathetic nonvoters another day off. But nothing else seems
to be stemming the trend toward abysmally low turnout in American
elections. Even after the much-ballyhooed ``motor voter'' law went
into effect in 1993, Wattenberg points out, turnout for the 1996
presidential election fell below 50 percent for the first time
since the 1920s. Between one-third and one-half of eligible voters
cast ballots in congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   And given the way Generation X seems to have tuned out politics,
the future seems even grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In India, bribes are called ``efficiency money.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the piquant details in Edward Hoagland's
story in the October Outside of his trip to Arunachal Pradesh, a
remote, roadless, and politically charged region of India that is
home to a variety of hill tribes.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye both poetic and comprehensive, Hoagland takes the
reader across the creaky bridges and washed-out mountain roads and
into the villages of Arunachal Pradesh. Hoagland describes with
matter-of-fact respect the indigenous people he meets, some of
whose customs and garments may seem outlandish to Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Hoagland has always been one of those writers who can stop a
reader in his tracks with bravura prose, and those gifts are on
display again here: the mountains are ``molor and uninviting, the
weather lawless,'' rivers have ``carved giddy, green, orchestral
valleys,'' his ``wristwatch-and-monotheistic rigidity'' is relaxed
in the presence of ``people who live by the sun, stars and
fire-flicker from birth to a quiet grave.''

   Joshua Gamson discerns something a tad hypocritical, or at least
contradictory, in our reaction to ``The Truman Show,'' the Jim
Carrey movie about a man whose life, unknown to him, is a
television show.
</P>
<P>
   The film has been acclaimed for dramatizing the extent to which
our privacy has been invaded by the media culture, Big Brother, et.
al. Yet in a shrewdly observant essay in the November-December
issue of The American Prospect (available Monday on newsstands),
Gamson points out that nowadays, ``there are more than enough
people willing to invade their own `privacy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He cites such spectacles as the woman who gave birth on the
Internet last summer, along with the growth in ``reality
television'' fare like MTV's ``Real World,'' HBO's ``Taxicab
Confessions,'' ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' and ``The Jerry
Springer Show.'' These shows, Gamson writes, succeed because we
live in a culture that ``rewards the looked-at.''
</P>
<P>
   The casualty of this obsession is not a minor one: ``a life you
recognize as authentically your own because it is not there for the
entertainment of others.''

   Four years ago, Artisoft Inc. was riding high. Since then, it
has shrunk from 700 employees to 150. In the last two years it has
tumbled from a $13.6 million annual profit to a combined loss of
more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s popular operating system and its successor,
Windows 98, have caused life-threatening crises at Artisoft and
many other software companies, simply because Microsoft keeps
adding features to Windows that computer users once had to buy
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has drawn fire from the US Justice Department. For
instance, Microsoft's addition to Windows of free software to
browse the Internet helped spark the current federal antitrust
lawsuit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's upgrade strategy is nothing new. Since the early
1980s, the company has frequently added features &UR;  &LR; at no extra
charge _ &UR;  &LR; disk repair utilities, networking support, and Internet
compatibility, to name a few. Tod Nielsen, general manager of
software-developer relations at Microsoft, insists that the
Redmond, Wash., company adds features to improve the product, not
to hurt smaller competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's slightest move can cause serious hardship for
small companies that suddenly see their markets disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies react with fury, demanding that the federal
government set limits on Microsoft's ability to add free upgrades
to its software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely unfair,'' said Zvi Alon, president of
NetManage Inc., a California maker of networking software that has
lost key markets to Microsoft. Alon believes that Microsoft should
be compelled to charge for significant additions to its products.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that there won't be much of a software industry left
if Microsoft has carte blanche to add features to its operating
systems. ``If we use that logic and keep it moving forward,'' said
Alon, ``essentially we might as well all go home and stop
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Other software companies, such as Symantec Corp. and Quarterdeck
Corp., are finding ways to survive and even prosper by cooperating
with Microsoft. And still others dramatically shift their focus,
aiming to find new success in a market segment that Microsoft
hasn't conquered _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft, at one time based in Tucson, Ariz. but now in
Cambridge, Mass., is one company that's being forced to adapt or
die.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft had once carved out a small but profitable niche. By
the mid-1980s, businesses had discovered the power of computer
networking, connecting desktop machines to share files or use the
same printer. But it was hard to link computers that ran
Microsoft's then-popular MS-DOS operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft responded with LANtastic, software that made it easy
for small businesses to tie their PCs into networks. In fiscal
1994, Artisoft raked in revenues of more than $107 million and
profits of $13.6 million, primarily on the strength of -LANtastic.
It was the last good year the company had.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Microsoft rolled out its replacement for MS-DOS _
Windows 95, which had networking software built in.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thomas, Artisoft's chief operating officer and president,
realized that the firm was in big trouble. ``You're competing
against a company that not only has a huge marketing operation, but
also is installing its product on every PC made,'' said Thomas.
``In late '95, early '96, it was clear this was going to have a
huge impact on the revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time to find a new business model. Artisoft decided to
plunge into the market for software that controls the operation of
complex business telephone systems. The market for
-computer-telephone integration is supposed to grow to $6 billion a
year by 2000, according to market research firm Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft moved to Massachusetts in September to take advantage
of &UR;  &LR; a high concentration of expertise in its new &UR;  &LR; field. Says
Thomas: ``I don't think you can find a better place than the Boston
area for computer telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another local firm has decided to seek relief through
merger. Last month, FTP Software Inc. of Andover, Mass. was
acquired by Alon's NetManage Inc. Both have struggled to reorient
their businesses after key products were rendered irrelevant by
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   NetManage invented WinSock, a program that enabled users of PCs
to communicate over the Internet. In the early 1990s, when
consumers and businesses began going on line, NetManage scored
considerable success with its Chameleon Internet software, which
included &UR;  &LR; a primitive Web browser and WinSock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a substantial market share, 60 plus percent,'' said
NetManage president Alon.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the country, FTP was also prospering from
the sale of Internet software for PCs, as well as its OnNet
corporate networking software based on TCP/IP, the Internet data
protocol.

 UNDATED: ... data protocol.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But both companies were unprepared for the arrival of Windows
95. Microsoft had included its own software, similar to WinSock,
and the first crude but usable version of Microsoft's Internet
browser. Suddenly, NetManage Chameleon didn't have a market any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's operating systems weren't NetManage's only source of
trouble. Another successful NetManage product was Ecco Pro, &UR;  &LR; a
popular personal information manager, a program used by individuals
to plan their activities. But Microsoft began including a competing
product, Outlook, with its Microsoft Office software suite. Office
is by far the most popular business software package, and Alon
decided that few Office users would pay an additional $139 for Ecco
Pro. Last December, NetManage discontinued the product.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the East Coast, FTP was also struggling. Why
should businesses buy OnNet to create internal TCP/IP networks?
Windows 95 had similar features built right in. Soon FTP saw its
sales wither. The firm posted a 1997 net loss of $56.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were competing with a free offering bundled with operating
systems'' sold by Microsoft, FTP general counsel Douglas Flood told
Bloomberg News last year. ``That clearly had some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   It all looked familiar to Alon at NetManage. ``FTP was in
exactly the same boat,'' he said. Their common hardship made an
acquisition seem appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies also shared a strong background in creating
software for linking PCs to diverse computer systems. By focusing
the new NetManage on these markets, Alon hopes to stay clear of
future operating system &UR;  &LR; changes from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of utility software are especially vulnerable to
death-by-Microsoft-upgrade. Utilities perform unglamorous but
important functions, such as fixing minor disk-drive problems,
restoring accidentally deleted files, or hunting for computer
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterdeck Corp. of Marina del Rey, Calif., came to prominence
selling QEMM, which makes more efficient use of memory on
Microsoft-based PCs. But Windows 95 featured vastly improved memory
management that made products like QEMM far less useful.
Quarterdeck's revenues fell from $117.6 milllion in 1995 to $83.8
million last year, and 1995's $11.25 million profit became a 1997
loss of more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Dickson, Quarterdeck's vice president of marketing, said
her firm is rolling out utility products to solve problems that
Microsoft still hasn't addressed. For instance, it's notoriously
difficult to remove unwanted software from a Windows machine.
Quarterdeck is one of several companies touting uninstaller
software to make the job easier. The firm has also entered the
antivirus market and has a new disk-cloning product to help people
add bigger hard drives to their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being angry with Microsoft, Dickson said, Quarterdeck
sees Microsoft as an ally. Microsoft engineers consult with
Quarterdeck's people, keeping them informed of changes in Windows
that might affect sales of a Quarterdeck product. Quarterdeck uses
this guidance to design new utilities that meet needs that
Microsoft has overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbiotic type of relationship,'' said Dickson. ``We
wouldn't even have a utilities business if it weren't &UR;  &LR; for the
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar relationship exists between Microsoft and Symantec
Corp., maker of the popular Norton Utilities. Each new version of
Windows has added features like disk repair that were once a prime
reason to buy Norton Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the quintessential example of a company that
ought to hate Microsoft.'' said Symantec president Gordon Eubanks.
Instead, Eubanks is a close Microsoft ally and has helped to form
the Association for Competitive Technology, a -software-industry
group that supports Microsoft in its antitrust battles.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it's because many of the improved utilities found in
Microsoft products, such as disk--repair software, were actually
created by Symantec and licensed to Microsoft. But aside from that,
Eubanks said that Microsoft works closely with Symantec to ensure
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it shocks people,'' said Eubanks. ``They're not a bunch
of raving maniacs who want to put everybody out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Symantec is the hottest company in PC
utilities, with fiscal 1998 sales of $578 million and profits of
$85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Tod Nielsen says his firm runs aggressive programs
to inform software developers about Microsoft's upgrade plans.
``Any developer that's impacted, he's going to know way before it's
shipping,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He conceded that some companies have been squashed by
Microsoft upgrades, but he argued that these are mainly firms that
weren't prepared to compete in one of the world's toughest
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are companies that say, `It's not fair; we have a
birthright,''' said Nielsen. ``Those are the companies that get
impacted negatively.''

<P>
   Autumn spreads its chill, the hearty swordfish is preparing to
depart the cold waters off Nova Scotia and swim south. During these
last weeks along New England's coast, connoisseurs say the sword is
as good as it gets: fat and flavorful after summer in our seas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when the fish migrates, it won't be regret that fills
the consumer. It will be relief. Out of sight, out of mind, says
one chef. ``I'm glad the season is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   What caused this sentiment is a high-profile conservation
campaign for the swordfish. Targeted by environmental groups, it's
the new poster fish for overutilized resources. A boycott of North
Atlantic swordfish began last January, when the fish hadn't
migrated this far north yet. Now some chefs who honored the boycott
are wondering if they did the right thing, responsible retailers
are handing out position sheets, and consumers are left in a
muddle.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the ``Give Swordfish a Break'' campaign,
sponsored by SeaWeb and the Natural Resources Defense Council,
raised an alarm. The boycott _ effective in some arenas _ was
launched because the North Atlantic swordfish population is
dwindling after years of losing its juvenile stocks. Not many chefs
in this area took up the cause and most major retailers didn't go
along with it, but one Maine wholesaler, who supplies top Manhattan
tables, reports that he didn't have a call for swordfish all
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen felt the pinch. And it couldn't have come at a worse
time, say the boycott's critics. Since demand for swordfish is
higher than ever, imported fish are being bought up. When fishermen
lose the chance to sell premium fish to high-end restaurants, the
economic loss is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, they say, fishermen already comply with strict
international conservation regulations and fight for their own
quota reductions. They, more than anyone, want to see the waters
filled with swordfish, otherwise they won't have a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sympathetic to that point of view,'' says SeaWeb's
executive director Vikki Spruill. ``The federal government has a
responsibility to take care of families in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on out there in the big, bold sea?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has an opinion. Fishermen's groups accuse the
environmental organization SeaWeb, a project of the Pew Charitable
Trusts, of having interests unrelated to conservation. SeaWeb says
that the National Marine Fisheries Service and the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (known as ICCAT),
regulators for the Atlantic's pelagic long-line fish _ of which
swordfish is one _ are simply arresting the decline, not rebuilding
the fisheries. &UR;  &LR; Ecology-minded chefs and consumers worry about the
unmarketable, juvenile fish that accidentally hook onto a long-line
and die _ known as by-catch to the fisheries and by-kill to the
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   No one disagrees that these problems exist. All sides claim to
be conservation-minded. And all agree that something had to be done
to rebuild North Atlantic swordfish (the North Atlantic Ocean ends
at the northeast corner of Brazil; Pacific swordfish is not in
danger). When New England quotas have been met, some retailers,
like Roger Berkowitz of Legal Sea Foods, buy swordfish from boats
as far south as Florida. He won't bring in swordfish from South
America. ``It doesn't eat the same,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 20 percent of swordfish consumed in the United States
is caught in the North Atlantic, whose fishery was 750,000 pounds
under quota last year, an amount that will be added to this fall's
catch.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott might have raised awareness, ``but it penalized
fishermen who are trying to get the fishery rebuilt,'' says Rebecca
Lent, chief of the highly migratory species division of the
National Marine Fisheries Service. This US Commerce Department
agency oversees our fishing boats and enforces regulations set by
ICCAT.
</P>
<P>
   The targeting of our fishermen is what riles critics. SeaWeb is
``taking the few producers who are left and hammering them into the
ground,'' says John Wojtasinski of Atlantic Seacove, one of many
wholesalers that supply swordfish to Foley Fish Co., Legal Sea
Foods, and Bread &AMP; Circus, none of whom are participating in the
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like all controversies, this one comes with its conspiracy
theory. ``This is not about conservation,'' says Nelson Beideman,
executive director of Blue Water Fishermen's Association, based in
Barnegat Light, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Beideman represents the 200 active US fleets that harvest
swordfish, tuna, sharks, and mahi-mahi. He insists that elite sport
fishermen and major oil companies, in cahoots with SeaWeb, are
trying to wipe out commercial fishermen to give recreational
fishermen more catch.
</P>
<P>
   He understands conservationists who say that swordfish quotas
must be enforced and that even with perfect compliance the stocks
won't rebuild. Fisheries experts say that, given the chance,
swordfish will replenish itself fairly quickly.

CATHERINE JONES GETS A BELATED SHOT AT THE IRONMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)  
 (Includes Triathlon facts text table.   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, Mass. _ Cathy Jones had mixed emotions when she
learned in May 1997 that she was pregnant. Of course she was
ecstatic, but the news put a damper on her dream to finally run in
the Ironman Triathlon in Kona, Hawaii, that fall. Skill was with
her when she had finished a triathlon to qualify, then luck was
with her when her name was picked as a winner in the 3,000-person
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But that was two weeks before Jones, a doctor with the Wachusett
Emergency Physicians Group, got the news of her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, out of indecision or denial, she kept riding, biking, and
swimming all summer until finally, just before the deadline last
August, she admitted to herself and to the race organizers that she
couldn't compete after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been 28 weeks pregnant,'' said Jones, who asked
if she could defer her entry for a year but was told she had to try
again.
</P>
<P>
   Fate was with her again. When Jones threw her name in the
lottery this year, she was chosen again. Her husband, Eric Dickson,
on the other hand, has tried to beat the odds for three years with
no success _ only 150 are chosen from the 3,000 hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday, Jones, 35, will compete in the 20th edition of
the Ironman race that starts at 7 a.m. and includes a 2.4-mile
ocean swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run. Eric and son
Killian _ now seven months old _ will be watching and pulling for
Mom to finish under the 17-hour limit.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jones will not be a newcomer to the race in Hawaii.
She was there three years ago, not competing, but working the
medical tent. She tended to athletes whose bodies had trouble
withstanding grueling events back to back to back, in 90 degree
heat over tar-topped roads. The tent is situated where the bikes
are set up, which is also the finish of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being depressed or horrified by the collapsing bodies
she saw that day, Jones was invigorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very exciting place,'' she said. ``There's a lot of
energy and enthusiasm in the air there, and great people. Most of
the athletes were dehydrated and needed IVs, and then got back in
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where it's necessary to know two things about Jones: As
an emergency-room physician, she's no stranger to trauma, and as a
former college record-holder in swimming, she's no stranger to
competition. Athletics and medicine have been constant themes in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   Jones grew up in Framingham and was on the swimming team at
Framingham North high school. Then at the University of New
Hampshire, she continued swimming and set school records (since
broken) in the 1,000 freestyle and 1,650 freestyle. She also
started running to keep in shape during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1985, Jones worked in the ultrasound lab at
the Lahey Clinic for four years before entering the University of
Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. But she didn't take a
break from competing.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's running had escalated to the marathon level (she has
competed in nine Boston Marathons and in the Falmouth Marathon).
She also kept up her swimming, competing in the Boston Harbor Light
and Vineyard Sound swims and ``a couple of open-water marathon
swims.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided about 10 years ago to combine her athletic skills
and start competing in triathlons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started seriously thinking about the Hawaii Ironman about
five or six years ago,'' Jones said. ``I really wanted to do this,
but it always seemed kind of distant.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when she was on a medical rotation in Hawaii,
the prospect seemed a little closer. She was on Oahu, and went to
Kona on the big island of Hawaii to volunteer at the medical tent
on race day.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 race doctors are scheduled to work for a few hours
apiece, but Jones liked it so much, she said, that she ``stayed for
the whole thing, and we finished around 2 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a busy day, but I love medicine, so it was kind of neat
to combine two things I really like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Jones competed in two triathlons that are
about half the length of the Ironman. She ran one in Lancaster,
where she finished fourth in her 35-39 age group, and one in
Medford.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jones got the word last spring that she'll be one of the
1,500 in Saturday's race, she has been juggling training and
competing with being a mother and working eight-hour shifts that
can start at 7 a.m. or 11 p.m. for a week at a time. As a member of
the Wachusett Emergency Physicians Group, Jones works at either
Leominster Hospital or Burbank Hospital in Fitchburg.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's strongest segment of the triathon is the swim but she
has had to sacrifice some of that training for the sake of Killian.
She has forgone open-water swims in favor of laps at the local
YMCA, where she swims in the pool for an hour while Killian is at
the club's day-care facility.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other sports, she said, ``I run when I can and bike
when I can, and I try and do a fair amount of running when I'm
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   So after she finishea a 40-mile bike ride, Jones might go out
for a 5-mile run as she tries to get used to the transitions
athletes must make in a triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   She runs with Killian in front of her in a jogging stroller if
it's a short run _ ``40 minutes or less'' _ and by herself on the
roads of Princeton if it's longer. Training in the rolling hills
near her house in the shadow of Wachusett Mountain should be an
advantage when she gets to Hawaii, she figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrain in Kona is not as steep as it is around here,''
she said, adding that the hills aren't her main concern. ``The
biggest thing about the marathon is, it's hot. The pavement is
black tar _ it's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   The biking, she said, will be the hardest leg for her,
especially since she took up the sport only so she could do
triathlons.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good ride for me is about 40 miles,'' she said. ``And I've
done longer rides, but I don't routinely do 100 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, triathlon biking is a lot different than bike
racing, because while you are surrounded by other cyclists, you
have to ride individually, as you would in a time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal to ride in a pack, and there is no drafting, no
teammates,'' Jones said. ``So it really is a different sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the training Jones has been doing _ running on the
hills, riding in the heat, and swimming in the pool _ she is aware
that a large part of the Ironman is enduring the psychological
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any race that's 14 hours long, a significant part of it is
mental,'' she said. ``But first off, I'm hoping to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   And she remains upbeat.
</P>

BLEAK PROFIT PICTURE LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any experienced investor will tell you that interest rates and
company earnings are the real forces behind stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   You got the Federal Reserve's tepid good news on rates Tuesday.
Now get ready for a bleaker profit picture.
</P>
<P>
   Companies nationwide are preparing to report earnings for the
quarter ending Wednesday, and the forecasts are not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a survey of Massachusetts' 100 largest public
companies, based on stock brokerage forecasts tracked by First Call
Corp. of Boston, found about 40 percent were expected to report
lower profits or greater losses than those recorded in the same
quarter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern is taking place among the country's leading
companies that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, according
to First Call. As a group, they are forecast to report earnings 1
percent lower than year-ago profits, the first such decline
recorded since the recession of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasts of brokerage analysts collected by First Call
usually measure the results of continuing operations and do not
include one-time gains and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had forecast a third-quarter earnings increase of 10
percent at the beginning of July, but have been cutting predictions
ever since. Their consensus forecast for the fourth quarter still
calls for an unrealistic 9.5 percent earnings increase, according
to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as analysts are going to have to substantially reduce
short-term estimates, it's going to keep pressure on the market,''
said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call. ``It's hard
to see the market going up when estimates are going to have to be
cut to the degree we expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Actual third-quarter earnings reports will be issued over the
next three or four weeks. Usually the worst news comes out early,
in the style of Gillette Co.'s third-quarter warning Monday.
Analysts cut their consensus forecast Gillette earnings for the
quarter by 10 cents per share Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Bay State firms are expected to report strong
earnings growth, including Biogen Inc., the Cambridge-based
biotechnology company; Keane Inc. of Boston, a software services
firm; and Carematrix Corp., the Needham-based owner of senior
living services.
</P>
<P>
   But more are expected to report significantly lower
third-quarter profits. Teradyne Inc. of Boston, which makes
semiconductor test equipment, is forecast to earn less than half
its profits of the third quarter of 1997. PRI Automation Inc. of
Billerica, which also serves the semiconductor industry, is
predicted to lose money in the quarter, off from a healthy year-ago
quarterly profit.
</P>
<P>
   Many other technology firms are in the same boat. Millipore
Corp., Data General Corp., and Analog Devices Inc. are part of a
larger group of Massachusetts technology companies with lower
earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The declining profit predictions are hardly limited to the tech
sector. Companies in a variety of industries such as Reebok
International Ltd., New England Electric System, and Stone &AMP;
Webster Inc. are all expected to earn less money.
</P>
<P>
   Many US firms are struggling with an inability to raise prices
while some costs, particularly payroll expenses, rise. By some
accounts, that spells more trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our very eyes, we are entering into a profits recession
that will last as long or longer than a traditional recession,''
said Edward G. Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston Corp.
``That means corporate earnings will decline for at least two
consecutive quarters, if not three or four.'' Another opinion: The
news is bad but most of the pain has already been inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   John Ballen, president of MFS Investment Management, points to
Gillette as an example. Gillette shares only fell by about 6
percent Tuesday, after the market had digested bad news from the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors never really believed Wall Street forecasts about
Gillette and had already knocked the stock down by about 40 percent
from its peak, Ballen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news already has been figured into the price of many other
stocks besides Gillette, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the stock market relative to interest rates,
it's projecting low single-digit earnings growth next year, much
less than Wall Street estimates,'' Ballen said.
</P>
<P>
   Much, much less. The First Call survey of analysts calls for
corporate profit growth of 14.3 percent in the first quarter of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outrageously high,'' said Hill. And sure to come down in the
months ahead.

HIXON OPTS OFF US FIELD HOCKEY TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprising move, 1996 Olympics coach Pam Hixon has resigned
as coach of the US women's national field hockey team, citing
philosophical differences with the sport's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not see eye to eye,'' said Hixon, who as coach at the
University of Massachusetts before accepting the national-team post
led the Minutewomen to 13 consecutive postseason appearances.
``They were totally results-oriented. I have a different philosophy
in terms of development, which means you don't always get
results.''
</P>
<P>
   A parting of the ways, the Framingham, Mass. native said
Tuesday, was best for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The issue apparently heated up after the US, coming off a bronze
medal in the 1994 World Cup and a fifth-place finish in the 1996
Olympics, finished eighth out of 12 teams in May's 1998 World Cup.
By several accounts, the governing body expected better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following the World Cup, I think it was time to make some hard
decisions,'' said Hixon, who lost the core of her team to
retirement after Atlanta. ``I thought the team did fine. Would we
have liked to have done better? Absolutely. But I know we were
competitive with the teams we should have been competitive with.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory at next summer's Pan American Games would
automatically send the US team to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, and
Hixon remains optimistic. ``I think the team is in position to win
the Pan Ams,'' she said. ``The young talent is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since resigning in late July, Hixon has been concentrating on
her White Mountain Sports Camp, which offers developmental programs
and clinics in field hockey. Based in Amherst, Hixon recently
opened a second office in the Washington, D.C., area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy,'' said the 1973 graduate of Springfield
College. ``Doors are opening every day.'' Hixon said she may also
do some consulting and TV commentary as well as expand the camps to
include other sports, such as lacrosse and golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Field hockey has been so great to me, to keep that going and
continue to give something back to the sport is important, but
other things in sport are attractive to me to explore, as well,''
said Hixon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the United States Field Hockey
Association, executive director Jane Betts said: ``We certainly
thank Coach Hixon for all her efforts and wish her only the best as
she moves on to handle her developing business interests.'' A
worldwide search is under way for her replacement.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Freeman-Young, of Newton, Mass., has returned
victorious from England, where her team of four Americans won the
Young Cup in tennis. The women, all in the over-40 division,
defeated teams from Canada, Australia, and South Africa on their
way to winning the Cup. The captain of the team was Peggy Michel
Michel, a former doubles' champion at Wimbledon. Also competing in
England was Lillian Peltz Pito from Revere, who played with a team
in the over 45-division for the Margaret Court Cup ... The New
England Blizzard has signed Michelle Campbell as a replacement
player until Kara Wolters returns to the lineup. Campbell, a
graduate of the University of Southern California, played with the
Philadelphia Rage last season. Wolters, who underwent shoulder last
July, is expected to return to practice fulltime by late October.
The Blizzard's first game is Nov. 5 ... The Female Athlete Inc., a
catalog company, is now on the web at www.thefemaleathlete.com ...
Salve Regina University in Newport, R.I., will add women's ice
hockey as a varsity sport in 1999, and is seeking a head coach ...
A traveling mural in honor of the Ivy League's silver anniversary
celebration of women's sports will be on display at Harvard's Murr
Center through Oct. 12.

FIRM FINDS NICHE IN MAPPING DATA FOR CRANBERRY GROWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ore., Wash, Wis., Mich., British Columbia)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAREHAM, Mass._ A part of the Massachusetts landscape since
Colonial times, the business of growing cranberries has in some
ways changed very little since then. But a collaboration between a
cranberry grower and a software consultant is changing that.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when Deborah Burke Beaton first met her husband,
Peter, she was amazed how he carried much of what he knew about his
crops in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Jammed into his brain were all the types of berries that grow on
each of more than 40 properties he owns or manages in nine
southeastern Massachusetts towns, the fertilizers and pest-control
agents that have to be applied to each bog up to 10 times per
season, details about climate and soil conditions and water
chemistry at each location _ the list went on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Being a human database on this scale wasn't easy, said Peter
Beaton, 51, a third-generation cranberry grower. After ``walking
the bogs'' each day, he spent up to three hours each evening making
notes, he said, ``and then I would lose half of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Deborah Beaton, 40, a former research entomologist at the
Lakeville headquarters of Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc.: ``I knew
there had to be an easier way.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was: a customized computer program that links an
off-the-shelf software product, MapInfo, with the database
capabilities of Microsoft's Excel. The result is CranInfo, an
application especially suited to this niche agricultural sector,
which Beaton and her business collaborator, software consultant
Kevin Hanron, 42, plan to begin marketing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have had a place on most farms for years. Dairy
farmers use them to calculate diets for their cows to boost milk
production. Wheat farmers load their hard drives with weather and
climate data, market news, and dozens of other inputs, to build
yields and determine when to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   But with only about 1,000 cranberry growers in the United States
_ about half of them in Massachusetts _ this industry, whose
product is synonymous with Thanksgiving dinner, was an easy one for
larger software developers to overlook or ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, individual growers have explored the field on their own,
often eagerly. One is Gary Garretson, of Carver, also a
third-generation grower, who has installed remote sensors in his
200 acres of bogs to monitor soil and climate conditions as part of
a program to fend off insects and plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Loading this data into a software mapping application called
ArcView, Garretson keeps a running record of his integrated pest
management program, a holistic system that combines use of chemical
and biological agents with ecological techniques, such as the
introduction of bluebirds to eat insect larvae.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Deborah Beaton and Hanron, founder of Charles River
Technologies Inc., a Wellesley consulting firm, who may have done
the most to drag the industry into the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Their story begins with Beaton's earlier introduction to
MapInfo. The software is made by a Troy, N.Y., company of the same
name and was introduced in 1986 as a tool for displaying
demographic data for use in marketing and sales. Its uses have
multiplied since then, including versions that analyze crime data
and select the best sites for cellular telephone antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Beaton had seen MapInfo used by marketers at Ocean Spray, and
she liked how it could superimpose outlines of any shape, from a
house lot to a town boundary, onto existing maps. Even before
meeting Hanron, she used it to draw simple maps that field crews
could use to reach hard-to-find bogs.
</P>
<P>
   But CranInfo's genesis dates to April 1997, when Hanron, who is
MapInfo's New England representative, gave a demonstration that
Deborah Beaton attended at Ocean Spray's offices. Afterward, she
and Hanron talked and agreed on a partnership to develop a
comprehensive software application for cranberry growers.
</P>
<P>
   Beaton and her husband provided the first-hand knowledge about
cranberries; &UR;  &LR; Hanron provided programming skills needed to
customize his product.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a program that displays information on
easy-to-read maps. Printed out, these can be used by a grower or a
field foreman or a helicopter pilot to see what work is needed
where, in detail down to how many pounds of fertilizer to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Beaton and Hanron often worked by trial and error, taking some
wrong turns along the way. One early version was built around the
navigational data that helicopter pilots get from global
positioning satellite receivers aboard their craft.
</P>
<P>
   But when they tried linking cranberry bog maps to this data, the
system couldn't tell whether the longitude and latitude coordinates
were north or south of the equator. ``The bogs ended up in Africa,
not in North America,'' Deborah Beaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, however, CranInfo's bugs were worked out. Now it can
display maps of a wide region, zoom in on local topography, then
focus on a bog as small as a tenth of an acre, smaller than a city
house lot.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the system can display production records for
individual bogs, accounts of past soil treatments, and season-long
work schedules, including amounts of materials needed.
</P>
<P>
   CranInfo so far has five users, including Peter Beaton's
Cranberry Growers Service, which manages bogs owned by absentee
landowners, as well as the family's own cranberry plantings.
</P>
<P>
   That number is expected to grow rapidly as Hanron and Deborah
Beaton begin marketing the product nationwide this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Early publicity in agricultural and software publications has
already prompted inquiries from growers in Oregon, Washington, and
British Columbia, Hanron said. A basic version of CranInfo,
customized for managing about 30 acres of bogs, will cost about
$2,500, he said. At that price, he said, growers with smaller
holdings probably won't find CranInfo worth the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Beaton said helicopter pilots tell her that CranInfo's
most useful feature may be its ability to print a one-page work
order, with a map, that details exactly what they need to do and
where.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to getting their instructions orally or on
hard-to-read hand-drawn maps, the pilots say this order form should
cut down on disputes over whether work was carried out correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' said Gene Ray, a helicopter pilot for Firefly Inc. of
Carver, ``when someone comes in and says, `You screwed up,' you can
pull it out and show them what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Deborah Beaton: ``When this was all written down on the
back of a Dunkin' Donuts bag that later got tossed in a corner of
some pilot's hangar, it wasn't doing anyone any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Garretson said he envisions a time when software will automate
aerial applications. ``Our goal,'' he said, ``is to be able to give
this data to the pilot on a disc'' and then let the GPS guidance
system take over the actual application process.
</P>
<P>
   Growers say it's too early to know whether this technology will
improve profits. But Garretson said he now has more time to begin
overdue renovations on his buildings. Peter Beaton is now spending
some evenings working on a long-postponed plan to replant his bogs
with more productive berry varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Beaton is also glad to have shed the burden of having to know
everything. ``There are limits to how much one can remember,'' he
said.

NO PATRONIZING THESE SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tuesday was a holy day for the Patriots'
coaching staff. It was all Saints day.
</P>
<P>
   While their players basked in the beauty of a crisp and clear
New England fall day, the coaches did what they do every Tuesday.
They turned themselves into 15 mushrooms, surfacing only for a
lunchtime jog (Paul Boudreau, Carl Smith, Steve Walters, Dante
Scarnecchia) or an hourly smoke (Ernie Zampese).
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, Tuesday is the day when the grand plan is laid
out, and nothing changes that. Not bye weeks or fall sunshine or
even baseball playoff games. So Tuesday may have been a high
holiday for Red Sox Nation but it was simply all Saints day for the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   For most of their history, the Saints didn't require much in the
way of preparation. With the exception of the few years Jim Mora
had them in the playoffs, you could put a checkmark by the Saints
on your schedule when it came out and assume that you were
guaranteed at least one victory. In some seasons, half a day might
have been enough preparation if you had the Saints marching in.
</P>
<P>
   But this year they are 3-0 and tied with the San Francisco 49ers
atop the NFC West. Admittedly, those victories came against a
less-than-fearsome collection of opponents (St. Louis, Carolina,
and Indianapolis) that is at the moment an aggregate 1-10, but
coaches worry a lot. So while most of New England frets about the
Red Sox, Pete Carroll and his staff fret about the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell is not a worrier by nature
but he spent a dozen hours studying a quarterback named Danny
Wuerffel who can't throw but always seems to win and Wuerffel's
favorite targets, Andre Hastings, Sean Dawkins, and rookie tight
end Cameron Cleeland, who has played like a guy who wants to become
famous for something more than being hit in the face with a sock
full of nickels.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell and his assistants worried about a running back named
Lamar Smith who is six months removed from spending evenings in a
jail cell, and they worried about a young, aggressive offensive
line anchored by an All-Pro left tackle named Willie Roaf and
bookend guards the size of the anchor on an ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, they had formulated their plan and met with Carroll
in a stuffy office without windows. This was just about the time Mo
Vaughn was blasting a three-run homer to put the Red Sox on top of
the Cleveland Indians, 3-0, in the first inning. All of New England
saw that blast or at least heard Jerry Trupiano's ``Way back!'' _
all except the 15 worriers in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, offensive coordinator Zampese worried, too, but
that's his nature when he's preparing his quick-passing game for a
bombing run. This day, he had more than usual to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, he had to worry about Joe Johnson, a
defensive lineman who said all summer he wouldn't play for the
Saints but finally showed up and is playing like the devil.
</P>
<P>
   And he worried about a longtime quarterback-destroyer named
Wayne Martin who is now working from the tackle position, and a new
quarterback-killer named La'Roi Glover who was rejected by the
Oakland Raiders three years ago and now is looking like a star on
the rise with a team-leading four sacks. Glover's presence in the
Saints' lineup and not the Raiders' says as much about Oakland's
present predicament as it does about New Orleans's sudden success.
</P>
<P>
   When Boudreau, New England's line coach, and Zampese finished
figuring out how to arrange pass-protection schemes, Zampese moved
on to mobile linebackers like Kevin Mitchell and Keith Mitchell
without listening to Joni Mitchell in the background as mood music.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Zampese got to the people he most wants to beat this
Sunday. He got to a headhunting safety named Chad Cota, who likes
knockouts more than Mike Tyson does, and a cornerback Carroll is
familiar with named Tyronne Drakeford, who played for Carroll in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, they all worried together about Mike Ditka
because after a slow start last season, it seems he may have found
his coaching sea legs again. Somehow Ditka has gotten the hapless
Saints afloat and playing Bears-style football, which means alley
cat football. Even though no one is ready to say these Saints
resemble Da Bears of 1985, they're 3-0 on the schedule and hence a
source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saints have found the formula of playing good defense,
running the ball, and controlling their turnovers,'' Carroll said.
``That's how they're winning. Ditka has chosen players that
complement his approach. He's got real attitude guys.''
</P>
<P>
   As in bad attitude guys. Guys who come to play with bad
intentions. Guys who make football coaches worry even on the most
beautiful of days.
</P>
<P>
   What the worriers in Foxborough understood by the end of all
Saints day was that New Orleans is a team that is young and fast
and aggressive and hasn't been taught yet where its place is. These
Saints really believe they are a 3-0 team, which, if true, would
make them a playoff team, which, if true, would make Ditka not only
a Saint but also a miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next month, these Saints may again become the Aints
after playing New England, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Tampa Bay,
because those opponents will tell them more than the Rams,
Panthers, and Colts have. Knowing that, on a beautiful fall day
made not for sitting in a darkened coaches room but for sitting
outside with a portable radio listening to the Red Sox, the
worriers who work for Carroll labored to become the first team to
ruin the Saints' self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell and his staff assembled attack plans, deciding just how
much pressure it would take to snap young Wuerffel. Zampese went
over his list of pass plays short and long before presenting his
ideas to Carroll on just how many throws it would take to blow the
roof off the Saints' undefeated defense if not the Superdome
itself.

   It was a busy day on a beautiful day spent studying a team they
knew little about. It was the kind of day understood by no one but
the 15 men locked in tiny offices at Foxboro Stadium, living in a

<P>
   It may have been a glorious Tuesday in New England and a
glorious playoff day in Cleveland, but it was all Saints day in
Foxborough.

 UNDATED: ... fairly quickly.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The rules are wrong,'' says SeaWeb's Spruill. She agrees that
the fishermen are complying, but she calls the present regulations
``woefully inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what?'' says Beideman. ``They are right. And we agree
with them that more needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lent says that at international meetings, US fishermen are
``calling for quota cuts to rebuild the fisheries'' and have agreed
to a 10-year plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which is in draft
form. Quotas are way down, she says, but they'll ``cut quotas
further in order to get (stocks rebuilt) in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that when a nation goes over its quotas, no
punitive measures are taken. ``When a foreign country overfishes,''
suggests Beideman, &UR;  &LR; ``we should not accept that fish in our
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The international governing body for swordfish, ICCAT, sent
warning letters to 23 nations that haven't complied with the
quotas, including nonmembers Taiwan, Chile, Costa Rica, and
Ecuador. Many point to Spain, an ICCAT member and the largest
harvester of swordfish in the world. Coincidentally, ICCAT's
headquarters are in Madrid. In addition to the letters, Lent says,
quotas have to be checked again and again, so a threat of trade
sanctions would probably have swifter results.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 275 restaurants, mostly on the East Coast, are
participating in the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Former Boston restaurateur Jasper White, now the consulting chef
for Legal Sea Foods, initially supported the campaign but says he
is no longer doing so. ``It's having a really bad effect on the
fishermen,'' he says. ``Chefs in New York don't live here.
Swordfishermen are our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz, Legal's owner, did not boycott swordfish and insists
that ``we never carried pups (juveniles). If one thing comes out of
this, &UR;  &LR; it's that no one should be taking pups for whatever
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average size caught today is 90 pounds,'' says SeaWeb's
Spruill. The females are too immature to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what worries Sam Hayward, co-owner of Fore Street
in Portland, Maine, where the menu is 60 percent fish. ``I'm part
of a community that includes the New England fishing community,''
he says, ``but pups are being killed even if they're not being
landed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen's advocate Beideman suggests consumers only buy
swordfish caught by US, Canadian, or Japanese fishermen, the three
countries he considers most responsible about quotas and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   For Wojtasinski, the wholesaler, the simple profile of a New
Bedford fisherman from whom he buys swordfish brings the issue to
life. ``He's 1,500 miles from home in a 68-foot boat,'' says
Wojtasinski. ``It takes three days each way, he fishes for 20 days
while the hurricanes go by. Then he comes in,'' after almost a
month at sea with a full catch. ``He loads 10,000 gallons of fuel,
a month's worth of groceries, and ice. And he turns around. The
risks are very, very high in October. Boats do it because they'll
survive another year. It forces people to take chances they might
not ordinarily take.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody's not equally conserving,'' says Wojtasinski,
``other fishermen from other countries will benefit. The fish are
going to be caught. Trust me.''

SWORDFISH WITH LATE-HARVEST TOMATO COMPOTE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As long as tomatoes are still ripening on the vine and the frost
hasn't hit, you can make this late-harvest tomato compote, in which
cherry tomatoes are sauteed with plum tomatoes until the two
collapse. The compote cooks while the swordfish broils, so the
assembly takes about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds thickly cut fresh swordfish, cut into 4 even-sized
pieces
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil, for fish and tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pint cherry tomatoes, stemmed but left whole
</P>
<P>
   3 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and cut into thick strips
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground allspice or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground coriander or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of cayenne pepper or to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped mixed herbs (thyme, oregano, rosemary)
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the broiler. Rub the bottom of a stainless broiler pan
with oil and set in the pieces of swordfish.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle them with oil, salt, and pepper. Slide them under the
broiler and cook them, without turning, for 10 minutes or until the
top is lightly browned and the fish is cooked through. (The
10-minute cooking time only applies to thickly cut fish; if it is
thinly cut, 5 to 8 minutes may do.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pour enough oil into a large cast-iron or other
heavy-based skillet to make a very thin film. Heat the oil until it
is very hot, then add the cherry tomatoes and plum tomatoes. Saute,
stirring constantly, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the cherry
tomatoes collapse into the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Add the allspice, coriander, cayenne, chopped herbs, salt, and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange 1 piece of fish on each of 4 dinner plates. Spoon the
tomato compote directly onto the fish and sprinkle each serving
with lemon juice. Serve at once with steamed red potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

HISTORIC HUDSON RIVER ENJOYS CLEANER TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ While the early-morning mists still shrouded
the Hudson River far below, a wave of gray cadets silently passed
by Taylor Hall on the way to classes.
</P>
<P>
   Unsmiling, moving at a uniform speed, with only a word or two
spoken for every dozen that passed. It's odd to think of them as
teen-agers with the solemn bearing of men and women three times
their age.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from the river, the military academy at West Point is
first an imposing citadel resting on bedrock at the lower river's
narrowest point. Here the Hudson takes a sharp turn where British
sailing ships of war could not hold the wind. A critical strategic
position that with the addition of a famous linked chain across the
river in all likelihood saved our War of Independence. Such is the
importance of the Hudson River to our nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The promontory view from West Point looking upriver and across
to the equally high bluffs of Constitution Island is the most
breathtaking on the river. In the lightening gloom of early
morning, it is the stuff of goose bumps and poetic description.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cole, founding of the Hudson River school of painting
(his Catskill home and studio were just a short walk from the
river), was also struck by the Hudson at first light. ``The mists
were resting on the vale of the Hudson like drifted snow.''
</P>
<P>
   But much can be hidden by a romantic misty vale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were kids, we'd go up to Tompkins Cove,'' white-haired
Daniel Donnelly said, pointing a little downriver from our berth at
the Garrison Yacht Club, which is directly across the river from
West Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were swimming in human excrement,'' he said, wrinkling his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, in a starched white shirt, tie, and striped suit
pants, is a lawyer who specializes in aviation law and his offices
are a hundred yards from the riverbank. He was there discussing a
case with another lawyer, Robert Murphy, wearing an almost
identical uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Columbia University in the '70s, Murphy said with a
smile, ``and played baseball there. I remember watching the crews
down below in the river rowing away. They had to be careful because
if they fell in they had to take a chemical bath.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Donnelly, Dan's wife and secretary, later said that those
same crews that fell in were required to take antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the years just before the effects of Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller's $1 billion Pure Waters Bond Act of 1965 kicked in
were the river's lowest ebb relating to water quality. Bond act
money and the resolve of genuine Hudson River heroes like Bob
Boyle, John Cronin and the Hudson River Valley Greenway began to
turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   The ``river that flows both ways'' is now cleaner than it's been
in more than a century, but still is not where it needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no sheen of oil on the water, or odd slick on the
shore left by the tide as there was even a decade ago. Swimming in
the Hudson may not be as dramatic as it once was, but it's a lot
safer and more fun.

POLLUTION FLOWS AT US-MEXICO BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AGUSTIN, Mexico _ Some &UR;  &LR; nights the stench of sewage and
chemicals from the canal running through this dusty border town is
so nauseating that Manuel Robles and his family cannot sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all kinds of dead fish in there,'' Robles, 57, a
teacher-turned-environmental activist, said of the leather-colored
water that flows swiftly from the factories and neighborhoods of
Ciudad Juarez, about 15 miles away. ``Government people come here
and talk about cleaning it up. But it's still here, where everybody
can smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of environmental problem that government
officials in Washington and Mexico City promised to address five
years ago when they were promoting the idea of a North American
Free Trade Agreement among Mexico, Canada, and the United States.
To prove their commitment to clean up the border, negotiators
signed a separate environmental agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But along this stretch of the Rio Grande and through most of the
2,000-mile US-Mexico border, it is hard to find much improvement.
Instead, several residents, activists, and government specialists
acknowledge that in many ways the border is worse off today than it
was before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I'd say the promises made for cleaning up the area
have not been fulfilled, and one area that has really suffered has
been the area around Juarez,'' said Richard Boren, 41, coordinator
of the Southwest Toxic Watch, an environmental group based in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt NAFTA has brought more economic activity to
Mexico, even from faraway places like Massachusetts. Last year Bay
State exports to this country rose to more than $440 million, up 33
percent since 1993, the year before NAFTA went into effect,
according to a report prepared by the Washington-based Trade
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious sign of the new business wave is among the new
factories owned by or performing work for US corporations. Known by
their Spanish name, ``maquiladoras,'' these factories benefit from
cheaper labor costs and provide jobs for thousands of Mexican
citizens. Although these ``twin plants'' existed long before NAFTA,
their popularity with multinational corporations has spawned
hundreds of facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But their explosive growth, along with the arrival of thousands
of new immigrants to the border region looking for jobs, has hurt
an environment that was, by most assessments, damaged before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA proponents argued that the agreement would encourage more
companies to build these assembly plants in Mexico's interior. But
largely because of its proximity to the United States, where the
finished products are sent, the border has absorbed most of the new
maquiladora construction.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-mile border area holds about two-thirds of Mexico's
4,010 maquiladoras, according to figures from the country's
commerce and industrial agency. The remaining third are in interior
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ciudad Juarez, for example, is Mexico's fourth-largest city with
a population of about 2 million people and sits adjacent El Paso,
Texas. The city is home to about a quarter of Mexico's
NAFTA-related factories, but it still does not have a water and
sewage treatment system.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's raw sewage and runoff from the factories flow
into six open canals. It is believed another 50 million gallons of
untreated waste is dumped every &UR;  &LR; day into the Rio Grande.
Government officials say plans for a new treatment plant
were &UR;  &LR; approved four years ago, but were postponed because of the
economic crisis that hit the country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A design for a $30 million plant has just been approved. But one
local government administrator, mindful that the Mexican peso again
has shown signs of volatility, wonders whether history might repeat
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy if we have to cut the budget again and
stop this project,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We're at the mercy of our peso, but I don't know how
much longer people can wait for clean water.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also said the two agencies created by NAFTA to develop
more binational cleanup projects have done little to help. The
Border Environment Cooperation Commission, which is headquartered
in Juarez, Mexico, has been slow to approve initiatives. Meanwhile,
the Texas-based North American Development Bank, which is run by
Treasury officials of both nations, has been hamstrung by internal
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at both agencies insist that more cleanup projects
are on the way. Eleven environmental initiatives totaling $3
billion _ most of them for waste and water treatment _ have secured
financing or are already under construction, according to NADBank
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand people's desires to see things done quickly, but
we'd rather see projects that are planned and built carefully,''
said Linda Taylor, a New Mexico environmentalist and member of the
BECC board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say the border environment has worsened,
especially with the maquiladoras, but I think there'll be
improvement in the future,'' she added, referring to 23 projects
the commission has certified.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA supporters also said tougher environmental laws that took
effect with the agreement have helped improve some border
communities. In Matamoros, a Mexican town across the bridge from
Brownsville, Texas, an area once dubbed ``Chemical Row'' has
improved gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing outrage from activists and community leaders, the
area's worst polluters were driven out and many remaining companies
have installed their own treatment systems. Even some of the newer
factories in Juarez have new recycling programs and are teaching
employees better ways to dispose of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the problems along this corner of the border appear to
outnumber the solutions. There is the electrical substation outside
El Porvenir, Mexico, where drums of toxic fluids and old
transformers sit unwatched near a residential neighborhood. There
is the landfill in Sunland Park, N.M., only a few miles from the
border, where residents say dumping goes unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the danger, many residents say, that this part of
the border is drawing more waste rather than eliminating it.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca, Texas, a sleepy town of 700 residents that lies
in a desert valley 80 miles east of El Paso, is home to the
nation's largest sludge dump. About 250 tons of waste arrive almost
daily by train, much of it from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the area's dry terrain, Texas has also proposed a
low-level radioactive waste site 5 miles away, 15 miles from the
Mexican border. The waste would come from Texas, Vermont, and
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the planned waste site say the dump will not harm
the environment. But opponents say the site lies near an earthquake
fault line and that its presence would reinforce the idea that
poorer and mostly Hispanic border residents can be exposed to such
a risk.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has drawn together an unusual alliance of Mexican
and US residents in opposition to the project, which has been
approved by Congress and is awaiting final word from President
Clinton and the Texas Legislature.

<P>
   The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission will make
its final decision on the waste dump on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Mexican government officials had offered only
minor resistance to the proposal. But earlier this month, Mexico's
environmental secretary, Julia Carabias, asked US officials to
reconsider the site's location.
</P>
<P>
   That is little comfort to Robles, the environmental activist,
who still runs San Agustin's only library and museum, even though
his government pay was cut off in February. He believes the act was
in retaliation by local government officials angry with his work
with the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole area is like one human body,'' Robles said while
moving along the foul-smelling canal. ``The parts of this body are
getting sicker. And unless something happens soon, the whole
beautiful body will suffer terribly.''

WARM DEBUT FOR PREVIN'S `STREETCAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By R.M. CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Part of the excitement of opera in
turn-of-the-century America is the increasing abundance of new work
to be seen, to be heard, to be digested.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is doing it, in one form or another, but few premieres
have had the sex appeal of Tennessee Williams' ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' set to music by Andre Previn at San Francisco Opera this
month.
</P>
<P>
   With the vivid personalities the playwright conjured up for his
play _ two of whom are virtual icons in America's theatrical
imagination _ the smoky, heat-filled ambience of New Orleans and
the tragic pull of the narrative, the play is a natural for lyric
muse. And while ballets have been based on the Williams text, no
one attempted an opera until Previn.
</P>
<P>
   Some have called Previn's opera the best in more than two
decades, while others have decried its too-free adaptation of mixed
musical sources and lack of Southern verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a weak second act that just trips along, anxious to
keep up with the flow of Williams' words, the opera has a firm grip
on our consciousness with telling characterizations, a score that
punctuates with color and exclamation points and moments of stark
horror and sadness. Previn gives Blanche all the arias the deluded
lady of the Old South could ever want, but none to Stanley because
the composer thought the rough and tumble guy wasn't the sort to
sing arias. Previn is sparse with duets, curiously, but those few
work with surprising power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Previn has written an opera that sits nicely in the ear.
It can move speedily along, but then slow down to savor the moment.
The composer has taken our pluralistic age at its word and borrowed
from many, including two 20th-century Russians, Prokofiev and
Shostakovich, bits of Richard Strauss and occasional hints of jazz,
not well played by the orchestra. On occasion, Previn stoops to
movie music cliches. Philip Littell's libretto is faithful to
Williams' text, but does not illuminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yeargan's set _ the Kowalskis' two-room apartment evokes
the French Quarter deftly. For variety, it revolves. Thomas J.
Munn's lighting design is equally effective.
</P>
<P>
   One could not ask for a better cast: Renee Fleming as Blanche;
Rodney Gilfry, Stanley; Elizabeth Futral, Stella; and Anthony Dean
Griffey, Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's Blanche sits at the very heart of the opera. She is
given a good share of the best, the most poetic music, which she
delivers with eloquence. Admittedly, she is neither Jessica Tandy,
who created the role on Broadway, nor Vivian Leigh, who appeared in
the movie, but she sings with beauty of tone and acts in an
appealing manner.
</P>
<P>
   Gilfry looks like a Stanley, big and muscular and brash. He has
a strong stage presence, full of masculine pride and threatening
gestures. But he is given little to do vocally. Futral has a sweet
soprano and a sweet, loving presence, which makes her a good
counterpoint to her older sister, Blanche, and her husband,
Stanley. Griffey makes for a pitiful, and well-sung, Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable criticism on how well the opera, and
the accents of its principal characters, suggest the South. On that
subject, I cannot offer an opinion. But I did ask the opinion of
the music critic for the Times-Picayune, New Orleans' leading
newspaper, at the performance. He said he thought the negative
comments were not justified.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, conducted by Previn, was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini's ``Turandot'' formally opened the season earlier this
month. The production, designed by David Hockney, became celebrated
the moment of its premiere five years ago at Lyric Opera of
Chicago, a co-producer with San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The English artist is no stranger to the theater, having
designed a number of operas since his first, a wondrous ``Magic
Flute'' in 1978 for Glyndebourne Festival. I have seen a good share
of them in various places, and none follows a formula. Always, a
seemingly wild, but in fact calculated, imagination rules.
Convention is thrown out and invention summoned.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Turandot,'' the expected is banished. Hockney's line is
long and sweeping in the first act and elusive in the third. His
palette is vivid, electric, almost overwhelming. Chinese reds at
their most intense are paired with unlikely blues and purples to
create stirring sensations, while gold and celadon are joined for a
softer but no less striking contrast.
</P>
<P>
   All of Hockney's visual genius is joined by Ian Falconer's bold
costumes that equally dispense with the ordinary, however opulent,
and Munn's superb lighting design.
</P>
<P>
   The production is so strong, the musical forces seem less
important. In San Francisco, they were. The cast was strong but not
subtle. The German soprano Gabriele Schnaut sang the title role.
With her voice, she is a steamroller that always can be heard
despite competition from a big orchestra and chorus. She can sing
softly, but rarely did. The Canadian tenor Richard Margison sang
the role of Calaf with equal heft, but little grace in his musical
phrasing. The Slovakian soprano Andrea Dankova was a tender Liu.
The Ping, Pang and Pong of Earle Patriarco, Dennis Petersen and
Matthew Lord were terrific. Marco Armiliato, from Genoa, conducted
vigorously, and stage director Garnett Bruce moved people around
with alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabella,'' also being performed this season, was the last
collaboration between Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. It
is a cream puff of an opera, at once elegant, amusing and happy.
While it is one of Hofmannsthal's finest creations, it is not one
of Strauss'. In spite of dry patches, it has much memorable music:
Strauss at his most sublimely lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has done the opera once before, in 1980, with Kiri
Te Kanawa in the title role. She was at her best, beautiful and
persuasive, the music pouring out of her in long, seamless phrases.
Janice Watson, an English soprano, is not Kanawa's equal, but she
has a handsome voice and stylish manner. Mary Mills was all fervent
charm as Arabella's younger sister, Zdenka.
</P>
<P>
   Mandryka, the Croatian landowner who loves Arabella as she does
him, was sung by the noted German bass-baritone Franz Grundheber.
His voice is more gritty than beautiful, thus right for the part.
More important is his singing, which was impassioned and
intelligent. The rest of the cast did their parts well, and
Scottish conductor Donald Runnicles, music director of San
Francisco Opera since 1992, gave life and energy to the whole
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The production from Covent Garden looks good and suits the
period. David Edwards directed with sympathy and attention to
detail.

struggling valiantly to cope with an AIDS epidemic that has
infected 20 percent of its population, desperate Ugandans clamor to
participate in an AIDS vaccine trial. In the past, ethical
guidelines have made it clear that vaccines should be tested where
health care is excellent before they are ever used in places
without a safety net, like Uganda. Now, for the first time, the
international medical community has set aside that requirement.
``We are the people with the problem. Why should Americans
undertake risky research on themselves for a problem they don't

   LENDING-SLOWDOWN (Undated) _ The United States is starting to
feel the effects of a lending pullback. The pinch, still quite
mild, is almost entirely on businesses, not consumers. Commercial
banks, investment firms, Japanese banks that lend in America and
the millions of people who purchase corporate bonds are all
becoming a bit more tight-fisted _ demanding slightly higher
interest rates, and sometimes refusing to lend as much as before.
The caution predates the Russian debacle, where some of the world's

strengthened the resolve to filter out potential deadbeats. And the
near collapse of Long-Term Capital has added to the nervousness
about lending. By Louis Uchitelle.

<HEADLINE>
HAPPY HOUR + ALARM EMERGENCY! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It could have happened to anybody whose husband came
home a little late from happy hour and tried to set the burglar
alarm for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The siren was blasting, the dog was barking. The phone started
to ring shrilly, and in 15 seconds, our peaceful little house had
been transformed into a commercial for Valium. My husband was
stationed in front of the burglar alarm, desperately trying to
punch in numbers to turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you eat bread before you went to happy hour?'' I shouted.
``You know you can't go to happy hour on an empty stomach! The last
time you came home like this, you were determined to write an
off-Broadway production based on the Foreigner greatest-hits
album!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You said it was OK because we had a designated driver!'' he
shouted from the laundry room. ``And that play would have totally
worked! I AM the Dirty White Boy!''
</P>
<P>
   The phone kept screaming as I ran from the bathroom to answer
it. I had been getting ready for bed when calamity erupted. I
sprinted to the phone as quickly as I could, dodging our dog, which
consistently kept trying to leap into my arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the security company calling,'' the voice on the other
end said. ``Your alarm is on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I'm sorry,'' I replied. ``My husband can't shut it
off! Get off my back, would you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me?'' the security lady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' I hastily answered. ``I'm talking to my dog!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a false alarm?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I told her. ``Leave me alone!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' I said. ``My dog. Everything's fine, really!''
</P>
<P>
   BANG! Our front door shook. BANG! BANG! BANG!
</P>
<P>
   ``I need your security code, please,'' the lady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um,'' I said, trying to think. ``It's my nephew's birthday!
Wait, it's our anniversary! No, I think it's my body-fat ratio!''
</P>
<P>
   BANG! BANG! BANG! The front door shook again, as my dog whined
and scrambled to hide under the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on,'' I said, putting down the phone to answer the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``POLICE!! OPEN UP!!'' I heard from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   I opened the door and saw two uniformed officers on my porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's fine,'' I told them. ``My husband tried to set
the alarm on an empty stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see some ID,'' the first policeman said, looking at
me curiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``AHH!'' my husband screamed from the back of the house. ``I'm
going to KILL this thing! I'm gonna tear you apart with my bare
hands!''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled quickly. ``He's talking to the alarm,'' I said
nonchalantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!'' my husband yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' I yelled, running into the kitchen, ``the police are
here! Shut up!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding!'' he said in shock. ``Are we on ``COPS''? They
don't have cameras, do they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT?'' I said, becoming frustrated. ``No, we're not on
``COPS''!
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' he replied. ``You're not wearing a bra under your
shirt!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big deal,'' I said, getting more flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or pants!'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just how much did you drink?'' I asked before I looked down
and gasped. No pants. Only underwear, of the brief style, which had
turned a dingy kind of gray when I had washed them with new black
tights, and, thankfully, a rather long T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I'm married. I chew with my mouth open. I don't close the door
when I go to the bathroom. I stopped shaving the day after my
wedding. What do I need fancy underwear for? There's no one left to
impress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me your shorts!'' I demanded, pointing to my husband's
boxers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll be naked!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am,'' the policeman called from the living room, ``I need
to see some ID!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are so selfish!'' I hissed to my husband. ``I have an
Emotional Injury Journal from the ``Oprah'' show and I am going to
write this down in it, you know!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're injured, ma'am?'' the policeman called. ``Do you want
us to call an ambulance?''
</P>
<P>
   I pulled my T-shirt down as far as I could and went back into
the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied, ``I'm going back into therapy tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   I flipped through my wallet and found my driver's license and,
miraculously, the security code written on a card. I picked up the
phone, still resting patiently on the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' I said to the security lady. ``The code isn't my
nephew's birthday. It's my husband's blood alcohol level.''
</P>
<P>
   I handed my ID to the policeman, who was now standing in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have eaten some bread,'' the lady replied. ``Make
sure you note this in your ``Oprah'' journal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pen is in hand, sister,'' I replied before hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the alarm stopped screaming. The cop handed back my
license.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look much different in that picture,'' he mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was a long time ago,'' I said wearily. ``I wore
makeup, practiced hygiene and had fancy underwear then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And probably pants,'' he added, smirking. ``Expect to get a
letter from the police department in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the pants?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the false alarm,'' he informed me as he turned and walked
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it with these women?'' I heard him say to his partner
as they walked down the steps of the porch. ``They get a ring, a
handful of empty promises and then throw away all of their
razors?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shaved off enough body hair before I got married to carpet
my whole house!'' I called after them. ``I deserve this!''
</P>
<P>
   I saw my husband secretly trying to creep into the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mr. Magoo!'' I called. ``From now on, if you go to happy
hour, you are not allowed to touch anything when you come home that
blinks or is plugged in!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we in trouble?'' he mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet. They're going to send us a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Urgent! Urgent!'' I heard my husband sing as he began to
struggle with another electric appliance. ``Emergency! Wait and see
how urgent our love can be . . . It's urgent urgent urgent urgent
urgent . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll set the alarm clock, Juke Box Hero,'' I offered. &QL;

   UNDATED _ ``Felicity,'' which debuted this week on the WB
network and is one of the few series to appear in The Wall Street
Journal and that other journal of pop-cultural analysis, Seventeen,
before it even generates a rating point, earns its hype. It does so
not just for going against the grain but, based on a well-crafted,
crisply written, engaging pilot by filmmaker J.J. Abrams
(''Armageddon''), for being intellectually delicious. By KEN PARISH

   UNDATED _ Fifty years ago this week, movie screens in this neck
of the woods offered such new films as ``Homecoming,'' with Clark
Gable and Lana Turner, at the Belknap Drive-In and ``Green Grass of
Wyoming'' (Charles Coburn) at the Hollywood Theater in downtown
Fort Worth. But the real news was on the small screen, which made

all, writes about life out west, not the Lutherans in Lake Wobegon
who populate Keillor's ``A Prairie Home Companion.'' But as it
turns out, the poet/singer/songwriter and chronicler of life on the
range may well be on the way to creating the western equivalent of
Keillor's imaginary radio world at his own broadcast bunkhouse, the
syndicated ``Cowboy Corner.'' About 120 stations from New York
state to Canada's western provinces carry the hourlong program,
which Steagall launched nearly five years ago. By JOHN AUSTIN.

   UNDATED _ I started out in the newspaper business as a
sportswriter. My career goal was to cover major-league baseball, to
travel from city to city with the St. Louis Cardinals. Thank
goodness I was a lousy baseball writer. Consider this an official
tip of the cap to baseball writers, baseball players, baseball
groupies and all other individuals who spend days and weeks on the
road in pursuit of their livelihoods or hobbies. I just came off an
18-day road trip; I'm exhausted and disoriented, not to mention
dazed and confused. By BILL THOMPSON. Story will move in ``k''

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well, not only in the
many new start-ups spawned by the revved-up economy, but inside
corporate America. The New York Times examines this attitude in
ENTREPRENEURS, a special news section filled with instructive
stories on ventures that worked _ and some that didn't _ along with
information useful to anyone interested in enterprise, no matter
what the scale.
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   A selection of these articles -- plus art -- is available for
one-shot purchase from The New York Times Syndicate! These topnotch
features can be a platform for your own special entrepreneur
supplement. (What a great way to please both advertisers and
readers in your area!)
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   As you'll see, ENTREPRENEURS explores a range of topics,
everything from the financial and management challenges facing
company owners and managers to reflections on the culture of
self-employment.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

</P>
<P>
   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   Donald Katz, the 46-year-old author of three highly acclaimed
nonfiction books, is a rather unlikely entrepreneur. His
three-year-old Internet start-up, Audible Inc., offers custom audio
information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices
you can listen to any time and anywhere, say, while jogging or
driving to work. Tom Redburn, the business enterprise editor for
The New York Times, interviews Katz, whose experiences provide
insight into the obstacles and confusions that arise when
nonbusiness types go into business in a big way. Redburn has
written for The International Herald Tribune and the Los Angeles
Times.

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down
vertical surfaces. The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come
up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a
staff writer for The Times.

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1996), attempts to answer this question in this

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1996), attempts to answer this question in this

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well, not only in the
many new start-ups spawned by the revved-up economy, but inside
corporate America. The New York Times examines this attitude in
ENTREPRENEURS, a special news section filled with instructive
stories on ventures that worked _ and some that didn't _ along with
information useful to anyone interested in enterprise, no matter
what the scale.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

three-year-old Internet start-up, Audible Inc., offers custom audio
information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices
you can listen to any time and anywhere, say, while jogging or

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down
vertical surfaces. The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come
up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

ALICE'S WONDERLAND: Q&AMP;A WITH THE EARTH MOTHER OF ORGANIC FOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the gospel according to Alice Waters, food is the way.
</P>
<P>
   It sustains not only the body, but also the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Verily, it is the glue that binds together the family, society,
civilization and the life of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it a little ironic that the 54-year-old Waters _
founder of the landmark Chez Panisse Restaurant in Berkeley,
Calif., author of five books, earth mother to a generation of
organic foodies _ was in Dallas last week for the 10th American
Airlines Chefs Conclave, a meeting of 15 premier chefs who gather
yearly to talk about ways to improve ... airline food.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters? Airline food?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to influence 196,000 travelers a day,'' she said.
``Some of the things I was preaching to them years ago, they are
now doing. They are using more fresh fruit and vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   A petite woman with bobbed red hair and scant if any makeup, she
floats into the room like an Oriental monk. She is attired in
comfortable peasant slacks. Black. Simple tunic. Black. Simple
sandals. Black.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles serenely before she begins heaving with a deep,
hacking cough. It's a little bug she picked up in Paris (the one in
France).
</P>
<P>
   She was there negotiating for a new restaurant she has been
invited to open at the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   It's something that's liable to start another French Revolution.
Imagine, not just a woman (!), but an American (!) from California
(!) with no formal culinary training (!) setting up shop at the
Louvre (!).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the talking stage,'' she said, but the talk is
``serious.'' In any case, it's a couple of years away.
</P>
<P>
   She's also got another book in the works, the Chez Panisse Cafe
cookbook, due out in fall 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While she was in town, we took the opportunity to chat about
organic food, the future of the planet _ and the one and only time
Alice Waters ate at McDonald's:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is food in America headed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think people know that something is wrong. Some foods are
making people sick and unhappy. They are looking for something that
makes them feel good and that tastes good and happens to be good
for them. They are looking for that, and there's a much bigger
picture: They are looking for nourishment and spiritual
nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you see the movement toward healthy and organic food
continuing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it is a delicious revolution that is happening
because when people get connected with food that really tastes good
and that's good for them, then that lasts. That's something that is
deeply planted inside them, and it's what their body wants. It's
about the quality of your life, because when you buy food from a
farmers market, it's a social event, and eating around a table is a
social gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make it sound like a religious experience. Like taking
Communion.
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course it is. It brings meaning into your everyday life to
sit at a table and to talk with your friends and your family and to
eat something that's good and to participate in the cooking. You
know, 85 percent of the kids in this country do not have one meal a
day with their family. Now that's a terrible thing. We are in
danger of losing our culture.
</P>
<P>
   Food is about everything. That's the message. It's the
relationship to agriculture, to family, to everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We've gotten away from that. How do we get back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once you give people things that were picked when they are
alive, when they are completely ripe ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who has the time?
</P>
<P>
   A: People have to start to make time. Bringing people into the
circumstance of a farmers market is very seductive, and I feel like
we have to think about what is locally grown, what is seasonally
ripe, and we have to focus on that first. It leads us to the people
that care about our nourishment, and the people who care about the
land. We aren't led to the manufacturers who care about making
money on bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Eating fresh and organic produce is probably easier in
California.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is, but it's a matter of focus. It's a matter of
planning ahead and thinking about what's available. Lots of things
grow in the colder places, too. You can do it anywhere. You just
have to focus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The push in recent years has been to more convenience foods.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have to understand that convenience is not what we're
after.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did we go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's because of the way that food is distributed. It's the
television, it's the deep freeze, the transportation, it's the
shipping things from one country to another. It has taken away from
seasonality. We don't know what fresh is anymore. We don't know
what ripe is anymore. We sort of eat these mediocre fruits and
vegetables all year long instead of waiting for when they are
really ripe and special.
</P>
<P>
   And this consumerism _ we feel like everything has to get bigger
and better and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   It's about understanding where the meaning and the value is. I'm
not ready to go back into a hut, or grow everything myself. There
have been incredible advances in agriculture that could change the
deserts into gardens of Eden. We need to teach people about
farming. Everybody needs to know how important farming is.
Corporate farms are about profit, and we have to treasure these
farmers who are doing it the right way, and to encourage young
people to be farmers. We have to give it more status and
appreciation and offer them more money for doing what they are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can you turn people from the dark side?
</P>
<P>
   A: Through food. People have to get involved in shelling the
peas. The pleasure is in the doing. If I didn't shell the pea, I
can't appreciate what that is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you a zealot?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm in the lunatic fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you happy?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm very, very overworked right now because I can't say no,
and that's a big problem. I have to think about how to do this,
because my life is going to fall apart unless I can learn to say
no. I can't resist the opportunity to talk about this. I want to
talk to the biggest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tell us about the restaurant at the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think it would be like Chez Panisse. I would want it
to express almost in a didactic way this philosophy, and that maybe
we should think of it as art in the form of a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking of going to work with a Japanese designer who
could, you know, short of having a cow in there and milking it,
have a way that people interacted with food, that they understood
where it came from and how important it is to take care of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Eating is an agricultural act. You do more by eating than just
nourishing yourself. You are really taking care of the planet, and
you are thinking about the future for our kids.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A prized publisher
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The Lufkin Daily News has dedicated a new
flagpole in memory of Thomas R. Meredith, complete with a granite
marker that notes his tenure as publisher, 1965-78.
</P>
<P>
   Tom was a young man in his mid-30s when he was named to head up
the newspaper by its new owners, the Fentress group, headquartered
in Waco, where Tom grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Up until then, the Lufkin paper had been controlled by the
powers-that-be locally, same folks who owned the biggest bank, the
TV-radio station, the paper mill, sawmill, foundry and most
everything else worth having hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   When the patriarch, Ernest L. Kurth Sr., died, his heirs began
selling off holdings in order to deal with the death taxes. The
newspaper, which had never been all that profitable, was among the
first to go.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the old owners had sold the paper, cashed the checks
and spent the money, some of them seemed still of a mind that they
had a right to run the paper, same as they always had.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to run Tom Meredith. When that didn't work, they
tried to run him out of town. That didn't work either.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco headquarters backed him all the way, despite anonymous
hate letters, boycotts and other threats of economic reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Meredith, a good newspaperman and a good manager, made the
Lufkin newspaper into a money-maker. He later showed me a note he
had received from the president of the company after his first
successful year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve a fanfare of no less than 76 trombones,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd have put it closer to 76,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tom named me editor of my hometown newspaper when I was 28 years
old. He'd been impressed by stories I'd been writing as
correspondent for the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the story in my paper and it gives one side,'' he told
me. ``I read the same story you wrote for the Chronicle and it
gives both sides. That's what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   We were a great team. I took all the credit and he took all the
flak. My back was never to the wall. He was always behind me,
between me and the wall.
</P>
<P>
   He backed me up not just when I was right but, more importantly,
when I was wrong. That's the way Tom was. Right or wrong, I was his
editor.
</P>
<P>
   It was during those years that the Lufkin paper won the Pulitzer
Prize for Meritorious Public Service, the same award the Washington
Post had received for Watergate. Had it not been for Tom Meredith,
there never would have been a Pulitzer Prize for the Lufkin Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   The paper won for its investigation of the recruitment and death
of a Lufkin Marine. Tom was very much pro-military. He had twice
served his country in uniform, at the end of World War II and again
during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom, God bless him, had an inborn sense of right and wrong.
As always, he backed us all the way, and it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Tom told this story of the day a local lawyer, who had served
with the Marines in the Pacific, took exception to our stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether to simply cancel my subscription or come
over there and stomp your butt,'' he informed the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Tom replied, ``I don't normally encourage people not
to take the paper, but given that choice ...''
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, after reforms in recruitment and basic training
had resulted from our stories and no less than the commandant of
the Marine Corps said the Corps was getting well because of them,
the same lawyer wrote a note of apology.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, leaders of the community, some of the same ones who
once opposed Tom's leadership at the Lufkin Daily News, joined in a
banquet at the civic center honoring the newspaper when it received
the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   By then the Lufkin Daily News had been sold to Cox Newspapers of
Atlanta, and Tom was soon promoted to publisher of the Longview
(Texas) News-Journal, an operation twice the size of Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   This time he was warmly welcomed by the establishment, and
almost immediately elected president of the Longview chamber of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Tom, who had managed his own affairs as successfully as the
newspapers he ran, was able to retire at age 60. I was honored to
emcee his retirement banquet. A plane load of Cox dignitaries came
to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years later, sad to say, we returned to Longview to
pay tribute to him one last time. Tom, at age 64, was dead of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There are still publishers like Thomas R. Meredith, but fewer
all the time. They hardly make 'em like him anymore.

dusty street in this impoverished town of ramshackle wooden houses
-- where 30 people died, nearly one-fifth of Hurricane Georges'
victims in this small country -- I thought about my 9-year-old
daughter, Margaret. For most of her life I have tried to impress
upon her how incredibly lucky she was to have been born an
American. It's not that I want her to feel superior, it's that I
want her to realize that when things seem difficult in her life --
if a meal is an hour later than usual and she claims she's starving
-- her minor inconveniences pale against the sufferings of many in
this world. In Polo, I gathered first-hand knowledge of that
suffering. (Lipman, Cox News Service).

   MIAMI _ Miami University (of Ohio) is the latest public
university to be drawn into a nationwide controversy over the
allocation of mandatory student activity fees to campus religious
groups. A coalition of four Christian organizations and 11 students
filed suit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, claiming
that Miami's procedures for funding religious organizations are
unconstitutional. They contend that Miami does not provide equal
funding to religious organizations and that students are required
to subsidize groups they disagree with. Miami officials insist that
student organizations are funded fairly and legally and that
religious organizations are treated the same as campus political
groups. Two of the student organizations, including one called For
the Love of God, received some student-activity funds last year.
``This is not about access to funding. It's about using mandatory
fees to support religion,'' a Miami spokesman said. (Fisher, Dayton

DIM SUM CHEFS `TOUCH THE HEART'  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
 SUM-FOOD-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER CUSHMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Do you have the meatloaf and mashed-potato blues? Is
your palate craving something decidedly different? Now may be the
time to consider giving Chinese dim sum a try.
</P>
<P>
   Dim sum is small, flavorful pockets of pleasure made from
hundreds of combinations of meats, seafood, vegetables and sauces.
It is steamed, fried, baked or grilled, and ranges from the exotic
_ such as sweetened chicken feet, steamed duck web and beef tripe _
to the more mundane dishes of lotus leaf rice or steamed barbecue
pork buns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dim sum is not just one thing, it is all kinds of things,''
said Chau Liaw, a chef who has been teaching Chinese cooking at the
House of Rice in Scottsdale, Ariz., for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of Liaw's most popular classes is dim sum basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the old people in China, dim sum is very special,'' she
said. ``They get together to relax in a warm place where they drink
tea and eat simple snacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated, dim sum means ``touch the heart.'' Americans
interpret it to mean the food touches the heart, Liaw said.
Actually, the name shows deference to master dim sum chefs _ called
``si fu'' _ for wanting to please others by creating the yummy
morsels.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to first experience dim sum is in a restaurant. Dim
sum is a movable feast, literally. Waiters wheel around metal carts
of freshly made dim sum varieties. You take what you want to eat
and wait for the next turn of the cart, filled with different
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   After figuring out what dishes you like, you can start
experimenting with dim sum at home. The first thing to do is take a
trip to your local library for a cookbook or do a search for dim
sum on the Internet to find some easy recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to deconstruct dim sum, Ling Lou, co-owner of Cu-Fu
Gourmet, a dim sum and Chinese restaurant in Chandler, Ariz.,
explained some popular dishes and what they are made of.
</P>
<P>
   Any dim sum restaurant worth its salt will take pride in its
harr kow, a translucent, fresh shrimp dumpling, Lou said. The dough
(a combination of tapioca starch, wheat starch, lard and boiling
water) is very delicate. If the chef makes the dough too soft, the
dumpling breaks. If the dough is too thick, it becomes soggy during
steaming and sticks to the bamboo basket.
</P>
<P>
   Spring rolls are a little easier to make. Spring roll skins are
thin, square wrappers made of flour and water that can be purchased
from an Oriental market. Shredded pork is marinated with a
combination of oyster and soy sauces and added to black Chinese
mushrooms, Chinese cabbage leaves, gingerroot, shrimp, bamboo
shoots, scallion, chicken stock and a little cornstarch. The
filling is placed in the skins, which then are wrapped up and
sealed with a touch of beaten egg yolk. They are then quickly
deep-fried to a light, crispy texture.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue pork buns are another popular dim sum dish. A basic bun
dough of yeast, flour, sugar, milk and water is formed into a ball
around various fillings _ in this case, diced pork. The slightly
sweet sauce is made with hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce,
brown sugar, chicken stock, cornstarch and wine. The buns are
steamed until they are fluffy and light.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one cannot forget the importance of rice in any
Chinese meal. Lotus leaf rice is the centerpiece of dim sum. A
mixture of short-grain rice, dried shrimp, chicken, pork sausage,
barbecue pork and soy sauce is stuffed into the dried, round lotus
leaves (tropical water-lily plants), which are tied with string
into a neat, rectangular package and then steamed.
</P>
<P>
   Bean curd often is found in various dim sum dishes. Bean curd
(tofu) is made from soybeans that first are softened in water and
then crushed and boiled to make milk. The pulp is strained out and
the milk coagulates into curds that are pressed into molds. Bean
curd also can be dried into thin sheets for wrappers for fillings
such as chicken, pork, shrimp and black mushrooms to make treats
such as bean curd skin rolls. You can tell the difference between
spring rolls and bean curd skin rolls because the latter are
deep-fried and then steamed, which give them a wrinkled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about the way Chinese eat dim sum is you
don't have to wait until the end of the meal for dessert. You just
eat sweet delicacies such as baked custard buns or sesame seed
balls whenever the desire hits you.
</P>
<P>
   Custard buns use the same fluffy bun dough of the barbecue pork
buns, but the filling is a mixture of egg yolk, sugar and butter.
Sesame seed balls are an interesting mix of sweet rice dough and
dried red beans that are cooked slowly for at least five hours with
sugar until they turn to a thick red paste. The paste is smeared
into the dough, which is rolled into a ball and then sprinkled with
toasted sesame seeds and deep-fried in a wok.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken feet are an extremely popular dim sum dish in Asia. Not
surprisingly, they don't fare particularly well with Americans, Lou
said. Simply prepared, chicken feet are cooked in a black-bean
sauce. The proper way to eat them is to put the entire foot in
one's mouth, suck off the meat and spit out the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Lou doesn't recommend that people try the chicken feet unless
they are very brave. Instead, she steers newcomers toward the
dumplings, steamed buns and pastries.
</P>
<P>
   A dim sum aficionado, Lou dispenses advice about the Chinese
delicacies whenever possible.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   2 teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Filling:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces pork, shredded
</P>
<P>
   8 dried black Chinese mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   5 Chinese cabbage leaves, green part only
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced gingerroot
</P>
<P>
   1/2 minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces shrimp, shelled, deveined, cleaned and shredded
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded bamboo shoots
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup shredded scallion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons oil
</P>
<P>
   20 spring roll skins
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   Combine the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Add shredded
pork and mix well. Cover and marinate for 2 hours in the
refrigerator. Soak dried mushrooms in tepid water to cover for
about 30 minutes, or until soft and pliable. When reconstituted,
squeeze out water. Cut off and discard stems and mince caps. Cut
away white part of Chinese cabbage. Blanch green part in boiling
water for 1 minute. Plunge in bowl of cold water to halt cooking.
Drain and squeeze out excess water. Cut leaves into 1-inch strips
lengthwise and shred to make about 1 cup. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare remaining filling ingredients, arranging them separately
on a work platter.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons oil in wok over medium heat. Using the steel
spatula, coat the sides of the wok with hot oil. Stir-fry ginger
and garlic for about 10 seconds. Turn heat up high and add
marinated pork. Stir-fry until pork turns white. Add shrimp and
stir-fry until pink. Add mushrooms, Chinese cabbage, bamboo shoots
and scallion. Stir-fry for 2 more minutes. Add chicken stock.
</P>
<P>
   Add cornstarch-water mixture and continue to stir-fry until
liquid thickens. Spread filling on plate to cool to room
temperature. Keep spring roll skins under a damp towel. Remove one
skin and place it on the work surface. Place about 2 tablespoons of
stuffing on the skin about 1 inch from the edge nearest to you.
Fold the near edge over the filling. Fold over the right and left
sides. Roll up and seal with beaten egg. Set aside, sealed side
down, covered with plastic wrap. Continue with the remaining
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Spring rolls may be refrigerated or frozen at this point until
ready to fry.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange spring rolls, paper toweling or wine rack, and utensils
such as wire mesh strainer and cooking chopsticks, in convenient
fashion around the cooking area. Be sure your wok cover and
extinguisher are handy in case of an oil fire.
</P>
<P>
   Add 6 cups of oil to wok. Attach deep-frying thermometer and
heat to slightly above cooking temperature of 375. Add a spring
roll to the oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.
Turn several times while frying. Remove and sample. The interior
filling should be heated through. The exterior crust should be
golden brown and not oily or greasy. Adjust time and temperature
and fry the remaining spring rolls a few at a time, replacing one
each time one is removed from the oil. Drain on a wire rack or
paper toweling. Just before serving, you may want to cut the spring
rolls into 3 or 4 bite-size pieces with kitchen scissors. Serve hot
or at room temperature.

700-YEAR FAVORITE: CHINESE DUMPLING

<P>
   UNDATED - Although many Americans are discovering dim sum, these
delicious dumplings have been an integral part of Chinese culture
for seven centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient art of dim sum began as bite-size snacks for Chinese
emperors during the Sung dynasty (960-1279), according to the book
``Classic Deem Sum, Recipes from the Yank Sing Restaurant in San
Francisco.'' When the Mongols invaded China in the 13th century,
the royal court was forced to move slowly south. It took its
culinary traditions with it. Dim sum's popularity spread with each
stop, where common-folk chefs adapted the rich treats to blend with
their own tastes and food staples.
</P>
<P>
   By 1900, dim sum was the rage in China's southern Guangdong
province. Farmers headed to the scores of teahouses for nourishment
after long days in the fields. Dim sum remained a male-only
tradition for centuries. Over time, however, it filtered into
Chinese homes, where women would cook the treats for their families
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few decades, Chinese restaurants serving dim sum
have flourished in the various ``Chinatowns'' found throughout the
United States. &QL;

<P>
   Lucky man.

<P>
   ``Blotkake'' is one of the marvels of Scandinavian cooking,
showing off one of the country's wonderful dairy products. This is
the country, after all, where if you order hot chocolate in a
restaurant, it appears at your table along with a crystal bowl of
whipped cream to use as topping. (And no nutritional gasps, please.
This is a country with one of the longest life expectancies in the
world.)
</P>
<P>
   This recipe for ``blotkake'' is from a cookbook put together by
Friendship Force, a cultural-exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   BLOTKAKE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6-8
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 scant cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons liquid: milk, juice, lemonade, white wine,
sherry or liqueur
</P>
<P>
   1 pint whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 cups fresh berries: strawberries or raspberries
</P>
<P>
   Butter bottom of 9-inch springform pan. Beat eggs and sugar
until well-combined. Combine flour and baking powder and fold
gently into the eggs, until batter becomes smooth. Place in pan and
bake for 25 minutes on the lower shelf of a preheated oven at
350-375 degrees. Set aside for a few minutes, then remove cake to
cool on wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   Split cake into two layers and dribble half of the chosen liquid
over each cake half, especially around the edges, but do not allow
to get soggy. Whip cream and add 1 teaspoon sugar. Set aside 1 cup
of berries; cut the rest into small pieces and add remaining sugar.
Spread berry pieces on the bottom layer, add 1/3 of the whipped
cream, top with the second layer and cover the entire cake with
remaining whipped cream. Decorate the top with whole berries.

</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   Combine sugar, syrup and vinegar in saucepan. Cook over medium
heat until sugar dissolves. Continue cooking without stirring until
candy thermometer reaches 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat, quickly stir in baking soda and mix well. Pour
onto a lightly buttered pan or buttered foil. Don't spread. Cool
and break into pieces. Dip in melted chocolate, if you like.
</P>
<P>
   If there are dark spots in the candy after it is broken, it
means the soda wasn't mixed in well enough. The flavor will still
be fine.

A COMMON FATE IS IN STORE FOR ALL MOMS

<P>
   Like a wise old Indian scout surveying hoofprints in the sand,
mothers know. Like a meteorologist watching a barometer fluctuate
from high to low, mothers know. Like a pathologist observing
microscopic images of cells, mothers know.
</P>
<P>
   Psychic? No. But like size-9 feet in size-8 shoes on a five-mile
nature hike, some things are just predictable. What do mothers
know? We know when we absolutely, positively, without a doubt, have
no choice but to go to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it starts with the little things. The warning signs of
impending starvation. First, I run out of pop, cookies and ice
cream. Who cares? It's a bunch of fat and sugar, and the kids
really do need to drink more water.
</P>
<P>
   A few days pass and the children grumble a bit, but there just
aren't enough hours left at the end of my day, so I postpone the
inevitable and make a pitcher of Kool-Aid. Yeah, the colorful sugar
water buys me some time, but then the eggs and milk are all gone.
The natives become restless. They tape a grocery list to my
windshield. It's small. I can see around it. So I drive off and
ignore it for another day. Milk gives me gas, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we're down to those funny little brown slices of bread,
frozen meat and canned goods. I have the best intentions, but after
a full day at the office, I'm just too exhausted to stalk up and
down the aisles of the grocery store in search of macaroni. Yes, I
am aware that some grocery stores deliver to your door, but my
mother taught me to pick fruit the way her mother taught her to
pick fruit, and my great-grandma grew her own fruit. I just gotta
pick out my own fruit, no matter how inconvenient it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the family tires of my pitiful offerings of burgers,
chicken and pizza every night. When I arrive home, they're standing
outside in a picket line blocking the driveway, chanting: ``We want
some real food! We want some slow food!''
</P>
<P>
   I crawl out of the car and throw myself at their feet. ``Please,
please, just give me one more day. I promise I'll go to the grocery
store tomorrow. I will not come home without some brown paper sacks
and coupons.''
</P>
<P>
   They relent and allow me to enter the house. To escape their
hostile glares, I retreat to the bathroom. A few minutes later, I
notice that we are out of toilet tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone bring me a roll of toilet tissue!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, bring me a box of Kleenex, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Napkins?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paper towels?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Then my husband slides an old cleaning rag under the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you crazy? I'd rather have the blow dryer.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly motivated, I grab my car keys and head for the grocery
store. Nine at night is a good time to shop, by the way. No crowds
or long lines. Home again, and the family greets me with cheers and
smiles. As they put the groceries away, I remember that the
weatherman has forecast rain for the next day. As I start to check
the coat closet, my oldest son screams: ``Wait! Mom, don't!''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. Inside the closet are several rolls of toilet tissue,
boxes of Kleenex, paper towels, napkins, and my blow dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, I guess mothers don't always know, after all.  &QL;

NOTHING BEATS BEING A FORMER OAKLAND PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mark McGwire leaves Oakland and hits 100
homers in a year and a half. Sandy Alderson leaves Oakland and gets
a cushy job in the commissioner's office trying to bring Major
League Baseball to Monte Carlo. And I think we all know what
happens next.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs leaves Oakland and becomes Secretary of Health and
Human Services in the Tipper Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, there must be something to being from Oakland that
makes it better than being in Oakland, at least if you're in the
baseball business. Thus, it is this fact, rather than any other,
that should puzzle and bother Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann as they
begin their fourth year of ownership of the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying that it does, necessarily. Only that it should.
</P>
<P>
   The only real difference between McGwire and Alderson, when it
is all boiled down, is that McGwire never missed a chance to roast
the owners for their seemingly indifferent commitment to the ball
team.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, on the other hand, never took a chance to do the same.
He would defend Schott and Hofmann's essential strategy of trying
to make a few bucks with a bad product in hopes of offering a shiny
little runabout to an eager buyer, and always found it easy to
gloss over the basic hole in the logic _ that making a few bucks
for the owner only does something for the owner, and a happy owner
is hard to market.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a careful observer knew Alderson's heart wasn't matching
his rhetoric (remember, he cut his teeth in baseball working for
Walter Haas, against whom most any owner would look shrewish and
dim), it wasn't hard to see how the relentless and seemingly
bottomless trail of losses was fouling Alderson's humor. He was the
loyal employee to the end, but he spoke loudest when he left
without saying a single bad word about his former bosses. He said
it with his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland _ Cradle Of Someone Else's Good Time. Again.
</P>
<P>
   There had been rumors that Alderson might at some point be
trying to collect investors to buy the team from Schott and
Hofmann, but nobody will know if Alderson had any luck or whether
he had ever tried. As was the case about the Oakland situation,
Alderson keeps the secrets he wants to keep.
</P>
<P>
   What we know now is, he always wanted to stay in the San
Francisco Bay area because both he and his family loved it so.
Then, he decided to leave. Being third in line for Bud Selig's
cushy chair is, frankly, not that good a tradeoff unless he
adjudged the situation in Oakland (six years of losing, dwindling
crowds and pewter gray atmosphere) had become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Schott's answer to this grinding dilemma was at least honest. He
and Hofmann will not spend more than they take in, which means the
payroll is likely to shrink even further next year. He and Hofmann
still are engaged in trench warfare with the Coliseum about the
stadium lease and the broken promises and slights on behalf of the
Raiders. He doesn't have any immediate ideas about how to stop the
fire drill to warmer and happier climes.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, but if he had a new stadium ... God, it just makes your
head crack open.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Schott's solution is relatively simple, and it doesn't
require moving vans in the middle of the night. First, operate the
team as though winning were the first objective, rather than a very
distant second. Second, keep every good player on site and hire
someone who can find the rest. Third, leave him and those he hires
to do their jobs without let or hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   Schott knows all that, though. Of course he does. Nobody ever
reached Final Jeopardy claiming that either he or Hofmann were
stupid. He said it himself Monday: ``I know that you have to spend
$40 million to put yourself in the arena of real competitiveness.
Sure I can divide the number of victories we had by the money we
spent and say, `Hey, we did a lot better than a lot of other
teams.' That doesn't make me feel any better.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't change anything, because that's not how score is
kept. If he wanted to win first, he would have put his and
Hofmann's money where Alderson's mouth was. Even if he had signed
McGwire two years ago, the payroll wouldn't have reached $30
million and the wins-per-dollar figure wouldn't have changed all
that much.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, maybe McGwire wouldn't have hit those 70 home runs
and been declared Lord High Sheriff of the Universe had he stayed
in Oakland. You can't take one set of facts, change a material
detail and expect everything else to stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   But he would have stayed, and nobody can make a sensible
argument saying that his staying would not have been a considerable
improvement, just as nobody can make a sensible argument for the
A's being better off without Alderson. Not the constricted,
frustrated apologist for cheap baseball that he was at the end, but
the bold, aggressive dealer he was in the Haas years, left to
thrive or dive on his own judgment rather than someone else's
mini-budget.
</P>
<P>
   So now the A's start 1999 with Billy Beane unchanged, except for
having half as much money to spend as the Giants, who are spending
about $10 million less than they ought to be for the kind of team
they have. That's no solution, either. That's just the prelude to a
press conference two years down the road, where we learn that Beane
is leaving to become a veejay at MTV. Because apparently nothing
beats being an ex-A.

(among others) as well as his own group, the Family, and God's
Property, the group he shepherded to enormous success last year via
a 2-million-selling debut album, ``God's Property From Kirk
Franklin's Nu Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also his autobiography, ``Church Boy.'' It's a fairly
no-punches-pulled account of growing up poor in Fort Worth, making
more than a few mistakes and finally rising to superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin is the biggest name in gospel music. But at this
moment, as another interview commences, he may also be the most
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the biggest challenge is, I feel like a fish out of
water,'' he says. ``I'm not built for this stuff: promos and
interviews and autographs and all this. The secular world makes me
uncomfortable. I'm a church boy; I need to be on the corner with a
Bible somewhere. I'll be glad when it's five or six months from now
and the CD's been out a while and this part of it is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin is also truly nervous about ``The Nu Nation Project,''
which brings together all the styles he loves: traditional and
modern gospel, hip-hop, jazz, rock, R&AMP;B. Several times during the
interviews, he asks people if they like the CD. He's more like a
teen-ager who has just cut his first demo tape than a man who has
sold more than 5 million albums.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the nervousness is also because this is his first CD
since a fall from a stage in Memphis in November 1996 left him in
intensive care for days and gave him horrible headaches for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has no physical problems related to the accident and
views the incident as pivotal to his development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never graduated high school; I never walked across that
stage,'' he says. ``My fall in Memphis was my graduation; it took
me from a boy to a man. When you see death, it changes you.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's another reason Franklin is nervous. He may have
helped gospel cross over to the pop and R&AMP;B markets more than
anyone else in history, but he is well aware that a lot of people
may like the beats but not the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many barriers about what I do,'' he says. ``The
majority of society isn't trying to hear about Jesus. Sex sells.
Women still dance to music that calls them whores. That confuses
me. When a young black man says `Jesus loves you,' people don't
want to hear it. All we're saying is, `Give Jesus a try.' We're not
doggin' anybody out; we're not saying Jesus can beat up on
Buddha.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lean on Me,'' the CD's flagship single, includes vocals from
Bono, R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige and Crystal Lewis. ``When you get
some big hitters on a record, more people listen,'' Franklin says.
``It's a tool. The purpose never changes, but the tools do. For me,
it was a song about issues that as Christians we don't deal with.
In church, we can be so busy shouting, we can not recognize that
the person next to us is dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin recruited friends Kelly and Blige, and Bono was
suggested by producer Jimmy Iovine, who has worked with U2.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school, U2 was the group,'' Franklin says.
``I was going to the Professional Youth Conservatory, and I was the
only black kid there. A guy named Perry loved U2, and they have a
very spiritual thing. Jimmy suggested Bono, and I was like, `Get
outta here.' I was honored to have him. We flew to Dublin, and he
recorded his song.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin was only in Ireland one day, however. He flew in, got
Bono's vocals and flew back. Why? The next day was his daughter
Kennedy's birthday, and he wasn't about to miss it. Franklin says
his family _ wife Tammy and children Kerrion, Carrington and
Kennedy _ are the most important part of his life, because he
realizes that however famous he is, he won't always be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's your life,'' he says, pointing at a copy of the new
CD lying on a table, ``you're in trouble.''

KIRK FRANKLIN TELLS HOW HE OVERCAME
</HEADLINE>
 BOY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did well in the NFL for a few seasons? You get a book.
</P>
<P>
   Did well at the Olympics? You get a book.
</P>
<P>
   Had an affair with your father or a famous writer, or want to
whine about how many drugs you hoovered and how hard your poor
little life is? You get a book.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, most of it, all feeding our insatiable need for yet
another personality to examine for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church Boy'' (Word Publishing, $12.99), Kirk Franklin's new
autobiography, flies in the face of all that, mainly because at age
28 the Fort Worth gospel superstar has an amazing story to tell.
Nobody else has come so far so fast _ at least in gospel music _
and therein lies a tale with as many twists and turns as a novel.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Church Boy,'' which Franklin dictated to ghost writer Jim
Nelson Black during the 1997 international Tour of Life, he talks
candidly about being adopted by his aunt, Gertrude Franklin, when
his teen-age mother, Deborah, was unable and unwilling to take care
of him. He talks about being teased because of his small size and
his love of church, and abouy a wild spell as a teen that included
smoking marijuana and briefly being homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin wrote this, he said, to ``share my junk,'' to show how
God can take self-esteem problems and internal struggles and use
them to the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``Church Boy'' is a lot like kicking back and talking
with Franklin _ and, at the same time, like listening to him preach
in concert. He will always emphasize that God is working in
people's lives, whether they know and admit it or not, and such is
the case here.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR DEDICATES TEXAS SCHOOL NAMED IN HER HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LUCY HOOD  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
encouraged students to meet the challenges of a changing world at
the Tuesday dedication of a high school named in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   She used her life and the strides made by women as an example.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, the first woman named to the Supreme Court, recalled
her graduation from a high school in El Paso named after Texas
colonizer Stephen F. Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, women did not hold public office and no
self-respecting Texan would name a school after a woman,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 68, graduated from the law school at Stanford
University in 1952. Despite an initial job offer as a legal
secretary, she went on to become an assistant attorney general in
Arizona and a state senator before President Ronald Reagan named
her to the Supreme Court in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than one generation, conditions for women in the
United States have changed dramatically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was the responsibility of today's young people to
meet contemporary challenges by contributing to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have to know how to build new institutions to meet
the needs of the 21st century,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said she was honored that students chose her name for
the new Northside District high school. ``You can't imagine what a
special day this is for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first high school in the nation that carries
O'Connor's name.
</P>
<P>
   All high schools in the Northside District are named for Supreme
Court justices and students vote to select the name. Superintendent
Ed Rawlinson said the students voted overwhelmingly to name the
school for O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Harle, a junior at the school who introduced the
Supreme Court justice, said she was motivated by O'Connor's
selection as the first woman on the Supreme Court _ as well as
another factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't leave out the fact that she's a native of Texas,''
Harle said.
</P>
<P>
   The $28.6 million school opened in August with 1,848 students.

</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 1/2 out of 5 stars various styles that, as always, is
the underpinning for his message of love for God.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to appreciate how good this CD is unless you listen to
most other modern gospel music. Dozens of acts have sprung up in
Franklin's wake, trying to improve upon his hip-hop-meets-gospel
formula.
</P>
<P>
   Most sound like pale imitations _ and none is going to catch him
now. This album encompasses modern gospel, touches of '40s jazz,
some hard-rock guitar worthy of Prince's ``Purple Rain'' era, lush
orchestral work, easygoing pop/funk, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin has never ranged so far afield, but ``Project'' never
sounds like a confused mishmash; he uses both the Family and God's
Property as the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He has also never used so many guest artists, but here again,
it's not just a matter of getting famous names to sing with him;
it's a matter of integrating them into the songs. ``Lean on Me,''
featuring R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige, Bono and Crystal Lewis, will get
the most attention. But ``Something About the Name Jesus,'' which
features Rance Allen and Men of Standard working with the Family,
is as worthy an example.
</P>
<P>
   At its base, though, ``Project'' is about good ol'
Sunday-morning gospel _ updated and retooled for the late '90s, but
still tied into the sounds of uplifted voices bolstered by piano
and organ.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Revolution'' and ``Riverside'' Franklin weaves together
lyrics and hip-hop beats to hypnotic effect, like a church service
when everybody gets happy and nobody wants the song to end.
</P>
<P>
   And that, really, is Kirk Franklin's finest quality: He's rooted
in the church, but he knows about the street. More than any of his
previous albums, ``The Nu Nation Project'' is a complete work, one
in which he has truly said his piece.

`FELICITY' LIVES UP TO ITS HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a moment early on in ``Felicity'' that topples
expectations so thoroughly that it left me wondering whether its
creators were psychologically fit or simply naive in the ways of
network television.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Porter (Keri Russell), the harried heroine of the most
dissected new TV series since ``NYPD Blue'' introduced a parade of
bare bottoms, asks her chiseled-face classmate Ben Covington (Scott
Speedman) to sign her high-school yearbook. ``Can you give me a
minute to do this?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   As he drops to the grass and begins to write ... and write ...
and write, the camera locks in and stays put. Felicity creeps
tentatively and awkwardly around him. She kneels, stares at the
ground, looks away. Is she excited or bewildered?
</P>
<P>
   I've watched this scene numerous times trying to figure out its
surreal attraction, and to marvel at Russell's facial aerobics. My
conclusion is the obvious: It speaks without saying anything. This
is a stylistic trick we readily accept in films but question in
prime-time TV, where a stately pace can be jolting and, in the age
of the remote control, cinematic suicide.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly why ``Felicity'' has become one of the few series
to appear in The Wall Street Journal and that other journal of
pop-culture analysis, ``Seventeen,'' before it even generates one
rating point.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, ``Felicity'' earns its hype for not just going
against the grain but, based on a well-crafted, crisply written,
engaging pilot by filmmaker J.J. Abrams (''Armageddon''), for being
intellectually delicious.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to concern me is that everything I've read thus
far has been based on the pilot. The real test for dramatic serials
comes over a matter of weeks, after viewers have decided whether
returning is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   If only from the saturated media coverage ``Felicity'' has
received, you probably know the basics: smart high school grad
ditches plans to attend Stanford (pre-med, all expenses paid
courtesy of Dad) and instead heads for the fictional University of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   As we learn from ``Felicity's'' voice-over (oh, you know it's
serious if there's a voice-over), she's a doctor's daughter with an
artist's soul, a young mind wanting and needing to color outside
the lines. She's never done anything impulsive; Dad has guided her
life up until this point.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she begins assembling a support system, people who
in the pilot are merely character sketches. Noel Crane (Scott
Foley, fresh from a recurring role in ``Dawson's Creek'') is her
student resident adviser, geeky but cute and clearly nuts about
Felicity.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Emrick (Amy Jo Johnson) is a friend she meets while
sobbing in class. doesn't show up in the pilot but is listed in
press materials as ``a native New Yorker overly confident and
aggressively opinionated (who) shocks Felicity with her
freight-train personality.'']
</P>
<P>
   Pretty boy Ben is among the A team, too, and is a pivotal part
of what is becoming a WB signature element: the love triangle. (See
``Dawson's Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and the new ``Hyperion
Bay.'')
</P>
<P>
   Through the eyes of Felicity, we are supposed to learn about
college life, young love and lingering pain, that life is like
physics: Nothing really happens without effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' will hinge on whether the drama offers characters
and not caricatures, crisp dialogue and not cliches, realistic
situations that don't fall into unhip pretentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Russell isn't enchanting. Having been in her share of
flops (see ``Malibu Shores'' and a batch of so-so made-for-TV
movies), she is trumpeted as an overnight sensation. This is an
insult. She's merely a good actor sinking her teeth into better
material.
</P>
<P>
   Russell manages to establish believability in a complicated
character who is so nervy and vulnerably ambivalent that she'd
probably psychoanalyze the nutritional value of a Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Russell's expressions as the camera pans on her during
emotional conversations, mostly with the university counselor, her
parents and Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Describing it earlier as facial aerobics isn't being cute; it's
the best way I can explain how she's one of those gifted actresses
able to say so much by saying absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You provoke me,'' Ben tells her near the end of tonight's
pilot. ``You make me think about things that I never think about.
Without saying anything. Just by the way you look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   You, too?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Oreste Bruni rushes around the emergency room at the
Massapequa General Hospital in Seaford, N.Y., hands-on medicine is
not his only occupation. Like all doctors in that fast-paced world,
he's busy taking notes _ notes to guide later treatment and help
insure payment for both him and the hospital. Such notes can even
become vital evidence if a malpractice suit is filed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 90s, Bruni tried to move into the electronic age by
taking notes on laptop computers that used special screens and pens
rather than keys for entering text and commands. He bought and
tried four different models, but their awkward weight, size and
shape ultimately forced him to abandon them all.
</P>
<P>
   Bruni has returned to taking notes with a ballpoint pen and a
standard yellow notepad, 8{ by 11 inches, but there is a
difference. Since last spring, he has been slipping those pads onto
a clipboard that silently creates an electronic version of his
medical charts as he writes with ink on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if Bruni chooses, handwriting-recognition software takes
those electronic records and translates them _ more or less _ into
text that can be handled by a word-processing program.
</P>
<P>
   He has switched to one of the devices that is making people take
a new look at word-recognition software: the Crosspad, developed by
International Business Machines and the pen maker A.T. Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting-recognition software has generally been tailored for
either large- or small-scale use. Huge systems are used by large
corporations and agencies like the United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, personal digital assistants like 3Com's Palm
Pilot offer limited recognition ability. The Crosspad's Ink Manager
software and Smart-writer by Advanced Recognition Technologies are
trying to bring some of the more advanced features of larger
systems to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Crosspad, the latest attempt to link handwriting and
computers, uses a pen with a miniature radio transmitter. While the
user writes in ink, the pen beams its movements to a computer in
the clipboard, which assembles the data into a digital image of the
scribblings.
</P>
<P>
   The Crosspad has enough memory to hold an electronic record of
more than 50 written pages. The computer files can be uploaded onto
any computer that has a Pentium processor and runs Windows 95 or 98
or NT.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Cross hope that the Crosspad, which came on the market
in the spring, will join PDAs like the Palm Pilot as a
handwriting-recognition gadget of choice for well-heeled executives
and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cross introduced a smaller, lighter model that uses
steno-size notebooks. IBM and Cross officials say they expect other
companies to have Crosspad copycats available by spring.
</P>
<P>
   The pages captured by a Crosspad are like fax images in a
computer _ they are graphical depictions of text and drawings, not
text that can be manipulated by a word-processing program.
</P>
<P>
   The Crosspad includes handwriting-recognition software to
convert such notes into text, but such software tends to make a lot
of errors, depending on the handwriting. One early
handwriting-recognition product, the Newton from Apple, became
widely known after it was parodied in the Doonesbury comic strip
because of the comical errors its software sometimes produced.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilots and similar PDAs also offer handwriting recognition,
but users must write in special script with a stylus on small
liquid-crystal-display screens.
</P>
<P>
   James Landay, a professor specializing in user-interface
research at the University of California at Berkeley, said that
with PDAs, ``the screen resolution is pretty poor and you're
writing on something smaller than a Post-It note.'' He is now
trying a Crosspad.
</P>
<P>
   Pen-based laptops have evolved as heavy-duty tools for
professionals in the field. They tend to have a short battery life
and slippery writing surfaces. One pen-based Thinkpad that IBM
marketed in hospitals weighed nearly seven pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurses weren't going to carry it around all day unless they
were ex-East German swimmers,'' recalled Krishna Nathan, who
studies handwriting recognition at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center, where he is the laboratory's senior manager for consumer
devices.
</P>
<P>
   IBM changed its thinking with the Crosspad. ``We were focusing
on trying to solve the problem of the pen and forgot about
everything that paper's really good at,'' Nathan said. ``After all,
paper offers the ultimate in portability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crosspad's main advantage over paper alone is the ability to
search for bits of information in notes and retrieve them. Crosspad
users can circle words to make them keywords that can be searched
for later.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate prize, of course, with products like the Crosspad
is the ability to translate notes into standard computer text. The
Crosspad comes with IBM Ink Manager software to do that.
</P>
<P>
   One person who uses the handwriting-recognition software to
convert his Crosspad notes into text is Marc Demarest, chief
executive of DP Applications, a software developer in Portland,
Ore. He immediately converts all his notes into text and stores
them in programs like Microsoft Word, he said, never saving the
graphic images of his writing.
</P>
<P>
   But neither IBM nor Cross seems willing to trumpet the ability
to transform notes into computer text. Officials in both companies
vividly remember the mockery directed at other ambitious
handwriting-recognition claims and are cautious about claiming too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe Crosspad first and foremost as a note-capture
and note-management device,'' said Brian Mullins, director of
marketing for the Cross Pen Computer Group. ``The level of
satisfaction with our product for handwriting recognition is all
over the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disclaimers, the Crosspad is clearly, along with
PDAs, the latest in a series of steps to restore respectability to
handwriting recognition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nathan says sorting out pen scratches is a more difficult
problem than its sibling software challenge, voice recognition.
``Speech has evolved as a means of communication,'' he said.
``There's no point in me making sounds if you can't understand
them. But when we come to writing, we do not tend to write for
others, we tend to write for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific survey of 400 executives by Cross found that 49
percent of them had trouble reading their own handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   As people use computers more, the handwriting problem becomes
more difficult. In two decades of grappling with the problem,
Professor Sargur Srihari, director of the Center of Excellence for
Document Analysis and Recognition at the State University of New
York at Buffalo, has noticed a steady decline in the quality of
handwriting, at least in affluent nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there is less of an emphasis on it because of
computers,'' Srihari said. ``There is a sense that the classroom
time that was once devoted to penmanship is now devoted to
keyboarding.''
</P>
<P>
   But handwriting remains overwhelmingly the favored method for
taking notes at business meetings, in schools and for many job
activities. The Cross survey found that 72 percent of its
respondents still took handwritten notes on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my world, there is nothing more annoying than someone in a
meeting banging away on a laptop keyboard _ rat-a-tat-tatting on
the damned thing,'' Demarest wrote in an e-mail message. ``It's
intrusive, ostentatious and ultimately stifles the free flow of
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Software for handwriting recognition uses vast digital libraries
of writing samples. Complex pattern-recognition algorithms _
mathematical approaches to the problem _ sort through the samples
and develop statistics on the most likely forms letters and numbers
take.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting recognition works reasonably well if users print
carefully in capital letters (called discrete handwriting) and
limit the amount of text. The Palm Pilot solves the problem by
having people learn to write in a special manuscript-type script it
calls Graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Casio's Cassiopeia E-10, which uses Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system, has a slightly more sophisticated
handwriting-recognition program known as Jot, from the
Communication Intelligence Corp. It recognizes characters that more
closely resemble standard printing and allows users to make notes
anywhere on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing individual letters and numbers is the easy part.
``Computers are pretty good today at individual recognition of
shapes in isolation,'' Srihari said. ``Recognizing words is where
they fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting-recognition programs that are more ambitious than
those found in most PDAs use two techniques simultaneously to
translate scribbles into words and sentences. The holistic approach
tries to pluck out entire words that match dictionary entries.
</P>
<P>
   Analytical algorithms break down pen strokes into fine divisions
to discover, using probability, individual letters that can then be
assembled into words.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting-recognition programs must be trained to read a
specific user's writing style. The Crosspad's Ink Manager software
requires a tedious teaching process. The user copies such phrases
as, ``Do you know why America presently accounts for about 50
percent of world tuna consumption?'' IBM says Ink Manager can be
fully trained in about a half-hour. Demarest said he had toiled
with it for about 10 hours and wound up with an astounding accuracy
rate of 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mullins, the person at Cross responsible for selling the
Crosspad, says the recognition software often fails him. ``I have
terrible handwriting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After training the Crosspad software for a half-hour, I entered
some of the interview notes for this article but had little
success. ``They were very heavy'' was rendered by Ink Manager as
``REX we in lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Large sections of notes looked as if they had been written in a
long-forgotten language with a few contemporary English words.
</P>
<P>
   Crosspad is not the only product Cross offers with handwriting
recognition. The iPen Pro, a digital writing tablet that connects
to Windows-based PCs, is supplied with Smartwriter. Like Ink
Manager, Smartwriter requires training, although the company,
perhaps optimistically, says the process can be completed within
five minutes. Unlike the IBM software, Smartwriter converts each
word into text as it is written.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl for handwriting recognition might well be the
next United States Census, in 2000. The Census Bureau plans to
process all 1.4 billion personal and business forms electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Using a handwriting-recognition system developed by Associated
Solutions of Dallas, the bureau is hoping for 98 percent accuracy.
If the software can do that, the census may finally eliminate the
sour taste Apple's Newton brought to handwriting recognition.

WBAP CELEBRATES 50TH ANNIVERSARY AS SOUTHWEST'S FIRST TV STATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago this week, movie screens in this neck of the
woods offered such new films as ``Homecoming,'' with Clark Gable
and Lana Turner, at the Belknap Drive-In and ``Green Grass of
Wyoming'' (Charles Coburn) at the Hollywood Theater in downtown
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   That same evening in 1948, the 1935 Leslie Howard opus ``The
Scarlet Pimpernel'' was showing on several hundred smaller screens.
</P>
<P>
   It may not have seemed so at the time, but the big show was on
the small screen. Or, rather, the big show WAS the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1948, WBAP-TV signed on the air as the
first TV station in the Southwest. Announcer Frank Mills pronounced
the call letters. Then there were welcoming remarks by station
founder and Fort Worth Star-Telegram Publisher Amon G. Carter Sr.
and station director Harold Hough. The Star-Telegram owned WBAP
radio and WBAP-TV (now KXAS/Channel 5).
</P>
<P>
   Those formalities accomplished, fiddler Mel Cox and his Flying X
Ranch Boys struck up a lively country-western tune on the state's
first locally sponsored and locally produced variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Although this was the ``official'' inaugural of WBAP-TV, the
first public images over the new station were telecast two days
earlier, when President Truman's re-election campaign train stopped
briefly at the T&AMP;P terminal in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our true license date wasn't until Sept. 29, but President
Truman was coming to town on the 27th,'' Mills recalled. ``Someone
said, `Mr. Carter wants to televise the president's visit.' So, OK,
that was that. We would find a way to put that on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The loophole was that the Truman telecast was called a ``test,''
said Lee Elsesser, producer of various events and telecasts linked
to the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people saw the president at the train station than on TV,
because there weren't that many TV sets in town,'' Elsesser said.
</P>
<P>
   The sets would come, however, and within a half-dozen years the
programs would be broadcast in color. Carter pulled the switch that
transferred Channel 5 to color May 15, 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of programming at WBAP-TV may have seemed bland to
those 1948 viewers. But there was plenty of drama behind the
cameras. During the executives' introductory remarks, a truck ran
into a utility pole near the station, knocking out power for 17
frantic minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The horror wasn't over. Reels of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' were
improperly cued, so when the movie began, the picture was upside
down and backward _ running from end to beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not surprising that, as the Star-Telegram noted in
its coverage of the big day, ``The station will not be on the air
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 5 returned Friday, though, with NBC news at 7 p.m., the
redoubtable Flying X Ranch Boys at 7:10, and, at 7:45, a high
school football game between Paschal and Amarillo. The station was
on the air about four hours per evening, Wednesdays through
Sundays. And, the newspaper article added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Test patterns will be aired 15 minutes before program time, in
addition to tests from 10 a.m. to noon and from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're over 45, you probably recall that people really did
tune in those test patterns and use them to adjust their sets. Some
people also turned up the volume so they could hear the piercing
audio tone. (''Yep, sound's workin' OK. We should have a rasslin'
match in a couple a hours.'')
</P>
<P>
   WBAP-TV did, indeed, telecast wrestling matches from its trusty
remote truck. On a higher plane _ intellectually and celestially _
the station premiered ``Weather Telefacts,'' the region's first
professional weather program, on Halloween night, 1949. The
weathermen were Bob Denney, Walter Porter and a youngster named
Harold Taft. Taft went on to become a cherished institution who, at
the time of his death in 1991, was arguably the most popular on-air
figure in Channel 5 history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, WBAP-TV was sold to Lynn Broadcasting. Because the
station no longer shared a common owner with WBAP Radio, one had to
change its call letters. The TV operation became KXAS. NBC now owns
KXAS/Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   WBAP plunged fearlessly into local programming. A popular entry
of the 1950s was a teen variety show sponsored by Foremost milk and
featuring a fresh-faced collegian named Pat Boone _ who commuted
from Denton, where he was a student at North Texas State University
(now the University of North Texas). Luther Adkins, a retired
Star-Telegram vice president who held a number of administrative
and on-air posts at WBAP-TV, recalled:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat and his wife, Shirley, already had the first of their
girls then. So after every show, Pat would gather up all of the
milk product that was used in commercials and race back to Denton
with it before it spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Amon Carter and his new TV station did not have to outrun a lot
of other folks to get on the air first. In 1948, television was
still regarded as radio with pictures, a quaint toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought that Mr. Carter started the station
just so he could be the first,'' Elsesser said. ``They never
thought television could make any money.''

GORE CAMPAIGNS FOR DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore spent 24 hours in
California collecting campaign money for Democrats and giving back
a few tax dollars, while bolstering his party's profile among
crucial swing voters in the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hollywood celebrities and Beverly Hills millionaires
may finance their campaigns, California Democrats and Republicans
know the only way to win Nov. 3 is to court middle-class voters
from Fresno to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   After raising $750,000 for Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic
gubernatorial candidate on Monday, the vice president spent a few
hours Tuesday in the state's heartland, where he announced $1.9
million in grants to help the police fight domestic violence,
toured a high school and helped raise money for other Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At an evening fund-raiser in Sacramento, Gore criticized the
Republican-led Congress for its partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they can agree on is personally attacking the
president of the United States,'' Gore told the $500-a-plate dinner
in Sacramento for Phil Angelides, who is running for treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Congress of the United States ought to get on
with the business of the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Sacramento, Gore announced federal grants that would
unleash ``the crime-fighting power of community policing on the
scourge of domestic violence.'' Gore also announced a $20.2 million
grant to extend the city's light rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republican gubernatorial
candidate, called Gore's grant announcements election-year
largesse. ``It's Christmas,'' he said. ``Santa Claus is coming to
town. He's going to leave goodies all around the place. They don't
give it away on who's naughty or nice, they just do it on who's
going to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who took no questions from reporters, had traveled to
Sacramento from Fresno with former Assembly Speaker Cruz
Bustamante, who is running for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising trip helps Democrats in several ways, not just
by raising money. Although the vast central spine of California is
home to only about 20 percent of the state's voters, the electorate
there is considered crucial to Davis and Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican Southern California voters are checkmated by
Northern California Democrats,'' said Tim Hodson, executive
director of the Center for California Studies at California State
University at Sacramento. ``The balance tips in the Central
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a Democratic stronghold, the vast farming and sprawling
suburban communities of Central California are about evenly divided
between Republican and Democratic voters.

A FASHION DREAM STAYS OUT OF REACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To a casual observer, the items inside the cardboard box I
hauled to the post office the other day might have seemed mundane:
a pair of jeans, a bright-colored tank top, black sneakers. But to
me, the box was full of disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was either the wrong size or the wrong cut or had
cheap rubber soles. The contents represented yet another setback in
my attempts to buy clothing that flatters rather than ridicules.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not the whole truth. Like so many statements
made on the highly charged subject of personal fashion, that was an
obfuscation. The truth? I am not willing to settle for flattering:
I want clothing that will make me look like Audrey Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have entered a murky area of human need, where reality
and fantasy collide and people standing in front of a mirror fudge
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, I know I look nothing like the gamin actress _ nor
must I to fulfill the basic requirement of swathing myself in
appropriate fabrics to withstand the elements. But I harbor
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   To try to preserve them, I rely on photos of how clothes look on
models in mail-order catalogs, instead of trying them on myself in
harshly lit dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the clothes often look different on me than on the catalog
models. That is why I got excited the other day about a new
software tool called Fashion Trip, which promised to let create an
on-screen mannequin in my own image.
</P>
<P>
   Then I could log on to a Web site to superimpose garments from
nearly 40 designers and manufacturers like Levi's, Esprit and
Jessica McClintock onto the mannequin before deciding whether to
purchase the clothing on line.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Trip, developed by Moda CAD and distributed by Sierra
Online, was scheduled to go on sale for $39.95 in stores nationwide
Wednesday. But I got a review copy last week because I could not
wait: I had begun to imagine a program that would enable me to
create a personal database _ height, weight, age, measurements,
aversions to certain fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that on one level, I was fantasizing about finding a
dress that would scream ``Holly Golightly'' when draped across my
personal mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   But I also saw the possibility of a greater good. At its best,
the Internet is capable of smashing old paradigms about business
and life styles.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Fashion Trip would be the first of a new generation of
software that would upend ideas about shopping, liberating untold
millions from the pain of wearing _ or at least buying _ clothes
that don't fit well.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the potential usefulness of that kind of product for,
say, parents shopping for school clothes. Instead of spending a
long afternoon at the mall with squirming offspring, the parent
would type in a child's measurements and shop on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Or think what a boon that could be to homebound shoppers unable
to get to the nearest mall.
</P>
<P>
   I held on to my high hopes, even after I opened Fashion Trip and
saw that it was aimed narrowly at shoppers 15 to 28 years old, a
group that has not included me for eight years. I knew I would
never use the program's chat feature to discuss clothes with other
friends logged onto the Moda CAD servers.
</P>
<P>
   I was willing to overlook the historical fashion facts sprinkled
throughout the technical manual: ``Body paint _ a late 60s
`futuristic' product _ was made so girls might coordinate their
skin color with the color of their miniskirts.''
</P>
<P>
   But then reality hit hard. As soon as I clicked on Expert Advice
to create my profile, I saw that the options for customizing the
mannequin were very limited. Faced with a choice of five body types
_ all of which looked like headless Barbies _ I gamely studied
them.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting, I could see how the bottom half of my body looked
like one of the types, the top half like another. I created two
profiles. I could try shirts on one, pants on another.
</P>
<P>
   Next I had a choice of five skin colors, ranging from light
beige to dark brown. Finally, the program asked my birthdate.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I clicked on Designer Picks to see which styles were
deemed most appropriate for the two Barbies. For the smaller-boned
one, a Silver Tab V-neck sweater (colors: camp green or ice) was
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slim fit V-neck sweater combined with hipster boot jeans
will be your fave uniform to throw on,'' the program assured me.
For the slightly fleshier Barbie: soft tailored jackets, but no
pointy shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I clicked on Fashion Tips, to be told, ``Do not buy
something you suspect may be hideous just because (a) it's cheap,
(b) it makes you look 10 lbs. thinner or (c) your best friend has
one just like it and it looks amazing on her.''
</P>
<P>
   I seemed to have run out of customization options. That was it?
I had the sinking feeling that anything I bought using this program
would end up in a box marked ``Return.`` After all, I didn't
resemble the Barbie bodies any more than I resemble catalog models.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Moda CAD to see if the next generation of Fashion Trip
might offer a richer shopping experience. Moda CAD's vice president
of marketing, Linda Freedman, assured me that the technology exists
to create a fully customized profile, based on height, weight and
more specific body measurements. It would even be possible to scan
my photo into a correctly sized on-screen figure.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan Weisberg, a Moda CAD senior product manager, said that
it probably wouldn't do any good if the software allowed a user to
create a more customized profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to the manufacturers,'' he said. ``The
manufacturers don't have products with customized breakdowns of
measurements.''
</P>
<P>
   I then wondered aloud about the possibility of a feature that
would enable a user to type in the name of the celebrity that the
shopper would most like to resemble. ``Maybe the software could
sort the available merchandise based on how well it fit the
criteria of the shopper's mental image,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Or _ I just had a brainstorm _ what about adding one little
button that says, ``Click here for clothes Audrey Hepburn would
wear''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm writing all this down,'' Ms. Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason I didn't buy the Silver Tab V-neck or any
other merchandise offered on Fashion Trip was that I didn't know
whether it would flatter me _ or even fit. But you know that's not
the whole truth. In the end, I just couldn't picture Audrey Hepburn
in hipster boot jeans.

FROM LIVELY JIGS TO CHAT ROOMS, WEB IS A HOST FOR IRISH CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irish culture is, of course, far more than green beer every
March 17. For many, the entree into the Celtic musical traditions
is ``Riverdance,'' that loud, brash Broadway-style stage show that
has thumped its way back to New York for a run at Radio City Music
Hall until Oct, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the show has its own Web site, based in Dublin
(www.riverdance.com). In addition to dispensing ticket and tour
information, the official site caters to fans who just can't get
enough by including cast biographies, multimedia clips and
rehearsal photos.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has message boards for fans around the world to
exchange greetings and news.
</P>
<P>
   For those wanting to learn more about traditional Irish culture,
there are plenty of places on the Web in which to tarry. A site
called Ceolas (www.ceolas.org/ceolas.html) says it has the
``largest online collection of information on Celtic music'' with a
multitude of links to sites related to the topic. (Celtic dance has
its own section here, but links to anything remotely connected to
Celtic music dominate the site. ``Celtic'' refers to, for the most
part, the cultures of Ireland, Scotland and Wales.)
</P>
<P>
   Particularly enticing is an area with a bulging index of musical
notation for traditional tunes, which are available for printing or
downloading in a variety of file formats, including Adobe Acrobat
PDF and GIF, a photo format easily handled by most Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   With its penny whistles and mournful pipes, the best-selling
soundtrack for ``Titanic'' recently brought new exposure for Celtic
music. But National Public Radio was there first with its renowned
weekly program ``The Thistle and Shamrock,'' which has run for 15
years and also has its own official Web site
(www.npr.org/programs/thistle).
</P>
<P>
   The radio show, with Fiona Ritchie as host, presents a lively
mix of musical material from Scotland, Ireland and North America.
The site offers basic information about the show, like national
station listings and forthcoming programs. A Features section
provides background about artists heard on the show, and the
Exchange/Feedback page lets users post and respond to a discussion
board.
</P>
<P>
   For current news from the old sod, there's The Irish Times
Online (www.irish-times.ie), which provides a link to its weekly
news supplement written in the Irish language. If that inspires you
to learn more about the language, try the Gaelic and Gaelic Culture
site, which offers plenty of information on the topic
(sunsite.unc.edu/gaelic).
</P>
<P>
   The Gaelic Software Digest page (www.gy.com/www/ga.htm) provides
links to all kinds of Gaelic language programs, including
dictionaries, spreadsheets and desktop-publishing tools. Gaelic is
an English word for a group of languages that include Irish.
</P>
<P>
   If live chat is more to your taste, drop in at the Virtual Irish
Pub (www.visunet.ie/vip/welcome.html) after a long day of surfing.
It offers chat areas for both guests and regulars, plus many Web
links to the Emerald Isle _ but you'll have to bring your own
Guinness.

COMPUTER DREAMS, SOME SAY, ARE BORN OF ANXIETY ABOUT TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., Wash., N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Can dreams tell people something about their
relationship to technology? Many people who report having such
dreams say they can. Following are a computer-related dream and
several interpretations of it:(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE DREAM:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have experienced a high-anxiety dream in which the walls of
a room are computer screens,'' Tanya Tabachnikoff, director of
media relations at Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vt., said in an
e-mail message describing a dream she had had about six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use the keyboard to try to go to a Web site, the
computer interrupts me with moving messages of new software
programs that I must download before proceeding, or else it is
deluging me with products I must purchase _ demanding my credit
card number, expiration date, etc. Even when I refuse to enter any
information, it starts racking up the bill in front of my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel completely trapped by the room, completely at the mercy
of these enormous monitors surrounding me. The computer `persona'
(which is definitely masculine) is overpowering and relentless,
verging on cruel, and I am struggling to regain control as it
attempts to take control of me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tabachnikoff, responding to an electronic posting in search
of computer-related dreams, said her dream might be related to her
pregnancy _ a condition that she says leads to vivid dreams _ and
to her college's growing reliance on technology. She said Marlboro
had embraced computers as a tool for education, offering master's
degrees in Internet Technology Management and Teaching With the
Internet, programs she has helped promote. And she often uses
e-mail to communicate with her boss and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess all the emphasis on technology has had some
anxiety-provoking effect on my unconscious,'' she wrote. ``The
dream obviously conveys a fear of computers taking over our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuits asked a number of dream interpreters, amateur and
professional, to analyze Ms. Tabachnikoff's dream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE INTERPRETATIONS:
</P>
<P>
   _ John Suler, a professor of psychology at Rider University,
said: ``You have the masculine, father-type image of the computer
as a masculine, controlling force. It's a turnaround because
usually we think of computers as servants. This is a source of
anxiety: you're thinking you're in control, but there's a kind of
betrayal by them in that dream.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Wear, a Jungian clinical psychologist in Seattle, said:
``Now the machine has all the information, all the data, and you're
just the operator, still a tool tender. You're tending the machine
and nothing more. Suddenly this impersonal thing obviously
overwhelms her and surrounds her, and she feels attacked by its
masculine energy. Computers are totally masculine in the sense that
they are totally objective.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hillary Butler, a certified social worker with a Freudian bent
at the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in New York, said:
``Certainly there's a fear/wish to be submissive and to be
dominated. There's a sense absolutely of being overwhelmed, being
out of control, being at the mercy of another, which again can be a
fear and a wish. I think it's both. So the college, the job, the
boss are all representations of a father, and the fear and the wish
to give in to a powerful father. I don't know that this was
particularly about computers, except that that's her life, that's
the language that she would use to express her deepest desires and
fears.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Allan Hobson, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, said: ``It's a classic REM-sleep dream in that it has
anxiety, a fair amount of bizarreness, incongruity and things that
are probably very unlikely if not physically impossible. What it
doesn't have is scene changes or action. It feels like a kind of
relatively static preawakening experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with dream interpretation is it was never
scientific and can never be scientific, but that doesn't mean we
won't do it. We interpret everything. My guess is that you'd still
have as many interpretations as you have people. That's an inexact
process and should be left outside the realm of science.''

<P>
   If you dream that your hard drive is crashing, do you wake up
just before the Fatal System Error message appears? What would be
the meaning of a dream about a cursor that was frozen, not
flashing, on a blank screen? And in scrutinizing nightmares about
computers, are there times when a hard drive is really just a hard
drive?
</P>
<P>
   As computers leach deeper into the subconscious, accounts of
anxiety-filled dreams about them are showing up in the public
spaces of the Internet and in off-line conversations.
</P>
<P>
   While ``10,000 Dreams Interpreted'' by Gustavus Hindman Miller,
written in 1909, featured dream objects like absinthe, reapers and
saltpeter, and current dream lexicons are filled with cars and
airplanes, it may be that before long, control panels and File Not
Found messages will be regularly showing up in the collective
subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The posting, reading and analysis of dreams is already something
of an international spectator sport. People post their dreams in
dozens of online dream journals, Web rings and newsgroups, and
computers play starring roles in some of these pre-breakfast
reveries.
</P>
<P>
   Recent sleep studies indicate that dreaming is more likely to be
a tool for the brain to process information than to be a source of
meaning and guidance, with symbols to be interpreted and heeded.
But dreams and their import remain a topic of water-cooler and
chat-room conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Few therapists have noticed computers turning up in their
patients' accounts of dreams, but some of them say computers have
not been in common use long enough to become part of dreamers'
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   One therapist who has noticed a difference is Barbara J. Lee, a
clinical social worker in South Pasadena, Calif., who says that
about 5 percent of her clients have reported computer-related
dreams. A Jungian, she says the computer is becoming its own
archetype, a symbol of how modern life has accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``American society wants faster food and shortcuts, and a
computer can embody that,'' Ms. Lee said. ``Sometimes we lose our
own identity. It's really about the individual's sense of not being
in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams about computers are quite easy to find through the Web.
John Jacobs, 26, a programmer in Miami Lakes, Fla., posted the
following dream on the alt.dreams newsgroup: ``I was in some kind
of store. There was a large mainframe computer on my left. The
computer would churn out a tape of something like bubble gum. My
brother was also there. After receiving the bubble gum tape, I
would look intently at it until I saw something, whatever vision
had been designed in the tape by the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   An online query about Internet dreams drew this e-mail response
from Kathleen Barco, director of media relations at Kaiser
Permanente in Pasadena, Calif. She described her dream this way:
``I sent my e-mail messages to print and there were so many the
printer just kept chugging them out and buried me in paper. Then I
woke up!''
</P>
<P>
   But mainstream psychologists and sleep researchers have not
reported any great flood of computer dreams even where you might
expect them. Robert A. Hicks, a professor of psychology
specializing in dreams at San Jose State University, said: ``It is
a little surprising to us that we've never run across that here in
the Silicon Valley. We do see a lot of stress-related dreams here.
It's a stressful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists, psychiatrists and other scientists have long
debated whether dreams reflect subconscious forces within dreamers
or simply show what bothers people in their daily lives. The latter
point of view is in favor now, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of us have dreams directly related to things we're
involved with, so it's not surprising that people who post dreams
on the Internet are posting dreams about computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Hobson, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, said most dreams involved emotions and physical motion but
not sedentary activities. ``Certain activities, like computing,
that you think would be in there a lot aren't,'' he said.
``Reading, writing, sitting at one's desk, the kinds of things we
do all day, almost never get in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea `` that dreams are mainly an effort to disguise
unconscious conflict is outmoded,'' Hobson said. But many other
psychologists and psychiatrists _ as well as Web site operators
with scant or no professional training _ still find meaning in
dreams. For them, what is the meaning behind the monitor?
</P>
<P>
   Take Jacobs' dream about the computer and the tape, which he
continued to describe this way: ``The computer gave me another
piece of gum tape. I put it up to my eyes and I saw the earth. I
didn't have any idea what to make of any of it, so I left.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Cartwright, director of the Sleep Disorder Service at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, suggested
that Jacobs might be finding new technology to be a bit beyond him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't understand it,'' she said. ``He can't make sense out
of it, and it's pointing at all different directions at once. He
wishes life was simple again and would just give him bubble gum as
a direct reward.'' So far, she said, she has not run across any
computer-related dreams in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some computer nightmares, a manufactured brain overpowers a
human brain. An entry on the Dream Page
(www.cs.washington.edu/homes/raj/dream/archives/arch11.html), a Web
site where people post their dreams, said: ``The room was dark and
I heard an evil sound come from the floor. I could not scream or
call for my roommates, the next thing I know my computer is biting
me. I woke up and finished my English paper, well to this day the
computer and I have not spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wear, a Jungian clinical psychologist in Seattle, said he
viewed computers, with their objectivity, as male. ``There's
nothing warm about the machine itself, nothing nurturing or
inviting, that I would suggest goes along with femininity in the
Jungian sense,'' he said. ``The machine itself is cold. All you can
do is touch it with your fingertips. It sort of demands that you
jump to its tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Wear said people who don't write code and create software might
feel that they have made a stressful move from being tool users to
being tool tenders. The computer seems to become the master.
</P>
<P>
   One place to go for a layman's interpretation of
technology-related dreams is
www.angelfire.com/tn/MythsDreamsSymbols/index.html, run by Jerry
Gifford, 48, a fence contractor in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind is the greatest computer,'' said Gifford, who started
working with dreams six years ago. Gifford said he based his
interpretations on the teachings of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung and
the mythologist Joseph Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   One prolific dreamer, Dee Finney of Waterford, Calif., who
chronicles her ``Crystal Visions and Dreams'' on Dee's Dreams and
Visions (www.greatdreams.com/deepage.htm), posted four dreams and a
vision on Dec. 17, 1997, including this frustrating one:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the computer, typing in URLs, trying to make a
pattern so that if you clicked on one, it would take you full
circle through the sites back to the beginning from whatever point
you started in a Ferris-wheel-type pattern. I was not able to solve
the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, she had another dream about a circle of
messages. She realized that from the center of the circle, she
could reach any point on it or zoom to another wheel. ``It had to
do with birth and death of one species of birds and the cycles of
life and the tree or vines it lived in,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wilkerson, a self-described dream educator in the San
Francisco Bay area and editor of Electric Dreams, a Web zine
(www.dreamgate.com/electric-dreams), took a stab at analyzing Ms.
Finney's circle-related dreams via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have what Jung would have identified as a Mandala, or
complete geometric expression of Wholeness,'' he wrote. ``If this
were my dream, I would say that I have finally realized one of the
greater truths about Mazes and Labyrinths, that I solve them not by
escaping, but by going directly to the center.''
</P>
<P>
   John Suler, a professor of psychology at Rider University in
Lawrenceville, N.J., said the dreaming mind had much in common with
the Web-surfing mind. In his Web textbook about the psychology of
cyberspace (www1.rider.edu/suler/psycyber/psycyber.html), Suler
said: ``Under the right conditions, cyberspace becomes a dream
world, not unlike the world which emerges when we sink into sleep.
The user can transcend the laws of space and physics. One simply
has to click on a button to be transported from one location to
another. There is no swinging of feet or turning of wheels to
confirm that one has moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Willa G. Cline, a Web designer in Kansas City, Mo., may have had
the ultimate computer dream, of a computer that would analyze her
dreams. She published the following in her online dream journal
(www.willa.com/dreams/dream197.htm):
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working on this dream page, and when I hit the return
key on the keyboard, I was taken to another page and I couldn't
figure out how I got there. I went back and tried to recreate what
I had done, and it happened again. I eventually figured out that
when I was looking at one of my dreams, if I hit `return' the
computer automatically interpreted my dream for me. If I put the
cursor on a specific word or phrase and hit `return,' I received an
interpretation of just that portion of the dream. I thought this
was pretty clever and made a mental note to come back and try it
again when I had more time.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about anxious computer-related dreams, she said she
didn't believe that this one qualified because she viewed it as
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever having an anxiety dream about computers,
actually,'' she said in an e-mail message. ``I (star)love(star)
computers. They don't make me anxious. :)''

STEAGALL AIRS `A BUNKHOUSE COMPANION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Steagall is no Garrison Keillor.
</P>
<P>
   Steagall, after all, writes about life Out West, not the
Lutherans in Lake Wobegon who populate Keillor's ``A Prairie Home
Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, the poet/singer/songwriter and chronicler
of life on the range may well be on the way to creating the western
equivalent of Keillor's imaginary radio world at his own broadcast
bunkhouse, the syndicated ``Cowboy Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   About 120 stations from New York state to Canada's western
provinces carry the hourlong program, which Steagall launched
nearly five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The show blends western songs, chats with Reba McEntire, cowboy
poet Waddie Mitchell, Michael Martin Murphey and kindred
entertainers, and reminiscences and stories from real-life
ranchers, brand inspectors and wranglers. ``Cowboy Corner'' has
also included coups such as Steagall's interview with actor Ben
Johnson, thought to be the last before Johnson's death.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steagall produces ``Cowboy Corner'' at his 75-acre
spread near Azle, Texas, the action takes place in an imaginary
bunkhouse populated by a couple of cowpokes named Buck and Badger.
There's also a dog. They never speak, but Buck and Badger do
chuckle occasionally. The dog exists only as a taped sound effect,
but apparently it's pretty believable.
</P>
<P>
   Steagall said his producer once substituted a more aggressive
dog-bark sound effect for the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two different people called the same day wanting to know what
happened to the other dog,'' said Steagall, who ranges far and wide
with his digital audio-tape recorder to capture the interviews and
stories he brings back to Texas and weaves into the ``Cowboy
Corner.'' ``I tell you, if you listen to our show, you'll think
it's live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboy Corner'' executive producer and co-owner Stuart Balcom
said cowboy protocol is strictly observed, although there's no real
bunkhouse or buckaroos.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman has never stepped foot in the bunkhouse,'' Balcom
said. ``When we interviewed Reba McEntire, we interviewed her on
the front porch.''
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to what city slickers might think, there's still
western legend and lore left to explore. Steagall figures that
three-quarters of a million North Americans make their living on
horseback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see 'em from the freeway,'' Steagall said.
</P>
<P>
   Steagall said ratings are good, and figures that ``Cowboy
Corner'' will find an audience wherever listeners long for
wide-open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of the West is very important to Americans,'' he
said. ``They dream of room. They want to get out in the open. They
want space.''

JUDGE THROWS OUT LAWSUIT AGAINST NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A federal judge has dismissed a bitter and
protracted lawsuit that accused New York Attorney General Dennis
Vacco of turning the Department of Law into a political patronage
mill.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Rosemary S. Pooler said in a decision dated
Monday that even if former assistant attorneys general Meredith H.
Savitt and Sue H.R. Adler were ousted for political reasons, as
they alleged, Vacco has the right to hire lawyers who share his
political views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public employees do not have an absolute right to be free of
patronage dismissal,'' Pooler wrote in a 28-page decision. ``If
party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective
performance of a public office, the employer may make an employment
decision based on party affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Adler and Savitt, who are not Republicans, had the
authority to act and speak for the Republican attorney general,
there is a ``rational connection between shared ideology and ...
job performance,'' the Syracuse-based judge ruled. Pooler noted
that while Vacco ``contended vigorously that all his employment
decisions were based on merit,'' he then argued in court that the
``constitution permits him to hire and fire (assistant attorneys
general) for political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adler/Savitt case was one of 14 lawsuits sparked by Vacco's
1995 purge of the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   After winning election in 1995 as the first Republican attorney
general in 16 years, Vacco fired approximately one-third of the 450
staff lawyers, prompting a plethora of lawsuits alleging political
bias.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the lawsuits has succeeded _ three are still
pending _ the litigation has repeatedly embarrassed the Vacco
administration, while providing the incumbent's opponent _ Eliot
Spitzer _ in this fall's election with a steady stream of material
for political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Documents unveiled as a result of the lawsuits showed that
Vacco, who initially claimed that politics had no bearing on his
hiring and firing decisions, hired several lawyers who had been
recommended by Republican politicians. While many of the hirees
recommended by GOP powers had outstanding credentials and
ultimately received stellar performance evaluations, others had, at
best, meager qualifications and performed poorly.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, an attorney recommended by a Republican judge,
and described as intelligent, politically active and ``strikingly
attractive,'' was later criticized in an employment evaluation for
failing to ``understand the subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The litigation also revealed that Vacco's top assistant, William
F. Flynn, failed the state bar examination eight times,
misrepresented his credentials and may have practiced law before he
was legally entitled to do so, and that Vacco retained one lawyer _
rated poorly by his own evaluators _ because he said hello in an
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Vacco's own conduct _ in particular, smart-aleck
responses to questions in a deposition _ prompted a judge to impose
financial sanctions of several thousand dollars, an expense that
the attorney general passed along to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Pooler, in her decision, upheld the sanctions against Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Vacco camp was elated with Pooler's decision,
although, given the history of similar cases, hardly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said from the start that these lawsuits were meritless
and politically motivated,'' said Chris McKenna, spokesman for the
attorney general's office. ``The fact that a federal judge has
carefully reviewed each and every charge ... and rejected every
single one of them proves that point. We have maintained all along,
and continue to maintain, that nobody's political affiliation
played any role in hiring and firing decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Savitt said she was considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was filed because of a principle,'' she said. ``I
believe the principle of standing up for what is right and decent
was upheld by the court. I will always be able to tell my children
I did what was right. Mr. Vacco ... cannot say the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has described his hiring practice as ``imperfect'' and has
acknowledged mistakes were made. However, he repeatedly points to
his office's record in court as evidence that the staff as a whole
is functioning at the highest level of professionalism.

CLASSIC CARTOONS TAKE AN INTERACTIVE TURN

<P>
   Eh, what's up, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   Jigsaw puzzles _ Looney Tunes Cosmic Capers Animated Jigsaws, a
puzzle collection culled from the intergalactic travels of Bugs
Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Marvin the Martian. Snap the
puzzle pieces together, and the image becomes an animated cartoon
from the Warner Brothers vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Duck Dodgers in the 24{th Century'' fragmented,
reconstituted and animated on a computer monitor, one realizes that
a bunch of deranged 40-something cartoon characters are the
vanguard of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   But then, we already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   As with any toy transported from the physical world to the
computer screen, there is the question of whether a digital
interface adds anything to the experience. In this case, it does.
Putting together a jigsaw puzzle, particularly the cardboard
variety, is an abstract undertaking. It's about memory and spatial
perception and pattern recognition.
</P>
<P>
   You sort things by color, find the corners, assemble the edges,
put together the obvious clusters, then fill in the gaps. When you
snap two pieces together, the primary payoff is the ``aha''
realization that they fit, followed by a tactile sense of
completion when you mash them together with your thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual version elicits the same puzzle-assembly behavior.
(Those sorting strategies are so universal and instinctual, one
half-suspects that a jigsaw gene is lurking somewhere in the cipher
of human DNA.) The ``aha'' moment is identical.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tactile feedback, there's a sound effect to punctuate
the moment when pieces lock together. Essentially, it's the same
kind of payoff _ some sensory reassurance that the pieces fit, a
validation of your insight. In digital translation, a jigsaw puzzle
doesn't lose much.
</P>
<P>
   And it gains a lot. For one thing, it's replayable. Unlike the
cardboard image, which loses all attraction once it is assembled,
the digital image can be recast as a different puzzle (or displayed
as computer wallpaper).
</P>
<P>
   There are 48 different patterns, from conventional cut-out
shapes to square and round configurations, which are surprisingly
difficult because they lack the usual interlocking puzzle parts.
This game makes you realize how much ``pure logic'' really comes
down to habit.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzles are two-sided, so if you get stumped, you can always
flip the thing over and work on the other image. If you get too
frustrated (or just want to see the cartoon), there is an ``instant
solve'' option.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an Auto Place feature that flings pieces together,
one at a time, with the appropriate gutbucket sound effects. Click
repeatedly and the puzzle pieces whirl and zing their way across
the screen as if by magic, leaving the last piece poised like a
bonbon to be placed, ever so delicately, in the remaining gap.
</P>
<P>
   So you can have 20 puzzles auto-assembled except for the last
piece and finish each one in rapid succession. It's like eating all
the green M&AMP;M's in the candy bowl: an innocent activity, but
nonetheless decadent (not that I have ever done this).
</P>
<P>
   Any of these puzzles can be scaled up and down the difficulty
scale, from level one (five pieces, mildly challenging to a
preschooler) to level five (hundreds of pieces, which can occupy an
adult for almost an hour).
</P>
<P>
   The program even has two interfaces, one with pull-down menus,
presumably for adults, and the other with large cartoon icons, for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Because children are more intelligent, sophisticated and
knowledgeable about computers, their interface is superior in every
way. Instead of a tedious pull-down menu bar that says Flip All
Pieces Over, there is a spatula with a fried egg on it and a sound
clip of Pepe Le Pew (``I em fleeping for you, mah leetel
flapjack!'').
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hitting ``P'' for a random puzzle, you can click on a
large yellow gift box. And at the end of the day, it is simply more
satisfying to break emergency glass at the behest of Foghorn
Leghorn than it is to scroll down to Solve Puzzle F4.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the cartoons themselves, classic pieces of
animation that connect the current generation of children to
preceding generations. Baby boomers saw these cartoons broadcast in
the 50s. Generation X saw them in Saturday morning reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 8-year-olds see them in 12-second snippets on a computer
screen. In 2030, children will be watching them on animated posters
affixed to their bedroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marvin the Martian will outlive us all. He will
endure because there's something about a Warner Brothers cartoon
that doesn't mind being frozen, chopped up, shuffled and pasted
onto anything. These characters have transcended their original
context, television. They don't need any sort of context now. They
just float.
</P>
<P>
   In Cosmic Capers, they create a bridge between two kinds of
moving image: the noninteractive image on television and the
computer image, which can be assembled, disassembled, turned upside
down, rotated and otherwise manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   The digital image is three-dimensional; you can flip it over and
see that the back is different from the front. It is something you
can literally construct, which is the whole point of the game. Or
deconstruct.
</P>
<P>
   The digital image is about leaning forward. The television image
is about leaning back. And it reveals a lot about grown-up media
habits that the former is a means to the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Solving puzzles is a highly interactive way to process images.
And as a reward, you get to kick back and watch television. The
implicit message is that interactivity is work and passive
viewership is more fun, when in fact, for anyone under 18, the
opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Cosmic Capers is a very influential kind of toy
because it changes one's way of thinking about television. If you
can take something apart and put it back together again, it's
yours. You control it, and you will expect to control it the next
time you see it.
</P>
<P>
   Every television image becomes a potential Humpty Dumpty _
something to be broken and reassembled at will.
</P>
<P>
   And like Humpty Dumpty, it can never be put all the way back
together, not in a child's mind, not after you've seen it shattered
repeatedly on a computer screen. A remote control teaches you that
the television image can be interrupted. A Looney Tunes animated
jigsaw teaches you that the television image can also be violated.
</P>
<P>
   Programming executives, be vewy, vewy afwaid.

STARS FANS SITE PAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., N.Y., Ind.)   (af)  
 By CHARLES BERMANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this summer Carolyn Hack got the thrill of her life.
Carolyn, 15, a high-school student from Overland Park, Mo., was in
line to ride the roller coaster at an amusement park in Kansas
City, Mo., when she and her friends saw the actor Leonardo DiCaprio
emerge from one of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   After the requisite hysteria, Carolyn's response fit a modern
teen-age template: she rode in the same car the actor had sat in;
then she went home and wrote a detailed account of the experience
for her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If every home will eventually have a home page, it seems that
every fan will have the power to put up a fan site. And while it is
common for celebrities to mount ``official'' sites, it is the
renegade pages that generate lively, unadulterated discussions
about the objects of their affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best fan sites allow people to share something they
experience and enjoy,'' said Brian Bikowicz, whose on-line name is
Megazone and who operates a page about the pop singer Ani DiFranco.
``They let people who enjoy the same thing establish a collective
memory of fandom.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her own Web site, Carolyn manages an on-line service
called DiCapring (www.sky.net/hack/dicapring.htm), which links
almost 660 DiCaprio-centric sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Web ring creates an on-line community of fan-oriented sites,
pages that have little in common except that they satisfy the
insatiable need to know everything about the celebrity or artist in
question. Visitors to the sites can post rumors, exchange pictures,
argue the quality of DiCaprio's work and generally wallow in the
minutiae of the star's life.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who create fan sites learn in the process how to use
the Internet more fluently and master the technical tools needed to
create a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Take Darrell Gaskins, 22, an Atlanta computer consultant who
also designs home pages. He had the foresight to register
www.dicaprio.com several years ago, and the site now gets heavy
traffic from fans. But he also uses the site to demonstrate sound
effects and animation tricks as a way to sell his talents to
prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that DiCaprio, one of the best-known movie stars
on the planet right now, has a strong on-line presence. A search on
his name yields thousands of results. Ms. DiFranco is not nearly as
well known; a similar search turns up a mere 3,500 entries, fewer
than half the number of DiCaprio sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. DiFranco's fans are as fervent, and the pages are as
wide ranging. As a favorite among college students, she is partly
responsible for the introduction of a whole generation to the world
of Web design.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ms. DiFranco's recent rise in popularity, it was nearly
impossible to find anything about her in the mainstream media. So
fan pages became the only route devotees could take to learn more
about her _ an artist who is so much of a renegade she distributes
her music on her own label, refusing offers from major record
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Parker, a Columbia University junior, chose Ms. DiFranco
as a subject for a Web-design class assignment because, she said,
``she is a great role model and empowering to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker has let her page (www.columbia.edu/mrp29/music.html)
live on long past the class and still maintains it on the
university's server.
</P>
<P>
   For some builders of fan sites, satire has become the sincerest
form of flattery. Tim Richardson, an independent filmmaker in
Indiana, created a Leotardo DiCappucino page, a sendup of a fawning
fan site, full of the requisite inside references intrinsic to many
Web sites (members.tripod.com/shinoh14/leotardo.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hobby,'' Richardson said. ``It's like collecting stamps
or baseball cards.''

<P>
   Landon Ray used to lead a fairly genteel life, selling flowers
at farmers' markets in California and taking home $2,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   So much for gentility. Ray recently recounted how he had made
$14,000 in profits that day alone, sitting at an IBM computer with
a Pentium II chip in lower Manhattan. At the time, Ray expected to
rake in a profit of $75,000 for the month of September. Not bad, he
said. Except for one thing: He made $175,000 in July.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months ago, Ray gave up his job as a flower salesman to
join the ranks of a small but growing group of independent small
investors known as day traders. Unlike traditional online
investing, where investors hang on to stocks for months or even
years, day trading is a fast and furious game of speculation that
can mean jaw-dropping returns but is also notoriously risky.
</P>
<P>
   For day traders like Ray, success hinges on the ability to move
quickly in exploiting the tiny differences, called spreads, that
typically exist between a stock's bid price (how much stock dealers
are willing to pay for a share) and its offered price (the price at
which dealers are willing to sell a share). Spreads are expressed
in fractions of one thirty-second of a dollar, a little more than
three cents.
</P>
<P>
   Large-volume traders like Wall Street investment houses have
been able to take advantage of spreads for years, pocketing the
difference between what they charge small investors for a stock and
what they actually pay for it. But only recently have the
independent investors themselves had access to the computer
technology that lets them track the prices bid and offered for a
stock and post their own bids. As a result, even small investors
can trade within a stock's spread either by using computers in a
day-trading firm or in their home.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Let's say an investor is sitting at a
computer screen at a day-trading office and notices that the price
bid for a stock called Fast Buck is $64.375, and it is being
offered for 64.75. Attracted by the spread, the investor puts in a
bid and is able to buy 4,000 shares of the stock at 64.4375 (total
purchase price: $257,750) and then, within seconds, turns around
and sells those shares at 64.6875 (total selling price: $258,750).
The profit: $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   If day trading sounds easy, it isn't. ``I got killed this
morning,'' Ray said recently.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. Sitting in the trading room at Broadway
Trading, a day-trading firm in lower Manhattan, Ray had begun his
day, as he does most days, by tapping into that company's online,
proprietary day-trading system. His computer screen showed the
prices being bid and offered (color-coded to make spotting spreads
easier for investors) as well as information on positions taken by
large institutional investors. At 9:30 a.m., Ray snapped up a few
thousand shares of Amazon.com, the online bookseller, at $114
apiece. At 9:35 a.m., the stock went ``crashing'' down, to $113 a
share. Ray jumped out, feeling lucky to have lost just $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a loss of that size in less than five minutes, most
investors would whack their computers and walk away. But Ray's
trading day was just getting started. Noticing that the stock of
Ascend Communications, a computer networking firm, was plummeting _
a drop of 75 cents in less than minute _ Ray bought 4,000 shares in
less than five seconds, just before the shares started turning
upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bought, bought, bought,'' he said later. ``And I made
$3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's results aren't unusual. While day traders might suffer in
an extended bear market, they can benefit from volatility, which
often accompanies a market's downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Stock volatility isn't the only key to successful day trading.
Speed is important: some traders carry out 1,000 trades a day. And
because the spreads are so small, stock volume is important as
well: most day traders trade thousands of shares of any particular
stock at a time. To make $14,000 in one day, for example, Ray
traded some 390,000 shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, independent investors like Ray might not have
been able to do that kind of trading. At that time, only traders
for large institutional investors had access to the information
needed to do day trading, as well as the fast, low-cost execution
technology. If smaller investors wanted to play as well, they
usually had to go through an intermediary like a broker; the
process typically ate up precious minutes, and brokers charged high
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, however, the Securities and Exchange
Commission has passed new regulations that let smaller investors in
on the action.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq exchange, which generally has more volatile stocks
and larger spreads (which the institutional investors like), has
made itself available to small investors through the Small Order
Execution System. SOES is an automatic system, so all orders are
processed, but it has some disadvantages for spread players, like a
ceiling of 1,000 shares per trade and time restrictions on multiple
stock purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictions are not found in another technology day
traders use: Electronic Communication Networks, which give smaller
investors a chance to post their own stock bids. The ECN's do not
have the time restrictions and limits on the size of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that day trading has soared in popularity,
spawning Web sites, dozens of day-trading classes and specialized
trading firms that offer SOES and ECN's in large trading rooms and
remotely, with direct access through modems or through Internet
sites, in return for expensive training courses and commissions on
trades.
</P>
<P>
   The day traders talk about ``scared money'' (desperate trading
at the end of the day), ``grinding'' (a style of trading that
emphasizes grinding out small profits on many trades), ``jiggles''
(stocks that fluctuate quickly) and ``head fakes''(large traders
trying to create an illusion of movement on a stock). The growing
interest has produced a recent best seller, ``The Electronic Day
Trader'' (McGraw-Hill) by Marc Friedfertig, who started Broadway
Trading, and George West, president of Broadway Consulting Group,
which offers training materials for day traders.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that there are perhaps 100 companies around the
country that offer some form of day trading. Day-trading firms make
their money several ways. First, they charge commissions, usually
between $10 and $25 per trade. Broadway Trading charges two cents
per share of stock traded or $20 per thousand shares. Firms also
charge for remote access to their systems. All Tech Investments,
for example, charges $250 a month for that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   All these firms charge for extensive training sessions, some of
them mandatory before trading and some just strongly recommended.
More than 90 percent of Broadway Trading's customers take a
five-day, $1,495 course from an independent firm, Broadway
Consulting Group. All-Tech Investments offers optional full-time
courses for $5,000, as well as occasional day trading ``boot camp''
sessions for $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friedfertig said he had seen all kinds of investors since he
began training them in 1995: former waiters, real estate developers
and professional golfers and even an investigator for the Legal Aid
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey John, what did you used to do before?'' Friedfertig asked
recently as he strolled through his 70-seat trading room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ski bum, baby,'' one trader said.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, former stockbrokers and commodities traders have also
passed through Broadway Trading's doors. David Bellia is a former
stockbroker who says he lost $60,000 in his first six months of
trading at Broadway Trading but reports making $120,000 in the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started having $10,000 days,'' Bellia said recently.
``I used to tell myself when I started trading that I'd never have
those kinds of days, like the experienced traders around me. But
now those guys are having $30,000 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedfertig said about two-thirds of his firm's 350 customers
came from outside the financial industry. And most of them trade
from computers at home.
</P>
<P>
   Home computer users can do day trading more easily than ever
before. To gain direct access to Broadway Trading's system, for
example, investors need to have only a phone line, an
IBM-compatible Pentium computer, a color monitor and a modem.
</P>
<P>
   Day-trading sites available on the Internet are a growing avenue
as well. But many day traders say that for carrying out hundreds of
trades quickly and reliably each day, they prefer logging directly
into the more sophisticated online trading systems that are
available directly from firms like Broadway Trading, Momentum
Securities and All-Tech Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Susan Scarla, an emergency-room doctor in Mesa, Ariz.,
day trading now is a vastly different animal from what it was 10
years ago, when she first took a stab at it. Back then, she used an
online trading program from the brokerage Quick &AMP; Reilly, but the
firm usually charged high commissions _ more than $100 a trade _
and it often took five minutes to confirm an order. Now Dr. Scarla
can get in or out of a stock in less than a second by using the
technology that is available through her account with Broadway
Trading.
</P>
<P>
   Most day traders don't spend a lot of time pondering the
fundamentals of a particular stock. That kind of stance, of course,
makes many successful investors see red. They pride themselves on
their research.
</P>
<P>
   Most day traders, experts say, are gamblers by nature. Take
Mitchell Dinnerman, a Florida day trader who took out a home equity
loan and sold his gas station business so he could support his
interest. But Friedfertig says that 9 out of every 10 day traders
typically fail to stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   Such attrition numbers do not surprise many regulatory
officials. Phil Feigin, a state securities regulator in Colorado,
described day trading as a ``sophisticated slot machine.'' He said
investors merely ``bet that a number is going to move a certain
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators like Feigin question whether the growing number of
day-trading firms and the classes they offer are really giving
investors anything worthwhile. Second, regulators are concerned
about the degree to which day-trading firms are actually acting as
investment advisers, by lending their customers money for trading
from a proprietary account or perhaps conducting some of the trades
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the person conducting the class tells their customer
that they'll do the first 30 or 40 trades for them,'' Feigin said.
``At what point do they have to assume the fiduciary responsibility
to see that those investments are suitable?'' Feigin is also
concerned that day trading is attracting those investors who can
least afford to do it. ``I know of one 23-year-old man, with no
visible means of support, who took out a second mortgage on his
house to pay for one of these classes,'' Feigin said.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Van Hochman, a dive-master in the Florida Keys who says he
once made $27,000 in a single day of trading, said that the proper
attitude was central to succeeding as a day trader. Investment
professionals, he added, seem to have the hardest time sticking
with day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Friedfertig agreed. ``Sometimes people who have been successful
in life find what we do pretty challenging,'' he said. ``Part of
successful day trading is being wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Houtkin, a longtime supporter of day trading who is the
chief executive of All-Tech Investment Group, a day-trading firm in
Montvale, N.J., said: ``If you're going to be a trader, you have to
view it as a business. Otherwise the market will clean your clock
without any hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Collins of Glastonbury, Conn., is a day trader who has
had a tough time hanging on. When he began trading stocks on line
from his home in September 1996, his wife had recently died and
Collins had quit a job in the computer industry to spend more time
with his 8-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After taking an evening course from Broadway Trading, he moved
into day trading. Two or three months later, however, Collins
thought that he was losing too much money, perhaps because he was
trading from home, without the presence of trading colleagues who
could offer valuable advice. So in September 1997, he began trading
at a Block Trading office in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Even that move didn't produce the results that Collins was
banking on. Discouraged, Collins recently took a job with a
financial service company. ``In terms of making a profit,'' he
said, ``I would have been better off putting the money in a mutual
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Even successful day traders seem to be able to stand the
pressure-cooker atmosphere only so long. Ray said his goal was to
make a million dollars and retire at 30, when he might become a
teacher. Van Hochman, who is 37, is also reconsidering his
priorities as a day trader.
</P>
<P>
   His father taught him how to chart stocks when he was 11. He now
spends most of his time teaching other day traders instead of
trading himself. ``Before I lost my father, he had four heart
attacks and triple-bypass surgery,'' Van Hochman said. ``I still
have a need to day-trade, but not at the level that I used to.''

PINBALL STILL ALIVE IN AN ELECTRONIC WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., Calif., Ill.)   (af)  
 By BRIGID BUCKMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age of video games, home computers and virtual-reality
snowboarding at the mall, pinball games may sound like something
from the 50s, or from, at best, the glory days of the Who and its
rock opera, ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   But pinball, like ``Tommy,'' revived on Broadway a few years
ago, has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, there was some worry about its future. Beaten
down by the advent of the video-game craze spearheaded by games
like Pac Man and Space Invaders in the early 80s, by 1984, pinball
controlled only 5 percent of the coin-operated game market it had
once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Though both video and pinball games were using digital
computerization (pinball went solid state in 1977), video had
captured the imagination of the markets' quarter poppers and was
poised to deliver an animated death kick to an American
recreational icon.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the third annual Pinball Fantasy _ a combination of
trade show, collectibles and competitions _ drew 1,200 people to
the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., and the evidence of pinball's
survival was loud and flashing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Vending Times, which tracks the use of
coin-operated games, by 1994 the silver ball had rebounded for a 38
percent take of that market, roughly $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The future is not assured. Home game consoles and the Internet
have eaten into pinball's market share as more people choose home
entertainment over visits to bars and bowling alleys, pinball
machines' more lucrative locations. But the 1997 figures were still
strong, at $1.7 billion, roughly matching the coin-operated video
market's take.
</P>
<P>
   Pinball's successful retaliation against the video threat was a
result of a number of design developments, said Joe Kaminkow,
executive vice president of engineering and design for Sega
Pinball.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of multiball bonuses, gadgets like trap doors and
moving hands that grab the ball, three-dimensional play fields
embellished with ramps and ball traps, and most important, the
introduction of a dot matrix animation system that feeds scoring
and strategic information to the player in a display above the back
glass, gave the ailing market a boost. The dot matrix display unit,
now a mainstay, was first seen in a game called Checkpoint in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminkow, the designer of Checkpoint, explained the effects dot
matrix had on the game. ``Dot matrix allowed you to get information
to the player in a different way with pictures, and it also allowed
us to explode our scoring band,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring band, denoted in the graphics display above the
backglass was once limited to five- or six-digit point tallies but
became capable of delivering scores in the hundreds of millions.
Fast-paced graphic effects combined with huge scoring possibilities
rallied players back to pinball en masse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compact-disk sound quality via a digitally compressed system
became the status quo in 1993, further enhancing the ever-evolving
three-dimensional play field designs. Pinball games like Sega's
latest, ``Lost in Space,'' usher the player through a jamboree of
lightning-quick, sound-intensive stimuli as gravity maneuvers the
80-gram silver ball toward the ball drain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is this mosaic of technology too much to absorb for the average
player? Apparently not, given the lines of people waiting to play
X-Files, Champion Pub and other top-of-the-line pinball games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shelley Glazer, 41, a dermatologist from Oakland, Calif.,
enjoys the newer designs. ``The more challenges to figure out, the
better,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Zwas, 25, a technical writer from Ithaca, N.Y., went to
the pinball show in Las Vegas to check out the assortment of games.
Zwas, like Dr. Glazer, preferred the modern, multifaceted games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about the new ones is that they're fast and
exciting, and when they're done well, they're really
entertaining,'' Zwas said. But despite his preference for high-tech
action, he shuns videos, he said, favoring the physical action of a
good game of ``pin.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two manufacturers responsible for all pinball machines
currently being produced _ Sega Pinball of Melrose Park, Ill., and
Williams Electronics Games in neighboring Chicago _ both had
designers at the event.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a way to take pinball to its next level (as Harry
Mabs did for the industry in 1947 with his flipper invention, which
made all machines built up until that time obsolete), both
companies looked to players in action for inspiration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jon Norris, one of Sega's top designers as well as an acclaimed
pinball wizard, is hard at work on Sega's hush-hush Project X.
Likewise, Williams Electronics Games is preparing to deliver its
covert Project 2000 in early 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players are speculating that anticipated designs may borrow from
pinball's rival, video, by working a monitor into the back glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give them something they can't have at home,''
said Louis Koziarz, a pinball software engineer at Williams. ``It's
one thing to play the pinball simulation on your PC, but to have
jumping Martians and a saucer that shakes things, moves and talks,
that's the real magic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If pinball seems complicated enough without further digitized
enhancements, worry not. The basic principles have remained the
same. Flippers are your friends, gravity your enemy; keep your eye
on the ball and be sure not to tilt.
</P>
<P>
   And for when you're aiming for that high score, Kaminkow offered
this age-old strategic advice: ``The most important thing to
remember about pinball is shoot the blinking light.''

DRESSED TO EXCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a fashion fantasy, from the glitzy
over-the-top clothes to the costumed dogs to the fireworks
exploding overhead and on stage like a Fourth of July spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Passport '98, sponsored by Macy's and American Express, raised
$2 million last week for AIDS/HIV and gave the hipsters and
philanthropists of Los Angeles and San Francisco a night of fantasy
and fashion. Think of a haughty New York runway show, a sassy Las
Vegas revue and Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade and,
well, you've got the idea. There were major stars, familiar faces
and sports figures on the stage and in the seats, but the hosts _
Elizabeth Taylor, Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson and k.d. lang _ were the
big draw.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport on Saturday
night, a sold-out audience of 2,800 screamed when Johnson came out
and asked them if they were ``dressed to impress.'' They screamed
again when lang and supermodel Christy Turlington were introduced,
but gave a standing ovation in silence to Elizabeth Taylor as she
made her way to the podium on the arm of Johnson. Although she
looked tiny and frail, her message was loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for those from whom we've turned away,'' she said,
reminding the audience and the press that more research and
services to stop new AIDS infections are needed. But her comment,
``Now is the time for guts and God,'' brought the house down.
</P>
<P>
   The show began with a dark and stormy special-effects scene, and
out of the mist, male models paraded the stage dressed in
head-to-toe black. Before Passport '98 finished with swing dancers
in bobby socks, we were treated to lang's Tom Jones-esque
performance of ``What's New Pussycat,'' Mickey and Minnie Mouse
doing magic tricks, and a bunch of models in Levi's new dark denim
jeans carrying construction supplies. In a reversal of construction
site roles, the women in the audience provided whistles and
catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the Passport show is provocative in its presentation,
and the Calvin Klein underwear parade with models stripping off
their T-shirts and tossing them into the audience was a crowd
pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   More serious fashion was provided by Hugo Boss, Elie Tahari, and
L.A. designer Shelli Segal of Laundry, followed by whimsical hats
by Marsha Akins and a Bohemian rhapsody-themed finale that featured
lavish and eccentric gowns with feathers, fringe, lace and velvet
designed by Emanuel and Jessica McClintock.

THE MAN BEHIND BOOKTALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's about as low tech as high tech gets: Call a
number, punch in a few digits and hear top authors talk about their
newest books. It's BookTalk, the little feature that runs on the
Sunday book pages of 34 papers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The service itself is simple. Angelenos can call BookTalk at
(818) 788-9722 or (310) 582-8820 to listen. Every week, papers list
codes for up to 25 new books, chosen from a broad smattering of
genres, said company founder David Knight, whose office is in
Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Dial and listen. Simple.
</P>
<P>
   Free, too, unless you're calling long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, there are real nuggets, such as former
sportswriter Dan Jenkins (at code 4206) talking about his ``Semi
Tough'' quasi-sequel, ``Rude Behavior,'' with protagonist Billy
Clyde Puckett now general manager of an expansion football team.
</P>
<P>
   As Jenkins says in his rich Texas drawl, ``the characters are
about as politically incorrect as they can be,'' and proves it with
a character's great line about marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Though the service tapes a wide variety of authors, well-known
writers, especially of fiction, draw the most interest. Just as
importantly, Knight said, well-spoken authors really can help their
own book's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Authors who are good speakers without a doubt do better,''
Knight said. ``People will tell their friends to call. If the
author has a good voice, we know it will do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent good listens include Richard Preston, whose
nonfiction ``The Hot Zone'' briskly detailed the horrors of the
ebola virus, talks about the cloak-and-dagger source work he had to
do to research his first novel, also about a killer virus, ``The
Cobra Event'' (at code 2850).
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Craig's comments about his ballyhooed novel of a
severely dysfunctional Hollywood clan led by a fading male movie
star, ``The Martini Shot,'' (code 4961) are all the more intriguing
for Craig's disclaimers that it's not mere thinly veiled
autobiography. Craig's mother is Sally Field, and her longtime beau
was Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Among others who have attracted a lot of callers over the years
are George Plimpton, Amy Tan, ``Galloping Gourmet'' Graham Kerr and
former ``Avengers'' star Patrick MacNee, Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   About the toughest recording session was one with Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, whose heavy German accent forced five takes, Knight
said.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners can go to a specific code, or hit the browse function
to listen randomly. The calls are limited to 15 minutes, because
Knight found some listeners stayed on so long at night that they
fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who describes himself as a ``big book lover,'' said he
started the service as a way to tell friends about books he liked.
Since then, it has grown and prospered into a busy little business,
with 30,000 to 35,000 calls a week around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's considering adding some actual high-tech touches to the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena-based Internet service provider Earthlink Networks, for
instance, has cut a deal to give new customers any book on BookTalk
in exchange for signing up. And Internet booksellers have been
inquiring about incorporating the audio into their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a nice little service based in the Valley,''
Knight said. ``I thought there'd be another book line out there,
but in all the years since I've been doing it, I've never heard of
another.''

WHERE ALIENATION SELLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COSTA MESA, Calif. _ At one entrance to the Lab Anti Mall stands
a whimsical sculpture combining a head of Buddha with a disco-style
mirror ball. New Age spiritual, 1970s revival _ they sell it all
here.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Paul and I agreed to meet by the sculpture. As I
waited, I noticed the word ``Feel'' painted in huge letters on the
adjoining wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Lab, opened in 1994, the brainchild of a developer named
Shaheen Sadeghi, who came to the project with a background in beach
wear and a business degree, is postmodernist retailing. Just as
advertisements joke about advertisements, this is a mall that jokes
about malls.
</P>
<P>
   Paul belongs to the target demographic for the Lab. A wry, not
to say cynical, Gen X'er, he works in software and on weekends
pursues recondite interests in Betty Page pinups and rockabilly
revival music. ``I like strange subcultures,'' he told me when he
invited me to the Lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, like a regular mall, they're trying to get you to
spend money, but they try to make you feel hip and trendy,'' Paul
explained. ``Have you seen the book `Commodify Your Dissent?' It
has some eye-opening material about how the marketers have adopted
alternate life styles to sell goods.''
</P>
<P>
   As I waited for Paul to arrive, I thought that the Lab's central
lounge, with its seedy furniture, was just the place to read that
book, edited by Thomas Frank and Matt Weiland (Norton, 1997), a
collection of essays about the commercial co-opting of
countercultures.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this was no more news than Jimi Hendrix music tracked
onto Pontiac Sunfire commercials, especially at the Lab, a
converted canning factory where the ambiance is decay _ bare
plywood, exposed rebar reinforcing steel and cracked concrete. But
vines and flowers grow over everything.
</P>
<P>
   I visited the Lab when it opened and expected it to have faded
by now. Its esthetic was then part grunge, part ``Road Warrior'' _
a postapocalypse, postindustrial vision of the future now situated
well in the past. But the Lab has survived changing countercultural
trends and updated its own market. Several stores have given way to
new ones _ beads have been replaced by sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   The anchor tenant is Urban Outfitters. This year, its grungy
graphics have been replaced with a modern sans-serif typeface.
Other enterprises include a Tower Alternative _ emphasizing
nonmainstream CD's and books, along with a skateboard shop and a
sunglasses store called Nana. A store called Decor Deluxe offers
secondhand furniture, as well as such objects as velvet paintings;
it also offers a bridal registry. At the two ends are a new Cuban
restaurant, Habana, and a cafe called the Gypsy Den.
</P>
<P>
   Can ruins fall into ruins? Part of the answer I found in
``Commodify Your Dissent,'' which in a critique more Mencken than
Marx argues not only that marketers sell alienation and cynicism
back to the alienated but also that it's important for commercial
culture to create subcultures, then process them through the system
as fast as possible, leaving few remainders to discount.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the book, I noticed with a start a reference to this
place itself. In an essay on wealthy Orange County, Calif., ``The
Gaudy and the Damned,'' Tom Vanderbilt argues that the Anti Mall is
as paradoxical there as the county's private prosperity and
political bankruptcy. But I thought the opposite: only the very
wealthy could afford the indulgence of decrepitude, like artificial
romantic ruins in an English garden.
</P>
<P>
   And only the very cynical can afford the luxury of this much
anti-luxury. What is really for sale at the Anti Mall is attitude _
the retailers' visual acknowledgment that we know you know we are
selling you. For a generation that grew up on Pop Tarts and Wacky
Packs and Gerald Ford as both President and ``Saturday Night Live''
joke, that's more of a comfort _ a more welcoming ambiance _ than
any number of food courts or sitting lobbies. Irony is the means by
which the huge lumbering machinery designing and marketing goods
around us not only disarms resistance to consumerism but actually
grows stronger with homeopathic doses of it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul reminded me that there are real and very slick malls, like
South Coast Plaza just a couple of miles away. What, I asked him,
would happen if a real mall and an anti-mall should meet? Perhaps,
he said, they would cancel each other out, like matter meeting
antimatter. Or possibly produce a synthesis stronger than either.
</P>
<P>
   As I left, I noticed that the ``Feel'' sign continues on the
ceiling and opposite wall, so that the whole motto reads ``Feel
Real Good.''

   &UR; The Admiral's Attire &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Navy Admiral was being courtmartialed for an incident where he
was found to be chasing a young lady through the hallways of the
hotel in which they were both staying. Neither of them were wearing
anything. One of the charges was that of `being out of uniform.`
</P>
<P>
   The Admiral's lawyer argued that the officer was not out of
uniform, as the regulations read: `A Naval officer must be at all
times appropriately attired for the activity in which he is
engaged.`
</P>
<P>
   The Admiral was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; School Days &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The teacher was instructing her students on how she expected
them to behave.
</P>
<P>
   `If you have to go to the bathroom, please raise two fingers.`
She demonstrated holding her arm straight up. From the back of the
room came a tiny voice, `I don't see how that's going to help
anything.`

   And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was
not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility.
</P>
<P>
   And God was pleased. And Adam was greatly improved.

   For the first time in many years, a an old man traveled from his
rural town to the city to attend a movie. After buying his ticket,
he stopped at the concession stand to purchase some popcorn.
Handing the attendant $1.50, he couldn't help but comment, `The
last time I came to the movies, popcorn was only 15 cents.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, sir,` the attendant replied with a grin, `You're really
going to enjoy yourself. We have sound now.`

sudden increase in business with enough employees and money to get

<P>
   DUBOIS , Wyo. _ Software can sometimes be put to unexpected
uses. A database system originally designed to create a variety of
maps, some to aid in urban street planning, is enabling researchers
and archeologists to create a permanent record of American Indian
rock art.
</P>
<P>
   What must have seemed permanent centuries ago is now vanishing
because of erosion and vandalism. ``The United States has a
marvelous heritage of rock art, but unfortunately it's being
destroyed at a phenomenal rate,'' said Evelyn Billo, founder and
chief executive of Rupestrian Cyber Services. (Rupestrian is
derived from the word rupes, Latin for rock.)
</P>
<P>
   The company is designing a database to record, preserve and
share information about some rock drawings _ called petroglyphs _
which are sacred to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho
tribal members who live near here on the Wind River Reservation.
Rock drawings, mostly images of animals, birds and other objects,
were methodically pecked out on stone surfaces using sharp rock
tools to convey messages of spiritual journeys or other mysterious
meanings.
</P>
<P>
   Using a program called Arc View, from Environmental Systems
Research Institute, Ms. Billo is helping archeologists and
preservationists to create a CD-ROM with satellite maps that
provide aerial and topographical views of the valley where the
petroglyphs are, photographs and drawings that can be successively
layered and text of data accumulated at the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a filing cabinet approach,'' said Larry Loendorf, a
research professor of archeology at New Mexico State University and
one of the creators of the project. ``Once it's established, we can
keep adding to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The intent is not to release the CD-ROM to the public but to
make it available primarily to those with a vested interest _ the
American Indians whose cultural history was etched into the
relatively soft sandstone rocks of the region and others interested
in conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might indeed be the first program used for the people
whose ancestors made the rock art,'' said Sharon Urban, secretary
for the American Rock Art Research Association in Tucson, Ariz.
``It can also be useful for land management techniques and
visitation impact to the sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the varied land interests at stake, vandalism,
natural erosion and other factors are working against
conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated, complicated issue as to how to protect the
rock art,'' Ms. Billo said. ``Any site that can be reached by car
has been shot up'' _ a reference to how some people use the
drawings for target practice. ``Mistakes have been made _ people
would use chalk to outline the drawings so they would show up in
photographs, or do rubbings right over the rock face, but now we
know just the oil from our hands can affect them.'' Graffiti is
also a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Digital photography and successive image layering, done by Ms.
Billo and Robert Mark, chief scientist of Rupestrian Cyber Services
(www.infomagic.com/rockart), allows scientists and educators to
view changes in the rock surface with a simple mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Using several commercially available software programs, Mark has
created a system of morphing old images with new. For example, a
color photograph taken in 1984 of a drawing of an owl can be
layered with a color photograph taken last month to clearly show
changes in the rock face. In some cases, growth of lichen over the
surface may obscure a drawing or cause the disappearance of more
detailed features of the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   These subtle changes over time can be readily seen when someone
clicks on the left side of the image in a red box for ``1984,''
then on the right for ``1998,'' going back and forth between the
two images.
</P>
<P>
   A database user could begin with the topographical or contour
map, which has some shaded relief, and click on one of the dozens
of white or red dots that indicate individual petroglyphs. Once the
selection is made, the user will be able to view a color
photograph, a tracing (done with string grids, not rubbings) or a
collection of photographs. Along with the image there will be
measurements of the actual drawing, its new ``serial number'' and
any available archaeological data or interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The project is concentrated on the petroglyphs in only one
valley in western Wyoming, just beyond the shadow of the Grand
Tetons. The petroglyphs site here was put on the National Register
of Historic Places in 1990, and that status helped gain some of the
$26,000 in grants used for this project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately we want to have this database available in three
locations _ the Dubois Museum, the school at Fort Washakie on the
reservation and the University of Wyoming in Laramie,'' said Sharon
Kahin, director of the Dubois Museum here, and one of the creators
of this project. ``Maybe we could get Indians involved in recording
their own rock art, or interested in archeology.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it won't be on the Web. ``If we put this on the Internet, it
would bring hordes of people out here who might not just be
satisfied with looking at it,'' Loendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the petroglyphs are held sacred by some. ``Like
religions, you have to respect the Bible, the spirit, when you go
into the church you have to be quiet to show respect for the
faith,'' said John Tarnesse, a Shoshone tribal member and spiritual
leader. Tarnesse, 52, spoke recently at the Aurora History Museum
in Aurora, Co., in conjunction with a photography exhibition,
``Sacred Sites: Journeys of the Spirits,'' about the petroglyphs of
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Others see the cultural history that was carved in stone
thousands of years ago as a disappearing resource, like a native
language. ``When these elders are gone with that knowledge, what
will today's high-school youngster know about the petroglyphs
except that they shouldn't be tampered with?'' said Barbara Sage, a
65-year-old Shoshone rancher. ``With this new process of preserving
the petroglyphs they can learn what petroglyphs mean, when they
came into existence, who did them and why, about traditional
cultural values.'' There is also the possibility of learning more
about the migration patterns of earlier tribes with
cross-referencing details of specific rock art drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Working in conjunction with educators from the reservation,
Loendorf and Ms. Kahin have organized field trips for local
students.
</P>
<P>
   Students from St. Stephens High School on the reservation
visited the petroglyph site this week _ most for the first time.
``It was pretty cool to see they were out there making stuff, to
see what they saw, were thinking, their myths, legends,'' said
Andrew C'Hair, a Northern Arapaho and a 16-year-old sophomore at
the school.``It made me feel proud to be an Indian.''

DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A PROBLEM: HIS NAME IS BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, Oct. 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the intensifying frenzy over Bill Clinton's
ethics and morals _ or the lack thereof _ there are as yet no
credible heroes or heroines. But there are villains and there are
victims.
</P>
<P>
   To millions of Americans, Clinton himself is the arch-villain,
the reckless leader whose disgraceful antics precipitated the
scandal that has totally dominated governmental proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Clinton supporters, the main villain is independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who _ like Javert in ``Les Miserables'' _
has been relentless in his pursuit of a 1990s Jean Valjean: Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate for villain is Linda Tripp, who
surreptitiously recorded the sexual revelations of her then-friend,
Monica Lewinsky, and turned the tapes over to Starr. She is to the
Clinton faithful a reincarnation of Charles Dickens' Madame
Defarge, the French revolutionary who bellowed her approval as the
guillotine severed one head after another.
</P>
<P>
   As for the victims, the foremost is the institution of the
presidency. It is tarnished and in Clinton's embattled hands, it is
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The American people also are victims. They deserve better
conduct by a president who lied under oath about his relations with
a young White House intern. They also deserve better that they've
received from a special counsel who, after an investigation of more
than four years and the expenditure of more than $40 million, is
proposing impeachment of the president on the narrow issue of
perjury and possible obstruction of justice regarding a sexual
encounter that only surfaced publicly nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is a wise and worldly woman who has suffered
through her husband's infidelity for many years, it is difficult to
determine whether Hillary Rodham Clinton is a victim. She is quite
adroit at hiding her true feelings while defending her husband and
pursuing her determination to continue to enjoy the power and
influence that accrue to a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   A true victim, however, is her daughter, Chelsea, who is
pursuing academic achievement at Stanford, while watching from afar
the disintegration of her father's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Democratic Party, which could be a very big
loser. It is the world's oldest and most successful political
party, tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It has known both the grandeur of victory and the shame of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   One illustrious Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, was the founding
father of the enlightened internationalism that was rejected by the
isolationists of his day but has been the basis of American foreign
policy since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Another illustrious Democrat, Franklin D. Roosevelt, changed for
all time the relationship between the people and their government.
Many of the reforms of the New Deal, including Social Security,
remain as integral parts of our system.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cannot, however, point with much pride to the refusal
of their liberal wing to recognize the evil of Soviet communism in
the 1940s or their stewardship of the war in Vietnam in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing Democrats now, however is not the past, but
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the party's current leaders fear they will be pummeled
by voters in November just as Republicans were in 1974 after
Richard Nixon's forced resignation. In that election, the GOP lost
five seats in the Senate and 48 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the debilitating scandal, this should be a
rather hopeful time for Democrats. The president's official
performance continues to command the support of a majority of the
American people. Until fairly recently, it even appeared that
tradition might be broken this year and that the Democrats, who
control the White House, could gain enough seats in November to
reclaim control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   But those rosy dreams have been dashed by the very man who
helped create them: Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a paradox. Clinton helped perform cosmetic surgery
on the party, replacing its old big government, high spending face
with a moderate balance-the-budget, cut-welfare-spending visage. On
his watch, the country has achieved a credible record in the
domestic arena and some worthwhile accomplishments abroad,
including a peace agreement in Ireland and movement toward a peace
agreement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president since Lyndon Johnson, 29 years
ago, to produce a balanced budget. Jobs are plentiful and the
number of individuals living below the poverty level has declined
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Democrats seeking election or reelection to
Congress, Clinton now is a political liability. Where they once
welcomed him into their states and districts, they now shudder at
the thought of him making an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   His obfuscation in describing his liaisons with Lewinsky was, as
Winston Churchill once said of the Soviet Union, ``a riddle wrapped
in a mystery inside an enigma.'' It was meant to confuse and
confound _ and it did so.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, like the Republicans, are well acquainted with
defeat. Previously, they have suffered through long periods of
drought, decreed by American voters.
</P>
<P>
   The longest was from the election of Abraham Lincoln, the first
Republican president, in 1860 to that of Democrat Grover Cleveland
24 years later. From 1860 to 1892, a period of 32 years, the GOP
controlled the Senate, although the Democrats sporadically
prevailed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In the current crisis, some of the party's most prominent
leaders have been caustic in their criticism of Clinton's conduct
and have suggested that he resign.
</P>
<P>
   There is no escaping the fact that the Democratic Party has a
major problem and his name is Bill Clinton.

   NEW YORK _ The sun was setting like a fat tomato behind the
Statue of Liberty just as Armando Babillo hooked a 20-inch sea
bass, flashing silver in the light, from the end of the new $3
million Louis Valentino Jr. Pier at the end of Coffey Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vivo en el proyecto de Red Hook,'' Babillo said, adding
proudly, ``We will have this for Sunday dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez, from East New York, held his hands wide to
describe the 29-inch bluefish he'd caught the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and I ate the whole thing ourselves, at her house on
Pioneer Street,'' said Gonzalez, 36, a carpenter, who learned to
fish right here on Buttermilk Channel. He looked out over the
velvety water as a Staten Island ferryboat steamed by and said,
``They fix it up, and then they make it smell like garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who grew up on Pioneer Street, used to paint ships at
the old 48-acre Todd Shipyard 10 blocks away. The site is one of
three in Brooklyn and one in the South Bronx that are reportedly
being considered for a garbage transfer station after the Fresh
Kills Landfill on Staten Island closes in three years. The site
could handle 10,000 tons of the city's waste a day. A decision is
expected in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of all that garbage looming over Red Hook's
renaissance has natives and newcomers alike shaking their heads.
Sandra Phillips, who grew up on her grandmother's little farm in
Barbados, bought a house on Dikeman Street for $110,000 a few years
ago with her husband, Henry Morales. They renovated it themselves,
and now the backyard is stuffed with plants, from peach trees to
cannas, which have a tropical look.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips arrived in Red Hook a century after its glory days
as a shipping center. It is coming back from a long slide into ruin
as an industrial wasteland and a haven for drug dealers. There is a
sense of adventure, as people renovate houses and lobby for
waterfront parks. And risk, too, as they push out drug dealers and
illegal dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate is booming. Light industry is moving onto the old
restored piers. A bank, a pharmacy and three cafes have just
opened. Red Hook has a spring in its step. But will it falter under
10,000 tons of waste? In the Hook, which has fought off 13 trash
stations in the past, people can't afford to be defeatist.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site for the latest station is a block from a new
esplanade that extends about a quarter-mile into the Erie Basin. On
weekends the walkway, which includes a bike trail, is lined with
people of all ages, fishing and crabbing, or simply watching sturdy
work boats churning past.
</P>
<P>
   The station would lie across the street from 69 acres of fields
used by soccer and baseball teams from all over the city. The
running track and grassy park, shaded by sycamores, is a favorite
picnic ground for thousands of residents from Red Hook Houses, just
two blocks north.
</P>
<P>
   There is new playground equipment in the courtyards of Red Hook
Houses. An alternative school for children interested in science
and the environment just opened in a wing of Public School 27 on
Columbia Street, and children have already been down on the new
pier taking samples of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems shameful that the city would spend all this money to
lift up the community and make people feel good, and then hit them
with a lightning bolt like this,'' Ms. Phillips said of the
proposed garbage site. (Asked if Red Hook would get the transfer
station, Paula Young, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Sanitation said, ``It's premature to comment.'')
</P>
<P>
   Like other newcomers to this little peninsula, Ms. Phillips was
drawn by the salty air and the light, the old stories of Red Hook's
heyday, with ships visiting from all over the world. About 12 years
ago, her family moved into a little basement apartment on King
Street, which abuts Red Hook Houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were shootings almost every night, like the OK Corral,''
said Ms. Phillips, whose daughter, Pearl, was at P.S. 15 when the
principal, Patrick Daly, was killed in a drug-related shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she and Morales bought their house on Dikeman
Street. ``It was the feel of the place that I loved,'' she said.
``It was like a village. I liked the sound of the wheels going over
cobblestones. And you could smell the river. I liked talking to the
old people and envisioning how it was back then.''
</P>
<P>
   How it was a sailors' town, with boarding houses, and bars at
the end of every street. How you could buy a live chicken and have
your hair done on the same block on Van Brunt Street. How people
watched out for each other: if children got into a brawl, their
mothers knew about it before they got home.
</P>
<P>
   The old-timers tell of Red Hook's ruin, too. First came the
Gowanus Expressway, cutting it in half in the early 1940s. Then the
sewer line, so long in the making that people called it the Trench.
</P>
<P>
   The waterfront fell apart when ships began carrying
containerized cargo and moved to deeper ports. Whole blocks of
houses were razed for a Red Hook container port that never
materialized. But the exodus had begun. Red Hook Houses, originally
built for local working people, was converted to subsidized
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was white flight in the late 1950s and 1960s,'' said
Frank Manzione, a real-estate agent who grew up on Hamilton Avenue.
``Businesses began to leave. People started selling property very
cheap, or renting it and not doing the repairs. By the 70s and 80s,
it was a drug place.''
</P>
<P>
   The neglect that made the old houses and industrial spaces dirt
cheap attracted a few hardy souls. Florence Neal and Scott
Pfaffman, both artists, bought a three-story former haberdashery on
Van Brunt Street for $2,500. With six years of ``sweat equity'' _
about $175,000 worth _ they made it livable. They got to know their
neighbors, too, even those on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   There were shootouts in front. The two artists eventually
divorced, Pfaffman moving to Coffey Street, but the Kentler
International Drawing Space that they founded now thrives in the
storefront below. Artists from Venezuela, Mexico, Holland and Italy
show there, and there are poetry readings and live performances.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other artists and actors trickled in, like Bettina Magi, a
painter, who was first drawn to Red Hook by the gallery, and then
by Sonny's, the old sailor's bar on Conover Street, where there was
good music and conversation. Ms. Magi bought a little brick row
house on Coffey Street for $85,000. The house had a little
south-facing yard, but inside it was nothing but debris, peeling
paint, linoleum, dark paneling and roaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the first morning, at 4 a.m., tractor-trailers started
coming down the cobblestones,'' she said. ``There's a box warehouse
next door.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Red Hook in a nutshell. The industrial buildings give it
a virility that artists love. But the manufacturing zone means
truck traffic _ and garbage sites like the one that already exists
on Court Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Magi, who teaches art, is renovating. She has taken down
walls and plastered the others white, and has put in a hardwood
floor and a skylight. Down on the garden floor, a tenant, Richard
Dennis, a painter and carpenter, has ripped out the south wall to
open the view to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, who comes from Pennsylvania, has turned the backyard
into a small farm and built a sleeping shed in the back of the
garden that his friends call ``Africa'' because of its mosquito
netting.
</P>
<P>
   This same spirit of adventure shows at Michael Goodall's
sprawling house and quarter-acre backyard on King Street. Goodall
bought the house for $30,000 about two years ago. Originally a
sailors' boarding house, it was a labyrinth of 28 rooms, decayed
pipes and wiring, and an old furnace stripped of copper fittings by
crack addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Goodall did most of the renovations himself and got to the
garden when he could. The old apple tree was in desperate need of
pruning. He dismantled an above-ground pool, dug a pond and built a
waterfall. The backyard is now a habitat for water lilies, frogs
and birds.
</P>
<P>
   The block feels a lot safer now. And records at the 76th
Precinct, which includes Red Hook, show that serious crimes have
declined steadily for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodall isn't surprised that Red Hook might get the city's
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a map, Red Hook looks pretty good for a
transfer site,'' he said. ``It's right on the water. The highways
are right there. You can just see some intern in the mayor's office
saying, `And there are only 14,000 people there.' That's not going
to put a dent in anybody's election.''
</P>
<P>
   New businesses continue to move into the renovated warehouses on
two piers owned by Gregory O'Connell, a former police detective. He
bought them about 10 years ago, along with 28 acres of waterfront,
from the Port Authority, in a $500,000 deal that required him to
provide waterfront access for the community. Part of the Beard
Street Pier is used for art exhibitions and live performances, and
one side of the pier has just been opened as a public walkway.
</P>
<P>
   Some newcomers, like Story Mann and his wife, Melina
Finkelstein, are taking a wait-and-see approach to buying. ``You
going to pay what they're asking (italics)now?''(end italics) asked
Mann, a carpenter from North Carolina. ``And then pay for a dump?''
</P>
<P>
   Mann may be the lone voice of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Manzione, the realty agent, said: ``About a year ago, we made
our first $220,000 sale on a residential house in Red Hook. It has
charm and a beautiful English-style kitchen and a big backyard. All
the houses in Red Hook are not going to shoot up to that price, but
it suggests what a new house could go for.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, a three-story frame house in Red Hook could be had for
$30,000 to $50,000, Manzione said. ``But you'd have a hard time
getting a mortgage,'' he said. ``It would be a hard thing to prove,
but banks were redlining.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a house like that was selling for more like
$100,000, Manzione said. ``Now it might start at $150,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But getting a developer interested in building a block of
houses under the shadow of a dump is a hard sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So down on Van Brunt Street, the battle goes on. A yellow ``Stop
the Garbage'' poster is taped to the glass of Amandola Grocery. Sue
Amandola, whose grandfather came here from Italy in 1894, never
misses a demonstration. ``I've given out pamphlets,'' she said.
``I've taken signatures.''
</P>
<P>
   And she goes down to the new pier almost every night, for the
sunset. So does Ms. Magi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come home from work, I always stop and look at the
water,'' she said. ``I think of my father coming here, through
Ellis Island. The Statue of Liberty is kind of like a Madonna to
me. And she's looking at Red Hook, not Manhattan.''

SAVE THAT LEGEND! PRESERVATIONISTS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ At a $1,000-a-plate benefit on Oct. 1 with
the actor Brad Pitt as host, this city will toast the restoration
of the Robert R. Blacker House, a national treasure and one of the
celebrated Ultimate Bungalows designed at the turn of the century
by the Arts and Crafts architects Greene &AMP; Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The force of nature drawing movie-industry executives here from
Paramount Pictures, Universal, Walt Disney and the Creative Artists
Agency is the rebirth of a wooden house. Since the 20-room
heavy-timbered mansion, with its covered terraces and sleeping
porches, was built in 1907, deferred maintenance had taken its
toll.
</P>
<P>
   But what seemed to be irreparable damage _ what Pasadena's
preservationists call ``the rape of the Blacker house'' _ occurred
in 1985, when the stately home was stripped of approximately 60
custom-designed light fixtures, stained-glass doors and window
transoms, many of which were sold on the art market as body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Often, historic buildings are done in by the rising value of
their land. The Blacker house was sabotaged from within, by its
irresistible lamps and lanterns. Barton English, a collector from
Texas, bought the house from its owner, Marjorie Hill, for about $1
million and within weeks of its purchase had dispersed the lamps,
some for his private collection and some for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hill said that at the time she couldn't understand why
English kept counting the fixtures. Speaking by phone from
Fredericksburg, Texas, English said he was basically acting on a
comment made by Randall Makinson, who at the time was the director
of the Gamble House (another Greene &AMP; Greene masterpiece in
Pasadena), which was relayed to him: ``Randy Makinson mentioned at
a party in Pasadena that the house was for sale and that anyone who
bought it could make a killing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lamps fetched $100,000 each, and at least one of the
more imposing chandeliers sold for about a quarter of a million
dollars. A handful of fixtures was sufficient to cover the price of
the house. (English declined to give figures.)
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena citizens, including Makinson, loudly declared their
outrage, and with the support of Pasadena Heritage, a preservation
group, the city passed an emergency ordinance that slowed further
removal of the pieces. Citizens guarded the house in cars parked
out front.
</P>
<P>
   English sold the Blacker House in 1988, never having lived in
it. The removal of the fixtures had violated the integrity of
Greene &AMP; Greene's design. The brothers had created interiors that
were symphonies of carefully orchestrated parts, and suddenly the
first violin section was missing in every room. One of the finest
works of American architecture had been desecrated.
</P>
<P>
   Its saviors were Harvey and Ellen Knell, who had kept loose tabs
on the house since 1981. ``We drove by and stopped, and I didn't
care what it looked like inside,'' Knell, 54, recalled. ``I loved
the house. I wanted to buy it.'' Even though the couple were in
escrow on another Greene &AMP; Greene house, they leaped at the chance
to buy the Blacker house when they learned it was being sold in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Knells, working with Makinson, now a restoration architect
with a specialty in Greene &AMP; Greene, and James Ipekjian, a master
craftsman, have restored the shell of the building inside and out.
The last of the 60 lamps replicated by Ipekjian was installed on
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was granted an audience with a couple of originals in New
York,'' Ipekjian said.
</P>
<P>
   Knell, an investor whose family once owned a chain of building
supply stores, said, ``We didn't do anything we didn't need to do,
but we needed to do much more than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blacker house was predicated on grandiloquent
understatement: Charles and Henry Greene had developed a democratic
style popular among social liberals with progressive ideas about
women's suffrage, national parks, healthy living environments and
the development of an American architectural style independent of
Europe's aristocratic architectural attitudes. Living simply
amounted to a virtue, and a crafted house represented moral
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena itself lies at the foothills of the majestic San
Gabriel Mountains, and the Greenes landscaped the original
five-acre site with a quarter-acre lily pond and a timber pergola
stretching toward the view of the San Gabriel Valley. They
conceived the house as a pavilion in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Mr. and Mrs. Knell start relating their saga
while on the covered terrace off the living room, which delivers
the epiphany of the house: on a brilliant Saturday afternoon, with
the close-up view of the mountains and gentle breezes touching the
skin and rustling the leaves, there is little reason to think that
heaven could be any better.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of the Greenes was their ability to visualize and
idealize this nature architecturally, through materials, forms and
metaphor. The open timber framework allows breezes and views
through the house.
</P>
<P>
   This newly re-established state of grace was the result of four
years of planning and hard work. The Knells completely rewired the
house and redid the plumbing, upgraded its structure to withstand
earthquakes and threaded ventilation ducts through the framework.
They removed every shingle, stripped the timbers back to the grain
and replaced nearly all the tail rafters cantilevering beyond the
roof line.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the early architectural efforts to bring the outside
in, the Greenes detailed the major rooms to resemble the timbered
porches. Inside, the terrace's wood columns and trusses are
suggested with appliques of mahogany and teak, so that the rooms
evoke the open-air spaces protected by parasols of wood.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, the frieze ringing the top of the wall is a
shimmering gold-leafed version of the lily pads that once floated
in the pond. Baskets of stained-glass flowers are suspended from
ceiling beams that seem an indoor arbor _ like the wisteria
dripping from the heavy beams of the pergola in the yard. The
blossoms of light in the living room cast light up onto the
mahogany beams. ``The lamps are more important for the effects they
produce than for their presence as separate objects,'' Mrs. Knell
said.
</P>
<P>
   For public tours, which begin on Oct. 2, and for the benefit
Thursday night and for another one on Saturday for Pasadena
Heritage, museums and private collectors have lent furniture that
might have been used in the house, including some Blacker originals
designed by the Greenes. Otherwise, the Knells are living like
Bedouins.
</P>
<P>
   With the restoration of the house's shell, they have just
started to furnish the rooms: they have only bought Oriental
carpets. The Knells and the youngest of their three sons, Lorin,
are using the expansive mansion as a two-bedroom house, with a
family room in the old billiard room in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The teak-paneled entry, with a massive stairway and beamed
ceiling, is one of the most dazzling domestic visions ever built in
the United States: the Greenes structured the staircase and
upstairs landing with heavy brackets, corbeled beams and a woven
wood handrail. Stained-glass doors on either side of the front door
open for breezes that cross the space to the wall of doors at the
far side facing the garden.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner landing, where the staircase turns, a bay window
of stained-glass grape vines emphasizes California's beneficent
climate, as do the Japanese-inspired lamps hanging from the beams
of the entry way: the Greenes are again suggesting that the inside
is really an outside space. One of the most brilliant touches is
the redwood frieze on the second-floor landing, wire-brushed so
that grain patterns recall skies striated with clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Painstaking chromatic archaeology revealed that a dusty green in
several shades was the original color of the plaster walls. ``The
dark color gives life to the wood,'' Mrs. Knell said. ``The white
we found when we bought the house made the wood look dark and
dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Poking about in basement cavities, the restoration team found
small slivers of the original shingle, retaining remnants of color.
They located the paint company that originally produced the
transparent oil stain _ again, a dusty green.
</P>
<P>
   Each shingle was hand dipped in the stain (reformulated and now
sold by the company) and today the facade is a lively but gentle
chromatic mix: green on the shingles, brown on the structural beams
and natural blond on the frame holding the screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in 50 years we've seen the exterior of a
Greene &AMP; Greene house the way it should be,'' said Makinson, author
of a new book, ``Greene &AMP; Greene: The Passion and the Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the colors encourages the interpretation of the
house as a garden pergola that happens to have plaster walls.
</P>
<P>
   The house is not a wall building, like the many Spanish
colonials in the neighborhood. It reads instead like a skeletal
frame structure with panels that can be imagined away to allow
views of the nature that infuses the design and makes the house
thoroughly and innovatively American.

<P>
   Most household cutting jobs consist of slicing through paper,
cloth or wood. Do-it-yourselfers can easily handle these cutting
chores although sometimes cutting lumber to size can present
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consider plywood, for example. It's easy to cut but often the
saw splinters the wood and leaves an unsightly edge as it cuts. One
way to avoid this is by putting a strip of masking tape along the
cut line and then sawing through the tape and board at the same
time. Another way to get a clean cut is by scoring the cut line
with a sharp utility knife before cutting.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using a hand saw, the good side of the panel should be
up. The saw will splinter the bottom, i.e. the bad side, as you
push down. The reverse is true if you cut plywood with a circular
saw. The good side of the panel should be down because the sawblade
cuts as it comes up. You will also get a smoother cut with a
circular saw if you use an 80-tooth carbide blade in the saw.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting down the center of a full 4 feet by 8 feet sheet of
plywood can be awkward because you have to reach off balance to
make the cut. The job can be made easier if you lay a few 2 by 4's
on the work floor first, then position the plywood panel on these.
The 2 by 4's should be parallel to the cut. Adjust the depth of the
blade on your saw so it just goes through the plywood. Now you can
push the saw as you kneel directly on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting through masonry and ceramics is difficult because these
materials are hard and they require special tools or cutting
blades. You can cut into a concrete block, or paver, with your
circular saw, provided you use a masonry blade. Do not attempt to
cut completely through a thick block of concrete, instead slowly
cut a groove about 1/2-inch deep on all four sides. Then use a
heavy hammer to break the block in two. This will leave a rough
surface at the break.
</P>
<P>
   If you require a clean cut, you can rent a concrete saw fitted
with a diamond cutting blade. It can cut to a depth of four inches.
Sawing through concrete creates a lot of dust and noise. Try to
work outdoors whenever possible and be sure to wear appropriate
eye, hearing and dust protective gear.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a special saw or blade to cut bricks, but there
is a knack to doing it. An experienced mason can cut a brick in
half simply by whacking it with the edge of a heavy trowel. This
technique takes a bit of practice to master. Most do-it-yourselfers
will find it easier to break the brick by striking it with a hammer
and wide masonry chisel.
</P>
<P>
   There is another technique for cutting a brick. Score a groove
about 1/8-inch deep in the top of the brick with a cold chisel.
Place the brick on a half-inch dowel or pipe, grooved-side up, so
the dowel is directly under the groove. Press down on both ends of
the brick to snap it in two.
</P>
<P>
   Tile installations always require trimming a few full-sized
tiles into narrower widths. Professional tilers use a wet saw for
this. The tool has a circular diamond blade. A water jet directed
at rotating blade cools it and washes away tile debris.
</P>
<P>
   This tool is particularly effective for cutting thin pieces of
tile. It also leaves smooth edges at the cut. This is important if
those edges are to be left exposed. The wet saw is essential for
cutting tiles made of marble and stone. A cutting saw can usually
be rented at tile suppliers, but it can be expensive. Also the tile
saw is big and requires two people to move it to the job site.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers may find it easier and more economical to rent
a snap cutter. Strictly speaking, the term ``cutter'' is a misnomer
because the tool does not actually cut the tile. Instead, it breaks
it along a scored line.
</P>
<P>
   Snap cutters are available in various configurations, but they
utilize the same cutting principle. The tile is placed on the bed,
over a raised cutting bar.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp cutting wheel is drawn across the tile face. The wheel
does not cut the tile but only scores the surface. Pressing down on
the cutting arm puts pressure on the edges of the tile. On either
side of the cutting bar are soft rubber pads that ``give'' when
pressure is applied. The pressure on the tile ends makes it snap at
the cutting bar. If the break leaves a rough edge, you can smooth
it with a rubbing stone. &QL;

   Q. How can people find out if their home computers have a Year
2000, or Y2K, problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. Even if you don't have an aging mainframe machine sitting in
your living room, Y2K compliance is still important. One way to
check out your system and software before the big day is to list
all your computer equipment and programs according to the company
that made each item. The Vendor 2000 site has a lengthy list of Y2K
compliance information submitted by computer and software companies
(www.vendor2000.com). If you don't see an item, you may want to
visit that company's Web site for news on Y2K upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Tech Net has a list of the company's products and
how they comply with the problem (www.
microsoft.com/technet/topics/year2k/default.htm). Apple Computer's
Y2K Web page (www.apple.com/macos/info/2000.html) boldly states
that Macs and most Mac software can handle dates ``for the next
27,940 years,'' but it posts steps for testing Mac programs. The
Year 2000 Information Center is a good place to find out more about
the problem (www.year2000.com).

 By JULIE MICHAELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Jonathan Harr is a homebody. His world by
day _ and most nights _ is a book-lined study at the front of a
turn-of-the-century Victorian house in this college town. In his
study, Harr spent eight years writing ``A Civil Action,'' a
nonfiction blockbuster that has sold a million copies since its
publication in 1995. The story of an ambitious lawyer with a
passion for social justice, Harr's book follows a lawsuit against
two companies accused of dumping toxic wastes and causing leukemia
in children in Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A meticulous reporter with a novelist's gift for narrative, the
author fashioned a legal thriller out of an enormously complex
case. Even John Grisham, master of the genre, has called the book,
published by Random House, ``the most compelling chronicle of
litigation'' he has ever read.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood agreed. Harr sold the film rights to Robert Redford
and the Walt Disney Co. for $1.25 million. The film, starring John
Travolta, is to open on Christmas Day. For Harr and his wife,
Diane, the windfall was a happy ending to years of struggle. His
$80,000 advance petered out long before the manuscript was
completed. To get by, they relied on Mrs. Harr's salary as a
part-time art teacher. Their one buffer against hard times was
their house.
</P>
<P>
   Within walking distance of Northampton's trendy downtown, the
house sits on a sleepy, tree-lined street, its wraparound porch
reminiscent of an Andy Hardy movie. The couple bought the place for
$86,000 in 1981. But with interest rates at 17 percent, they could
afford it only by converting the upstairs into two rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated being a landlord,'' Harr, 49, recalled during a
late-summer lunch at his house. ``We had only one thermostat, which
meant we paid for the heat. I'd lie in bed at night, hear the
furnace turn over and listen to my money going up the chimney.''
</P>
<P>
   As Harr struggled with his book, he never dreamed of having a
best seller, much less a movie sale. He hoped ``A Civil Action''
would earn enough for a new roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go from $2,500 in the bank to $1.25 million, a
strange delirium sets in,'' he said, reaching down to pet his
creaky basset hound, McPhee (named for the nonfiction master John
McPhee). Finally they asked their tenants to leave, then moved out
themselves, for six months of renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had two priorities: Harr's office and the kitchen.
Although south-facing, the office was darkened by the overhanging
porch. During endless months of reading and annotating court
documents _ stacked up, they'd have stood as tall as a three-story
building _ he had longed for light. ``I look back,'' he said, ``and
it seems to me it was always winter, always dark. I felt I had
lived eight years in a cave.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't in his cave, Harr was in the kitchen. Both Harrs
are passionate cooks, as evidenced by a garden heavy with ripe
tomatoes and the chilled orange-and-carrot soup Mrs. Harr had made
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary interviews with architects, the kitchen expanded
and contracted, the study moved upstairs and down. But it wasn't
until the Harrs met Tom Douglas, of the Northampton firm bearing
his name, that they found someone who shared their vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great house,'' Douglas said, ``but the interior was
chopped up into a bunch of small, dark rooms.'' By moving a
staircase and consolidating some rooms, the architect was able to
open up the downstairs area. An addition at the rear _ what Mrs.
Harr calls the ``Victorian ranch'' wing _ was rebuilt with a guest
bedroom, a bath and an expanded dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas left the study at the front of the house. He solved the
light problem by linking the room via an open arch to the former
living room, now a library. The area is flooded by light from a bay
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I envisioned a more formal room, with a library
table and chairs,'' Douglas said. But Harr's work habits required a
couch. He does his best thinking _ and his best worrying _ lying
down.
</P>
<P>
   Like any struggling writer, Harr worried constantly about money.
Midway through the book, broke and mired in rewriting, he
considered applying for a job at a Burger King. That goes a long
way toward explaining his Depression-style spending habits. But he
couldn't resist splurging on the new kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Anchored by a 48-inch professional Viking stove and a Sub-Zero
refrigerator, it is designed to accommodate two cooks working side
by side. One wall is lined with pale maple cabinets, specially
designed by Lance Hodes of Haydenville (Mass.) Woodworking and
Design. The black counter tops are made of Ashfield schist, a local
slate.
</P>
<P>
   But some costs Harr could not countenance. For the kitchen,
Douglas chose a handsome German faucet by Grohe but didn't note
that it listed for $600. Harr rejected it. ``But it haunted me,''
the architect said with a laugh. ``At every meeting that followed,
Jonathan always managed to bring up the Grohe faucet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harr cheerfully conceded that she learned early on not to
miss meetings with the architect. One time, Harr eliminated a
shower in the master bath and counters of crow's-foot schist, a
spectacular black slate with pale flecks that mimic avian
footprints. ``I made him put them back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas confessed that his greatest concern was Tracy Kidder,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who is Harr's best friend and
Northampton neighbor. Kidder wrote ``House,'' an account of the
design and construction of a house in nearby Amherst _ and the
disputes and misunderstandings that occurred as it went up. ``Any
architect would be nervous if he knew the guy who wrote `House' was
scrutinizing his drawings,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   He need not have worried. The Harrs, who spent $300,000 on the
project, said they are delighted. Over lunch, the couple spoke of
their old house _ its faulty wiring, its old furnace _ the way one
would speak of an old friend. They bickered good-naturedly over who
saw it first and just how much they charged in rents. Finally, Harr
escaped to walk McPhee, while Mrs. Harr offered an upstairs tour.
</P>
<P>
   The larger apartment has become a second guest room and the
master bedroom suite, with its fancy counter tops and walk-in
shower. The second apartment became Mrs. Harr's studio. Then she
opened a door to reveal that apartment's old kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we'd keep it,'' she said, ever the pragmatist.
``Jonathan wants to write another book, and you never know _ if we
need the income, we can always rent it out.''

WORLD RELIGIONS: THIS WEEK, CONFUCIANISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIGIN: Confucianism is based on the teachings of a Chinese
philosopher, Confucius, born in Shantung province in 551 B.C.
Confucius first devoted himself to learning, but at age 30 began
teaching that social reformation could be brought about by the
reformation of the individual. By the time of his death in 479
B.C., he had acquired many followers.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTRINE: Ideally, a ruler would be a sage, one who has mastered
the ``li'' _ rites and ceremonies preserving the five cardinal
relations: sovereign and subject, father and son, elder and younger
brother, husband and wife, friend and friend. (His teachings on
filial piety popularized the practice of ancestor worship.) The
sage, or ruler, would then be a model for the masses, appointing to
prominence only those who are models of ``te'' (virtue). All people
could then emulate the models and acquire the highest level of
moral development (''jen,'' or humanity). One of the best-known
sayings that expresses Confucius' philosophy is: ``Do not do to
others what you do not want them to do to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Confucianism became the official orthodox position during the
Han dynasty (206 B.C.-220); however, it fell into decline for about
600 years. Neo-Confucianism, which showed Taoist and Buddhist
influences and sought to transform the human mind into the Mind of
Heaven _ the state of perfected excellence _ gave Confucianism a
new lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   Although Confucian orthodoxy has survived in Taiwan, only in
Hong Kong and among Chinese scholars working in the West is there
serious, ongoing Confucian philosophy. Traditional Chinese ethics
still stem from the teachings of Confucius, however.
</P>
<P>
   MEMBERSHIP: About 5 million worldwide, with more than 99 percent
residing in Asian countries; 27,000 in North America.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNIFICANT WRITINGS: Two of 13 classics are The Analects of
Confucius, a compilation of his sayings, and the Meng-tze, a
compilation of the teachings of his follower, Mencius.

GM TO OPEN DOORS OF ONLINE NATIONAL SHOWROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The burgeoning Internet has often been compared with the
automobile industry in the early days of mass production. Now the
big auto makers want to take more of their business on line.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors Corp. intends to become the first auto maker
to offer nationwide Internet shopping for the cars and trucks
sitting on participating dealers' lots.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced this week that GM Buy Power (www.
gmbuypower.com), a Web site, would start operating in the first
quarter of 1999, enabling customers to do everything over the
Internet except actually buy and take delivery of a vehicle, which
must still be done at a dealership.
</P>
<P>
   The online customer will be able to schedule a test drive, ask
the dealer to hold or locate a specific vehicle, find out the
dealer's best price on a selected vehicle and apply for
pre-approved financing from the General Motors Acceptance Corp. The
Web site will list all vehicles in inventory at dealers
participating in the service, with the list updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike such other online buying services as Autobytel and
Microsoft's Carpoint, GM Buy Power will not limit consumers to
shopping a specific geographic area, giving them a wider choice, a
spokesman for GM said.
</P>
<P>
   GM dealers will not pay a monthly subscription fee to
participate in the service and, for the first nine months of 1999,
GM will not charge dealers an enrollment fee. Other services
require a monthly fee in return for limiting the number of dealers
in an area who can participate.
</P>
<P>
   All GM dealers can be part of GM Buy Power if they agree to
certain customer standards; install required computer hardware,
which costs about $1,000, and send a dealership manager through
training.
</P>
<P>
   GM research shows that customers want the time needed to buy a
vehicle at a dealership to be an hour to an hour and a half instead
of the usual three to five hours, said Ron Sobrero, the Chevrolet
general sales and service manager who is a leader of the national
roll-out of the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming too popular with car shoppers for auto
manufacturers to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 percent of vehicle shoppers search the Internet for
information before buying, a number that is likely to rise to 50 to
60 percent in 2000, according to a recent study by J.D. Power and
Associates of Agoura Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   GM's decision to take the online shopping service nationwide
follows a successful test started in October in four Western
states: California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In the test, the
Buy Power site received more than 670,000 visits in its first 10
months, with users spending an average of 11 minutes there, making
it one of GM's most active sites. More than 60 percent of the
dealers in the region participated in the service, and consumers
made more than 300,000 online searches for GM Buy Power dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler Corp. plan to upgrade their
Web sites (www2.Ford. com) and (www2.Chryslercorp. com) to offer
similar listings of dealer inventory and the ability to find out a
dealer's best price. Both currently offer model specifications (but
not listings of specific vehicles) and the ability to get a quote
from a dealer on a car or truck via phone or e-mail.

 NOW PLAYING AT HOUSE MUSEUMS: THE TELL-ALL TOUR

   They weren't interested in going to the beach because they don't
like sand. We'd already eaten lunch and gone window shopping in
East Hampton. All right then, why not take Mom and Dad on a tour of
Eastern Long Island's primary art-history attraction, the
Pollock-Krasner house? It's going to be a big year for Pollock, I
explained, with the retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in
November. Without much enthusiasm, they agreed we should check it
out.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled up to the little 1879 farmhouse on Fireplace Road in
Springs, where Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner lived _ now a
National Historic Landmark _ and signed on for a house tour.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful day, and the setting, with a view of the
wetlands and Accabonac Creek, was picturesque. Still, a gloomy look
was coming over their faces. My parents aren't what you'd call
Pollock people. To them, Pollock, like Kerouac, Ginsberg and Elvis,
was about everything that went wrong with American culture in the
postwar era. To hear them, you'd think he was an extortionist, not
an Abstract Expressionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely hate his work,'' said my mother, a retired
librarian. ``A child could splatter paint like that, too, and the
critics could as easily call it art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about him was crawly-creepy,'' added my father, who
used to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be an upbeat tour, I could tell.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd that pulled up in Jeeps and tiny convertibles didn't
look like tourists. They were chic New Yorkers in black, all
seeming to have perfected an ``I identify with Abstract
Expressionism'' attitude. Our guide, a retired nurse, didn't offer
any of her own opinions about the artist. But she sure did come up
with some facts.
</P>
<P>
   The fact, for instance, that Krasner appreciated the location of
the house (she and Pollock moved there from Greenwich Village in
1945) because it was a mile to the nearest bar _ they didn't have a
car when they first relocated from the city. And the fact that
Pollock was drinking with his mistress when he crashed his car into
a tree in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' Dad said, ``this isn't Norman Rockwell's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in an age of tell-all memoirs and scurrilous social
histories _ the latest rehashing of Pollock's death can be found in
``Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the
Hamptons'' by Steven Gaines (Little, Brown, 1998) _ it makes sense
that guides at house museums would get with the program. And while
some still strain out the pulp in order to present a smooth
historical portrait, others are more inclined to tell all. Even if
the walls don't speak, the guides will.
</P>
<P>
   At Beechwood, in Newport, R.I., tourists are shown a photograph
of William Backhouse Astor Jr.'s sailing vessel, the Nourmahal,
which, it is explained with some winking, is Arabic for ``Light of
the Harem.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunnyside, in Tarrytown, N.Y., where Washington Irving lived
as a confirmed bachelor, an ``interpreter'' discussed the
middle-aged writer's fondness for much younger women.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt residence in Hyde
Park, N.Y., recalled the offhand joke of a guide about a back door
used by certain women who called on FDR.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the guides don't volunteer much, they're pushed by
visitors, with Kenneth Starr-like vigor, to tell all. ``The Jack
the Dripper questions are the worst part of giving tours,'' Helen
Harrison, curator of the Pollack-Krasner home, told me. ``But what
can you do? Some visitors relate to people more easily than they do
to art.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always easy to handle. For instance, the Walt Whitman
birthplace in Huntington Station, N.Y., has been accused of
``erasing history'' by one gay group for not bringing up Whitman's
homosexuality on the tour. ``With us, it's don't ask, don't tell,''
said Kay Carroll, a guide there. ``But if it's relevant to a
visitor, we try to answer questions, and we have books that address
Whitman's sexuality in the gift shop.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hyde Park, Scott Rector, who trains guides, has noticed an
increase in probing questions. ``We tell visitors that we prefer to
stick to what we know from our own research,'' he said. In this
case, it does not include anything about the fidelity of FDR or his
wife. But when ``Empty Without You'' by Rodger Streitmatter (Free
Press) hits bookstores this fall, guides are bound to face more
questions: The book features the romantic-sounding correspondence
between Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I say to visitors who ask is that Eleanor Roosevelt
enjoyed people,'' Rector said. ``If a visitor is adamant about
something, I say I'll have to look into it. You never know who else
is on the tour, and you don't want to offend anyone, especially
members of the Roosevelt family.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Monticello, what some people now think of as a
hotbed of innuendo, guides are facing more questions about the
sexual relations between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, a
slave. Their response is that there's no definitive answer yet, and
that there may never be one. Elizabeth Dowling Taylor, the head
guide there, attributes the increased interest to ``Jefferson in
Paris,'' the 1995 Merchant-Ivory film, as well as to the general
climate of the times. ``We're moving away from the `great man'
approach to history and getting more into personal history,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Less salacious but equally provocative is the revamped image of
305-year-old Philipsburg Manor, which now emphasizes contributions
of enslaved Africans, and Van Cortlandt Manor, where guides
disclose how strangers shared beds at the tavern. Burns Patterson,
a spokesman for Historic Hudson Valley, which owns both, explained:
``We need to make sites exciting and can't rest on a tour that was
written 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So many homes, so many intrigues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Did Charles Dodgson photograph any of his young Alices in his
home in Oxford, England? What do the guides at Georgia O'Keeffe's
adobe residence in Abiquiu, N.M., think about the recent searing
biography by Jeffrey Hogrefe, who contends that the artist
``shamed'' the local church into selling her the house? What do
they say at Nixon's birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif.? And whatever
are they saying at the White House these days?
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts were crossing my mind, like so many squirrels in
the attic, as our soft-spoken guide stood on the lawn, fielding
tawdry questions about Pollock. Finally, after the litany had
ended, she invited us into his studio to turn our attention to what
really mattered _ his art.
</P>
<P>
   Before stepping in, we had to remove our shoes and put on
special foam slippers to avoid marring the paint-splattered floor
of the barn. My parents rolled their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking my shoes off,'' Mom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll go wait in the car,'' my father added. ``There's a
ball game on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, their curiosity got the better of them. Once inside,
they walked around, inspecting the space where so many monumental
works had been dribbled and poured. There were rusty coffee cans
with paintbrushes, old tubes of pigment, pieces of colored glass _
in short, a raw environment where important ideas were born.
Although the preserved splatterings on the floor didn't teach my
mother anything at all (a mess, after all, is a mess), what did
interest her was an article from a 1949 Life magazine, mounted on
the wall. It described Pollock as a ``shining new phenomenon of
American art.'
</P>
<P>
   When the guide informed us that this article was responsible for
making the artist into an international figure, my mother let loose
with a happy ``Hmmph!'' Here was evidence that this splatter-happy
man's status was about the media, not his talent. ``The critics can
do so much for a career,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the little shingled house next to the barn, an old hi-fi
was playing one of Pollock's jazz albums. I couldn't help wishing
that the orderly home I grew up in had been more bohemian, like
this one. My parents fell quiet as the guide pointed out what she
felt was significant: a human skull that Pollock stole from the Art
Students League, a rusty anchor scavenged from the beach and a
monumental abstract painting by Krasner, who spent most of her life
promoting her husband's career and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the guide showed us the tiny room Krasner used as her
studio while Pollock was alive. And in the master bedroom, where an
old electric clock still kept time, she told us that Krasner (who
lived in the house until her death in 1984) had installed the big
bed after Pollock died. When he was alive, they had twin beds. No
comment besides that.
</P>
<P>
   Later, someone noticed a copy of ``Finnegans Wake'' on a
bookshelf and remarked that the couple must have been intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' the guide said. ``The bookmark is
only on page three.''
</P>
<P>
   A drop-leaf table, an elliptical mirror, a collection of
seashells. There wasn't much to see inside the Pollock-Krasner
house, just the modest environment of two people who lived for art,
not things. My parents listened to the guide (who later confided to
me that she thought Pollock must have been ``a horror to live
with'') speak in measured tones about his Jungian therapy and, over
and over again, his drinking. Yet, in the end, they left thinking
about Krasner, who surely would have had things to discuss with
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She promoted her husband for her entire life,'' Mom said, as
we got into the car, ``even when she knew he was unfaithful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so stable and so selfless,'' Dad said. ``And she
painted beautifully, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As we drove away from the historic house of creative bedlam, I
felt purged of my desire for a bohemian lineage. ``Compared to
that,'' Mom said, ``I guess our house is pretty boring, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``Thank goodness,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pollock-Krasner house is open Thursday, Friday and Saturday
by appointment. Information: (516) 324-4929.

MORTGAGE DEBATE: WAIT OR SEIZE THE MOMENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How loooooooow can they go?
</P>
<P>
   With the rates for many mortgages almost a percentage point
below where they were a year ago, prospective co-op and condominium
buyers in Manhattan are asking their mortgage brokers whether they
should take the plunge or wait until the stock market _ or interest
rates _ take another dive.
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on whom you talk to. The heads of New York
City's two biggest mortgage brokerages _ Skyscraper Mortgage and
Manhattan Mortgage _ give intriguingly different advice.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bader, the chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, said he
tells clients who don't have to buy now to ``hold off for six
months.'' Bader, who wrote $750 million in mortgages last year,
predicts that real-estate prices in Manhattan will soften further _
financial parlance for ``go down'' _ and that mortgage interest
rates will also decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dow Jones industrial average's 512-point plunge on
Aug. 31, Bader has been besieged with calls from nervous buyers.
His purchase business _ as opposed to the refinancing of existing
mortgages to take advantage of the low rates _ is down 35 percent
from what it was in September 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his chief competitor, Melissa Cohn, the president of
Manhattan Mortgage, said that the number of customers applying
through her company for a new mortgage, not a refinance, has stayed
almost the same. What have changed are the percentages those new
mortgages represent.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, new mortgage applications made up 76 percent
of the company's $800-million-a-year business. This September, new
buyers made up 59 percent. The number of refinancings almost
doubled _ from 24 percent in September 1997 to 41 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohn is advising buyers to seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to predict the future,'' she said. ``First,
the apartment you love may not be there in six months. Second,
nothing says that prices _ after one month of softening _ may not
turn around and start going up again. And third, interest rates
could go up.''
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between the Skyscraper figures, which show a
significant drop in applications to buy, and those from Manhattan
Mortgage, which show about the same number of applications, can be
readily explained. Skyscraper, Bader said, owes 80 percent of its
business to Wall Street _ brokers, bankers and lawyers. Only 40
percent of Manhattan Mortgage's business comes from Wall Street,
Ms. Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people closest to Wall Street _ the high-flying folks _
may not be coming into the marketplace,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a
vice president with HSH Associates, of Butler, N.J., a financial
publisher that surveys lenders across the United States. ``Whereas
people not connected with it, more middle-market folks, just don't
notice any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have decided to buy, Bader, Ms. Cohn and other
mortgage brokers surveyed this week offered the following advice:
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering whether to go for a 30-year fixed mortgage
or one of the tailor-made five-, seven- or 10-year adjustable
mortgages _ in which the interest rate remains fixed for the first
five, seven or 10 years and then adjusts relative to the prevailing
rates _ consider this. Current 30-year fixed-mortgage interest
rates, which were around 6.69 percent Wednesday, according to HSH,
are the lowest in three decades. So if you're a bit of a gambler,
or if you know you're going to live in your new house for, say,
exactly 10 years, you'll pay less per month with a 10-year
adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   Match the product to the time frame, brokers say. They agree
that if you need a $300,000 mortgage, you'll pay $120 less a month
in the first decade of a 10-year adjustable than for a 30-year
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rates for 30-year fixed loans so low, some buyers
may prefer to pay the extra and relax. After all, over the next 30
years, rates will almost certainly go up. (Remember when mortgages
hit 16 percent during the Carter administration?)
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that with all the uncertainty, you feel most
comfortable by jumping into a 30-year fixed,'' Gumbinger of HSH
said. ``It provides the most stability, but you'll have to pay for
it.''
</P>

   ``The Jesus Principle''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Reinventing American Protestantism''
</P>
<P>
   By Donald E. Miller
</P>
<P>
   University of California Press, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   There's theory, and then there's practice. Charles R. Wade is
telling us how ``to'' do church, and Donald E. Miller is telling us
how some people ``do'' do church.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Jesus Principle,'' Wade _ with the help of Lee and
Carol Bowman _ presents his theology of how to build churches in
the likeness of Christ: ``When the church, `the Body of Christ,'
worships, evangelizes, disciples, ministers, and creates
fellowship, it is doing ... what Jesus did when he was here on
earth, and what he is doing today as he fills the congregation of
believers with his Holy Spirit. ... The church learns to behave as
Jesus behaved. That is the `Jesus Principle.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After perceptively dissecting the nature of Christ and the
church, the Texas minister examines five congregational activities
as well as practical aspects of congregation-building. He is
particularly concerned about ministry to the marginalized, and his
ideas about church vision and personal ``calling'' echo those in
``Experiencing God.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade's decades of ministry experience have obviously provided
him with a wealth of insight. ``The Jesus Principle'' contains
thoughts that will be valuable even to those who don't fully agree
with its moderate Southern Baptist author.
</P>
<P>
   Donald E. Miller, meanwhile, is certainly not a moderate
Southern Baptist, and neither are the believers he has studied; but
anyone interested in the changing face of religion would do well to
pay attention to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are witnessing a second reformation that is
transforming the way Christianity will be experienced in the new
millennium,'' the University of Southern California professor
writes. ``Reinventing American Protestantism'' is a study of ``new
paradigm churches'' that have combined conservative theology, an
emphasis on cultural relevance, and an informal and charismatic
style of worship and organization.
</P>
<P>
   These movements are plainly successful in ways that mainline
denominations are not, Miller says. That is an interesting
observation, because even though his study is arguably sympathetic,
the author is a liberal Episcopalian who makes it clear that he
does not buy into his subjects' theological package. ``Reinventing
American Protestantism'' is a highly readable study that may prove
particularly interesting to those interested in
``nondenominational'' Christianity.

   Early Wednesday morning bands of thunderstorms spawned several
tornadoes across northern Florida as the ghost of Hurricane Georges
drifted slowly toward eastern Georgia. Early Thursday morning,
showers and isolated thunderstorms will speckle the Southeast
Coast. The precipitation will end by afternoon as the remnant
moisture of Georges finally pushes out to sea. Meanwhile, sinking
currents of air in the wake of the system will promote mainly sunny
and very warm conditions from the southern Mississippi Valley to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A band of clouds and isolated thundershowers will accompany a
sharp cold front moving south from the Ohio Valley Thursday. Gusty
winds from the northwest behind the front will import the chilliest
air so far this season into the upper Middle West and interior
Northeast. As the unseasonably cold air gathers moisture in transit
across the still tepid waters of the Great Lakes, roiling cumulus
clouds will form downwind of the Lakes. A few of these clouds will
produce brief, gusty showers of rain, especially east of Lake
Ontario Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will develop over the Front Range of the Rockies and
west-central Plains Thursday as winds from the east moisten upon
ascending the sloping terrain. The showers could turn heavy for a
time as a jet stream disturbance approaching from the central
Rockies intercepts the moist air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore breezes will direct damp and cool air into the Northwest
Coast while generally dry conditions cover eastern sections of
Washington and Oregon. The Southwest will remain mainly sunny and
warm, though patchy clouds will cover the California coastline.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Memorable Storm &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges was a memorable storm. The first advisory for
a tropical depression came near 25 degrees west longitude,
unusually far east in the Atlantic. As the developing system
approached the Lesser Antilles, its top sustained winds reached 150
mph. Though the storm weakened near longitude 60 degrees west, it
marched onward, successfully negotiating the mountains of Puerto
Rico and the lofty peaks on Hispaniola. It then hit Cuba before
battering the Florida Keys and intensifying over the Gulf of
Mexico. The storm then dumped up to 30 inches of rain on parts of
the Gulf States.

   Day trading isn't for the faint-hearted. Like other forms of
investing, it doesn't come with a guarantee that future returns
will mimic any favorable ones of the past. And because day trading
is highly speculative and can easily swallow up large chunks of
cash, experts say it's not an appropriate investment strategy for,
say, savings for retirement or college.
</P>
<P>
   Getting started can be hideously expensive as well. For example,
while some day-trading firms let a customer get started with just
$25,000 in an account, Broadway Trading requires a customer to have
at least $75,000 in a trading account.
</P>
<P>
   Several day-trading firms say that even well-padded investors
can expect to wait six months before they begin making money. And
while they're waiting, it's common to lose tens of thousands of
dollars. For that reason, some firms, like All-Tech, recommend that
new day traders trade only in lots of 200 shares at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs can add up quickly as well. Investors who trade full
time from home, for example, can expect to pay an extra $400 to
$700 a month in phone costs alone, as part of dialing into a
company's trading system.
</P>
<P>
   To cut connection costs, some day-trading firms, like All-Tech
Investments, offer their proprietary services through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure reliability, the firms will also recommend an Internet
service provider.

`ROCKET BOYS': HOW CHASING A STAR STRUCTURED A BOY'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va.)   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fall of 1957, when the Soviet space satellite Sputnik
passed over southern West Virginia one evening, it caught the
dazzled eye of a 14-year-old resident of the tiny coal-mining town
of Coalwood, one Homer H. Hickam Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As Hickam, now a retired NASA engineer, recalls in his
thoroughly charming memoir, ``Rocket Boys,'' the experience changed
him forever. A small, nearsighted, bright and imaginative boy whose
chief activities until that point had been reading science fiction
and playing games with his pals, he at once knew that Coalwood
would be too small for his future.
</P>
<P>
   His hero now became Dr. Wernher von Braun, whom he could imagine
``high on a gantry, lying on his back like Michelangelo, working
with a wrench on the fuel lines of one of his rockets.'' Here was
his ticket out of the hills of West Virginia. Like von Braun, he
would build himself a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately he conferred with his gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll need a countdown,'' one member said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How high will it fly?'' wondered another.
</P>
<P>
   ``High,'' the rocketeer guessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't blow yourself up,'' advised his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In his first attempt at a launch, all he succeeded in getting up
in the air was his mother's precious rose-garden fence.
</P>
<P>
   From these modest beginnings, Hickam builds a story of
overcoming obstacles that is worthy of Frank Capra, especially in
its sweetness and honest sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Hickam's father disapproved of his rocket activity the few times
he even noticed it. As superintendent of the local coal mine and a
staunch company man, he took a dim view of his son's need to bother
the mine workers for equipment and assistance. Besides, he
preferred his older son, Jim, a hero in the town for his
considerable football skills.
</P>
<P>
   The author's mother, by contrast, devotedly backed him. She
hated coal mining for daily endangering her husband and for giving
him the beginning of black lung disease, and she saw her younger
son's obsession with rockets as a way for him to escape the mining
life.
</P>
<P>
   But her support added to the already bristling family tension,
for which her older son blamed his younger brother and incited his
football cronies to pick on him and call him ``sister.'' On top of
all this, the girl the author had a crush on, while happy to be his
friend, preferred football players for true romance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so neatly arranged are the many hurdles that Hickam has
to clear that you begin to see what he means when he writes in an
introductory note that he has ``taken certain liberties in the
telling of the story, particularly having to do with the precise
sequence of events and who may have said what to whom.'' The only
flaw of ``Rocket Boys'' is that its plot seems just a shade too
well made even for a work of fiction, let alone a memoir.
</P>
<P>
   The author's father, while respected, is mildly resented by the
townspeople for his allegiance to the mine owners, and the author
must sometimes pay for this, particularly for being the weaker,
non-football-playing son.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the extremely close-knit community identifies
with his attempt to escape the town's increasingly bleak-looking
future. When, ironically, the local football program is suspended
because of the author's father's overzealous support of the team,
the people of Coalwood have further cause to switch their hero
worship to the rocket boys.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Hickam's plotting seems here and there manipulated, what
always ring true are his adventures in rocketry. Not knowing where
to begin, he turned in desperation to ``the class joke,'' one
Quenton, an oddball loner who seemed to know everything and who was
forever dreaming up quirky ideas that in other hands would become
inventions like Velcro and pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what makes a rocket work, Quenton informed the author of
Newton's third law of motion _ that for every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction _ and together with the author's gang
they were off to the firing range. Before they were finished they
had mastered the higher physics, engineering and mathematics of
rocket propulsion, and they were shooting their creations miles
into the air before an audience of hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   At the climax of ``Rocket Boys,'' the author even recalls a
dialogue about space that he engaged in with no less than John F.
Kennedy during his 1960 primary campaign in West Virginia. You
realize with a shock, as if awakening from what seemed like a
dream, that all this actually happened.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides being a retired NASA engineer and a consultant on
aerospace projects, Hickam is the author of a previous book,
``Torpedo Junction,'' and many articles for publications like
Smithsonian Air and Space and American History Illustrated. But for
all its unusualness as a scientific memoir, what is most effective
about ``Rocket Boys'' is its eloquent evocation of a lost time and
place.
</P>
<P>
   At the end he writes: ``Sometimes now, I wake at night, thinking
I have heard the sound of my father's footsteps on the stairs, or
the shuffling boots and low murmur of the hoot-owl shift going to
work. In that half-world between sleep and wakefulness, I can
almost hear the ringing of a hammer on steel and the dry hiss of
the arc welder at the little machine shop by the tipple. But it is
only a trick of my imagination; nearly everything that I knew in
Coalwood is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing commemorates the site,'' he continues, ``only rubble
and faded signs in overgrown thickets where hundreds of men once
toiled and sometimes died.''
</P>
<P>
   And now memorializing the site is his own touching memoir, which
makes a dark and threatening place seem as golden as the dawn of a
promising new life.

   The New York Times computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier
games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a large difference
between Denver (No. 2) and Jacksonville (3), but much smaller
difference between Jacksonville and San Francisco (4).

   This just in from the World of the Incredible Shrinking
Computer: A Berkeley, Calif., company is testing software that
handheld computers can use to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The new browser, brazenly squeezing in where even Netscape's
Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer have not dared to
tread, is called Proxiweb. It essentially captures Web page images,
then shrinks them to a size and format viewable on the very small
screen of a Palm Pilot or a Windows CE computer.
</P>
<P>
   But are the Web faithful prepared to do their thing on such tiny
devices? ``It's not our world view that people will want to do a
search for `sea cucumber' while sitting on the bus,'' said Tara
Suan, spokeswoman for Proxinet Inc., makers of the diminutive
browser. ``But we do think people may want to access personalized
services like e-mail or My Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus scenario, indeed the Proxiweb model in general, relies
on the growth of wireless modem technology for hand-held personal
computers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company, which is beta testing the software, said
it hoped to sell a commercial product by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, searches for sea cucumbers will have to be done
on the desktop, laptop or the old-fashioned way, in the ocean.

   New Web Radio Will Show Animation to Go With Music
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the nexus of MTV, radio, the Internet and the
late-night laser show at the Planetarium exists FlashRadio, which
its marketers are calling a new concept in radio. FlashRadio
(www.flashradio.com), which is scheduled to debut Thursday,
presents five channels of different music themes, including pop,
alternative and urban. The added touch is that while the music
plays, the monitor fills with a continuous animation show (the
images are not tailored to the individual songs, but to the
channel's ``mood.'')
</P>
<P>
   The station is the product of a joint effort between Sonicnet
(www.sonicnet.com), the popular music entertainment site,
Macromedia (www.macromedia.com), which makes animation software,
and Intel Corp. Nicholas Butterworth, the 30-year-old president of
Sonicnet _ a division of TCI Music _ conceded that there were
already a lot of radio stations on the Internet. ``They have been
great to listen to, but boring to watch,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   How much fun FlashRadio will be to watch may depend on the speed
of your processor. Butterworth noted that a Pentium II processor
was needed for optimal viewing. That is a vast minority of home
computers.

   Some Stanford Students Go Deeper Into Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   Students entering the electrical engineering master's degree
program at Stanford University last week may hold some future class
reunion in an Internet chat room. That would seem about right,
given that some of the students will take all their classes, turn
in all their homework and hold all class discussions online.
</P>
<P>
   Taking courses via the Net has become increasingly common, and
Stanford now is permitting some students to graduate with a
prestigious Master of Science degree without ever leaving the
comfort of their desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The program extends into cyberspace a 30-year tradition at
Stanford of distance learning, which typically has been
accomplished by sending videotapes of classes to remote students.
In the case of the Net, the university will stream the video onto
the Web for student access.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of caveats. To be eligible, students must
work at one of roughly 300 high-tech companies affiliated with the
electrical engineering program. Also, students who participate
online will pay more than their on-campus classmates _ an academic
unit taken via the Internet costs $844, 40 percent more than the
cost of attending classes in the flesh, said Andy DiPaolo,
executive director of the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this new generation of online study would seem to
demand a commensurate advance in student excuses for late work.
Possibilities: ``Professor, the dog ate my modem,'' or ``My
computer contracted a virus. I'm e-mailing a note from tech
support.''
</P>
<P>
   This Space Available on AOL Starting for a Mere $25,000
</P>
<P>
   For the Web surfer who has everything, the new Neiman Marcus
Christmas catalog offers an exclusive spot on the menu of America
Online. The price tag: just $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that is the minimum bid in the auction for the spot,
which AOL calls a ``keyword.'' Typically, these keywords are saved
for general categories such as ``sports,'' or ``news,'' or
sometimes are used to advertise online events for celebrities like
the Spice Girls. The keyword up for auction will be the first
assigned to a regular Joe or Jane, albeit one with some big green
to toss around.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder will get a new computer (perhaps not a big
bonus for someone with $25,000 to spare on a Web site) and help in
designing the content to which the keyword will be linked. There
are some restrictions, however, in that the bidder can use the
keyword only to link to personal content, not for business. The
keyword will be active for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a vanity license plate,'' said Ginger Reeder,
spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus Direct, who knows how to wring an
analogy out of the ``information superhighway'' metaphor.

   A New Way to Kill Some Time While Web Pages Download
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco company wants to capitalize on two rampant
conditions in modern culture _ the World Wide Wait and narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Wait is what some people call the sometimes
excruciatingly slow time that it takes for Web pages to download
for viewing on screen. The Zing Network Inc. (www.zing.com) has
developed a technology that allows Web surfers to scan in and stare
at pictures of themselves, or their families (or their pets) to
pass the downloading downtime.
</P>
<P>
   This interlude is one of several entertainment options offered
by Zing to mitigate the World Wide Wait. The company has signed
deals with Rolling Stone Network, Surfer Magazine and Universal
Studios to provide other images for viewing during the loading
time. Steve Guttman, Zing's executive vice president for marketing
and business development, said the images _ such as still shots of
movie monsters from Universal Studios _ will appear on a monitor
between the time a user calls up a Web page and the time text and
graphics appear.
</P>
<P>
   A survey this year in which Zing participated found that home
modem users wasted 2.4 billion hours a year waiting for content to
download.
</P>
<P>
   So then, these images are somehow enhancing productivity?
</P>
<P>
   Guttman says yes, but he notes it will also cost users a little
bit of attention, as one of every 10 Zing spots will eventually be
advertising. ``Our feeling is if you can make a fraction of that
time more interesting to people they should shower you with money _
I mean, respect,'' Guttman said.
</P>
<P>
   High Failure Rate for New PCs Found in a Magazine Survey
</P>
<P>
   Imagine driving off the lot in a brand-new car only to find that
the radio does not work, the tires are falling off and the steering
wheel will turn only left.
</P>
<P>
   Windows magazine says that situation is analogous to the one
faced far too often by purchasers of new computers whose machines
are dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 6,000 of its readers, published in the October
issue, found that 13 percent of their new computers had come out of
the box with a major hardware failure, most often the modem, hard
drive or monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of performance in any other industry would be
totally unacceptable,'' said Mike Elgan, editor of Windows. ``If 13
percent of refrigerator users couldn't use their new
refrigerator,'' the companies would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., Larry Sennett, does not
like the comparison. He said one reason for the high failure rates
of computer components was that they were ``pretty complex pieces
of electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard fared better than others in the Windows survey.
Respondents reported a problem with that company's PCs at an 8
percent rate, with Dell and Gateway next best at 9 percent. At the
other end of the spectrum were NEC, Packard Bell and AST, each of
which had problems in more than 13 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sennett said the survey, which included users of both home and
business desktop computers, might indicate that the push for less
expensive PCs meant less is being spent by manufacturers on
components. Meanwhile, he offered one solution that sounded
surprising given his position as editor of Windows: Buy an iMac.
``It's a good solution for a lot of people,'' he said, ``especially
novices.''
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, it appears that CMP Media Inc., which publishes
Windows magazine, wanted to eat its cake and have it too. In a
press release, CMP heralded the findings of the survey about the
high PC failure rates, but mentioned only those companies that
fared better than average. CMP apparently did not want to upset the
other computer companies that advertise in the magazine.

 &HT;    Atlanta gets a feel for New York warm-up
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with Broadway-caliber excitement, ``Elaborate Lives''
brings to Atlanta another peculiarly New York tradition: the
three-week preview period.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was only a few years ago that the Alliance Theatre
increased its preview performances from two to five, patrons began
to query the Journal-Constitution a few days after ``Lives'' began
previews Sept. 17, ``Where's the review?'' The answer is that it
will appear Oct. 8, the day after the musical's opening, for only
by that time will the creative team finish its tinkering and lock
in the production for the public record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays three weeks is not perceived as a long time here,''
said longtime New York theater publicist Richard Kornberg. ``So
many journalists worldwide are waiting for word on `Lives' that
Disney's going to make darn sure it's ready to open.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who have e-mailed critiques to the Journal-Constitution
seem to find performances more memorable if there's a glitch _ such
as the stalled pyramid that made an inconvenient humming sound
during one musical number.
</P>
<P>
   New York producers dramatically expanded previews in the 1980s,
partly to wrestle with more technically complex productions and
partly to minimize the risk of critical pans. ``There's a constant
tension between critics and producers over the length of
previews,'' said Jeremy Gerard, an editor at New York magazine and
former chief drama critic at Variety. Recalling a major bomb of the
early '90s, he said, ``After `Nick and Nora' dragged out previews
nine weeks (in the early 1990s), a lot of us (critics) swore,
`Never again.'''
</P>
<P>
   But since then few producers have tried to push previews beyond
four weeks, Gerard adds, ``because advertising has gotten so
expensive, they've gotta take their chances on the free publicity
of a review.''

 &HT;    Quest stops short of great goodbye
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight songs into this, Phife Dawg says, ``You don't stop, and
you don't quit/unless you're in the studio doing whack.'' Maybe
that's why A Tribe Called Quest is calling it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``The Love Movement'' is ``whack'' _ or just terrible.
The pioneering trio's supposed adios to hip-hop (at least as a
group) holds up to the same musical standard set when Tribe hit the
scene eight years ago and went on to brilliantly meld rap's street
grittiness with the smoothness of some jazz. They must have known
that, because Tribe even includes the breezy instrumental track ``4
Moms,'' a rarity on an album in this genre.
</P>
<P>
   But, lyrically, it gives little indication why Q-Tip, Phife Dawg
and Ali Shaheed Muhammad will be missed. They must have known that,
too, because Tribe spends 3 minutes and 18 seconds basically saying
let's get things going (``Start It Up'') and then follows with a
lot of shorter, underdeveloped songs that are rarely reflective of
their capacity for intelligent wordplay. It's like midway through
``Like It Like That'' or ``Common Ground'' someone said, ``Oh, just
forget about it. We've got a hook and a groove.'' So instead of a
great goodbye, we get a danceable ``See ya!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Movement''
</P>
<P>
   A Tribe Called Quest. Jive. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Goo-goo-eyed groove music.

THE MEDICI BEHIND DISNEY'S HIGH ART 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Mass., Mo., Ohio, Conn., Minn.)   (af) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ On a wall facing Michael Eisner's desk in the
sitting room outside his airy office at the Walt Disney Co.
headquarters hangs a single storyboard _ 18 feet long, 2{ feet high
_ with black and white and color pictures of events of the past 50
years and typeset story lines explaining them.
</P>
<P>
   In an entertainment colossus with $22.5 billion in revenues last
year, there is no shortage of storyboards to go around, so it's
interesting that the one hanging there is for a choral symphony by
the contemporary composer Michael Torke, one of two such
compositions that Eisner commissioned to mark the millennium. It
was an idea that came to him while attending Mahler's Symphony of a
Thousand at Carnegie Hall in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like Coke or McDonald's, the Disney name and brand is so
implanted in the culture of the nation and the world that to say
the word is to evoke a wholly defined universe _ in this case
Disney's familiar panoply of antic, animated icons and competent,
comforting family entertainment. To some they add up to
imaginative, benign, pop culture marvels. To others, they're just
superficial cultural junk.
</P>
<P>
   But the storyboard outside Eisner's office is a window onto
another side of the Mouse. Seemingly unnoticed, under Eisner's
watch, Disney has become a purveyor of what can only be described
as high culture.
</P>
<P>
   Such work is, and will surely remain, a small part of the
far-flung empire of Disney and Miramax, ABC and ESPN, Tokyo
Disneyland and the Mighty Ducks. Some argue that it is totally
consistent with the company Walt Disney created.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all the more rarefied projects reflect the tastes of
Eisner, Disney's chairman and CEO, and they are revealing glimpses
into the mind and instincts of a man who can shape culture on a
global basis like perhaps no other person in history.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, whose public profile usually plays out in high-stakes
deal making or ferocious corporate jousting, like his messy
divorces from the former Disney titans Jeffrey Katzenberg and
Michael Ovitz, is first and foremost a businessman responsible to
Disney's shareholders. But he is also a man with deep instincts
about culture, shaped by a Park Avenue upbringing that was informed
by sophisticated experiences with architecture, theater, music and
art.
</P>
<P>
   With Disney's resources and reach, Eisner is playing a role more
like arts patrons or imperial business tycoons of the past than
today's cautious, faceless corporate donors, one that ventures
toward the social engineering of the company's Celebration
residential community in Florida as well as artistic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think back on European history and the support the
churches gave to art and music that later spilled over to the
Medicis,'' said Aaron Jay Kernis, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
music this year and is the other composer commissioned to develop a
choral symphony for the millennium. ``What Eisner and Disney are
doing has the potential to be the new Medicis for our time, if done
in the right way for the best of reasons. It could help new culture
flower when what we're seeing is this overwhelming junk culture.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few hard and fast lines between high art and any other
kind, and Disney officials, ever image-conscious, are uncomfortable
with the distinction, seeing in it the implicit notion that on one
side is the good stuff and on the other the shlock. But whatever
you call it, Disney's output now includes much that doesn't fit the
notion of what is, well, Disneyesque.
</P>
<P>
   There are the two choral symphonies by Torke and Kernis. Torke's
work, essentially looking back on the past half century, has a
libretto by Philip Littell. Kernis' looks into the future and has a
libretto by a Welsh poet, Menna Elfyn. The pieces will be
introduced at concerts in New York, with the details still to be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   There was the decision to bring in Julie Taymor, one of the most
cerebral and innovative theatrical directors and designers, to
transform ``The Lion King'' from the standard Disney animated idyll
into a wonder of contemporary multicultural theatrics and
stagecraft on Broadway. The much-acclaimed renovation of the New
Amsterdam Theater came along as part of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There is Eisner's longstanding and enthusiastic support for many
of the most acclaimed figures in modern architecture like Robert
A.M. Stern, Michael Graves, Robert Venturi, Arata Isozaki, Frank
Gehry, Aldo Rossi and others, to create a body of architectural
work unmatched by any company and perhaps by any contemporary
institution, public or private.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long-delayed new version of the Disney classic
``Fantasia,'' in the form of ``Fantasia 2000,'' with six new
symphonic pieces and three revisions of original pieces performed
by James Levine and the Chicago Symphony. Levine and the orchestra
will introduce the music next winter, beginning with concerts at
Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   There is a $25 million donation that will finally allow the
construction of a grandiose Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los
Angeles that was conceived a decade ago with a $50 million gift
from Walt Disney's widow, Lillian B. Disney. There is Disney's
Young Musicians Symphony Orchestra, the new ``Elaborate Lives: The
Legend of Aida,'' getting ready for its premiere in Atlanta, and a
stage version of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' which will open
in Berlin in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And however one defines her place in the cultural petrie dish,
there is the former New Yorker editor Tina Brown, whose friendship
with Eisner helped lead to her new role heading a media venture
that will include a monthly magazine intended to create films and
television shows for Disney's Miramax subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the face of Disney to go from Mickey Mouse to
Elliott Carter. Some critics have derided Disney's high culture
borrowings, like the film of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' as
far closer to base trivializations than high art.
</P>
<P>
   To many people, Disney is and will always be the quintessence of
junk culture, less vulgar than Jerry Springer or the Fox network
but still a greedy mass marketer of sanitized, shriveled
entertainment.

</P>

   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Long dismissed as a Replacements clone band, this Buffalo, N.Y.,
trio has lately opted for a more commercially viable sound,
beginning with the 1995 hit ballad ``Name.'' The shift has
continued through this summer's overplayed single ``Iris,'' from
the ``City of Angels'' soundtrack as the group has slowly traded
scruffy guitars and souped-up tempos for stadium-size riffs and
sappy platitudes. The slick tricks continue on the Dolls' seventh
album, which mixes formulaic alterna-rockers (``Broadway,'' ``Black
Balloon'') with overblown lighter-wavers (``January Friend''). The
results are catchy, but indistinguishable from Dishwalla,
Collective Soul or any number of other so-called ``alternative''
acts on the scene today.

</P>
<P>
   Chicago's ``insurgent country'' cover boy, singer-songwriter
Robbie Fulks has distinguished himself as the next big thing in a
genre that's become a vague catchall for any act strong enough to
tote around a pedal steel guitar. How dandy it is that Fulks' third
album and major-label debut leapfrogs out of that rut in a variety
of ways. There's plenty of old-line C&AMP;W stylizing (including the
apostate's anthem, ``God Isn't Real''), but the fun comes with the
distorted guitars of ``Caroline'' and the Byrdsian jangle of ``She
Must Think That I Like Poetry.'' Lucinda Williams makes a guest
appearance, as Fulks channels Elvis Costello on ``Pretty Little
Poison,'' a song in which shimmery pop chops and rebel passions not
only co-exist but break a suave sweat.

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   After dazzling listeners with his first solo album, ``North of a
Miracle'' in 1984, the former leader of Brit popsters Haircut 100
has offered frustrated fans only momentary glimpses of his keen pop
sensibilities in the intervening 14 years. Now, here's ``The Apple
Bed,'' which with melodic guitars, gorgeous string quartets, horns
and layered vocal harmonies comes close to being a pop masterpiece.
Like ``Miracle'' which was produced by Beatles ``Abbey Road''
engineer Geoff Emerick, the self-produced ``Apple Bed'' clearly
draws on Heyward's love of '60s pop, but with a '90s sensibility.
How else to explain ``Incredible Agnes,'' a tale of finding love at
the video shop or Heyward's clever insights into his own 1980s pop
stardom, ``The Man You Used to Be.''

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish combo that saw its sophomore release, ``If You're
Feeling Sinister,'' land on numerous year-end Top 10 lists is a
more mature outfit here. Following an album that drew nearly
universal critical acclaim is not an enviable task, but Belle &AMP;
Sebastian have come through. The childlike jangle and youthful
lyrical concerns of the last record have passed through puberty and
come out the other side with a tad more muscularity. The title cut
comes perilously close to rocking. It also appears that primary
vocalist and songwriter Stuart Murdoch has loosened the songwriting
reins. It's difficult to be sure about that from perusing the CD's
sleeve, though. Belle &AMP; Sebastian inhabits a world where bands
don't go in for heavy-handed promotional hype or even such niceties
as credits. It's a much gentler world than ours, filled with
transcendent music.

<P>
   Almost half skits from this record-breaking movie, the other
half songs from urban contemporary stars, the ``Rush Hour''
soundtrack is all fine, although little here is as memorable as a
Chris Tucker screech. But rapper Jay-Z's bouncy ``Can I Get a ...''
and ``Terror Squadians,'' including Big Pun and Fat Joe, loom large
as the better tracks in this sizable collection. Plus, you can file
Case's (``Touch Me Tease Me'') team-up with R&AMP;B vocalist Joe on
``Faded Pictures'' under the pleasant surprise category. As for
``How Deep Is Your Love'' by R&AMP;B quartet Dru Hill and rapper
Redman? Considering their previous work, their efforts here can go
in File 13.

 &HT;    Pop singer wanders into the Gothic mists
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the ashes of a once blazing pyre, the music P.J. Harvey's
making right now is a wind-blown trace marking some powerful,
all-consuming occurrence. The voice on these songs, often
omniscient and a little detached, could belong to a ghost _ a
wandering murder victim from some Appalachian ballad, offering
testimony to those who will pay heed _ or someone recovering from
an alien abduction, or maybe a wan British pop singer, steeped in
the gothicism of Edgar Allan Poe, the primacy of American blues,
the transgressive clamor of Nick Cave and Captain Beefheart and
Pere Ubu.
</P>
<P>
   Polly Jean Harvey's career triumph was her last solo album, ``To
Bring You My Love,'' a cathartic walk with love and death, God and
the Devil, that played like the soundtrack to a virgin sacrifice
(if, say, Joan of Arc was in league with Howlin' Wolf). The
rhetorical tilt to ``Is This Desire?'' already implies a
distancing.
</P>
<P>
   And the new songs Harvey has composed, with a band featuring
various Bad Seeds and Ubu/Beefheart sideman Eric Drew Feldman, seem
to unfold in a pre-Raphaelite waking dreamworld, all funereal and
forboding and full of forking garden paths in which lovely blossoms
wither into twilight.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a song called ``The Garden.'' Along with ``The
River,'' ``The Wind'' and ``The Sky Lit Up,'' and various titles
devoted to women's names (''Angelene,'' ``A Perfect Day Elise,''
``Joy,'' ``Catherine,'' ``My Beautiful Leah''). There's obviously,
you know, conscious artistry going on, but Harvey's not making it
easy for you. Even the haunted lilt she so seductively evokes is
nearly always at odds with deafening bass or keyboard rumbles and
odd, textured layers of sound. Is this a good P.J. Harvey album?
Yeah, it is. Does it matter? I haven't a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is This Desire?''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Harvey. Island. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Once emphatic, the British singer tosses her fans a
question mark.

 &HT;    Outkast enjoys free rein
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being from and obviously really loving the South has given
Outkast an incredible vantage point from which to view the rap
world, because the Atlanta rap duo isn't caught up in all the East
Coast posturing. But it has the kind of respected sense of its
Southern self that enables Outkast to enlist Staten Island, N.Y.'s
Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan for a racing and kinetic ``Skew It on
the Bar-B'' that's surely being played in sports-utility vehicles
tooling Harlem streets.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, Outkast isn't about shooting and robbing like much West
Coast gangster rap, because the life they've detailed on two
previous million-selling records has been about cruising
Campbellton Road in Cadillacs looking for women _ not for a target
for a drive-by. Nevertheless, ``Aquemini'' is heavy on the same
keyboards and Blaxploitation soundtracks that power Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   See, growing up in a region that doesn't have a signature sound,
Outkast feels comfortable incorporating it all. Even better, with
just two lines verbal acrobats Dre and Big Boi can quickly take you
wherever they're at on a particular song: reminiscing about an old
girlfriend (``Da Art of Storytellin _ Pt. 1''), surveying their
surroundings as ghetto superstars (``Return of the `G''') or simply
seeking the ``Liberation'' any listener is sure to find here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquemini''
</P>
<P>
   Outkast. LaFace. 16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A combination of Aquarius and Gemini, '70s rhythms
and a lot of sense.

 &HT;    Disc has the goods on `Graffiti'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two things to recommend the 25th anniversary
re-release of ``American Graffiti'' on DVD. First is the
opportunity to see how the early '70s _ the film came out in 1973 _
viewed the early '60s _ the film is set in 1962. Keep in mind that
George Lucas' nostalgic celebration of a more innocent ``happy
days'' era for teens was released the same year as Martin
Scorsese's ``Mean Streets,'' Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look Now,'' and
Marlon Brando in ``Last Tango in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more fascinating is a bonus feature offered only on the
DVD: a 75-minute featurette on ``The Making of `American
Graffiti.''' Lucas is interviewed at length, along with sound
editor Walter Murch (he just worked on the restored ``Touch of
Evil''), writers Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck and all of the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Among the revelations:
</P>
<P>
   -- Lucas named Paul Le Mat's ``cool'' character, John Milner,
after his filmmaking buddy, John Milius.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jack Nicholson suggested Lucas test Candy Clark.
</P>
<P>
   -- Harrison Ford had to interrupt ``a very successful carpentry
career'' (his words) to audition.
</P>
<P>
   -- Suzanne Somers, who played the role of the unattainable
blonde in the T-bird, recalls that her interview with Lucas
consisted of one question: ``Can you drive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Making of'' also puts to rest (sort of) an aspect of
``American Graffiti'' that's bothered me for a quarter of a
century. The memorable coda tells us what happened to each of the
guys _ Ron Howard sells insurance; Charles Martin Smith went to
Vietnam, etc. Nothing is said about the girls. Lucas, squirming
ever so slightly a la Clinton during the grand jury videotaping,
says that it was a creative decision, a matter of too many bios _
eight instead of four _ cluttering up the ending. However, Cindy
Williams, who played Howard's girlfriend, has a better explanation.
She says that it reflects the times. That, in 1962 and even in
1973, all girls had pretty much the same future: marriage.

 &HT;    GLOBAL CHANGE COMES TO THE INTERNET
 &HT;    Eds: Publishable photos are available at the Web site noted in
the text.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Scientists don't agree on why a 4,600-square-mile
hunk of ice broke away from Antarctica 12 years ago and started
floating northward in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some climate researchers think the event may have be related to
global warming, and some glaciologists say the event was part of a
normal cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the glacial ``calving'' - and other examples of
global change - are now within a mouse click of anyone with access
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Geological Survey page on the Internet
(http://www.usgs.gov/earthshots) presents satellite imagery
collected over the last 30 years to illustrate the changes under
way around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Using images that U.S. Landsat satellites have been beaming back
to Earth since the 1970s, Geological Survey scientists are posting
a series of ``change pairs,'' scans of the Earth's surface that
illustrate before-and-after conditions of key spots.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a ``change pair'' will include several images
rather than just two.
</P>
<P>
   Deforestation in the Brazilian state of Rondonia in the Amazon
rain forest is ominously evident in two satellite images, one from
1975 and the other from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier image shows a practically unbroken expanse of forest
in a 150-square-mile area of Rondonia. Only a pair of intersecting
roads appear in the rain forest vegetation, which appears red in
the satellite image.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1992 image shows widespread land clearing along a series
of roads that have been built to intersect with the original
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Quirk, a remote sensing scientist with the Geological
Survey's EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, S.D., said the Internet
site is getting about 10,000 ``hits'' a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change pairs seem to be kind of like potato chips,'' Quirk
said in a telephone interview. ``You have one and you want another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The site grew out of a booklet the survey put out several years
ago to take global change illustrations into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we ran out of booklets, we decided to post the material
on the Internet and start updating it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the booklets and the Internet site are intended to
illustrate ``what's happening on the face of the Earth over time
and how important it is to monitor our environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Earthshots site also includes explanations of the imagery
and descriptions of how scientists read it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no scientific uncertainty about why Africa's Lake Chad
has shrunk in the past 30 years from nearly 10,000 square miles to
just 800 square miles. A combination of drought and irrigation have
all but destroyed the lake, and Earthspots images show the change.
</P>
<P>
   A few thousand miles away, vast areas of coastal mangrove swamps
have been dying on the coast of Senegal. Once thought to be the
result of a disease sweeping through the wetlands, the die-off is
now believed to be caused by the same continental drought that
contributes to the shrinking of Lake Chad.
</P>
<P>
   With less rainfall, rivers are becoming more saline and
mangroves are being poisoned. Earthspots documents the change.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, satellite views show the abandonment of
farmland in Ukraine as a result of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant accident.
</P>
<P>
   The images show Texas-scale urban sprawl in Dallas-Fort Worth
and San Antonio and changes resulting from the eruption of Mount
St. Helens in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Quirk said he has 10 new sets of imagery nearly ready to add to
the Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of Santiago, Chile, and the successful efforts of the
Netherlands to claim additional territory by diking off the North
Sea will go on line soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he has satellite images recorded of a small central
Florida city not long after the opening of Disney World _ to be
compared with those of modern Orlando.

 &HT;    Shades of gray
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the boardroom to the dance floor, gray takes center stage
as the season's latest must-have color.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Ralph Lauren calls gray ``the neutral for the season''
while Bill Blass dubs it ``the ultimate classic.'' Gray in all its
glorious shades _ from pearl to charcoal _ is a solid choice for
building a chic wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Eiseman, a color tracker with the Color
Marketing Group, gray's a good compromise shade. ``It's a softer
color than black,'' she says, ``yet it does everything that black
does.'' And Michele Weston, fashion and style director for Mode
magazine, says gray is an important shade that will continue to be
popular right into spring.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news, since you'll find gray in everything from
wools and cashmere to rayon blends and silk. Gray's an easy color
to dress up or dress down with the flick of an accessory in the
palest pinks or the brightest reds.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Jo Katz, catering director for the Swissotel Atlanta,
owns two pairs of gray trousers and is looking for the perfect
medium-color gray flannels to wear at cocktail parties with a lace
top and striped Armani jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this look,'' says the former fashion model. ``Most
people think of gray flannel only in terms of daytime clothes, but
it's comfortable and unexpected for evening wear.''
</P>
<P>
   To give you some ideas on how to make gray a part of your
wardrobe, we chose two pairs of gray trousers: one charcoal and one
light gray, and paired them with a variety of tops for five
different looks. Don't be afraid to experiment with plaids, stripes
or checks, and for you color-shy dressers, gray's a natural mate
with navys and creams. The most important thing is to have a gray
day!
</P>
<P>
   Suited for the boardroom
</P>
<P>
   Any woman in a gray flannel suit will look snappy in
front-pleated gray wool trousers ($68) and matching one-button
jacket ($128). For a classy touch, add a white pique shirt ($39)
and an Adrienne Vittadini scarf in tones of gray and black ($20),
all from Casual Corner stores.
</P>
<P>
   Brunching in style
</P>
<P>
   To give the charcoal trousers ($68, Casual Corner) a laid-back
weekend feel, pair them with a comfy sweater. Choose a cropped or
hip- or mid-thigh-length sweater from crunchy tweeds to bold
patterns. Our choice is a green-gray wool folkloric pullover
($29.99) worn over a white turtleneck ($14.99). For added warmth,
toss a muffler around your neck ($19.99), then slip into black
ankle boots ($39.99). The boots would also work well with skirts.
All at T.J. Maxx stores.
</P>
<P>
   For cool days
</P>
<P>
   Nothing adds more spice to gray than red. Light-as-air,
single-breasted wool coat ($238) gives a sassy charge to charcoal
gray trousers ($68, Casual Corner). Other go-alongs include: Light
gray wool/cashmere turtleneck ($88) and Nine West's microfiber
black backpack ($69). Top off the outfit with Liz Claiborne's faux
fur black hat ($36) and stay sure-footed in CK's lug sole boots
($110). Faux fur-trimmed gray gloves are $12.
</P>
<P>
   All from Parisian stores.
</P>
<P>
   Dress-up evenings
</P>
<P>
   Gray goes elegant and sophisticated for evenings, when the
trousers are a medium gray wool by ICB ($190). Top the pants with
Helen Wang's lacy-looking gray crochet tank ($110) and matching
cardigan ($140). These tops, also accented with beads, could easily
be paired with velvet or crepe trousers. Elegant accessory touches
include DKNY's pewter high-heeled slides ($178) and a deep gray
velvet bag with jewel handle ($120). Clothes and accessories from
Saks Fifth Avenue. Polish information: 1-877-263-6245.

shows Winston Churchill in the tiny Missouri farm town where he
used the phrase ``iron curtain.''

 BURBANK, Calif.: shriveled entertainment.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Disney is so good at being good that it manifests an evil; so
uniformly efficient and courteous, so dependably clean and
conscientious, so unfailingly (italics)entertaining(end italics)
that it's unreal, and therefore is an agent of pure wickedness,''
writes Carl Hiassen in his slender tirade ``Team Rodent: How
Disneyland Devours the World (Ballantine, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Eisner scoffs at the notion that anything he's doing now is a
radical departure from what Disney has always done. ``I don't see
high art or low art,'' he said. ``If you're an ice skating clown at
an ice show, you're probably the best skater in the arena. To be
broadly commercial, you have to be broadly talented, so nothing we
do now is inconsistent with what Walt did with his early pioneering
work in animation, or with `Fantasia' or with working with
Westinghouse to adapt the technology of his day to his theme
parks.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever distinctions one wants to draw, Eisner has the
capacity to commission culture, to summon up whole worlds of
buildings and art forms and narratives.
</P>
<P>
   The two symphonies, for instance, came about, as Eisner tells
it, when he attended Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand at Carnegie
Hall. Thumbing through the program, he discovered that the symphony
had been commissioned in the 1890s to celebrate the new century. He
decided that Disney ought to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner took his idea to Jean-Luc Choplin, who was hired in 1989
to put on the entertainment at what was then called EuroDisney and
is now known as Disneyland Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Choplin, whose background included stints as artistic director
of La Sainte Baume, an avant-garde music and dance festival in a
former Dominican monastery in Provence, administrator for Roland
Petit's Ballet National de Marseille and managing director of the
Paris Opera Ballet with Rudolf Nureyev, began by listening to 129
modern composers.
</P>
<P>
   He then narrowed the list to four, ranked in order. Eisner
listened to tapes of the four and agreed with Choplin's ranking;
the project went from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of Disney, what you think of is Snow White,
Mickey Mouse and cartoon characters,'' said Torke. ``But I think
the fact that Jean-Luc Choplin came from the Paris Opera Ballet,
had worked with Nureyev, with John Cage and Robert Wilson and many
others, signaled to me that Disney had gotten an ambassador aboard
and that they were very serious about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Choplin said he saw Disney's mission and his own instincts as
entirely compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Beethoven, music has been sacred,'' said Choplin, who
has the compact gnomic look of an animated Disney character come to
life. ``But before that, great music was popular entertainment.
Botticelli was designing parades and pageants. Great painters
worked for Queen Elizabeth I to provide pageantry. Or if you go
back to Charles Ives, to Leonard Bernstein, the way Mahler and
Dvorak were inspired by waltzes and popular music, Sibelius, they
were all inspired by popular traditions, by roots. I think we have
explored a lot of one-way streets at the end of the 20th century,
and I think art needs to go back to more popular roots. And roots
are not in the ether; they're in popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two things may be making good art better commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The first, certainly in architecture, is the rise of
post-modernism. No matter what his tastes, Eisner could never have
made the mute forms of the International School compatible vehicles
for expressing Disney's vision. With the best architects now
working in wildly diverse forms animated by narrative and playful
design, the tides of design and the mission of Disney blend
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the global growth of a more discerning cultural
marketplace. And just as there's a market for junk, there's now
like never before a mass audience for sophisticated culture, a
lesson brought home on Broadway by Julie Taymor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Eisner's friendship and alliance with Tina Brown speaks
as much to his business sense as his cultural one. After all, the
thing to remember about Eisner's vision for Disney is not so much
that it's going high end as that it has become omnivorous.
</P>
<P>
   That vision is not a radical departure from Walt Disney's. After
all, his landmark ``Fantasia,'' which brought together the animated
Disney menagerie and Leopold Stokowski, was his conspicuous bid for
high culture approval in a pop culture context. But he consorted
with other well-known artists, Salvador Dali, for example, and very
much saw his work as groundbreaking art that was both serious and
popular.
</P>
<P>
   And while his theme parks will always be seen by many critics as
empires of kitsch, a respected minority viewpoint heralded them as
brilliant evocations of human-scale architecture that in many ways
prefigured a new respect for urbanism amid the relentless rise of
suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   The late architect Charles Moore called Disneyland the ``most
important single piece of construction in the West in the past
several decades.'' The developer James Rouse told an audience at
Harvard in 1963 that ``the greatest piece of urban design in the
United States today is Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Disney, nephew of the company founder, said Eisner had Walt
Disney's broad vision but with a very different cultural
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt was a guy who was born at the turn of the century in the
middle of America,'' said Disney, the chairman of Walt Disney
Feature Animation and the man who more than anyone brought Eisner
to the company. ``Michael grew up well-to-do in New York, exposed
to very different things. They have many things in common, but in
those ways they are absolutely diametrical opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   As his new autobiography, ``Work in Progress,'' makes clear (the
book was written with Tony Schwartz), Eisner has at least in part
the instincts of a closet highbrow, as quintessentially a product
of the Upper East Side as Disney was of Marceline and Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a lawyer, Eisner grew up on Park Avenue in a home
where he was expected to wear a sports jacket to dinner as the
family dined by candlelight. Weekends were spent in Westchester
County at the Bedford Hills estate of his maternal grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Birthdays and anniversaries were celebrated with trips to
Broadway musicals _ ``Kiss Me Kate,'' ``Guys and Dolls,'' ``South
Pacific,'' ``Oklahoma!'' A family friend, Victor Ganz, served as an
informal tutor on art and architecture and once lent the Eisners
Picasso's ``Bullfight,'' which hung for 10 years in young Michael's
bedroom.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Hollywood's fantasy takes on sweet hereafter
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, sweet mystery of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The movies have long loved to tell us what it would be like once
we departed this mortal coil. Heavenly harps, winged angels, puffy
clouds and twinkling stars have generally been the most popular
motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Reincarnation has been a staple, too _ from Spencer Tracy in ``A
Guy Named Joe'' to Richard Dreyfuss in ``Always,'' the remake of
``A Guy Named Joe.'' From Patrick Swayze in ``Ghost'' to Bill Cosby
in ``Ghost Dad.'' But then, the movies do make you immortal, don't
they?
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason _ wishful thinking, perhaps? _ heaven has
always been more popular than hell. Hell, after all, to paraphrase
Sartre, is for other people, not movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend brings Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May Come.''
Set in heaven, hell and points in between, it's an imaginative and
highly effective mix of tear-jerker and phantasmagoria _ as if
Terry Gilliam had remade ``Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other cinematic visions of life after death.
Decide for yourself which one suits you best.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Defending Your Life'' (1991) With Albert Brooks and Meryl
Streep. Directed by Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   What It Looks Like: Judgment City, a kind of cosmic way station,
is a mix of a perimeter office park and Disney World _ sort of
every suburban Sunbelt sprawl that ever was, complete with nail
parlors and comedy clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Good News: Brooks discovers he can eat all the pasta and ice
cream he wants without ever gaining weight. He also discovers a
radiant, recently deceased Streep.
</P>
<P>
   The Bad News: As the title suggests, you must go to court and
defend outtakes of your past life so it can be decided whether you
will pass to a higher level or go back to Earth for another try.
Rip Torn plays Brooks' defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Made in Heaven'' (1987) With Timothy Hutton and Kelly
McGillis. Directed by Alan Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   What It Looks Like: Lots of gardens and ponds and bucolic
countryside and cobblestone streets. Actually, it looks a lot like
Charleston, which is where it was shot. Also, you can design your
own heaven. For instance, Maureen Stapleton, who plays Hutton's
aunt, changes her view every day _ the Eiffel Tower one day, St.
Peter's the next.
</P>
<P>
   The Good News: Hutton, who died a hero's death on Earth, meets
McGillis, an unborn soul. They fall in love. And yes, there's sex
in this heaven. Cigarettes, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Bad News: When McGillis gets sent to Earth, Hutton asks to
go back as well. They've got 30 years to find each other or else
live unhappily ever after. By the way, Atlanta plays Earth.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Heart and Souls'' (1993) With Robert Downey Jr., Charles
Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard and Tom Sizemore. Directed by
Ron Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   What It Looks Like: As one character says, ``like the back seat
of a '58 Rambler.'' When a city bus dives off a bridge in 1959,
four disparate souls attach themselves to a nearby newborn, thus,
in the tradition of reincarnation flicks, creating their heaven
right here on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Good News: Through their mortal host, each soul gets to
resolve his or her cut-short life. Example: Grodin gets a chance at
the opera audition he always chickened out of and single-mom
Woodard gets to check on how her boy turned out.
</P>
<P>
   The Bad News: Their mortal host is Downey. Great actor, iffy
health factor.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Heaven'' (1987) With ... anyone from Diane Keaton's
94-year-old grandmother, Grammy Hall, to boxing promoter Don King.
Directed by Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   What It Looks Like: You name it. For her offbeat documentary,
Keaton asked dozens of people what they thought about heaven. The
answers are both sacred and inane.
</P>
<P>
   The Good News: The interviews are interspersed with a
fascinating array of depictions of heaven gathered from features,
television shows and religious programs. The clips range from the
celebrated _ the moving stairway in Michael Powell's ``Stairway to
Heaven'' (also called ``A Matter of Life and Death'') to the arcane
_ a heavenly orchestra from ``The Horn Blows at Midnight,'' a 1945
fantasy starring Jack Benny.
</P>
<P>
   The Bad News: Interspersed with those clips are those
interviews. You might find King's view of heaven interesting, but
do you really care what Peter Sellers' youngest daughter thinks?

 &HT;    Video Reviews: The latest word on the latest sights
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``The Object of My Affection'' (R) _ Based on Stephen
McCauley's novel, this comedy-drama is fashioned as sort of a
modern-day Shakespearean romp of romantic mismatches. Nina
(Jennifer Aniston) gets pregnant by her bossy lover (John Pankow).
She begins to think her new roommate George (Paul Rudd) would make
a better father _ he's polite, single, smart and a babe. He's also
gay. Shimmering with charm and sharp performances, the movie can't
quite overcome a central problem. George and Nina are such bland,
nice nudniks, it's hard to invest in their story. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Spanish Prisoner'' (PG) _ If only writer-director David
Mamet had let someone else direct his mind-game thriller, it might
have the Hitchcockian momentum it badly needs. Even so, the
looks-are-deceiving tale of an inventor (Campbell Scott) drawn into
the world of a wealthy businessman (a terrific Steve Martin) has
sinister elegance. Grade: B +
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Paulie'' (PG) _ A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a
wisecracking parrot (voice by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'')
separated from his owner, 5-year-old Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Mrs. Dalloway'' (PG-13) _ OK, so maybe it's impossible to
translate Virginia Woolf's internal monologues into movies. But
director Marleen Gorris (``Antonia's Line'') makes a valiant
effort, following the middle-aged, middle-class Mrs. Dalloway
(Vanessa Redgrave) through a day of bittersweet reflection of the
choices she's made. Natascha McElhone plays Redgrave at a young
age. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Two Girls and a Guy'' (R) _ If you want to see the
narcissistic extent some actors can go to, this is for you. Robert
Downey Jr. blusters through this painfully uninsightful James
Toback film, wherein the actor is confronted by two women (Heather
Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) who've just realized they're
sharing the same man. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Chinese Box'' (R) _ A fine cast and a fascinating backdrop,
but not much of a story. In Hong Kong on the eve of the Chinese
takeover, a British journalist (Jeremy Irons) is sick with leukemia
and love-sick for beautiful bar hostess, Gong Li. Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fallen Angels'' (R) _ Wong Kar-Wai doesn't make movies. He
has visions and throws them onto the screen in anti-narrative fits
and starts. Sometimes you're in the mood for this sort of thing;
sometimes you're not. Full of the director's trademark jump cuts
and neon-headache colors, ``Angels'' (an unofficial sequel to his
``Chungking Express'') is like watching an incoherent student film.
Grade: D

FAITH FORD SHOWS _ SURPRISE _ DEPTH IN `MAGGIE WINTERS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know if it's a compliment to say that ``Maggie Winters''
isn't the train wreck first envisioned sight unseen. Part of the
trepidation centered on its lead, Faith Ford, who had spent 10
years on ``Murphy Brown'' as Corky, a sometimes-scene stealer whose
one-screw-loose approach to laughs was the object of affection.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping a sitcom around Corky wasn't appealing, and still
isn't. So ``Maggie Winters'' is clever (not the show, the approach)
in that it gives us bits of Corky and lots of Ford, creating a
character who might actually grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plays Maggie, newly divorced, unemployed and broke. She
returns to the Indiana hometown she dissed as a dusty little place
that wouldn't let her think.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still stuck in high school, and they want to suck me
back,'` she says of her friends who never left Shelbyville. She
tells her pessimistic mother (Shirley Knight) that she'll be around
for ``six months, tops,'' but we know the sitcom drill.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere episode focuses on her fall from grace and how she
comes to face her friends, her tail wedged firmly between her legs.
Most of the key characters are female, and they're an impressive
lot. Jenny Robertson is amusing as one of her running buddies, and
Clea Lewis is simply wonderful as the geek Maggie doesn't remember.
Never mind. She still hates Maggie for getting all the boys and the
other trappings afforded the girl most likely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has a hilarious job interview scene with Maggie (she'll be
her boss at a retail store) in which she berates her old nemesis
about ``stealing'' the boy whom she ``like-liked'' in high school.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Maggie Winters'' zips along quite nicely, and a
smarter Ford is certainly a more interesting one.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, CBS could use this softer, sweeter series to offset the
lineup of new shows heavy on testosterone, like ``Buddy Faro'' and
the cartoonish drama with the fat guy chopping and kicking people.
</P>
<P>
   Also premiering this week:
</P>
<P>
   He sees the scumbags, she sees the broken hearts. He's a cop.
She's a public defender. ``To Have &AMP; to Hold'' (CBS) is a romantic
comedic drama that's missing one of its key elements. After two
episodes, it's clear that this is simply a well-intentioned, boring
show that lacks dramatic storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing really happens, except when Annie (the terrific Moira
Kelly) and Sean (Jason Beghe) fog up the windows, which is often,
since they're newlyweds and, as they continue to remind us,
opposites attract.
</P>
<P>
   I can't see ``To Have &AMP; to Hold'' generating much interest, and
CBS might feel the same. To arouse our interest, it sent an episode
scheduled for airing next month. It shows Annie and Sean playing
that newlywed game of consummating their marriage in every part of
the house, including the driveway during a Halloween party.
</P>
<P>
   Sex as drama. Hey, it works on ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Lives of Men (ABC) is a misfire. It's a
character-based comedy with no interesting characters and no
comedy. Peter Gallagher, Bradley Whitford and Mitch Rouse sit
around whining about the state of their lives. All three are
annoying. Skip it and feel better in the morning.  &QL;  .MDRV/.MDNM/

 &HT;    Elaborating on 'Aida'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Standing on the Alliance Theatre stage as the Elton John
music began during a recent performance of ``Elaborate Lives: The
Legend of Aida,'' actor Hank Stratton suddenly stared at one of his
fellow actors with a worried look. He slowly mouthed three words.
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Jess Roth, watching from the audience, easily
read Stratton's lips. The three words were ``Oh my God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the translation was: Hank was lost, he had no idea where
he was in the 36 bars of new dance music we had just shoved into
the show that afternoon,'' says Roth, who has worked round the
clock for nine weeks to shape the Disney-Alliance premiere into a
Broadway hit rivaling his 1994 ``Beauty and the Beast.''
Choreographer Matt West turned to Roth and grimly cracked, ``I
think we're in for a rough ride.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stratton _ who plays Radames, the Egyptian soldier
dangerously in love with slave girl Aida, a former princess
captured from his Nubian enemies _ ``managed to stumble through the
number all right,'' Roth adds, ``considering he'd had no time to
digest the new material.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wild world of theater previews. It's a crucial
time of discovery for the ``Aida'' artists, a necessary phase of
controlled chaos before critics and VIPs arrive for opening night
Wednesday. This is when shows are tweaked, when laughs fail to
appear where scripted or pop up where none was expected. When new
ideas are tested and artists' nerves are tested sorely. This is the
pressure cooker that can yield last-minute triumphs such as the
song ``Comedy Tonight,'' which Stephen Sondheim wrote so quickly in
1962 that he transformed ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum'' from an out-of-town flop into a Broadway hit.
</P>
<P>
   This is also when bugs are worked out of new hardware _ such as
the ``Elaborate'' pyramid, the ultimate balky gizmo. During one
preview, the shape-changing set piece stalled and spewed hydraulic
fluid onto the stage. During another, it produced a distinctly
unmusical hum. But technical glitches by no means predict a bomb:
Witness the ``Titanic'' ship that refused to sink during a preview
but sailed on to win the 1997 Tony for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pyramid involves brand-new technology and we never
expected it to pop out of the box and work perfectly the first
time,'' says Roth, 35. ``I was heartened to read that Michael
Bennett had to cancel some `Dreamgirls' previews (in 1982) because
the famous light towers wouldn't turn. And that show didn't do too
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   As a new stage work without any animated movie to draw from,
``Lives'' requires even more honing than most musicals. Especially
since the Broadway-bound work has a very difficult Disney act to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to be any show trying to follow `The Lion King'
into New York _ the pressure must be unbelievable,'' says Jeremy
Gerard, an editor at New York magazine and former chief drama
critic for Variety.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Roth, while visibly stressed, also appears to be having
the time of his life. ``What makes it fun is that we're on track _
we're liking what we see,'' says Roth, including, in his reference
to ``we,'' Disney chairman Michael Eisner, who's attended four
previews.
</P>
<P>
   And what did The Boss have to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael cuts through the pleasantries, since we've worked
together a long time,'' says the boyish New York-based veteran of
Disney theme-park shows, ``and he'll often say, `What I don't get,
Rob. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of script doctors, an astute one, Roth says, has been
Atlanta's own Elton John. After seeing a preview, the composer
suggested that the song ``A Step Too Far'' be moved up to the
opening of Act 2, ``Since it's the only song,'' Roth says, ``that
really focuses in on the triangle relationship'' between Radames,
Aida and her romantic rival, Amneris.
</P>
<P>
   The most heavily taxed artist, since previews began Sept. 17,
may be Linda Woolverton, the scriptwriter and Roth's old ``Beauty''
sidekick, who not only attends afternoon rehearsals and evening
previews, but rushes back to her Atlanta hotel during open slots to
type up script changes.
</P>
<P>
   Previews are the time of the unpredictable. Roth got a call on
recent morning from lyricist Tim Rice, the most seasoned member of
the creative team; he wrote 1971's ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' with
Andrew Lloyd Webber. Rice told the director that after seeing a
preview and thinking about it overnight, he'd decided to rewrite
the lyrics to ``Enchantment Passing Through,'' a song he and John
wrote months ago but had never seen onstage. When Heather Headley,
who plays Aida, arrived at rehearsal that day she learned that
she'd be singing new lyrics that evening, and was able to do so
thanks to cue cards taped to the inside wall of the orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   Roth sits in the audience every night because, ``I can feel when
people are involved. On Saturday, when Michael Eisner was in the
audience again, there were three women crying so loudly during the
song `Elaborate Lives' that a woman behind them asked them to keep
it down. I was thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The director finds only one physical defect in the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place,'' he exclaims, ``to pace!''

 &HT;    Biography eyes revered jurist who helped bring down legal
segregation in America
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Cynthia Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to serve on the
U.S. Supreme Court, had a reputation late in life for being gruff
and reclusive. So it is a revelation to learn that for most of his
life he was just the opposite: a gregarious, carousing,
hard-drinking storyteller with a lust for the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Never modest about his role in history, Marshall believed his
contributions to dismantling Jim Crow entitled him to a seat on the
nation's highest court. He used his friendship with President
Lyndon B. Johnson to press his case and called on associates to
lobby the president as well.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Juan Williams, a Washington Post reporter who wrote
``Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965,''
began frequent interviews with Marshall in 1989, two years before
he retired from the bench. Those interviews, though not especially
revealing, are an important part of the historical record of the
life of the man who, more than any other single figure, destroyed
the legal foundations of segregation in America.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's most famous victory remains the toppling of the
``separate but equal'' doctrine that legitimized segregated schools
_ the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education _ but that case
was just the climax of a decades-long legal strategy waged by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Because Marshall worked for the NAACP or its offshoot, the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, throughout his civil rights career, the book is
also a thumbnail history of the NAACP's courtroom campaign against
segregation, a strategy begun decades before the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. introduced his philosophy of nonviolent protest.
</P>
<P>
   Williams recounts many stories of Marshall's life as a poorly
paid NAACP lawyer, when he was frequently in the Deep South
defending blacks charged with serious crimes, gathering data on the
inferiority of segregated black schools or giving speeches to raise
funds. Marshall worked with similarly talented and dedicated
attorneys who were always on the lookout for cases that would allow
them to chip away at the legal supports of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, their grand plans were outdone by comic mishaps, as
when a whining, self-aggrandizing plaintiff _ a black man who had
volunteered to sue the University of Missouri for admission to its
law school _ disappeared before his case worked its way through the
legal system. Without a plaintiff, the Missouri case was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Marshall and his associates simply lost to the
oppressive forces of segregation. In one criminal case in Oklahoma,
a black man was convicted of multiple murder even though two white
felons admitted to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for their triumphs that Marshall and his colleagues
are remembered, and rightly so, since those cases changed the
country. Slowly but surely, they chalked up victories against
unequal pay for black teachers, the poll tax, the tradition of
banning blacks from juries and, finally, segregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though this overly admiring biography does not paint as full a
portrait of Marshall as his place in American history deserves
(Marshall's widow, Cissy, refused to cooperate, as did their
children), it does provide glimpses of the childhood forces that
helped shape his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Baltimore in 1908 to parents who were ambitious
for their children and their race; they were early activists in the
struggle for racial equality. A childhood spent in integrated
neighborhoods may have shaped Marshall's lifelong belief in
integration as the key to solving the nation's racial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall believed deeply in American jurisprudence, so much so
that he could admire great white lawyers even if they were rigid
segregationists.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this biography tells too little about Marshall's
complexities, perhaps because Williams was reluctant to delve too
deeply into his subject's considerable flaws. A legendary womanizer
and partygoer, Marshall thought nothing of buying bootleg whiskey
during his trips through the Deep South. That's astonishingly
reckless behavior from a man who knew that Old South authorities
would have used any excuse to discredit him. Yet Williams does not
remark on that recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Williams draw the obvious conclusions from the
evidence: Marshall was probably an alcoholic. The great jurist
died, apparently, as his father had, isolated from longtime friends
by an irascibility and paranoia fueled by drink.
</P>
<P>
   An equally glaring omission lies in Williams' failure to
seriously analyze the criticism that dogged Marshall throughout his
tenure on the high court: a lack of intellectual rigor. Though
Marshall is remembered for championing civil rights and expanding
constitutional protections for criminal defendants and reproductive
rights for women, he was portrayed in Bob Woodward's landmark book
on the Supreme Court, ``The Brethren'' (1979), as lazy and
inattentive. Williams gives that subject short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to examine the whole man notwithstanding, Williams
has written a highly readable book that establishes Marshall's
place as an architect of America's 20th-century social
transformation.Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary. By Juan
Williams. Times Books. $27.50. 459 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A welcome addition to the history of the civil
rights movement and American jurisprudence.

 STARS FANS SITE PAGES  
 (af)  
 By CHARLES BERMANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this summer Carolyn Hack got the thrill of her life.
Carolyn, 15, a high-school student from Overland Park, Kan., was in
line to ride the roller coaster at an amusement park in Kansas
City, Mo., when she and her friends saw the actor Leonardo DiCaprio
emerge from one of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   After the requisite hysteria, Carolyn's response fit a modern
teen-age template: she rode in the same car the actor had sat in;
then she went home and wrote a detailed account of the experience
for her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If every home will eventually have a home page, it seems that
every fan will have the power to put up a fan site. And while it is
common for celebrities to mount ``official'' sites, it is the
renegade pages that generate lively, unadulterated discussions
about the objects of their affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best fan sites allow people to share something they
experience and enjoy,'' said Brian Bikowicz, whose on-line name is
Megazone and who operates a page about the pop singer Ani DiFranco.
``They let people who enjoy the same thing establish a collective
memory of fandom.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her own Web site, Carolyn manages an on-line service
called DiCapring (www.sky.net/hack/dicapring.htm), which links
almost 660 DiCaprio-centric sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Web ring creates an on-line community of fan-oriented sites,
pages that have little in common except that they satisfy the
insatiable need to know everything about the celebrity or artist in
question. Visitors to the sites can post rumors, exchange pictures,
argue the quality of DiCaprio's work and generally wallow in the
minutiae of the star's life.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who create fan sites learn in the process how to use
the Internet more fluently and master the technical tools needed to
create a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Take Darrell Gaskins, 22, an Atlanta computer consultant who
also designs home pages. He had the foresight to register
www.dicaprio.com several years ago, and the site now gets heavy
traffic from fans. But he also uses the site to demonstrate sound
effects and animation tricks as a way to sell his talents to
prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that DiCaprio, one of the best-known movie stars
on the planet right now, has a strong on-line presence. A search on
his name yields thousands of results. Ms. DiFranco is not nearly as
well known; a similar search turns up a mere 3,500 entries, fewer
than half the number of DiCaprio sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. DiFranco's fans are as fervent, and the pages are as
wide ranging. As a favorite among college students, she is partly
responsible for the introduction of a whole generation to the world
of Web design.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ms. DiFranco's recent rise in popularity, it was nearly
impossible to find anything about her in the mainstream media. So
fan pages became the only route devotees could take to learn more
about her _ an artist who is so much of a renegade she distributes
her music on her own label, refusing offers from major record
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Parker, a Columbia University junior, chose Ms. DiFranco
as a subject for a Web-design class assignment because, she said,
``she is a great role model and empowering to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker has let her page (www.columbia.edu/mrp29/music.html)
live on long past the class and still maintains it on the
university's server.
</P>
<P>
   For some builders of fan sites, satire has become the sincerest
form of flattery. Tim Richardson, an independent filmmaker in
Indiana, created a Leotardo DiCappucino page, a sendup of a fawning
fan site, full of the requisite inside references intrinsic to many
Web sites (members.tripod.com/shinoh14/leotardo.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hobby,'' Richardson said. ``It's like collecting stamps
or baseball cards.''

 &HT;    The squeaky hinge: Science-religion war has a long history
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1641, blind and in failing health, Galileo found pleasure in
explaining to his son plans for making a pendulum clock. He had
lost his sight three years earlier, and the Fathers of the Church
concluded that he had lost his faith even earlier. Proving what
Copernicus could present only as theory, he held that the Earth was
indeed not the center of God's universe, motionless as a
chandelier; to the contrary, his telescope told him that the Earth
rotated on its axis every 24 hours and, what's more, revolved
around the sun. And he produced the mathematical calculations to
prove it. There being no corroboration in the Bible, the Roman
Church pronounced his ideas heretical and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Galileo's recantation _ a winking white lie meant
only to placate the authorities _ is well-known and largely
mythologized. The truth is that Galileo died a broken man, a
believer and yet imprisoned during the Inquisition. His books were
censored and burned. ``This universe that I have extended a
thousand times,'' he said, ``has now shrunk to the narrow confines
of my own body. Thus God likes it; so I too must like it.'' But
truth, or the search for it, is not easily imprisoned. A more
secular example of it is the shrunken figure of Stephen Hawking,
confined within a paralyzed body, bereft of all power but that of
his mind, calculating the very beginnings of Time.
</P>
<P>
   Religion's encounter with Reason nearly four centuries ago
closed the door to one world and opened the door to another. The
world in which we live is the one created by science. Religion _ in
the West at least _ has been left to make what accommodations it
can. It was anything but an orderly transfer of power and
authority. Richard N. Goodwin's ``The Hinge of the World'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25) dramatizes, in the form of a play, all that
was at stake. In a subtitle evoking the times, Goodwin calls his
book ``A Drama in Which Professor Galileo Galilei, Chief
Mathematician and Philosopher to His Serene Highness the Grand Duke
of Tuscany, and His Holiness Urban VIII, Bishop of Rome, Battle for
the Soul of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing less than that, even if you acknowledge those
quarters of the globe where religion still rules. You could say
that the world stood still while Galileo was proving, against all
scriptural authority, that it in fact moved.
</P>
<P>
   Sparring over the uses of knowledge
</P>
<P>
   In Act 3 of this immensely rich work, the accused Galileo
appeals to his onetime friend Urban VIII:
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws of motion, the language of nature, are all of His
creation. There is no other possibility. Condemn me and little is
lost. Condemn the truth and you dim the glory of our Church, forbid
the knowledge for which God has granted us to rebuild the ruins of
our abolished world.''
</P>
<P>
   Replying, the Pope says in part: ``We are not threatened by
denial. It is worse. You would make God unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   And, moments later: ``You would subdue nature. Our duty is far
more difficult: to subdue man. You would understand nature. I must
understand man, a creature of terrifying disproportions, a Divine
spirit caged with a ravenous beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin has given us a meditation not just on the history of
ideas, but on the nature of man. At the dawn of the modern era, the
Renaissance and the Reformation elevated art and learning while
asserting the freedom of the individual over his own conscience.
The institutional scaffolding of the age coming to a close fell
away, the unchallenged authority of the pope along with the divine
right of kings.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding a world in transition
</P>
<P>
   It is poetic coincidence that Galileo was born on the day
Michelangelo died, and that the day of Galileo's death saw the
birth of Isaac Newton. But it is coincidence and nothing more. The
transition from one age to the next is never a clean break. The
first scientists, Galileo among them, were heirs to the Renaissance
and had greater appreciation for mystery and wonder than the
absolutists who feared them and wanted them silenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not a heretic, Galileo, one who misreads the faith,''
Urban VIII tells him. ``You are the creator of a whole new faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this is that Galileo sought to create no new faith,
but only to make more comprehensible the faith he already had.
</P>
<P>
   More ironic still, science has become its own religion, as smug
in its authority as the pontiffs who tried and failed to subdue it.
It takes a discerning reader to infer from Goodwin's book that the
two, religion and science, are not mutually incompatible. But any
concord between them requires agreement that most truths are
provisional. And with this, perhaps, the acknowledgment that the
mysteries of God's world exist to be understood, not merely
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, Galileo's position, for which he paid
dearly. He did not deny the existence of God. He only believed
there to be mysteries beyond the reach of Rome and reason alike.

 &HT;    Scents and sensibility: In collard-crazy Carolina, they love
their boiled leaves
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEULAVILLE, N.C._The coastal plain of North Carolina _ Down
East, as Tar Heels call it _ provides an olfactory tour to delight
and defile the nostrils. Driving through the flat countryside east
of Raleigh, you encounter the reek of hog farms, the bouquet of
barbecue joints, the foul belch of paper mills, the sweet pungence
of curing tobacco, the seductive promise of salt water. And if you
happen to stray into Beulaville, a flyspeck on the way to
Wilmington, you encounter a particular aroma that, depending on
your rearing, can seem as agreeable as hickory smoke or as
malodorous as a pigpen. Every Wednesday is Collards Day at
Beulaville's Wagon Wheel restaurant, and people come from miles
around as if lured by the siren stench of boiling greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks who aren't from around here can't stand the
smell, but we love it,'' says Mayo Quinn, a local retiree and
Collards Day regular, as she sprinkles her lunch with peppered
vinegar sauce. The green pile on her plate looks like a clump of
damp lawn clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they don't smell like chitlins,'' a fellow at the
next table chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never cooked collards and inhaled their potent vapors,
think of that famous scene in Charlie Chaplin's film ``The Gold
Rush.'' The Tramp, on the verge of starvation in the Yukon, boils a
pair of boots and serves the soles like veal cutlets, with laces
for spaghetti. Had he thrown in some fetid running shoes and sweaty
socks, and simmered them all day with no exhaust fan, only then
would the smell have approached the dank, earthy funk of collards
brewing in an open pot. That they taste so much better than they
smell is one of life's happy little mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Boiled greens have to be one of the most characteristic and
stereotypical of Southern foods. Like many of the region's culinary
specialties, they have been much abused _ derided as po-folks'
fare, larded with too much pork, often overcooked to the point of
mush. Yet they endure. While we're more likely to eat raw greens
these days, like the rest of the nation, you'll still find a vat of
steaming greens at just about every buffet and cafeteria line from
Texas to Virginia. Different areas have different preferences:
collards in the Deep South, turnips in the Upper South, mustards
here, kale there, with a little dandelion and pokeweed thrown in.
It's a mighty mess of greens, by any reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places where greens are prized, perhaps none
celebrates them as fervently as eastern North Carolina. The sandy
loam is perfect for growing large, leafy things like tobacco and
collards, a member of the kale family whose name is thought to be a
corruption of ``colewort,'' a type of cabbage. Though it isn't a
huge commercial crop, everyone seems to grow some collards in the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   In Ayden, the small town that recently staged its 24th annual
collard festival, they even have a garden of verse. The planners
sponsored a collards poetry contest a few years back, and they're
still getting entries. One ode addressed the plant as a woman:
``Colleen, Colleen, my sweet collard green.'' Another mimicked
Shakespeare: ``Shall I compare thee to the turnip green?'' (Given
the gastrointestinal consequences that collards can have, it's a
wonder someone hasn't written: ``Greens, greens, good for the
heart. ...'')
</P>
<P>
   For one weekend in September, Ayden truly is the collards
capital of the world. But for the rest of the year, you'd be
hard-pressed to find a more collardcentric place than Beulaville,
population 1,000, where the Wagon Wheel has been serving its weekly
feast of greens and pork backbone since 1968. Thanks to a couple of
features in Carolina newspapers, Collards Day has become something
of a regional phenomenon, drawing more than 600 customers from as
far away as Charlotte and Winston-Salem. Sometimes whole busloads
of greens lovers pull off N.C. 111 at the yellow frame restaurant
with the emerald awnings. For collards eaters who can't linger, the
management thoughtfully added a drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, as the line began to trail out the door,
a car turned in, a window lowered and a voice rang out, ``Y'all
don't eat all the collards, now!''
</P>
<P>
   There was little danger of that happening. The Wagon Wheel cooks
500 pounds of collards at a time, a laborious process that takes
all night. Once the kitchen closes after dinner, a graveyard shift
starts trimming greens of their stems and center veins. Next
they're washed repeatedly to remove the grit. Then they're seasoned
and boiled for hours in a broth rendered from the pork backbones.
Finally, they're chopped and mixed with a little cabbage if they
need sweetening. Summer collards, which tend to be tougher and more
bitter, usually need the help. The tender, milder-tasting collards
that grow after the first frost stand on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer the summer collards myself,'' says Zannie Atkinson,
one of the restaurant's founders, who grew up on a farm nearby and
is accustomed to eating assertive greens. Though she sold the
business to her son-in-law years ago, she still comes in once a
week, at age 74, to work until dawn cooking the collards. By the
time the greens are laid out on a buffet table, alongside fried
chicken and candied yams and hush puppies, she's back home catching
up on sleep _ and probably smelling collards in her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30, the doors open and Atkinson's 49-year-old son-in-law,
Bo Carpenter, greets the procession: silver-haired ladies,
tractor-capped truck drivers, uniformed deliverymen, wizened old
farmers with sun-creased necks, collard-swallerin' lawyers in
khakis and button-down dress shirts, a dental office staff in
matching smocks with smiling teeth on them. Young and old, big and
small, all coming for greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here because we love old-timey collards, and because we
hate the idea of cooking them,'' says Mary Edwards, a regular from
Beulaville, as she builds a green hillock on her plate.
</P>
<P>
   Behind her in line, one of the lawyers pulls the visitor aside
with a tip: ``Be sure you get Bo to show you his van.''
</P>
<P>
   His van? Carpenter rolls his eyes and motions to follow him out
back, through the collardy kitchen, to the gravel lot. There, on
the back of his shiny black Pontiac Trans Sport SE, a North
</P>
<P>
   Carolina vanity license plate hollers:
</P>
<P>
   ``COLLARDS.''

   Georgia Governor Zell Miller ate his share of greens and corn
bread growing up in the North Georgia mountains. In 1982, while
lieutenant governor, he fired off this letter to the editor to set
the record straight on a matter of greens terminology:
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought The New York Times knew everything, but
obviously your editor knows as little about spelling as he or she
does about Appalachian cooking and soul food. Only a culinarily
illiterate damnyankee (one word) who can't tell the difference
between beans and greens would call the liquid left in the pot
after cooking greens ``pot liquor'' (two words) instead of
``potlikker'' (one word) as yours did. And don't cite Webster as a
defense, because he didn't know any better either.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Southernisms a `sight' more than colorful
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when I thought I was learning to speak English, I find I
still have the taint of Creola, Ala. _ or is it South Georgia? _ in
my speech.
</P>
<P>
   I went to the library looking for something on the Coast Guard.
Talk about language, that branch of the service has its own _
colorful, flavorful, special. I'll never forget that when my
teenage son finished his reserve hitch in the Coast Guard, he came
home saying things such as, ``Walk back handsomely.'' I forget what
it means, but it had something to do with handling lines on a ship.
(Notice I said ``lines'' and not rope.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, the day I wanted to learn about the Coast Guard my hand
fell on a book I hadn't seen, titled simply and poetically
``Alabama.'' Naturally I poked around in it looking for Mobile and
found these nice lines: ``Mobile's blithe Mediterranean spirit
still lifts the heart and tempts the flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   The author, Virginia Van de Veer Hamilton, then took up speech.
She said she was talking about Creoles, but the usage she quoted
belongs to a lot of us. For instance, don't we often say ``proud''
when we mean ``glad,'' as in ``I'm proud to meet you''?
</P>
<P>
   We think ``sight'' a good word for ``much,'' as in, ``We've had
a sight of stormy weather.'' Then there's ``chunk'' for ``throw.''
I think the Atlanta Braves probably just throw the ball, but out in
the country we chunk it. Always have.
</P>
<P>
   When your son or grandson brings home a smart girl, we don't
call her ``industrious.'' ``Smart'' says it better. As for ``tote''
instead of carry, anybody who has toted a heavy load, either
physical or emotional, knows ``tote'' is the word.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Hamilton moved along to other usage, I think she had
hit pure country instead of Creole. For instance, don't you know
instead of addressing a letter you ``back'' it?
</P>
<P>
   My son down in Alford, Fla., had a neighbor who wasn't really
confident about reading and writing, and he especially didn't want
to disgrace himself by making a mess of the envelope when he did
the unaccustomed and dispatched a letter. So he asked my son if he
would ``back'' the letter for him. It was really fronting it, but
``back'' is the word we use.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton pointed out that we like to double up on words. I
hadn't noticed it before, but we do say ``womenfolks'' and ``church
house,'' and why not? That's getting really specific. I like
``biscuit bread,'' but stopped saying that years ago. One thing I
don't believe many people have noticed is that ``evening'' for some
of us begins at noon. Not ``this afternoon'' but ``this evening.''
In fact, the first time I heard a woman say ``good afternoon,'' I
fell out laughing. I thought she was some kind of foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton thought she was quoting Creole speech, but if she
had looked around a little she would have found she was also
quoting pure South. She didn't catch our pronunciation. How could
she? I was a high school student making a commencement speech
before I gave up putting a long ``i'' in night and right. It comes
out with ``o'' overtones. Almost, ``It's a nosse nott out tonott.''
That's not quite right, but you know what I mean. They tried to
speed up and smarten up my speech, but I'm afraid it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   On mature reflection, I think it's a good thing to hang on to
some of our differences. We'll rue the day when we all sound like
television.

 BURBANK, Calif.: Michael's bedroom.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At college at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, he started
off pre-med, but soon realized he was more interested in Arthur
Miller, Tennessee Williams and Luigi Pirandello than organic
chemistry. After college, he took off for Paris, intending to be a
playwright. He wrote three plays in three weeks but soon got
homesick for New York and decided he was more suited to a real job
than the life of a creative spirit.
</P>
<P>
   His background may look significant in retrospect, Eisner says,
but there was no conscious design or personal passion that led him
to a career in arts or entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family wasn't part of the entertainment world,'' he said.
``The closest we ever came to being part of the theater world was
when I was growing up: Elaine Stritch once borrowed my mother's
mink coat to wear to the Tonys. My sister collected Playbills, but
half the time I went under duress. I went to the Young People's
Concerts, but it was a nightmare. The other kids were out playing
football, and I was sitting in a tie and jacket listening to
Leonard Bernstein. What happens, I guess, is things do get
absorbed, but there was no inevitability about this.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, his interest in architecture is deep and
passionate. How many other CEOs use the word ``despicable'' to
describe the architecture of the 1960s and '70s? As a youth, he was
entranced by the march of modernism down Park Avenue in skyscrapers
like Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson's Seagram Building.
</P>
<P>
   The family friend, Ganz, took Eisner around Rome when he was 18,
giving him a whirlwind tour of every church, statue, museum and
landmark he could find.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A.M. Stern, the newly appointed dean of Yale's School of
Architecture, who has designed buildings for Eisner and now sits on
the Disney board, said Eisner was involved to an extraordinary
degree in both the big picture and the details of what makes a
building work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an architect or an architect manque,'' he said. ``But
he's a knowledgeable client, the rarest commodity you can find.
He's very visual and imaginatively visual.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the differences between the cultural instincts of Walt
Disney and Michael Eisner do not necessarily play in Eisner's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Karal Ann Marling, a professor of art history and American
studies at the University of Minnesota, said Disney had a native,
unschooled, intuitive approach to art and an admirable indifference
to the pronouncements of East Coast cultural pooh-bahs.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's much more self-conscious, as befitting someone who came
out of the '60s and '70s,'' said Ms. Marling, curator of the new
exhibition ``Designing Disney's Theme Parks: The Architecture of
Reassurance,'' which opens on Tuesday at the Cooper-Hewitt National
Design Museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find Walt's kind of naivete and willingness to take absolute
risks, high and low, terribly appealing. That's not to say Eisner's
not an innovator or a gifted figure, but he seems more in line with
educated sensibilities and maybe a little less experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Eisner is willing to take risks as well. Roy Disney said
projects like the millennium symphonies might have intrinsic value
as part of the company's commitment to creativity and perhaps the
more subtle virtue of making people unconsciously rethink what the
company is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever make a nickel off the millennium
concerts,'' Disney said. ``But maybe they help us go beyond being
`Disney,' in quotes. There's a downside to being successful. I'm
the last guy to ask about this, because it's my name, but I think
our name means a lot more than what people sometimes assume it
means.''
</P>
<P>
   How far does any of this go? Only an idiot, which Eisner
certainly is not, would try to reinvent Disney. But Eisner has
always been a shrewd marketer with a brilliant sense of what the
public will buy, as evidenced in the shows and movies he has been
involved in: ``Happy Days,'' ``Welcome Back Kotter,'' ``Saturday
Night Fever,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark''
and ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Disney says there is less design than happenstance in the
company's evolution. One reason Disney brought in Ms. Taymor, he
said, was that it was so hard to figure out a way to do ``The Lion
King'' onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were we going to do?'' he said. ``Have a bunch of guys in
lion suits sitting on their hind legs singing songs? We really
needed Julie's reputation for innovation and design and cleverness
and a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a grand design at work, you won't hear it expressed
by Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're giving us too much credit for thinking things out and
too little credit for working by instinct,'' he said. ``If high art
means limited art, I'm not interested. That's not what we're about.
If it means better quality and more intelligent, I think that's
what our audience expects from us.''

 &HT;    Fannie Flagg: Post-`Tomatoes'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years after a sweet little book called ``Fried Green
Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe'' became a best seller,
ultimately spinning off a sweet little hit movie and a bustling
business for sweet little cafes that specialize in the title dish,
author Fannie Flagg knew very well what readers wanted from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted a sequel to `Fried Green Tomatoes,''' she says
on a recent visit to her beloved hometown of Birmingham. ``But I
killed everybody in that. I boiled one person! So I couldn't really
do a sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagg will be in Atlanta on Wednesday to sign copies of her new
novel, ``Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!'' She knows she may have
some explaining to do to the hard-core fans who loved her first two
novels, ``Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man'' and ``Fried Green
Tomatoes,'' which were set in Mississippi and Alabama,
respectively. Not only is ``Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!'' not
a sequel to ``Fried Green Tomatoes,'' it's not even set in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, dual plot lines center on Dena Nordstrom, a blond,
blue-eyed TV newswoman in 1970s New York with a deep, dark secret,
and the quirky townspeople of Elmwood Springs, Mo. Dena's old
college roommate, Sookie _ a wife, a mom and a Kappa forever _
lives in Selma, Ala., providing the lone link to Flagg's typical
turf.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding cast of characters may not be Southern, but
they're suitably offbeat: ``Neighbor Dorothy,'' for instance,
broadcasts daily live radio shows from her living room. And sweet,
ditsy old Aunt Elner, who ``always smelled like a wedding cake,''
utters everyday pearls:
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor little old human beings. They're jerked into this world
without having any idea where they came from or what it is they are
supposed to do, or how long they have to do it in. Or where they
are gonna wind up after that. But bless their hearts, most of them
wake up every morning and keep on trying to make some sense out of
it. Why, you can't help but love them, can you?''
</P>
<P>
   The prose is unapologetically sentimental, even ``shamelessly
corny,'' as one reviewer wrote in Kirkus Reviews: ``The author
does, however, know how to spin a rattling good yarn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You always worry when an atomic bomb goes off with one book,
and then people wait with bated breath to see what you're going to
do next,'' says author Winston Groom, a lifelong resident of the
Mobile Bay, Ala. area, who has known Flagg for 14 years. Groom
wrote ``Forrest Gump,'' so he knows a little something about the
pressure that comes with writing a popular novel that becomes a
wildly popular movie. ``You can't worry about that,'' he says.
``You just have to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fannie isn't going to write the same book over and over again
like some people do. ... And she casts a pretty wide net. She's not
like Tom Clancy _ it's not just men in suits on business trips who
read her books. She draws her readers from all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary _ yet undeniably peculiar _ people are Flagg's bread
and butter. In ``Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!'' as in her
previous two novels, she introduces monumental elements of
friendship, love, race and morality on a distinctly personal level.
The message is small yet universal: People are basically good, and
life is pretty funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an inner goodness in people, and people who
have it don't even know they have it,'' Flagg says. ``People just
break my heart. They really touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   With red hair and clear blue eyes, Flagg is a youthful 57,
little changed since her 1970s heyday as a comedian and actress on
TV (``Candid Camera,'' ``The New Dick Van Dyke Show''), in movies
(``Grease,'' ``Five Easy Pieces'') and on Broadway (``The Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas''). Now she insists that performing was
simply a sidetrack, a long distraction from her first love of
writing. ``I never felt that comfortable performing,'' she says.
``I never had the need to get up in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagg has lived in California for decades, but she still wears
her Alabama dialect proudly, tossing in an occasional ``honey'' or
``precious'' where appropriate. She laughs easily, often cracking
herself up with her dead-on impersonations and memorable deadpan.
And she tends to whisper words that are somewhat distasteful: a
homeless man, an older lady. ...
</P>
<P>
   And she loves to tell a good tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to hear the story of how I first met Eudora Welty?
It was 1975, and I had just moved to California and was very
homesick. One day I looked up on an old telephone pole and saw a
flier that said, `Santa Barbara Writers Conference, guest speaker
Eudora Welty.' I thought, oh my God!''
</P>
<P>
   Flagg, who had written countless comedy sketches (for ``The
Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,'' ``Candid Camera'' and many
other shows) but no fiction, signed up for the weeklong conference
just to get the chance to meet the Southern icon. On the first day,
alongside ``all these educated, intellectual people,'' Flagg
received the major assignment of the conference: Write a short
story about childhood to be entered in the yearly contest, which
Welty would help judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to break out in a cold sweat because I'm dyslexic,
horribly dyslexic,'' Flagg says. ``But I went home and got one of
those little children's notebooks and wrote my story out in
longhand, so that all the misspelled words and bad punctuation
looked like I had done it on purpose. Oh, yes, I was diabolically
clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, honey, the thing won first prize! And Eudora handed me
my prize. I just went to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty and Flagg struck up a friendship that endures to this day,
and that prize-winning story ultimately became ``Coming
Attractions,'' which was later reissued as ``Daisy Fay and the
Miracle Man'' and spent 10 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller
List. (Welty supplied a note of praise for the book jacket, ``which
didn't hurt one bit, I tell you!'' Flagg says.)
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Flagg was in New York struggling to finish
writing her second novel, ``Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle
Stop Cafe,'' and Welty _ along with a second Southern literary
legend _ again became an unwitting factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing a second novel is terrifying,'' Flagg says, ``because
the first time you write, you don't know what you're doing. But the
second time you write you know you don't know what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway I had become very discouraged. ... One day I thought, I
can't write. I'm just giving the whole thing up. And I started
walking all the way up to 91st and Riverside, where my chiropractor
was. On the way, this man _ this homeless man _ looks at me and
says, `You're ugly!' And I said, `Well, thanks a lot! That's just
what I needed to hear today!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I go on to the chiropractor's office and notice that the
regular receptionist was not there _ instead, there was a nice
young man at the desk. Well, I sat down, still ranting about the
strange man in the street. `You know, I'm from Alabama. People have
manners in Alabama.' And this nice young man says, `You know, Miss
Flagg, I'm from Monroeville, Ala., and I just read your first book
and I thought it was great.'''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that Eudora Welty was coming to speak in New
York and he happened to have an extra ticket. Would Flagg like to
have it? The short answer was: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Eudora got through talking that night, all these
New York people, who can be somewhat condescending to people from
the South, were falling all over her,'' Flagg says.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Flagg visited with Welty and then walked into the
lobby, where she spotted the nice young man from the chiropractor's
office, accompanied by an older woman. ``I went over to thank him
so much for the ticket, and the woman reached out her hand and
said, `Hi, Fannie. Harper Lee, Monroeville.'''
</P>
<P>
   And so, in Flagg's fabled life, she spent the evening sharing
drinks and conversation with authors Eudora Welty and Harper Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not inspiration, I don't know what is,'' she says
with a shake of her head. ``I believe things like that happen for a
reason. I believe that things come to you when you really need
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, she had finished ``Fried Green Tomatoes,''
complete with a blurb on the book jacket from her new friend Lee,
and garnered nice reviews from such newspapers as the Los Angeles
Times, The Washington Post and The New York Times: ``A real novel
and a good one ... (from) the busy brain of a born storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   With that project behind her, Flagg was ready to begin a new
novel. But when the screenwriter for the movie version of ``Fried
Green Tomatoes'' fell ill, the producers asked her to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do it,'' Flagg says. Nonetheless, she spent
the next three years working with director and co-producer Jon
Avnet, crafting a screenplay that was nominated for an Academy
Award, a Writers Guild of America award and a Scripters Award
(which it won). Still, Flagg wasn't tempted to take on
screenwriting full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a collaborative effort,'' she says, ``and I don't like
that. If I'm going to go down in flames, I would rather do it
alone. And I think it's because I'm dyslexic that I'm still in such
awe of the novel _ of books. I find that kind of writing so much
more rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about dyslexia is obviously not something that Flagg
enjoys, but she's learned not to be embarrassed about it. Dyslexia
is a reading disorder characterized by reversals of letters such as
``b'' and ``d,'' words such as ``saw'' and ``was,'' and numbers
such as 6 and 9 or 16 and 61. Dyslexics often have trouble
remembering letters, words or numbers and have a tendency to skip
over or scramble letters, words and sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real name is Patricia Neal, and in school I continuously
signed my name Pasty Neal. I never could figure out why I couldn't
spell my own name _ I always felt so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Flagg was kicked out of the Lavenge School of Tap
and Ballet because she couldn't tell her left from her right and
was messing up all the routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what all these little things meant. Before
spelling tests at school, my mother would drill me for hours, but I
would get to school the next day and I couldn't retain it. I never
knew what it was, so I always acted silly to compensate. Years
later I went on a TV game show called `The Match Game,' where you
had to write your answers. There again, I would treat my
misspelling as a joke until one day a schoolteacher from St. Louis
wrote me a letter and asked, `How long have you been dyslexic?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never even seen the word, and I was 30-something years
old. I looked it up and took a test, and they said I was severely
dyslexic.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing is not the most logical profession for a dyslexic, but
Flagg has found a way to make it work. She types a chapter and
sends it to a professional typist, ``who knows how to decipher what
it is I'm trying to say.'' The typist retypes it, correcting all
the spelling, and sends it back to Flagg. The swapping continues
until the manuscript is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write kind of like a quilt,'' Flagg says. ``I have a
clothesline that goes all the way down the hall in my house. I
write a scene and put it on the clothesline. I never really know
what the book is going to be about until I finish it and put all
the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' was a hefty 403 pages;
``Baby Girl'' weighs in at an impressive 467. Both are complex
stories told in snippets, with characters and events jumping around
decades and states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always start out to write a very simple book,'' she says,
feigning exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ``lonely, hard and heartbreaking'' act of writing
itself has been a source of unmitigated pleasure since 1981, when
Flagg finally dropped her successful career as an actress and
comedian and set her sights on writing for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough,'' she says. ``I almost lost my house, and I
lived on $50 a week. ... But I was never happier. I can't even
explain it. It was like I had been going from room to room looking
for something, and finally I walked into the right room and said,
`Ah! This is where I belong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Flagg lives in a 1913 frame house with a porch, nestled
amid all the modern, Spanish-style haciendas in Santa Barbara. At
least two or three times a year, she returns to Birmingham to visit
old friends and distant relatives. She also is a frequent visitor
to metro Atlanta, where she made fast friends during the filming of
``Fried Green Tomatoes'' in the summer of 1991 and even considered
buying a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove a lot of real estate agents crazy, looking at all
these houses,'' Flagg says. ``I haven't given up the idea yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about an hour southeast of Atlanta, the little town
of Juliette, where most of the filming was done, has been
revitalized as a tourist stop. And a couple of hours west of
Atlanta, in a tiny mining town just outside Birmingham, sits the
Irondale Cafe, the real model for Flagg's fictional Whistle Stop
Cafe, where a weary fry cook prepares 60 to 70 pounds of fried
green tomatoes on a typical weekday _ more on Sundays _ to keep up
with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Flagg's late aunt Bess Fortenberry, the model for the
irrepressible Idgie Threadgoode, ran the cafe from the 1930s until
the early 1970s. Since 1973, Bill and Mary Jo McMichael have run

   ``We just adore Fannie,'' says Mary Jo, 66. ``She is such a
sweet, down-to-earth person. I remember way back when she was
co-anchor of the morning show in Birmingham, and I thought she was
the cutest, funniest person I had ever seen! I had no idea she
would be as successful as she's been or that I would actually get
to meet her. Now I feel like I've known her all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her book put us on the national map,'' McMichael adds. ``We
were already on the local map.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagg's family and friends frequently turn up in her fiction.
Aunt Elner, the sassy, slightly daffy soul of ``Welcome to the
World, Baby Girl!'' really existed (``Oh, honey, I wish I had
thought to bring a picture of her to show you!''), as do Norma and
Macky Warren, a salt-of-the-earth couple who didn't hesitate when
Flagg asked if they objected to her using their real names for the
characters they inspired: `Honey, we'd love to be famous!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited,'' says Norma Warren, 61, who has been
happily married for 43 years to Macky, the actual boy next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of what appears in the book is quite realistic,'' she
says with a laugh. ``You definitely get the idea of a couple that's
been married for a very long time. I think Fannie's been saving up
stories on us since we first met.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren accompanied Flagg on much of her book tour back in 1987,
when ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' was published. Then, they drove from
bookstore to bookstore in Alabama. Now, Flagg is beginning a
17-city national tour that will include stops in Boston, New York,
Denver, Chicago and Los Angeles. For her, this is the most
nerve-racking part of writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love meeting all the people, but I hate all the flying,''
she says. ``And I never read reviews, because you can really get
your feelings hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very Christian Scientist about this. I only
see the good, y'all! Because if I don't, I'll just sit down and sob
at these book signings, and that's not what people want to see.''

 &HT;    The look and sound of ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida.''
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE THEMES: Personal love vs. patriotic duty. Enslaved by the
Egyptians, Nubian Princess Aida is singled out by Captain Radames
for her intelligence. He presents her to his betrothed, Princess
Amneris, as a personal servant.
</P>
<P>
   From this position of relative power, Aida schemes to free her
fellow Nubians, including her father. In the process, she and
Radames fall in love. They each face having to betray their own
countrymen or their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The cast also includes a young Nubian boy slave; Amneris' dad,
the pharaoh; and Radames' father, Zoser, who is scheming to see his
son on the throne of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOOK: Nile glitz. The set design includes obelisks that rise
from the floor of the stage and descend from the fly space above.
The most impressive, most cantankerous bit of scenery is a
hydraulic-powered pyramid. The unit moves across the stage, raising
and lowering its four triangular sides to create multiple settings
_ including the battleship of Radames, private chambers and, of
course, the climactic pyramid/tomb.
</P>
<P>
   During previews, the pyramid has broken down several times,
causing the actors to continue the performance in a concert
version.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUND: Egyptian power pop. ``Elaborate Lives'' is not
totally sung through like ``Les Miserables'' or lyricist Tim Rice's
collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber, ``Jesus Christ Superstar''
and ``Evita.'' But the production is largely driven by the musical
numbers, with minimal dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSIC: ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida'' is the second
collaboration between lyricist Tim Rice (``Jesus Christ
Superstar,'' ``Evita,'' etc.) and composer Elton John (``Goodbye
Yellow Brick Road'' and a zillion other pop hits). The pair hooked
up to pen the tunes for Disney's animated film ``The Lion King''
and the subsequent Broadway smash.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, the show shifts between a couple of dominant styles.
Flashy, big-beat rock numbers and swoony, string-glossed love
ballads. In both, you can hear John's songwriting signature. The
up-tempo songs echo the pop hits John recorded in the early to
mid-1970s (there's that rollicking piano of the ``Crocodile Rock''
era). The slow tunes sound similar to the reflective, mature '90s
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight songs (there are 22 songs in all, including four
reprises) show off the title character, Aida, played by Heather
Headley. Her ballad turns _ ``Elaborate Lives'' and ``Easy As
Life'' _ are piano- and string-driven affairs (the former a duet
with Hank Stratton as Egyptian hunk Radames, whose star-crossed
love for Aida propels the story). They represent the emotional core
of the production and aim for a certain divalike grandeur. Headley
also gets to belt out a rousing, gospel-flavored theme, along with
other cast members, on ``The Gods Love Nubia.''
</P>
<P>
   The rock 'n' roll kicks in whenever Radames' evil, power-hungry
father, Zoser _ played by Rich Hebert _ takes the stage. Sherie
Scott, as the spoiled, unhappy Princess Amneris, has a role akin to
a narrator, introducing and closing the show with the song ``Every
Story Is a Love Story,'' a sweeping, melodic scene setter.

 &HT;    Reader's comments on ``Aida''
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Audiences adore ``Aida'' _ at least those who called us
to comment about ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida.'' Based on
what they saw in preview performances at the Alliance Theatre, a
large majority of the nearly 100 callers gave the musical an
overwhelming thumbs up. Some complained about the music's loud
volume, but most overlooked technical problems involving the show's
big special effect, a spinning, unfolding pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I thought it was the best production of anything I've ever
seen: the best performance since my husband rationalized buying his
new convertible. Everything was fantastic, even though the pyramid
malfunctioned in the first half. And I got to see Elton John (at
the theater). The only thing I was less than ecstatic about was the
choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Deborah DeHaven, Roswell , Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I loved it. It made me laugh, it made me cry. It was
emotional, sensual, funny. My favorite songs are ``Elaborate
Lives'' and ``My Strongest Suit.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Brenda Young, 43, Marietta , Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I loved it so much we got a second set of tickets. This is
going to be a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Penny Linder, 50ish, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It was fun, it was great. You could definitely feel the
Elton John-Tim Rice combination throughout. The songs were
wonderful. We got into it. I think it's a hit. It's a great way for
the Alliance to kick off its 30th-anniversary season. I thought it
was awesome, a fun night at the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Miskimen, 56, Tucker , Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It was fabulous. I cried a lot. It was one of the more
enjoyable plays I've seen, and I've seen many. The music is
amazing. The lyrics are totally inspiring. It was our 36th wedding
anniversary and we had a wonderful time.'' _Muriel Littman, 54,
Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I'm the wrong age for rock concerts and I've never been to
one, although I think I just was. It was far too loud. Most of the
lyrics were absolutely drowned out. But I quite liked the show.
</P>
<P>
   _Marjorie Andrews, 67, Atlanta -- ``We thought it was absolutely
breathtaking. We could see the deep Disney pockets as far as all
the special effects. We look forward to seeing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   _Jackie Goodman, 49, Atlanta

 &HT;    
 By KATRINA HERON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    It was Karl Marx, not Gore Vidal, who said that history repeats
itself _ the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.
 &HT;    But since Vidal has said practically everything else of interest
and wit on the subject, he might as well have said that too.
 &HT;    He has spent a half-century chronicling U.S. history, in the six
linked novels ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln,'' ``1876,'' ``Empire,''
``Hollywood'' and ``Washington, D.C.,'' while also knocking out
thunderous essays, not to mention such hairpin turns as ``Myra
Breckinridge.'' His most recent novel is ``The Smithsonian
Institution.''
 &HT;    One of literature's most caustic and seductive voices, a rich
kid who early on nurtured an acerbic relationship with the spoils
of capitalism, a libertarian's hero but also JFK's intimate _ and
Jackie's brother by marriage _ Gore Vidal has lived an erratically
patriotic life that finally landed him on the Amalfi coast, looking
back at us savages.
 &HT;    What does the future look like from there?
 &HT;    Al Gore is his cousin, which may or may not account for Vidal's
defense of the Internet as an endangered emblem of democracy. Yes,
he has a computer _ and a computer vassal to operate it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KATRINA HERON: Today the scientist-nerd has become a new
mythological hero. What's the next station in his journey?
 &HT;    GORE VIDAL: ``Mythological'' is the wrong word. He's not a myth
but a dim fact, like the Forbes list of the Truly Rich and
Infamous. The physical sciences _ not the arts and certainly not
philosophy _ are the central fact of the last three centuries.
Interesting that three writers as different as Martin Amis
(``Time's Arrow''), Tom Stoppard (``Arcadia''), and Gore Vidal
should all be writing about physics as fiction, or vice versa.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Can we learn from history?
 &HT;    A: The United States of Amnesia has a very good reason not to
cultivate a sense of the past, as our crimes against so many people
might make us _ not, God forbid, guilty, but jittery living in a
world where we are, contrary to our unrelenting propaganda,
detested.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is ``progress'' a fiction?
 &HT;    A: Was the invention of cellophane progress? My father brought
some home for me to look at in the '30s. DuPont had introduced it
and no one knew what to do with the stuff. Now human progress, and
some of my new novel, involves slow alterations of a Darwinian
nature, like the withering away of the little toe or the addition
of a third sphere to the brain. Incalculable.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You do take the long view, centuries-long at least.
 &HT;    A: I try to imagine it all from the big whimper on, and that
puts our self-important race in a class with the viruses. I do look
_ hope _ for change, but our short known history of 4,000 years or
so tends to be more of the same, with variable interest rates.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So how does the ``Digital Revolution'' rate in revolutions
the world has known?
 &HT;    A: Revolution, or evolution, or simply the latest gimmick? A
subject I don't ponder. I still want to know what Iago meant when
he said to Othello, ``What you know, you know.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Lots of people have claimed that a Kennedy White House would
never survive in this age of Internet/media frenzy. You're one of
the few people actually in a position to know.
 &HT;    A: Actually, we always thought JFK would be shot _ by an angry
husband. But he was a cooler character than Bill Clinton and I
suspect would have stared down the enemy. Also, if he had to, he'd
take everyone else with him. He would _ and could _ reveal
everyone's sex life, and then the government would fold. He was the
greatest gossip I've ever known.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What's the biggest thing you've changed your mind about over
the years?
 &HT;    A: I was brought up, like all Americans, to believe that we were
a peace-loving country whose bad luck it was to keep getting roped
into other people's wars. Then, while writing ``Empire,'' I
realized to what extent the Spanish-American War was cold-bloodedly
planned, specifically by the assistant secretary of the Navy,
Theodore Roosevelt and by Admiral Mahan, Cabot Lodge, and Brooks
Adams _ New England grandees with imperial longings. These four,
exactly one century ago, maneuvered us into a war with Spain so
that we could steal the Spanish colonial empire.
 &HT;    Looking again at ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln'' and ``1876,'' I saw there
was something big at the core of these narratives, something that
as an American author I had missed in my own work: that plainly we
are driven to conquest, whether by love of God or by some peculiar
DNA code.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: T., the 13-year-old protagonist of your latest novel, ``The
Smithsonian Institution,'' is your bid to rewrite history, showing
us what might have been an alternative future.
 &HT;    A: Yes, Woodrow Wilson provided us with World War I _ after
another invasion of Mexico, just for practice. It should be noted
that, all through this, the American people, ignorant of geography
and history, wanted no part of foreign wars. My guy T. time-travels
so that he can stop World War II, by stopping World War I, by
keeping Wilson from becoming president.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Where would you time-travel?
 &HT;    A: Nowhere without anesthetics.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you find the future more interesting than it used to be?
 &HT;    A: Less interesting. The only hopeful sign I see is that our
number two export, after weapons, is entertainment. Can Disney save
us? Tune in to the next millennium.
 &HT;    I haven't even made reservations, since, actually, I'm not going
to spend much _ if any _ time there.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: A good argument for cloning, perhaps?
 &HT;    A: What's the point of a physical duplicate when it is the
mind-experience that is a person? Yet if memory could be saved at
regular intervals, one might have a true immortality _ very
tempting in the sense that the more one knows, the more wonderful
consciousness is.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you have any concerns about electronic books, and
specifically, the electronic supertome, whose screen will display
the contents of innumerable books?
 &HT;    A: Yes! How do we _ the creators _ get paid?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What will you write about next?
 &HT;    A: The loss of our Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What advice would you give to a creative 23-year-old looking
to make a difference in the world?
 &HT;    A: Read.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Did you ever get any good advice at that age, or any other?
 &HT;    A: My father warned me never to date a girl who called her
mother Mummy. So I dated her brother and lived happily ever after.

 By KATRINA HERON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    It was Karl Marx, not Gore Vidal, who said that history repeats
itself _ the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.
 &HT;    But since Vidal has said practically everything else of interest
and wit on the subject, he might as well have said that too.
 &HT;    He has spent a half-century chronicling U.S. history, in the six
linked novels ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln,'' ``1876,'' ``Empire,''
``Hollywood'' and ``Washington, D.C.,'' while also knocking out
thunderous essays, not to mention such hairpin turns as ``Myra
Breckinridge.'' His most recent novel is ``The Smithsonian
Institution.''
 &HT;    One of literature's most caustic and seductive voices, a rich
kid who early on nurtured an acerbic relationship with the spoils
of capitalism, a libertarian's hero but also JFK's intimate _ and
Jackie's brother by marriage _ Gore Vidal has lived an erratically
patriotic life that finally landed him on the Amalfi coast, looking
back at us savages.
 &HT;    What does the future look like from there?
 &HT;    Al Gore is his cousin, which may or may not account for Vidal's
defense of the Internet as an endangered emblem of democracy. Yes,
he has a computer _ and a computer vassal to operate it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KATRINA HERON: Today the scientist-nerd has become a new
mythological hero. What's the next station in his journey?
 &HT;    GORE VIDAL: ``Mythological'' is the wrong word. He's not a myth
but a dim fact, like the Forbes list of the Truly Rich and
Infamous. The physical sciences _ not the arts and certainly not
philosophy _ are the central fact of the last three centuries.
Interesting that three writers as different as Martin Amis
(``Time's Arrow''), Tom Stoppard (``Arcadia''), and Gore Vidal
should all be writing about physics as fiction, or vice versa.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Can we learn from history?
 &HT;    A: The United States of Amnesia has a very good reason not to
cultivate a sense of the past, as our crimes against so many people
might make us _ not, God forbid, guilty, but jittery living in a
world where we are, contrary to our unrelenting propaganda,
detested.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is ``progress'' a fiction?
 &HT;    A: Was the invention of cellophane progress? My father brought
some home for me to look at in the '30s. DuPont had introduced it
and no one knew what to do with the stuff. Now human progress, and
some of my new novel, involves slow alterations of a Darwinian
nature, like the withering away of the little toe or the addition
of a third sphere to the brain. Incalculable.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You do take the long view, centuries-long at least.
 &HT;    A: I try to imagine it all from the big whimper on, and that
puts our self-important race in a class with the viruses. I do look
_ hope _ for change, but our short known history of 4,000 years or
so tends to be more of the same, with variable interest rates.

&HT;        MAYORS URGE CONGRESS TO QUICKLY RESOLVE CLINTON'S FATE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 -- Mayors from across the country penned a
letter to Congress this week urging them to quickly decide
President Clinton's fate and focus its energies on solving problems
that are facing American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors from 41 cities -- both large and small -- signed the six
paragraph letter that was delivered to Republican and Democratic
leaders in the House and Senate Tuesday. Most of the signers are
Democrats, but is also includes a handful of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said his mayoral colleagues are
frustrated that, with only weeks before Congress is scheduled to
adjourn, the legislative process has been ``paralyzed'' over
Clinton's admission to having an inappropriate relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going home in a few weeks,'' Menino said during an
interview Wednesday. ``I am not going home in a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston mayor, a Democrat, blamed Republican Congressional
leaders for focusing on the scandal and trying to embarrass Clinton
for his transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Congress' only makes decisions of what tapes
they are going to release, and what they are going to say on the
six o'clock news,'' Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   Menino said that he thinks the public humiliation Clinton has
suffered should be punishment enough, and he is opposed to
impeachment or censure.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was drafted by Denver Mayor Wellington Webb and
highlighted an array of problems facing urban and suburban cities
ranging from crime to economic development that they believe
Congress should be focusing their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said the mayors want congressional leaders to know
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky is not on the minds of
constituents back home. Instead, people are more concerned about
issues that will have an impact on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has really lost focus on the issues we deal with,''
Webb said. ``What we are hearing from our hometowns is that most
people are tired of hearing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter chastises Clinton for his actions, but it also said
they will ``continue to support his leadership.'' The letter does
not offer advice on what type, if any, punishment they think
Clinton should receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deplore the actions taken by the president, and we regret
particularly that this kind of discussion is presented daily to our
nation's children,'' the letter said. ``For their sake as well, we
ask you to move swiftly on the matters before you.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayors signed the letter last weekend while attending the
U.S. Conference of Mayors' Summer Leadership Conference in Salt
Lake City.

   Crack Series Advisory
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after crack cocaine gained a foothold in
America's poor, minority neighborhoods, a hidden generation of
motherless children is coming of age. With their parents tethered
more tightly to crack cocaine than to them, these orphans are
rearing themselves without fathers and often without mothers. Now
teenagers, many are having babies of their own. In ``Growing Up
With Crack,'' Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer Jane Hansen
presents their stories and those of the committed individuals
trying to help. Atlanta leads the nation in the continuing crack
crisis, as evidenced by data showing positive cocaine tests among
female arrestees.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a budget for the series. All will be available on
Friday, Oct. 2. Photos and graphics are available from the New York
Times News Service. For more information, please call CoxNet at
404-526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   (Papers not interested in the whole series may find the most
pertinent information in Part 1 and in the CRACK-CURE story in Part
6.)
</P>
<P>
   PART 1
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-GENERATION _ ATLANTA _ More than a decade after social
worker Donna Carson first detected the effects of crack on
newborns, Atlanta's first generation of crack babies is coming of
age. And they, too, are becoming young mothers, having to fend for
themselves and create their own semblance of family. WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-VICTIMS _ ATLANTA _ More than 10 years after crack gained
a foothold in Atlanta's inner-city neighborhoods, children remain
its primary victims. WITH CHART
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-SOCIAL-DAMAGE _ ATLANTA _ Even though babies born with
cocaine in their veins may not be plagued with the developmental
delays experts once predicted, the social deprivation may be just
as devastating and life-long. WITH PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   PART 2
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-CRUISE _ ATLANTA _ Demetria Walls knows the power of crack
cocaine. Now the former addict cruises Atlanta neighborhoods where
the orphans of crack suffer the double blow of neglect at home and
danger in the streets. WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   PART 3
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-ABANDON _ ATLANTA _ Medical advances allow Egleston
Children's Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital to save newborns
who couldn't be helped just a decade ago. But hospital workers
agonize over the choices they face when they send the babies home.
One child's story poses the question: Are we saving babies only to
abandon them? WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-SEND-HOME _ ATLANTA _ A team of physicians, nurses and
social workers move under dim lights from one plastic cocoon to the
next, quietly discussing each of the tiny sick babies that lives
within. Among them are the next generation of crack babies. Despite
the state-of-the-art medical care the newborns receive, their
caregivers wonder what purpose they perform in saving the babies'
lives only to send them home to crack addicts. WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   PART 4
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-CHILD-ABUSE _ ATLANTA _ Is crack addiction child abuse? We
shouldn't be surprised, much less shocked, at the consequences of
sending newborns home with crack addicts when the ``family first''
system is at work, experts say. Neglect, and sometimes death, await
them. It's a miracle that some survive. WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-COURT _ ATLANTA _ One recent day in Fulton County Juvenile
Court, a 4-year-old boy walked into the austere courtroom of Judge
Sanford ``Sammy'' Jones and headed straight for the judge's lap.
The boy and his twin sister were there that day so the judge could
figure out what to do with them. They'd been living for weeks in an
emergency shelter since authorities discovered that their mother _
a crack addict _ had been neglecting them. Drug addiction _ and the
child maltreatment that often follows _ is so prevalent here that
in the last year, Fulton judges have created a special calendar to
hear nothing but cases involving babies born with positive drug
screens, almost all with cocaine in their systems. WITH PHOTOS AND
CHART
</P>
<P>
   PART 5
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-KINSHIP-CARE _ ATLANTA _ Mary Shannon is a 55-year-old
woman with a new baby. She didn't want another child, and when she
learned of the pregnancy, she wanted nothing to do with it. Shannon
is the child's grandmother, one of thousands of American
grandparents raising their children's children _ a trend becoming
more common because of crack cocaine. Drug-addicted parents have
created a whole new class of children who are flooding the gates of
foster care, experts say. With too few foster homes, child welfare
workers are turning to relatives. WITH PHOTOS AND CHART
</P>
<P>
   PART 6
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-INCENTIVE _ ATLANTA _ Only a handful of residential drug
treatment programs in Georgia allow moms to keep their babies with
them. Gateway Cottage is one. A strict regimen, far from their old
haunts, offers crack moms their best chance at a new life. Their
babies provide the incentive. WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-CURE _ Heroin addicts have methadone. Cigarette smokers
have nicotine patches. From opiates to alcohol, there are
substitute drugs that help squelch the urge or discourage the use.
But there is no medication that stems an addict's powerful craving
for cocaine, one of the most addictive drugs known. That could soon
change.
</P>
<P>
   PART 7
</P>
<P>
   CRACK-PREGNANT _ ATLANTA _ Donna Carson used to look at a
pregnant crack addict and see scum of the Earth. Then she got to
know one. She no longer hates crack addicts _ she's devoted to
them. She listens to them, befriends them, threatens them and most
of all coaxes them into drug treatment. WITH PHOTOS AND CHART

<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda _ Raphael Nawiro got up extra early one steamy
morning this summer. He walked a mile from his home, then took two
long bus rides until he reached Uganda's principal medical complex,
the aging, overburdened Old Mulago Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He went directly to the office of Dr. Roy Mugerwa, who will run
an AIDS vaccine trial that is about to begin here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to enroll in the study,'' he told the secretary, eager
to take part in a promising and ethically contentious experiment.
``I want to help find a cure for what's killing us all.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary nodded gravely and told him where to go to fill
out forms. ``I can't promise a thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nawiro, a schoolteacher, is under no illusions that the test of
any vaccine will prevent him from becoming infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. But at the age of 32 he has lost five
members of his family to this plague, and he is weary of the
endless death that has come to rule his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to do something serious about this disease,'' he
said quietly as he rushed off to work. ``Isn't a vaccine really the
only hope we have?''
</P>
<P>
   On this continent the answer to that dark question is a ringing,
undeniable yes. People infected with HIV in rich countries now have
access to drug combinations that extend their lives. But in Africa,
where AIDS threatens to destroy an entire generation, there is no
such reason for optimism. And unless somebody comes up with a
vaccine, that is unlikely to change before millions more die.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ethical guidelines have made clear that vaccines
should be tested in developed countries _ where health care is
excellent _ before they are used in places without a safety net,
like Uganda. With AIDS, for the first time, the international
medical community has done away with that necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be this way,'' said Mugerwa, medical professor at
Makerere University who is the principal investigator for the
vaccine trial scheduled to begin in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to do it first anywhere else,'' he said, ``and
I don't blame them. We are the people with the problem. Why should
Americans undertake risky research on themselves for a problem they
don't really have? That would make them the guinea pigs. The risk
belongs here, where the people are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, a country struggling valiantly to cope with an
epidemic that has infected 20 percent of its population, the
questions surrounding the trial have become deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Who will take part in the first round, and what will happen if
people become infected and sick after they have volunteered, given
that Uganda spends about $6 per person annually on health care?
Will they receive the best medical care that money can buy, as they
would in America or France, two other countries that are testing
AIDS vaccines? If they do, who will pay? If not, will they be
treated like any other Africans _ given aspirin, good wishes and no
hope?
</P>
<P>
   What if, as is often the case with vaccines, this trial shows
that it may not prevent an AIDS infection but it may make the
disease less deadly? Should the test be stopped immediately so that
the vaccine can be given to people right away, before scientists
can find out the answers to how good the vaccine might ultimately
be or how best to use it? Or should the test go on, with some
people receiving a useless placebo, so that researchers can learn
the full potential of any possible vaccine?
</P>
<P>
   And, although most scientific experts say there will be no
useful AIDS vaccine for at least a decade, what will happen if that
vaccine is eventually produced thanks to the help of the eager,
fragile and desperate people of Uganda?
</P>
<P>
   What guarantee will there be, after helping to solve one of
modern medicine's most frightening and complex problems, that any
proven AIDS vaccine would be available here or in similar
countries, where most basic medicines are too expensive to buy?
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies will want to recoup their enormous investments,
and that means selling a vaccine to people who can pay for it. Few
effective vaccines, even the one for hepatitis B, which was
developed only after long testing in Senegal, have been made
routinely available in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   They just cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is worried that we will use Africa, develop a
vaccine there, say thanks and then take it back to Europe and
America,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of the
United Nations AIDS Program, who has worked to focus more attention
on the scope of the epidemic in the developing world. ``I don't
believe that will happen. But we are in a terrible position. The
process is perilous. It is unfair. And it is filled with inequities
_ because the world is filled with inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is our choice? In Africa they need a vaccine. Should we
just tell them we have too many ethical problems to help them find
one?''
</P>
<P>
   A walk across the campus of the Old Mulago, this giant hospital
complex that has served as ground zero in Africa's gruesome fight
with AIDS, answers that question in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no waiting rooms, but every landing on every floor
overflows with sick people. Mothers in bright cotton robes sit
quietly nursing their infants; old men wheeze in the stairwell.
Hundreds of men and women sit in eerie silence, coughing and
waiting for a number to be called. Some wait for days, sleeping
when they can, eating if there is food. There is probably no
hospital on earth _ and possibly no country _ more besieged by the
AIDS epidemic. Every pair of eyes seems to spell the word despair.
</P>
<P>
   So despite a rancorous debate in the West, wherecritics say
Africans will be misused in any test here because the highest
standards of care and of informed consent are impossible to attain,
Uganda is about to begin its trial. And it is hard to find anybody
in this country who thinks that's a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Forty healthy volunteers will be selected. Half will receive a
placebo that would have no effect on an HIV infection. The other
half will receive a vaccine into which some genes responsible for
producing important HIV proteins, some building blocks of the
virus, have been inserted. There will be no actual virus in the
vaccine. It is an initial test and its purpose is to see whether it
is safe and whether it it has any effect.
</P>
<P>
   If the vaccine stimulates the body's defenses _ and the placebo
does not _ that will mean that the vaccine should undergo further
tests on a larger group of people.
</P>
<P>
   There are different strains of HIV, known as clades, and the
predominant strains from Africa are different from those usually
seen in the West. Still, one of the critical questions about any
vaccine is how widely it can be used, and the hope is that at least
the basic building blocks of any vaccine that work on one strain
would also work on the others.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vaccine may reduce the amount of HIV in people who
have already become infected, it cannot really be tested broadly in
the United States. Americans who are diagnosed with HIV now
immediately start a drug treatment regimen aimed at cutting down
the amount of the virus in their bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less would be considered unethical. But if people in a
vaccine trial are also on these new drugs, researchers would have
no way to judge whether a vaccine is reducing the virus, or whether
the medicine was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Since people in Uganda cannot hope to afford such drug
treatment, which can cost more than $15,000 a year, they are
perfect subjects for such a vaccine test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question arises are we basically exporting our risky
scientific research, from which we would benefit, to the third
world?'' said Thomas M. Murray, director of Case Western Reserve
University's Center for Biomedical Ethics, speaking at a forum on
the vaccine trials this year. Case Western, which for years has had
a relationship with Makerere University Medical School, is one of
the vaccine trial sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a far more morally complicated issue than critics of
the research have ever made it out to be,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it has become clear to many people that there are
practical and cultural barriers to applying the same standards of
ethics in America and Africa. In the United States, for example,
informed consent is required for people who take part in drug
tests. They need to know what the test will do, what the risks are
and what the rewards are. In Africa, such consent is often given by
husbands or doctors or tribal leaders and many health officials say
the country simply doesn't have enough trained doctors to inform
everyone about complicated programs like the AIDS vaccine trials.
Informing a representative of a village would never be considered
enough in America, but in Uganda who should decide what is enough?
</P>
<P>
   Most experts, in Africa and in the West, say that every
participant always deserves to understand the risks and
possibilities of trials. And most specialists believe that informed
consent is not only possible in Africa, but essential if trials are
to work. Still, there is simply not enough time or money in most
cases to make certain that each potential risk or reward is
understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things seem so simple in a rich country,'' said Dr. Peter
Mugyenyi, the director of Uganda's Joint Clinical Research Center,
which will administer the AIDS vaccine trials here in conjunction
with a consortium of groups that include the National Institutes of
Health and Pasteur-Merieux, the French company that has developed
the vaccine and will provide it for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sometimes talk about this in America like it's the
Tuskegee experiment and we are simple, ignorant dupes,'' he said.
In the Tuskegee experiment, one of medicine's most notorious abuses
of research subjects, poor black men in Alabama were denied
affordable, effective and widely available treatment for syphilis.
They were not informed of their rights in the research or told what
was happening to them. And they were allowed to get sick when
penicillin could have cured them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly insulting to us and to the Western agencies and
individuals who have worked with us,'' said Mugyenyi, who presides
over a state-of-the-art research center staffed with highly trained
scientists from Uganda, Europe and America. ``Sure there are some
questions that are hard to address, like how will these people be
cared for if they become sick. But let's also look at the world and
tell the truth. In the history of medicine the only things that
have really worked to stop diseases in the third world have been
vaccines. Drugs won't work for us. Prevention has obviously failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is almost impossible. Without a vaccine we are going
to keep on losing and we are going to lose a lot.`
</P>
<P>
   More than a million people in Uganda have already died of AIDS.
The country's leadership is easily the most open in Africa about
the issue _ the president and other leaders mention the disease in
nearly every speech. It is only rare families where at least one
member has not fallen ill.
</P>
<P>
   Mugerwa and his colleagues are aware that in the past, when
vaccines have been developed in Africa, they disappear as soon as
they become worth money. That is why Uganda decided to be in on
every level of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are participating in the trials,'' he said, ``not just with
our citizens, but with our brains. We have demanded a role in the
research and we have sent our best people abroad to help develop
the drugs. When this vaccine becomes effective _ in a year or 10
years or two generations _ we want to be able to say that we have a
central interest in this product and you owe us for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That will help but it won't solve the problem. Representatives
from Pasteur-Merieux have said that it is now impossible to guess
how much a vaccine would cost since it does not yet exist. They
have also said, repeatedly, that foundations, international relief
agencies, pharmaceutical companies and governments will all have to
band together to come up with enough money to buy vaccines for poor
countries. The message is clear: First let's get a vaccine, then we
will figure out how to get it to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a student of history, it's not all that comforting
to see how Africa has been treated in the past,'' said Dr. Edward
Mbiddle, chief of Makerere University's Cancer Institute. ``But you
know what? If we are going to have a future, we can't afford to
live in history.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the better part of two decades, economists and
elected officials promised that all kinds of good things would
happen if the federal government stopped running huge budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the government closed the books on its fiscal year,
and for the first time since 1969 the budget will show a surplus,
which President Clinton said should be about $70 billion when all
the calculations are completed in the next few weeks. That is
slightly higher than the $63 billion projected earlier this month
by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the payoff?
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the answer is straightforward: Interest rates
are lower than they would be otherwise, a development that has
helped push unemployment down and the stock market up throughout
much of this decade. That shift has also helped establish the
United States as an anchor of stability in a world now at risk from
the deepening global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, some economists and analysts think the benefits
from fiscal prudence have been overstated, and some wonder whether
the projected surpluses will materialize if the economy should slip
into recession. There is still a debate about how much the strong
economy reflects the nation's improved fiscal condition and how
much the improved fiscal condition is a result of the strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some lingering doubt, especially among liberal
Democrats, about whether the fiscal belt-tightening will prove a
good deal for low- and moderate-income people in the long run, or
whether it primarily benefited Wall Street and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no consensus yet about what to do with coming
surpluses, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated will
total $1.55 trillion over the next decade. The debate over tax
cuts, additional spending, reducing the national debt and
strengthening entitlement programs is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a growing battle over whether the government
should consider itself to be in surplus at all, since nearly all of
the excess revenues in coming years come from payroll taxes that
are supposed to be earmarked for the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The dawn of the surplus era passed all but unnoticed Wednesday
in the financial markets, which have long since factored in the
anticipated good news. Meanwhile, in Washington, it was a day for
celebration and contention, with both Democrats and Republicans
claiming credit for the turnaround while laying out their own
priorities for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated his position that the surplus should be kept
in reserve until Congress and the administration settle on a plan
to shore up Social Security for the coming retirement of the
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans kept up their demands that a chunk of the surplus be
allocated to tax cuts so that it is not used for increased
spending, and said that Clinton had already raided the surplus by
proposing as much as $17 billion in emergency spending next year
for domestic and military programs that fall outside the normal
budget process.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the political posturing, there is agreement among many
economists that fiscal rectitude, when combined with unexpectedly
high tax receipts stemming in part from the rapid run-up in the
stock market, helped to push down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That happened because the government's borrowing requirements
declined, and because the absence of fiscal stimulus convinced
investors and the Federal Reserve Board that inflation was less of
a threat.
</P>
<P>
   How much lower rates are than they would have been in the
absence of fiscal improvement is largely a matter of guesswork,
given the myriad of interrelated factors that influence rates.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that lower rates have been a key
factor in keeping the economy growing since 1991 and in generating
new jobs at a healthy pace while stimulating business investment in
productivity-enhancing machinery and computers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many analysts say, the United States is facing a
period of deepening global economic crisis with considerable
strength and resilience, a far cry from its position a decade ago
when it was frequently judged to be in economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of the economy that we're all enjoying now is in
no small part attributable to the efforts we've made to eliminate
the deficit,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office who is now a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, the research group. ``We can be buffeted by
the winds from Asia and the waves from Latin America, and still our
economy chugs along.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, moreover, moving from deficits to surpluses
provides the United States with greater flexibility in economic and
social policy, from cutting taxes to increasing spending and coping
with the strains that will result from an aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our policy for years was driven by nickel-and-diming
the deficit rather than asking what's the right policy,'' said Van
Doorn Ooms, a former chief economist for the House Budget Committee
who is now with the Committee for Economic Development, a
business-sponsored research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we maintain our heads and approach this sensibly, it's much
easier now to take on issues like Social Security and Medicare,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been challenges to the prevailing fiscal
orthodoxy from both the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, many liberals have long been uncomfortable with
the notion that balancing the budget was more important than
financing social programs. To some Democrats, the emphasis on
eliminating the deficit remains little more than cover for
Republicans who want to shrink the size and influence of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But they also acknowledge real benefits from fiscal prudence,
particularly the Federal Reserve's willingness to cut interest
rates early in the Clinton administration and its increased
tolerance for extremely low unemployment rates even as growth has
remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those cuts in real interest rates were very important in
propelling the economy forward,'' said Robert Reich, who was labor
secretary during Clinton's first term. ``On the other hand, deficit
reduction meant cuts in domestic discretionary programs, especially
those for the less well off. And the president was unable to do
anything close to the $50 billion a year in education, training and
research and development investments that he had built his 1992
campaign around.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the sacrifices turn out to be worthwhile will depend on
how well the economy holds up the next time the business cycle
turns down and on how the country chooses to use the coming
surpluses, Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're turned into tax cuts that are mostly for people in
the top 20 percent of income or wealth, then many of the sacrifices
made by those in the bottom half, in terms of programs lost or
investments not made, will have been for very little,'' Reich said.
``If the surpluses are turned into investments in the productive
capacities of people in the bottom half _ education, job
retraining, an expanded earned-income tax credit, for example _
then the payoff may be quite substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a
former Reagan administration budget official, questioned the
premise that eliminating the deficit _ or more precisely,
restraining spending _ had been the key to the economy's strong
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The causality is working in the other direction here,'' Cogan
said. ``The reason we have a budget surplus is not so much because
we have had fiscal restraint _ although we have had more fiscal
restraint in recent years _ but because of a healthy economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogan said the surpluses provided the nation with an opportunity
to change its tax system, strengthen Social Security or reduce the
$5.5 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, the surpluses can also represent a large
problem,'' Cogan said. ``Along with surpluses come, inevitably, the
pressure to spend more, and we're already seeing the manifestation
of that pressure.'
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that the elimination of the deficit has brought
tangible economic benefits is not universally accepted, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we seem to be moving away from chaos and toward
stability,'' Peter Bernstein, an economic consultant in New York,
wrote recently in Challenge magazine. ``It should be good news. And
yet the payoff we were promised from reducing the budget deficit
remains unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein argued that the trade deficit, which some economists
had predicted would fall in tandem with the budget deficit,
remained stubbornly high, even before the Asian crisis sent it even
higher. And he made a case that interest rates, adjusted for
inflation, have actually remained stubbornly high despite the
fiscal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the trade and budget deficits were inextricably
linked may have been questionable from the start, since trade is
subject to political and business influences as well as fiscal
change. And given the tangle of complicated factors that determine
interest rates, it is difficult to say what would have happened to
rates had the nation not balanced its budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernstein also made a point that would resonate with many
economists in a world subject to rapid economic change: that it is
hazardous to assume that changing one element in the country's
economic mix could be counted on to have a certain result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advocates of the mainstream hypothesis fell into error
because they forgot one of the primary lessons of macroeconomics,''
Bernstein wrote. ``Partial equilibrium _ moving one variable while
holding all else constant _ is an interesting but a hazardous basis
for prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   As a case in point, Bernstein cites savings rates. While
deficits declined, reducing what economists call public dissaving,
the savings rate in the private sector was falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profligate private sector, and a swelling stream of both
domestic and foreign investment in the United States, thwarted the
result that the mainstream had assured us was in the cards,''
Bernstein said.

<P>
   KAHLOTUS, Wash. _ The huge piles of golden grain that rise like
sand dunes along the banks of the Columbia and Snake Rivers are a
beautiful sight, but to the wheat farmers of the Pacific Northwest,
they are really a sign of deep trouble. In a normal year, 90
percent of the wheat crop here in the Pacific Northwest is exported
to Asian markets, but this is not a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   Hammered by a sharp fall-off in demand because of Asia's
economic crisis, the region's farmers are faced with one of their
biggest stockpiles ever _ 340 million bushels, enough to fill a
line of hopper rail cars stretching from Seattle to Chicago. The
price of wheat has dropped to a 21-year low, but even then, as
Lonny Lightfoot, manager of the Port Wallula Barge Terminal
explains, ``There's just no selling it.''
</P>
<P>
   In central Washington, the heart of an apple industry that is by
far the largest of any state's, growers are forecasting a record
harvest this autumn. But the growers are so alarmed by the drop in
Asian demand _ Thailand, Malaysia, China and Indonesia all bought
50 percent to 85 percent fewer apples from Washington over the last
year _ that they recently voted to levy a 15-cent-a-box
``promotional assessment'' on themselves for an advertising
campaign. The aim is to get Americans to eat an extra apple a day.
</P>
<P>
   Here in what is by many measures the most trade-dependent region
of the country, Asia's economic problems are clearly hitting home,
starkly illustrating the domestic downside of a crisis that in
other parts of the United States may still seem like an
across-the-world abstraction, or perhaps even a welcome opportunity
in the form of ever-cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Pacific Northwest's sag in exports to Asia limited to
wheat or apples. Sales to Asia of computers, semiconductors and
software are all down sharply, and ``a lot of that stuff's more
perishable than the food,'' said Jeff Seely, president of Netstock
Direct Corp., an Internet services company in Bellevue, Wash.,
speaking only partly in jest.
</P>
<P>
   And the region's biggest employer, the Boeing Co. in Seattle,
has been hit by the worrisome news from Asia, which typically buys
about a third of its planes and which was long seen as Boeing's big
growth market. In recent weeks alone, China froze all of its
airplane orders and delayed some deliveries, while the flag carrier
of the Philippines went out of business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory survey of industries here indicates the ways that
the strong American dollar can do damage at home. And while the
Northwest's overall economy remains strong, Asia's difficulties
have already led some government officials to project a noticeable
slowdown in growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, for instance, the state's top economist, Chang
Mook Sohn, recently cited Asian problems in revising his estimates
for growth. In a presentation to Gov. Gary Locke's council of
economic advisers, he lowered projected job growth in the next two
years to 1.5 percent (it was 4.1 percent in 1997), and he lowered
estimates for the state's tax revenue in that period by almost $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   At the Port of Seattle, imports increased 37 percent in the
first six months of this year, compared with that period last year,
while exports dropped 24 percent, an imbalance that many experts
here find troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is crucial to the economy in this part of the country,
and anything that happens in Asia affects us very quickly and very
deeply,'' said Patricia Davis, a port commissioner and the
president of the Washington Council on International Trade, a
nonprofit business-backed organization here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs of a real downward spiral,'' added Ms. Davis,
ticking off statistics on the decline in current state exports to
10 Asian countries _ 48 percent in crops, 38 percent in apparel, 54
percent in lumber and wood, 22 percent in computers and industrial
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the pain felt more keenly than in the rolling
farmlands here in eastern Washington, where the interconnectedness
of world economies is vividly illustrated by the detailed knowledge
local farmers have of the ups and downs of the Thai baht, the
Japanese yen or the Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
   These farmers are long accustomed to the vagaries of the
weather, but something about the uncertainty of Asia's economy
seems almost more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said Gary Galbreath, a 58-year-old
farmer who grew 4,200 acres of wheat under near-perfect conditions
this year. ``Here it seems like you're cutting a pretty nice crop
and Mother Nature is smiling on you, but then you go to market and
you're not making any money at all. Not even close to breaking
even.''
</P>
<P>
   The local price for wheat recently dropped to $2.24 a bushel _
it was as high as $5.20 two years ago _ and most farmers estimate
that they need to make $3.25 to $3.50 a bushel before they can turn
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation all over,'' said Jonathan Schlueter,
executive vice president of the Pacific Northwest Grain and Feed
Association, a trade group based in Portland, Ore. ``Farmers know
they have a good crop, they know they have the quality foreign
buyers want, and yet the buyers are waiting for the markets to go
down. And it gets cheaper the longer they wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Properly covered and aerated, the grain can last for years, but
with all elevators in the area at capacity, wheat is piling up
along the rivers and in unlikely settings, like the broad lawn of a
go-cart track in St. John. But the stockpiles are ominous in
themselves: As the supply grows, prices are likelier to stay low,
so that another bountiful crop next year may only add to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers here say they can generally ride out one bad year _ they
have all done it before _ but what is worrisome about the Asian
crisis is that no one knows when it will lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prices stay like this another year or two, you're going to
see a crisis around here,'' said Vern Regennitter, general manager
of Ritzville Warehouse Co., a grain elevator operator in Ritzville,
a farm community where the welcoming sign at the edge of town
boasts that its Future Farmers of America chapter has won national
championships in parliamentary procedure and land evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to be in a world of hurt,'' he
added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with residents at places like Ritzville's
branch of the Wheatland Bank or the Wheat and Barley, a diner in
nearby Colfax, the worries that Asia's crisis could drag down
American farms are palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers in general have to deal with the weather, and we're
accustomed to taking the bad with the good, but you really get to
wondering if this thing in Asia is the big one,'' said Al Curtis, a
St. John wheat farmer whose summary of his harvest this summer
resembles a grim little haiku:
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent yield, terrible price, no profit.''
</P>
<P>
   What is also clear is that many farmers are getting increasingly
angry over the trade embargoes that the United States has imposed
on many nations around the world. Many here fervently believe that
they might have faced ruin if Congress had not agreed to
temporarily lift a ban on food sales to India and Pakistan. The ban
was imposed after the two countries tested nuclear weapons in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to turn around and launch a nuclear missile
filled with grain at us,'' said State Rep. Mark Schoesler, a
Republican and a Ritzville wheat farmer. ``If we take their money
and they take our grain, I don't think that's going to hurt
anybody. I can't think of any country we've turned around because
of food sanctions anyway. Castro's still Castro, Saddam's still
Saddam, and we're not making those sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in a broad reflection of such discontent, the leaders
of groups representing wheat, grain, barley, pea and lentil growers
in the Northwest signed a petition calling for elimination of all
sanctions on American food exports except in cases of ``compelling
national emergency'' or a declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   Apple growers, coming into their harvest season, are also deeply
worried by Asia's problems. Indonesia, for instance, which bought
4.1 million boxes of Washington apples in the 1996-97 season, the
most of any Asian nation except Taiwan, bought just 670,000 boxes
in the last season. A box weighs about 42 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American consumption of apples has flattened in
recent years at about 21 pounds annually per person, compared with
35 pounds in Canada and 50 pounds in some European countries, said
Jim Thomas, communications director for the Washington State Apple
Commission in Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the new marketing campaign, which comes amid a projected
record harvest of 103 million boxes in a state that typically grows
nearly two-thirds of all the nation's apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to compete for all those stomachs out there,'' Thomas
said. ``We're competing against Frito-Lay and all those people who
are spending millions of dollars to try to come up with what we
already are _ fat-free stuff, sodium-free, etc. But the problem for
us is to get to the consumer with the kind of high-profile imagery
those snack companies already have.''
</P>
<P>
   The $23 million advertising campaign is not exactly huge _
Thomas estimates that is the same amount that gets spent to market
a Snickers candy bar alone _ but it is a start. ``It gets us into
the ball game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the computer industry's problems in selling to
Asia have been generally offset by continued strong sales to
Europe, Canada and Mexico. William Archey, president of the
American Electronics Association, the largest high-technology trade
group in the country, said that he could not break down specific
figures for sales from the Northwest, but he noted that the region
had a heavy and growing concentration of computer companies,
including Microsoft, and that many companies here had been
specifically trying to increase sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, he said, sales to Asia of computer equipment and
software in the first six months of this year fell to $28.7 billion
from $32.5 billion in the same period of 1997. That 12 percent
decline is even greater if sales to China are factored out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue that I think is the most important, and only the
prophets can deal with it, is when this is all going to turn
around,'' Archey said. ``I think the most optimistic expectation at
this point is another two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the farm region, Northwesterners are trying to
treat the Asian problems with some stoicism. ``There's an old
saying,'' said Pearson Burke, a grain merchandiser and commodities
broker at the Ritzville Warehouse. ``Low prices cure low prices and
high prices cure high prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he offered a visitor a tour of his company, including an
elevator stacked full of wheat in a million-bushel pile stretching
more than half the length of a football field and 80 feet high,
Burke said the forces at work in this crisis felt far more remote
than those brought on by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things a farmer can't control, including
the weather,'' he said. ``But this is something else entirely. The
most skilled farmer here can't control what's going on in the
economy half a world away.''

NEW DIRECTOR STEERS FORT WORTH DALLAS BALLET INTO MORE ADVENTUROUS
TERRITORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's been an intense summer for Benjamin
Houk. In June, he left a job as director of the Nashville Ballet to
take over as artistic director at the scandal-rocked Fort Worth
Dallas Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the worst summer in 18 years, he moved with his
wife, Lauri Michelle, and their two preschool-age children to
Rockwall, where they stayed with his wife's parents for two months.
Last week, they bought a house in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an intense year for the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet, too.
</P>
<P>
   The low point of the company's 37-year history came in January,
when Paul Mejia resigned as artistic director under a cloud of
scandal involving allegations of sexual harassment. The high point
of the company's history came in May, with the long-awaited move to
Bass Performance Hall and the presentation of one of the monuments
of the repertoire in a final, glorious bow for Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   Houk, 36, and the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet are now embarked on a
new path with the first program of the Houk era.
</P>
<P>
   What audiences see this season will be substantially different
from what they've seen for the past 11 years. Most notably, Houk is
rechoreographing that traditional favorite, ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Mejia's leadership, the repertoire included only one work
not by legendary choreographer George Balanchine or Mejia. Houk
will expand the company in three directions:
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine will still be on several programs, but so will such
mid-20th-century contemporaries as Agnes de Mille and Antony Tudor,
whom Mejia avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Works by contemporary choreographers will add a range of
expressions and styles.
</P>
<P>
   And the company will restage 19th-century ballets, including
portions of ``Swan Lake'' and ``Paquita,'' presenting a view of
dance before Balanchine _ the ballet of princes and tutus and fairy
tales, in which refined movement was more important than the
constant emotional energy of the Balanchine style.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's wife, ballerina Maria Terezia-Balogh, dominated
principal female roles for the past 11 years. She remains
associated with the company as a coach but will not dance this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a different mood at the company.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mejia era, you had to catch the artistic director
before class or between class and rehearsal. He was always there;
if the dancers were working, so was he.
</P>
<P>
   Houk, a former principal dancer with the Pacific Northwest
Ballet, works with the dancers, but not every minute. He is as
likely to be in his office, in a tie, juggling schedules and, in a
switch from the Mejia era, raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   A newly appointed dance mistress, Deborah Hadley, who became one
of the country's most admired ballerinas during her career at
Pacific Northwest Ballet, does much of the rehearsing and teaching.
Hadley, Balogh and Houk rotate teaching the morning class.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Patchell, now in her fourth year with the ballet,
describes the mood around the company as happier. ``I'm receiving
much more encouragement,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Langenstein, beginning her sixth season with the
company, appreciates the variety of approaches in class. ``Ben and
Debbie are from the same company, and are on the same wavelength,''
she says. ``Maria gives class similar to what we're used to, and
it's nice to have that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Houk find when he arrived in Fort Worth?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good-looking company,'' he says. ``They're all
great instruments for dancing. It was like walking into a music
store and finding a bunch of Strads.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably relaxed compared with Mejia's intensity, Houk has
made it clear that he is broadening the focus away from Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's performances will include one Balanchine work,
``Tarantella.'' Lila York, a contemporary choreographer who is
decidedly post-Balanchine, will be represented by her ``Rapture,''
which Houk describes as ``unusual, violent at times, also lyrical
at times.'' The grand Russian classical tradition will be
represented by an excerpt from ``Swan Lake.'' And Houk will present
himself as choreographer in ``Rite of Swing,'' based on the revival
of swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most visible and highly attended event _ ``The
Nutcracker'' _ will take on Houk's stamp immediately. Moving to
Bass Performance Hall required that the company replace its
13-year-old sets, which in turn required new choreography. After
some discussion, Houk decided to do the new version himself. The
new ``Nutcracker'' will premiere in November in San Antonio and
arrive in early December in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Houk isn't offering any clues as to who will be the
stars of the company. In the Mejia regime, leading female roles
were dominated by Balogh and Maria Thomas, with Todd Edson as their
male counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to spread the top out,'' Houk says. ``I'm not sure
who the next budding soloists will be. It's not going to be just
one or two people anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The company includes 31 dancers and presents seasons in Fort
Worth and Dallas on a budget of $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Houk wants what any young director in a market that is far below
its potential would want: ``A bigger season. A bigger audience.
More performances.''

BOOK NOTES: A BAD BOY'S GOOD AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sometimes nasty, sometimes raunchy man whose lamentation on
radio Wednesday was that ``I'm not having any fun calling Jews on
Yom Kippur'' is about to become the progenitor of the richest
literary prizes in the United States. The very prodigiousness of
that, however embarrassing for book people, should and will bring
howls of joy from writers. Wrap your mind around the Imus American
Book Awards. That's Don Imus, and that's four awards annually.
Three are for $50,000 a pop and one for $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the prestigious but at times unfathomable National
Book Award carries a $10,000 prize, and a Pulitzer Prize is $5,000.
It was his anger at last year's National Book Award that got Imus,
somewhat accidentally, into awarding prizes. He was incensed that
``the elitists,'' as he called awards committees, bypassed Sam
Tanenhaus' biography, ``Whittaker Chambers'' (Random House), which
Imus promoted with gusto on his radio show, for yet another
biography of Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send me all the books that are nominated,'' he said, and
it's stuff ``that nobody reads. So I complained on my hideous radio
program. I was just kidding about Imus American Book Awards.
Kidding about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for publishers also to grumble about the
obscurity of some award nominees, and because awards are
subjective, the controversies surrounding them are not surprising.
But out of this Imus rage grew the apotheosis of his literary
awards, which will be presented in December.
</P>
<P>
   Imus luxuriates in everyone's fury, and so it is said that a few
publishers didn't even submit nominations for the Imus Awards,
which, if true, will be an unhappy surprise for their authors. What
is clear is that not only has Imus learned the craft of reading
but, unlike some of his competitors, he apparently actually
practices it as well. His show, between its provocative
vulgarities, is a berth for writers, often with several authors a
week as guests.
</P>
<P>
   The talker wants to be a power in book selling, similar to Oprah
Winfrey (who is considered the best book saleswoman in the
country). Not likely. But is his wish only hubris and largess,
arrogance and ego? No. His show is heard on more than 90 radio
stations and is televised on MSNBC, and his promotion people claim
he has 10 million listeners nationwide. While he's not exactly the
Chips of communications, his listeners attend to him and have a
surprisingly high income and education level for such a wild
program. All of which led one publishing executive to predict that
``Imus can become a huge catalyst for book sales, and suggestions
to his listeners can have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Imus could not make a best seller out of ``Whittaker Chambers,''
hard as he tried, but he drove up its sales. He did make a best
seller out of Jane Mendelsohn's ``I Was Amelia Earhart'' (Alfred A.
Knopf), a novel bought to his attention by his wife, Deirdre
Coleman-Imus, also an avid reader. When it was published in April
1996, the first printing was 30,000 copies. By August his on-air
``insistence'' _ as the publisher called it _ landed the book on
the New York Times' best-seller list and 200,000 copies were in
print.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the prizes will come from Barnes &AMP; Noble, the
booksellers, and A&AMP;E, the cable television entertainment channel,
through the simple method of buying advertising on the Imus show.
Imus will also do name-dropping for the two companies on his show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Barnes &AMP; Noble will prominently display books
selected by Imus as must-reads on a special shelf in each of its
500 stores, at the rate of two picks a week, sort of an Imus book
club. After all, Oprah has a book club. The selections will also
get special mention on the bookstore chain's online sales
operation. Ben Boyd, director of communications for Barnes &AMP; Noble,
said, ``Down the road, we're thinking of having him do children's
books selections too.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mohamad, marketing vice president for A&AMP;E, said: ``We
are helping him have fun doing serious things. These aren't
irrelevant books he'll be choosing, and along the way he'll be
mentioning our biography programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners will be chosen by Imus and by book buyers, who can vote
in Barnes &AMP; Noble stores from selections made by Imus and an
anonymous panel of five book editors who were chosen by Imus'
literary agent, Esther Newberg. The panel will nominate three
nonfiction books and three fiction books from works submitted by
publishers. Imus will nominate another three from each category,
producing a dozen finalists.
</P>
<P>
   From those the Barnes &AMP; Noble customers will vote on one fiction
and one nonfiction winner, and Imus will pick one of each. Three of
the four winners will receive $50,000 each. Imus will choose one
for the $100,000 prize just because he wants too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people will be surprised who we choose,'' Imus said.
``I'd like the winners to be writers who haven't a lot of money,
haven't yet got big advances or haven't written big sellers.'' He
indicated he was pretty sure that would mostly happen.
</P>
<P>
   There are some problems. For instance, Imus' show is really like
a boy's club. Some women feel they get short shrift, seldom getting
to say anything even when they are guests. One woman who is a
book-publishing executive wondered Wednesday if female writers
would get their share of the loot. On the other hand, it was Mrs.
Coleman-Imus who got her husband rolling on the Earhart book.
</P>
<P>
   And wow, $250,000 for prizes for writers. It's a good thing that
the sometimes viciously sophomoric radio host has concluded that
award juries are about as useful and annoying as the people who put
stickers on fruit. Certainly no literary person thought up this
blockbuster for writers and is making it happen. Anyhow, as Shaw
said in ``Major Barbara,'' you take money from the munition makers
to give to the Salvation Army.

`TOUCHING EVIL': THE CRIMINAL MIND AS A MYSTERY'S GOAL

<P>
   Can you justify doing evil to destroy evil? That is one of the
dark questions that slowly emerge from the absorbing, unsettling
five-part series that begins this season of ``Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Touching Evil'' has a dashing detective hero, Dave Creegan.
But this is no frothy cat-and-mouse game; it is a collection of
twisted contemporary tales in which Creegan, part of a team of
high-powered London detectives, comes face to face with unspeakable
killers.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to guess that ``Touching Evil'' was created and
largely written by Paul Abbott, who invented the great, personally
flawed, crime-solving psychologist of ``Cracker.'' In the mold of
the most intriguing modern crime-solvers, Creegan has psychological
turmoil of his own, and his cases have more to do with confronting
a criminal mind than with hunting down evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Robson Green, who plays Creegan, has piercing blue eyes,
slightly thinning hair and a taciturn quality that causes his
partner, Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker), to ask if he has spent a lot
of time alone lately. He has; he is recently divorced, the father
of two small daughters, and quietly torn apart over it. He also has
a conspicuous scar on his temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touching Evil'' unfolds with such deliberation (too much in
the slow-going early stages) that it takes a while to learn that
the scar is the result of a bullet to his head, taken during a not
so distant investigation. Creegan may be brave and smart, but he's
not infallible (the better to worry when he seems in danger).
</P>
<P>
   The series follows three separate cases (the first complete in
the two-hour opening, with two more stories covered in four
hourlong installments). In the first episode Creegan joins the
fictional OSC, the Organized and Serial Crime Unit, and tackles the
most disturbing case of all.
</P>
<P>
   Three small boys have been kidnapped. The clues _ a buried
sneaker and a plastic daffodil left at the scene _ lead to a cool,
professorial geneticist named Hinks (Ian McDiarmid), who they
suspect has kidnapped and murdered children before. If his pattern
holds, the detectives have six days to find the boys before they
are killed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the renegade hero, Creegan is willing to break the
rules to save the children. But it is the unfolding of his
character that becomes most fascinating to watch as Green smoothly
allows us to see the tension between Creegan's normal life as a
father and professional, and the flashes of dark intuition that
help him track the killers. (In a more outgoing mood, Green played
the young doctor obsessively in love with the middle-aged Francesca
Annis in the quirky ``Masterpiece Theater'' romance ``Reckless,''
also written by Abbott.)
</P>
<P>
   If Creegan never takes on the complexity of Robbie Coltrane's
Fitz in ``Cracker,'' he has an enigmatic allure that grows through
the series.
</P>
<P>
   The next stories feature similarly monstrous crimes. In the
second, several patients are drugged and killed in a hospital in
what appears to be unsolicited euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   The third has the least interesting crime, involving the
Internet, college students and mutilated corpses. But it offers the
most satisfying glimpses into the lives of the detectives.
</P>
<P>
   All are played with a crispness that suits the series,
especially Ms. Walker. With her cropped hair and brisk manner, she
brings an echo of Jane Tennison from ``Prime Suspect'' to the role
of Creegan's no-nonsense partner. This precision exists in a world
often filmed to look ominously claustrophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Though each case is self-contained, there are threads that go
through subsequent episodes, and the question left dangling in the
first episode leads to the startling conclusion of the final
installment. Another murder is solved but that solution only raises
more questions of ethics and morality.
</P>
<P>
   This psychologically chilling series takes on the big issues
beneath all detective stories: life and death, good and bad, the
extremes to which humans can go. Among its other qualities,
``Touching Evil'' is perfectly named.

CHOICE OF PITCHING NOW PROBLEMATICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There was a feeling of inevitability about the
series when all hell broke loose in the top of the first inning. On
the heels of their 11-3 win in the opener, the Red Sox had a 2-0
lead in Game 2 of their best-of-five American League Division
Series and the Indians were unraveling in front of Baseball
America. Boston was flexing its muscle, and you couldn't find
anyone in Cleveland who believed in the hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe looked like the Red Sox, circa 1990, when Roger
Clemens thought he was a Ninja Turtle and got tossed from a playoff
game in the second inning. This time we had Cleveland manager Mike
Hargrove and starter Dwight Gooden getting the heave from
rabbit-eared/arrogant/gutless plate umpire Joe Brinkman before the
game was two outs old.
</P>
<P>
   The Jake looked like the Paradise Club on Everclear Night, and
for sure, the Red Sox were going to embarrass Cleveland in three
tidy games en route to a date of destiny with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But then it all went the other way. The veteran Tribe awoke and
served Tim Wakefield and Red Sox Nation a 9-5 knuckle sandwich. So
now the series is tied, 1-1, and the Sox face the possibility that
their season could end with Pete Schourek on the mound at Fenway
Park Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen will start for the Red Sox Friday, and he
certainly deserves the nod. Saberhagen won the most important game
for the Red Sox this season when he stopped the bleeding in New
York in May. He is a big-game pitcher and this season wrote one of
the great comeback stories of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Sox have trouble hitting Charles Nagy? What if
Boston loses Game 3? The Sox don't want to talk about the
distasteful possibility, and it makes sense to keep quiet until
they have to make a decision. Bu if things go wrong Friday, Boston
has to pitch Pedro Martinez Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation calls for Saberhagen Friday, lefthander Schourek
Saturday, and ace Martinez in Game 5, if necessary. If Boston wins
Friday, it makes sense to stay in turn. That would set up Pedro for
either Game 5 Sunday (with his regular four days of rest) or Game 1
of the AL Championship Series Tuesday with six days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Sox lose Friday? Can they take a chance on
losing this series in four games with Pedro pitching only once?
</P>
<P>
   No way. The team has committed $75 million to Martinez, and he
showed Tuesday that he has great command over the Indians. Game 1
was over by 4 p.m., which means Pedro actually would be working
with 3 1/2 days of rest if he pitched Saturday night. The Sox would
have to come back with the ace, then empty the gun Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any decision,'' manager Jimy Williams
said when asked about changing the rotation if the Sox go down,
2-1. ``I don't think now is the right time to do anything like
that. I think we are going to stay with our rotation as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan scoffed at any suggestion of
changing the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going on what is planned out,'' said Kerrigan.
``It's what we've planned all year and for the last six weeks. We
don't deal with hypotheticals. We can bring Wakefield back in the
bullpen. Right now we're just thinking about Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that (changing the rotation) is for people who
panic, who don't have a program, who don't have a plan. We can't be
shifting people around when they are used to pitching every fifth
day. It doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield is the X factor. Game 2 was his shortest outing of the
year. He threw only 42 pitches and is capable of pitching every
other day under almost any conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pitch out of the bullpen, I can start Friday, I can
start (Friday) if they want me to,'' he said. ``I let my team down
today. I feel like I didn't even pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pedro starts and wins Game 4, Wakefield probably would get
the nod in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical plan would be to bring Wakefield back Friday,
pitch Saberhagen with an extra day of rest in Game 4, and have
Pedro ready for Game 5. That would give Boston its top three
starters in the final three games. But it would not be fair to
Saberhagen, who is programmed to pitch Friday. Saberhagen wouldn't
entertain any goofy theories about changing the rotation, and who
can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox win Game 3, none of the above matters. But if the
Sox lose Friday, they can't start Schourek (1-3, 4.30) in what
would be the biggest game of the year Saturday. It would have to be
Pedro.

SCHROEDER REASSURES FRENCH OF GERMAN COMMITMENT TO ALLIANCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ He will not become chancellor until after the new German
parliament is sworn in and he can form a coalition government,
maybe at the end of October, Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday, but
that did not stop the French from hanging on his every word for
signs that he might love them less than he loves the British.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first foray abroad since Sunday's election, Schroeder
reassured President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and French journalists Wednesday that he wanted to strengthen
Germany's relations with France every bit as much as those with
Britain, for the greater good of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And he made music to Chirac's ears by agreeing with him on the
need for better regulation of global capital flows to head off
world recession. That is a demand France will press at the coming
meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and
finance ministers of the leading industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Though that and a whole lot else Schroeder said Wednesday does
not yet amount to official policy, as French officials said they
realized, they were happy with what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   Standing side by side with Chirac in the courtyard of Elysee
Palace, where heads of state and government are received, though he
is not yet either, Schroeder said, ``The president and I are of one
opinion on the necessity of regulating capital flows and financial
markets better than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the German Embassy later, he added, ``We
need more coordination in international economic policy, especially
for uncontrolled capital flows that can bring whole economies under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said Chirac had raised the urgent issue of the
need for a coordinated position of the NATO alliance on how to stop
Yugoslav Army attacks on civilians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain sponsored a resolution on Kosovo that the
United Nations Security Council adopted last week, warning
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to stop the attacks, and
French officials said their view now was that this resolution
provided sufficient authority for the alliance to decide to carry
out bombing threats against Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said his party's position was also that a Security
Council resolution was needed before NATO could act.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, had lunch at the German Embassy
with the conservative Chirac and then spent the afternoon with the
Jospin, the Socialist prime minister, and key ministers of the
French government.
</P>
<P>
   After the official meetings, French officials said their leaders
had agreed with the chancellor-elect that jobs and the social
consequences of economic policy ought to rank high among European
priorities after years of reducing deficits, at German insistence,
to get the Continent ready for a common currency that will be
introduced in 11 countries in January.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder agreed with Chirac to set up joint working groups to
figure out ways of invigorating French-German relations and of
working out a common position on how to modify the cumbersome
institutions of the 15-nation European Union before it takes in
formerly Communist countries in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly reassured after finishing off his lunch with Schroeder
with Cuban cigars, Chirac told him he should feel at home at Elysee
Palace. Schroeder replied, ``I don't think I'll be moving in.'' The
two could converse directly only in English, since neither speaks
the other's language. Both said they believed that strengthening
relations with Britain was no threat to any third country.

BENEATH AM-FM, SOUNDS OF SILENCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before you or your grandparents were alive, before the days of
Thomas Edison or Jesus Christ, even before the first human beings
were around to hear it, there was radio.
</P>
<P>
   And it was beautiful. Sweet descending tones, wispy wavering
pitches and choruses of percussive pops and hisses filled the
airwaves. Only there were no radio receivers in existence to
capture them.
</P>
<P>
   These were the sounds of Mother Nature's own radio station,
produced by electromagnetic energy generated by lightning strokes,
the earth's magnetic field and related phenomena like the northern
and southern lights. But the world is such an electromagnetically
loud place these days _ full of power lines, electric lights,
automobiles and computers, not to mention radio stations programmed
by humans _ that nature's radio has been practically drowned out.
</P>
<P>
   To hear it, one must travel to an area free of electronic
interference (the desert, the jungle, Siberia, Central Park) with a
specially made very-low-frequency radio receiver tuned below the AM
and FM bands.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what a growing number of hobbyists have been doing
over the last few years, attracted not just by the sweet sounds and
the possibility of making discoveries in this bizarre branch of
plasma physics but also by the notion that to hear nature you must
immerse yourself in nature.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, you become attuned to the earth in the same way
that a surfer looking for the perfect wave gets to know the ocean.
Sunspot activity is projected to be at a peak over the next few
years, signaling an increase in magnetic storms and a prime time
for radio explorers in search of sferics, whistlers, tweeks and
chorus, as these sounds have been classified.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most active whistler hunters has been Stephen
McGreevy. He has traveled everywhere from the Nevada desert to the
Arctic Circle, bravely (or stupidly) sticking a metal radio antenna
into the air during lightning storms to hear the ensuing rush of
radio sounds. He recently released the first widely available
compact disk of what is known as natural radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electric Enigma'' (Irdial Discs,
irdial(AT)irdialsys.win-uk.net) is one strange radio show. There
are sections that sound like heavy laser fire or relentless
air-bomb attacks. These are whistler storms, caused by radio energy
from lightning strokes traveling and spreading out across thousands
of miles of the earth's magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are recordings that sound like a nest full of birds'
eggs hatching, the babies very hungry and very vocal. These sounds
are dawn chorus, sudden ascending pitches caused when the sun pelts
the earth's magnetic sphere with energy emissions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making these sounds available on CD, McGreevy has
also made natural radio easy to listen to for anyone who is not on
a first-name basis with his or her local Radio Shack clerk by
selling a hand-held very-low-frequency receiver
(vlfradio(AT)triax.com).
</P>
<P>
   McGreevy's work may be just the beginning of documenting the
radio sounds of the universe. In 1978, two scientists won the Nobel
Prize for discovering radio waves produced by the creation of the
universe. Couldn't those sounds be amplified into audibility?
</P>
<P>
   If I can't see photographs of the big bang, I'd at least like to
hear it. And then there are broadcasts from other planets:
whistlers picked up in radiation belts around Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune. What do those sound like? How about the
ultra-low-frequency signals that some believe are generated before
earthquakes?
</P>
<P>
   If there is a natural radio, then there must be a natural
television too. This may sound ridiculous, but in a much more
recent area of research, scientists and hobbyists are trying to
pinpoint the forces behind nature's own television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Its programs are known as red sprites, blue jets and short-lived
elves _ colorful light flashes, disks and effects that take place
during thunderstorms high above the storm clouds. Like whistlers,
they are a side effect of lightning.

   In most cases they are only visible through a television monitor
hooked up to a low-light video camera. But they're cheaper than
pay-per-view.

LIVING IN A DISNEY TOWN, WITH BIG BROTHER AT BAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)  (af) 
 Douglas Frantz, a Times national correspondent, is writing a book
about Celebration, with Catherine Collins, for Henry Holt and Co.  
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CELEBRATION, Fla. _ One hot afternoon last month, my wife,
Catherine Collins, was riding her bicycle home from the post office
here when a blue car with Pennsylvania license plates pulled
alongside her. One of the children in the car leaned out the window
and asked, ``Can you tell me where Truman lives?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me?'' Catherine replied, suspecting some kind of
tourist joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truman,'' the child's mother said emphatically. ``Didn't you
see the movie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that Truman,'' said Catherine, who had in fact seen ``The
Truman Story,'' the media satire starring Jim Carrey. ``He was just
a character. It was all make-believe. And anyway, it wasn't filmed
here. It was filmed over in Seaside, on the Panhandle.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time we had run into the misconception that
the movie had been filmed in Celebration _ or that the new town
where we live is some sort of unticketed gate for Disney World,
which is about eight miles away.
</P>
<P>
   There are similarities between the fictional movie town and this
post-neotraditional town built by those masters of make-believe,
Walt Disney Co. Both are pretty and orderly, populated by smiling,
waving residents and blessed by sunny skies and warm temperatures.
And like the movie town, Celebration has its own unique rules and
designs for social engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But, after living here for 15 months, we can testify that
Celebration is a real place, with its own attributes and its own
problems. Indeed, the town represents an ambitious, real-life
attempt by Disney to employ architecture and urban design to revive
the sense of community and place that Americans tell pollsters are
missing in traditional suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   As journalists, we have lived all over the country, mostly in or
on the edges of major cities. We have been pleasantly surprised to
find a degree of community spirit and neighborliness in Celebration
that we haven't encountered elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   We know everyone on our street, except for one family that never
seems to be at home, and block parties and town-wide festivities
are frequent and popular.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this community camaraderie is the sense
that we are all pioneers in this new town. But some of it is
attributable to the careful planning that went into Celebration's
design.
</P>
<P>
   The first residents moved in during the summer of 1996, and
today the town has about 2,000 people out of a projected population
of 20,000. The 5,000-acre tract on which the town is being built is
part of the 30,000 acres Walt Disney accumulated in the early 1960s
for his second theme park.
</P>
<P>
   When company planners determined that this swath of swamp and
cow pasture would not be needed for the future expansion of Disney
World, Michael Eisner, the company's chairman and chief executive,
gave a green light to developing the town, though it had nothing to
do with the company's core business of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The architect Robert A.M. Stern, a Disney board member and one
of the designers of Celebration's master plan, described Eisner's
motives in grandiose terms. ``Michael's feeling was that, if the
company were going to do this, it was going to be something that
would set an example,'' he said. ``It would demonstrate that this
was a great company with a great sense of public obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, in a telephone interview from his corporate jet a few
days ago, was more pragmatic. ``The motivation was to do something
with the property,'' he said. ``Once you decide to do something,
you want to do it in an excellent way.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eisner professed surprise at all the attention
Celebration has received in the press. ``I just thought we were
doing something small and unique,'' he said, though in the past he
has said he hoped the town would be a model for development in the
next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But no one involved in the project ever thought small. Along
with Stern, the roster of architects for Celebration's public
buildings included many of the profession's biggest names.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Graves designed the post office, Robert Venturi and
Denise Scott Brown designed the bank and Cesar Pelli designed the
1930s-era movie house. Philip Johnson created Town Hall, and the
real estate sales center was the last building designed by Charles
W. Moore, who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and his collaborator, Jacquelin Robertson, another New
York architect, paid close attention to the details of the master
plan for the town.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the streets are straight and narrow to slow traffic and
empower pedestrians and bicyclists. But there are also sweeping
arterial streets that carry the tourist and business traffic to the
town center.
</P>
<P>
   The houses are close together, most with front porches to
promote neighborhood interaction. Garages are tucked away at the
rear and entered from alleys. Most houses are within a five-minute
walk of downtown, though that will change as sections farther from
the town center are developed.
</P>
<P>
   Lots are small, with as little as 10 feet separating houses in
many instances, but the tradeoff is plentiful parks and other
public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   House prices range from about $175,000 to $1 million or more,
but even the mansions must conform to a strict design code that
reflects a Southeastern vernacular architecture from the pre-1940s.
There are deep porches, gables, dormers, loggia and large-columned
porticoes.
</P>
<P>
   To promote consistency and cohesiveness, the exterior color
palette is limited to white and pale shades of beige, blue, yellow,
green and pink.
</P>
<P>
   On the telephone the other day, Eisner asked if the people who
live in Celebration appreciate the architecture. The answer is that
while the architecture contributes to a feeling of genuine quality
to the town center, particularly the Graves post office and Pelli
movie house, the residential side is less satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, I found the six basic designs to be
repetitious and the pastel houses to be monotonous. There also is
an ersatz air to the place when you know that most dormers are
fake, with black paint on the windows, and the columns are plastic,
albeit to protect against termites and rot.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's disclaimer about doing something small aside,
Celebration has been a magnet for attention from the start. Demand
was so high that the first 350 houses and 120 apartments were sold
through a lottery in November 1995. Each month since, 15,000 people
have visited the preview center, and Celebration has remained the
hottest-selling residential development in the Orlando area,
despite prices that are 25 percent or more above the market.
</P>
<P>
   Why the popularity? Part of it is the simple association with
the Disney name. Many of the first wave of residents were drawn
because they believed Disney would build a top-quality town, just
the way it provided top-quality vacations year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Disney freak,'' said Dan Rudgers, a
retired high school music teacher from Long Island, who visited
Disney World an average of three times a year for 20 years before
he bought a town house in Celebration. ``I had faith in the company
to build the best place.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as control is a hallmark of Disney World, it also is a
central theme of Celebration, where the regulations extend beyond
the shade of pastel on the houses to govern anything visible from
the street, from the varieties of shrubs in the yard to the color
of window curtains _ white and off-white only, please.
</P>
<P>
   Political signs are also restricted, in terms of size, number
and when they can be posted _ only 45 days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the controls are similar to those found in planned
communities in Florida and elsewhere. Some even echo the restraints
imposed by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1868 when he designed
Riverside, Ill., widely regarded as the first modern planned town
and one of the models for Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I point to Olmsted in saying that in a freewheeling society,
some interventions have to be made to control the public realm,''
said Stern, the architect. ``There were no bed checks by the owners
in Riverside, and there are none in Celebration. You are alone in
your living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a fine line between harmony and conformity, and
at times the controls seem excessive and even silly. One of our
neighbors got a stern letter from the town manager when it was
discovered that her window curtains were red. She relented and the
curtains came down.
</P>
<P>
   Another couple fought town hall, which is really Disney since
there is no local government, over a demand that they remove two
etched-glass front doors. They refused, and the doors are still
there, an indication that there is flexibility even in this
controlled situation.
</P>
<P>
   We have learned to live with the restrictions, which are not
particularly onerous. What does remain a deeper irritation,
however, is the idea that a corporation exerts so much control over
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   The faith in Disney can be troubling. In the early days, many
residents seemed to expect the company to fix anything that went
wrong. Trouble with the construction of your house? Call Disney,
though the company isn't building the houses. Difficulties with the
progressive public school built here? Call Disney, though the
school is run by the county school district.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few months, those attitudes seemed to have
undergone a transformation, for the better from our perspective.
The clearest example came last summer, when a large contingent of
parents staged a rebellion against some of the policies at
Celebration School, the K-12 facility that serves the town.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were concerned about the absence of a written
curriculum, textbooks and a clear assessment of students'
performance in the form of grades. In response, grades were
instituted for the upper classes and other changes were made to
restrain what many people regarded as a runaway experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Barnes, a young architect who has been involved with
Celebration almost from the start, said the intention was not to
create a perfect place, but to build a good place for people to
live by providing architecture and planning that promote social
interaction and a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more residents take over, making it their town, the
better,'' he said. ``The more it becomes Celebration, rather than
Disney's Celebration, the better it gets.''

<P>
   Depressed that there's no more ``Seinfeld?'' Don't fret: An
herbal medicine man is offering free Saint Johnswort to help
addicts through the depression he expects to come with
Seinfeld-less Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kits'' include a month's supply of Saint
Johnswort and a list of 25 names that rhyme with female body parts.
The kits have been created as ``a contribution to the improvement
of society as a whole,'' says Ken Hakuta, creator and CEO of
AllHerb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``the show about nothing'' can feel as good as they did
when Seinfeld was on the air, and it's all free, Hakuta says.
</P>
<P>
   His new Web site, AllHerb.com, is being launched to offer
consumers a comprehensive herbal education, he says. Industry
experts will offer health tips, news and feature articles, as well
as a mail-order supply of many herbal products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fun way to show the application of natural herbal
supplements,'' Hakuta says of the Seinfeld kits. ``What we are
demonstrating here is that natural products can have very positive
influence on our moods and our health. Herbs help us feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can leave an e-mail message saying absolutely nothing on
AllHerb.com's Seinfeld message board; they can also send absolutely
nothing (except a clear return address) via regular mail to
``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kit,'' Jericho Communications, 304 Hudson
St., Suite 700, New York, NY 10013. Delivery will take a couple of
weeks, a company spokeswoman says.
</P>
<P>
   The kit, when taken in combination with any of the non-Seinfeld
situation comedies in the new fall lineup, is intended to induce
about the same level of enjoyment and happiness that we all
received from Jerry and friends for the past decade, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: The kit should not be taken with an empty remote
control ... or without the consent of your doctor.

IRAN HIDES WORLD-CLASS ART, DEEMING IT IMMORAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Propaganda placards around Tehran proclaim that a
woman hidden by Islamic dress codes is like ``a pearl in a shell.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, many pearls lie hidden by Iran's restrictive
culture, such as a government-owned art collection shut away since
the Islamic revolution of 1979 in a climate-controlled vault deep
in the bowels of the Museum of Contemporary Art here.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 important paintings by Renoir, Monet, Pissarro and
others are stored in that basement, and though some have been taken
upstairs for brief public viewings, for nearly 20 years others have
been deemed too provocative to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   To reflect President Mohammad Khatami's call for greater
cultural openness, a new director has won permission from the
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance for a plan to put much
more of the Western collection on regular display.
</P>
<P>
   But, he acknowledged in an interview here, some of the treasures
that were amassed in the waning days of Shah Mohammed Riza
Pahlevi's rule will have to remain locked behind a double set of
thick steel doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to morality,'' said the director, Ali Reza
Semiazar, bound by a principle that public art in Iran should
imitate public life.
</P>
<P>
   A good number of restrictions imposed on Iran after it was
transformed into an Islamic state have gradually been eased. Some
women now allow a good bit of hair to show from beneath their head
scarves, something that not long ago would have risked a public
berating or worse. A few even dare display painted toenails. Still,
no woman yet dares to appear in public in Iran unless she is
covered from head to foot.
</P>
<P>
   The same restriction applies to women portrayed on television,
in newspapers and magazines. And the trouble facing Semiazar is
that the museum's collection includes no small number of nudes.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in 1978, the museum has served as a kind of
mirror of change in Iran. Built on a design that emulates the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, it was part of the shah's
effort to establish Tehran as a cultural center, and was filled
with works acquired by curators in a worldwide buying spree. In the
year before the old government fell, it proudly displayed works _
clothed and unclothed _ by modern masters from Picasso to Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Islamic revolution made Western culture synonymous
with a cultural invasion, most of the Western works were locked
away in the vault, where the first image that greets a visitor is a
portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian religious
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's many galleries, the works were replaced by
kitsch revolutionary art, sober Islamic calligraphy and revolving
exhibitions, like a collection of photography from around the world
that is now on display.
</P>
<P>
   True, an Alexander Calder mobile does hang in the alcove, and a
sculpture garden includes works by Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti
and Rene Magritte. But only one small room in the museum is set
aside for Western art, which can be displayed no more than a
handful at a time.
</P>
<P>
   That limited space has meant that many among the museum's finest
paintings, including one by Max Ernst and another by Jackson
Pollock, have not been put on public display in more than a decade.
And what Iranian art experts call the finest of all _ a softly
rendered Renoir portrait of a half-clothed young girl _is among
those that have never appeared, and, by all accounts, is not likely
to emerge any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brilliant painting; it's wonderful; it's a
masterpiece,'' Semiazar, the museum director, said before escorting
a visitor into the vault to see the work, still in its heavy gilt
frame but hung on a sliding metal rack. ``It's just an innocent
young girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said with evident regret, the standards he was obliged
to enforce by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance meant
that ``it shouldn't be shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring another revolution, at least a dozen others among the
works that the museum acquired in its pre-opening buying spree
would seem to have even less of a chance of seeing the light of
day. Two are nudes in Francis Bacon's grotesque style; another,
``Intersection No. 3,'' by the painter John Kacere, is a Photo
Realistic depiction of the joining of a young girl's thighs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades only one among what Iranians see as the
controversial works has emerged into the international art market.
The painting, a 1952 nude by Willem de Kooning titled ``Woman
III,'' was quietly exchanged on the tarmac of the Vienna airport
four years ago for the remnants of a 16th-century book containing
miniature paintings detailing the ascension to the throne of Shah
Tahmasp of Persia. Both works had been valued at $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only with special permission have the Iranian authorities
allowed foreign experts and students to view the otherwise
off-limits prohibited works. That has long been a source of
frustration to Iranian art lovers; Mohammed Sohofi, whom the new
government replaced as museum director this year, said that during
a seven-year tenure he was variously pilloried among Iran's
intellectuals as being either a jailer or ``a person out of the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Iranian conservatives remain deeply suspicious both
of Khatami's government and its quest for cultural openness, some
people in Iran say they doubt that the museum will really carry out
its plan to be a little bit more bold.
</P>
<P>
   But Semiazar said that his superiors are fully behind that plan,
and that dozens of Western works will be on display by early next
year, including a landscape by Monet, a still life by Gauguin and a
portrait by Toulouse-Lautrec.
</P>
<P>
   He has also promised soon to post on the Internet images of the
entire collection _ even those deemed unsuitable here. That way, he
said, ``people in Paris can visit our Museum of Contemporary Art in
the same way that I can visit the Louvre.''

NEW BORDER CONTROLS TAKE EFFECT BUT LITTLE EXPECTED TO CHANGE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A law that tightens America's borders by tracking the
millions of foreigners who enter each year takes effect on
Thursday. But border operations are apparently unlikely to change,
because U.S. immigration officials say they are not ready to handle
the job and Congress is not sure that it really wants the system
enforced, at least not now.
</P>
<P>
   Border states and the governments of Canada and Mexico strongly
opposed the measure after experts had warned that requiring even
simple checks could cause huge lineups at the borders and 17-hour
delays that would hurt businesses and cost millions of dollars in
delayed or lost trade.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and Canadian officials had expected Congress to keep the
law from being put into effect on Oct. 1. But a stalemate developed
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted in July to repeal the law, after the House had
voted to delay it one year. But the two bills could not be
reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   This week members of Congress considered several proposals, but
no quick compromise seemed in sight. Efforts will continue until
Congress breaks for the November elections. Legislators said the
law could be postponed even if it has already officially been put
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the law takes effect it cannot be enforced,
because the Immigration and Naturalization Service has made it
clear that it does not have the means to collect and process so
much information. At congressional hearings in July experts
estimated that in its first year a border documentation system
would generate as much information as the Library of Congress
holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Congress early on that the technology and system did
not exist and would not be in place by Oct. 1,'' a spokesman for
the INS, Russell A. Bergeron Jr., said. ``And it's impossible to
project when such a system would be in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian executives and Mexican officials are relieved, but
remain upset about how the law was enacted. They say uncertainty
about what will occur can cause hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make plans to build cars in Detroit based on parts
made in Canada that might be held up by 10 to 20 hours crossing the
border,'' said Peter Eide, head of labor law policy for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and chairman of Americans for Better Borders.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Borders group was started by people who are worried
about the effects of the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are planned months and years in advance,'' Eide
said. ``But you can't make plans based on something Congress may or
may not do.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister of governmental affairs at the Mexican embassy in
Washington, Gustavo Mohar, said Mexico wanted the measure repealed.
``Regardless of the technology available,'' Mohar said, ``it
doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dispute started with a measure buried in the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.
Section 110 of the law required the immigration service to develop
an automated system to track the arrivals and departures of all
noncitizens, providing a way to identify immigrants who overstay
their visas.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials told Congress that 40 percent of the
estimated five and a half million illegal immigrants in the United
States might be overstaying their visas, but that pursuing them is
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The new law affects the Canadian and Mexican borders. But
opposition has been strongest in the north, where millions of
Canadians are accustomed to crossing without being checked.
</P>
<P>
   At least some members of Congress who voted for the bill
apparently thought that it would not apply to Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview from Washington, Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, who is chairman of the immigration subcommittee of the
Judiciary Committee, said, ``As far as I'm concerned we in the
House always intended this to apply to all aliens' coming into the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   At a training center in Glynco, Ga., the immigration service is
studying tracking foreigners, including cards with electromagnetic
stripes and electronic tags like those that let cars pay tolls
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Smith questioned the INS' commitment to making the system work.
``This isn't the first time this administration has ignored or
dragged its feet on immigration law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that he was willing to consider a bill that would
delay the measure for more than a year, but that he opposed repeal
because he believed that a tracking system was necessary to hinder
drug dealers and terrorists who try to slip across the borders.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who called Section 110 a
``bad law,'' said most legislators knew little about because it had
been ``slipped in'' after the immigration bill had been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham sponsored the Senate bill to repeal the law at all
points of entry except airports. He said he would not support any
compromise that merely delayed observance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all we do is delay it two years,'' Abraham said, ``we're
going to be stuck with a system that causes massive problems or
we'll incur a lot of expenses developing a system that will be
abandoned after the first day it is implemented.''

MORE MONEY WITHDRAWN LAST MONTH FROM STOCK FUNDS THAN WENT IN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors made net withdrawals of $11.2 billion from
equity mutual funds in August, the biggest outflow on record and
the first month in eight years that more money flowed out of stock
funds than went in, according to industry statistics released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, confirmed
Wednesday what many fund companies had reported anecdotally since
the tumultuous final days of August, when the stock market fell 19
percent below its July peak. Two independent trackers of mutual
fund flows, AMG Data Services and Trim Tabs Financial Services,
also reported earlier this month that stock funds experienced net
withdrawals in August.
</P>
<P>
   For the mutual fund industry, the withdrawals ended an extended
streak during which the fund industry had expanded enormously. In
September 1990, the last month when investors made net withdrawals
from stock funds, those funds had $227 billion in assets, well
below the $308 billion in bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, stock funds received as much in new investments
as they had total assets in 1990 _ $227 billion. And even with the
August withdrawals, assets of stock funds had grown to nearly $2.4
trillion, more than double the $1.1 trillion invested in bond and
hybrid funds. In the first seven months of this year, stock funds
took in, on average, $20 billion a month in new investments.
</P>
<P>
   In September, however, investors appeared to have returned to
their old ways. With the worst of the volatility of late August and
early September beginning to subside, mutual fund companies have
again begun to see money flowing in, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates
that in September, stock funds took in net new investments of $19.3
billion. AMG, based in Arcata, Calif., also reported that stock
funds had received positive cash flows last month, although the
amount is uncertain because a significant number of fund companies
report their cash flows to AMG once a month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some leading mutual fund companies, such as
Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Associates, said investors
put money in stock funds during September after redeeming money in
August.
</P>
<P>
   As investors fled from stock funds in August, they sought out
the relative safety of bond funds and other more conservative
investments. The trade group reported that fixed-income funds added
$5.82 billion in net new investments in August, compared with net
new investments of $6.84 billion in July. Hybrid funds, which
spread their assets among stocks, bonds and cash investments, had
an outflow of $887.5 million in August, after adding $1.07 billion
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Money market funds also proved a sought-after haven for
investors, according to the data released Wednesday. The institute
said that money market funds received a record $50.94 billion in
net new investments in August, compared with $24.93 billion in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Equity fund managers also raised the amount of cash on hand in
their portfolios in August, to 6 percent of assets, on average,
from 5.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   As the major stock market indexes headed lower in August, mutual
fund managers were said by traders at several large Wall Street
firms to be heavy sellers of stocks. That selling might have been
in anticipation of possible waves of redemptions from investors
alarmed by a rapidly declining stock market.
</P>
<P>
   One reason equity fund managers might have been forced to sell
was that they have been steadily slicing away at the amount of
spare cash in their portfolios over the last three years. The July
percentage of assets in cash was down from 7 percent two years ago
and nearly 13 percent in the fall of 1990, before stocks and stock
funds went on their eight-year tear.
</P>
<P>
   The recent streak is not the longest period of consecutive
months of positive cash flow ever recorded, however. For more than
15 years, from October 1954 through May 1970 _ a stretch that
coincided with a strong bull market in stocks _ investors similarly
made monthly deposits into equity mutual funds, according to the
Investment Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, that streak was even longer. Before October
1954, the Investment Company Institute tracked fund flows on a
quarterly basis, rather than monthly; stock funds recorded positive
quarterly net flows of cash dating back to the first quarter of
1944.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund shareholders have also gone through extended periods
of disillusionment with equity funds. In the eight years from
November 1971 through October 1979, which includes the bear market
of 1973-74, investors each month took more money out of stock funds
than they put in.
</P>
<P>
   The data for monthly fund flows reported by the Investment
Company Institute measure new sales of funds minus reinvested
dividends and withdrawals, or redemptions, plus the net amount of
money switched between stock funds and other types of mutual funds,
mainly those investing in bonds or money markets.

ABORTION, FAMILY PLANNING ISSUES BOG DOWN SPENDING BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The continuing controversy over abortion and family
planning threatens to stall four federal spending bills as the
government's new fiscal year begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say contentious measures related to abortion and
contraception are the latest shots in a fusillade by a Republican
majority intent on chipping away at the constitutional right to
choose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have come through the front door and the back door at
every opportunity to restrict or impede a woman's constitutional
right to choose as well as access to family planning and
reproductive health care,'' said Belle Taylor-McGhee, a spokeswoman
for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor-McGhee said Congress voted nearly 100 times on issues of
reproductive choice since the Republicans took control of both
houses of Congress in 1995. She said abortion-rights advocates lost
all but 14 votes.
</P>
<P>
   A major stumbling block in the spending bill for the Agriculture
Department is a provision that would ban the Food and Drug
Administration from testing or developing drugs that chemically
induce abortion, such as the French abortion drug RU-486, also
known as mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   A House version of the agriculture spending bill includes the
prohibition, while the Senate version does not. Clinton said he
would veto the bill if the ban is included.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury-postal spending bill is bogged down by the fiery
issue of whether federal employee health plans should be required
to pay for contraceptives if the plans cover other prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers have included provisions that would require
contraceptive coverage, although the House would give health care
providers the chance to opt out for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, supported by Sens. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine,
and Harry Reid, D-Nev., requires the health plans to cover oral
contraceptives, diaphragms, the long-term birth-control implant
Norplant, IUDs and depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats such as Reps. Nita M. Lowey of New York and Nancy L.
Johnson of Connecticut have led the charge for contraception
coverage, but they face strong opposition from Rep. Christopher H.
Smith, R-N.J., as well as Republican Sens. Don Nickles of Oklahoma,
Sam Brownback of Kansas and Dan Coats of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill for foreign operations is stalled in
House-Senate conference committee because of a perennial roadblock
over abortion. It is the fourth year in a row that disagreements
over abortion restrictions for international family-planning groups
have delayed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Congress has essentially killed such provisions in
the face of threatened vetoes from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would prohibit any international family-planning
organization from receiving federal funding if its employees lobby
or try to educate on the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversy arises in the House spending plan for the
departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.
That bill includes a provision by Rep. Ernest Istook Jr., R-Okla.,
that would require parents be notified five business days before
minors could receive contraceptives from federally funded
family-planning clinics.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, groups that favor family planning have
succeeded in removing the consent requirement, but this is the
first time the provision has been included.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress scheduled to leave town at the end of next week,
``it's really up to the Republican leadership'' to work out the
conflicts on abortion-related language, said Elizabeth Morra, the
House Appropriations Committee spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in approval of the spending bills are not likely to cause
government shutdowns because Congress two weeks ago passed an
interim budget _ known as a continuing resolution _ to keep the
federal government running.
</P>
<P>
   Until the differences between the House and Senate can be ironed
out, the bills cannot be sent to President Clinton for
consideration. The 1999 federal fiscal year began Thursday.

COMMENTARY: A STADIUM FOR EVERYONE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Borough president of the Bronx was up early on
Tuesday. A baseball season so sweet it seemed like a child's
fantasy was about to enter the crucial playoff stage. The Yankees,
the sweetest of teams in this sweetest of seasons, would take the
field Tuesday night against the Rangers of Texas. In Yankee
Stadium. In the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have drawn more fans to the stadium this year than
ever before. They won more games in the regular season than any
other team in American League history. They have created a new
generation of Yankee fanatics _ late-20th-century fans who cheer
the likes of Jeter and Williams and Wells and Martinez the way
old-timers once rooted for Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   The Borough president is Fernando Ferrer, and early Tuesday
morning, with the autumn air cool and hinting of many World Series
to come, he was outside the stadium showing reporters a plan that
he hopes will keep the principal owner of the Yankees from spoiling
this moment of glory in the city's cultural history by deciding
that his team should pack its gear and abandon the stadium and the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee Stadium is the most historic baseball venue in
America,'' said Ferrer. ``The Yankees belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no rancor in his tone, no hint of anger or
self-righteousness. But there was a clear sense of the devastation,
both physical and emotional, that would befall a large section of
the Bronx if the Yankees were to flee.
</P>
<P>
   So he's got this plan, which incorporates and refines a number
of prior proposals and adds some solid new ones. For starters,
there are plenty of goodies for the fans and the Yankees owner,
George Steinbrenner, who has complained loudly and frequently about
the lack of amenities at the aging stadium, the shortage of parking
facilities, the traffic jams before and after games and the
condition of nearby neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would completely modernize the stadium, turning it into
a more comfortable, more intimate 50,000-seat facility with 120 of
the phenomenally lucrative luxury boxes that Steinbrenner craves.
Parking would be available for more than 10,000 cars. Roads and
ramps leading to and from the stadium would be redesigned to ease
the flow of traffic. And a new Metro-North commuter rail station
would be built practically adjacent to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. One of the objections to sinking huge amounts of
public money into stadiums for team owners who are already very
wealthy is that there is little in the way of benefits that are
returned to the community. Under Ferrer's plan, real and
substantial improvements would be made to the area surrounding the
stadium, including a complete transformation of the Bronx Terminal
Market, a depressing 32-acre waterfront slum that is underused in
the daytime and becomes a playground for prostitutes, johns and
drug addicts at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said he would like to build upon the excitement and good
will generated by the Yankees and the rest of Major League Baseball
this year. A rebuilt Yankee Stadium as the sparkling hub of an area
with new retail outlets, themed restaurants, batting cages and
other sports-related facilities would, in his view, be a boon to
the team, the fans and the residents of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief visit to the Bronx Terminal Market, Ferrer said,
``You want Camden Yards?'' He was referring to the spectacular
success of the stadium complex built in Baltimore for the Orioles.
``Well, you've got it right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Ferrer's proposal, known as ``Yankee Village,'' ever see
the light of day? Could it actually happen? Well, parts of it sure
could. Hardly anyone other than Steinbrenner and his good friend
Rudolph Giuliani is in favor of relocating the Yankees into a
stadium that would cost more than $1 billion on the West Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And despite years of propaganda, there is still no evidence of a
serious plan to lure the Yankees to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   So it's looking more and more as if the Bronx is the answer. And
Ferrer contends that the total cost of his plan is less than half
that of a West Side stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If someone has a better idea, let's hear it.

`ANTZ' RAISES THE BAR FOR COMPUTER-ANIMATED FILMS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Rich Irwin) 
By   BOB STRAUSS   
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's good to be different. That's the moral of
``Antz,'' a groundbreaking, hilarious and surprisingly mature,
computer-animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   It might just as well be the motto for DreamWorks' cartoon
division. Though not the upstart studio's first in-house production
_ ``Antz'' was made by a digital outfit called PDI, much as
Disney's ``Toy Story'' was put together by Pixar _ DreamWorks'
first animated release declares loud and clear that the studio
won't slavishly imitate the Mouse's house formula.
</P>
<P>
   No syrupy kiddie songs here. For that matter, not much for
little tykes at all _ the movie's humor is both political and
psychologically sophisticated, and its big action set-piece looks
like something out of ``Starship Troopers.'' Even the film's
abundant visual wit, while certain to amuse insect lovers of all
ages, is more concerned with the humor of breathtaking perspective
shifts than in simple sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   After such witless Disney knockoffs as ``Anastasia'' and ``The
Quest for Camelot,'' ``Antz'' is refreshing evidence that animated
features can be much more interesting and diverse than they've
generally been allowed to be. That wouldn't mean much if the film
didn't deliver, but happily, it's as awesome as it is cockeyed, a
spectacle that never fails to dazzle the eye or tickle the laugh
nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the acting's even better than in most live-action films
you'd care to mention. Starting with the voice work of Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   He's the kvetching, unsatisfied Z, one of a few million drones
who dig dirt in a bustling, underground ant colony. ``The system
just makes me feel so insignificant'' he complains to his
six-legged shrink at the start of the movie. ``Breakthrough,'' the
analyst cries, ``You are insignificant!''
</P>
<P>
   The part was written especially for Allen and he ad libs
incorrigibly _ there are almost as many good lines here as in one
of the director's fabled, earlier funny ones. More than that, Z's
neurotic griping soon instigates a colony-wide workers' revolt
against conformity, just as the maniacal Gen. Mandible (Gene
Hackman), head of the army, puts his plans for a genocidal power
grab into play.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the cute talking ant movie is really a dialectical
manifesto that pits socialism against fascism and individualism
against regimentation. And this from a company owned by Steven
Spielberg and David Geffen, two of the most successful mass
entertainment capitalists the world has ever known.
State-of-the-art computer graphics and delicious irony _ I told ya,
this film's got everything.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, nebbish Z becomes an inadvertent hero when he
accidentally survives a battle with neighboring termites, kidnaps
the equally restless Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) and flees to the
outside world in search of the mythical Insectopia, where all God's
pests live together in peace and plenty.
</P>
<P>
   You can probably guess what that paradise turns out to be _
``Antz's'' most pronounced weakness is the obvious plotting in Todd
Alcott and Chris and Paul Weitz's screenplay. Yet there's no
predicting the delightful and exciting ways in which directors Eric
Darnell and Tim Johnson create a bug's-eye view of a world bursting
with gigantic, colorful new thrills and dangers. Yeah, it's a place
where you can get trapped inside a single drop of water. But where
else can you find such a temptingly delicious variety of dung?
</P>
<P>
   Great leaps forward in computer-graphics capability give
``Antz'' a much richer, more detailed and intricately kinetic look
than ``Toy Story's.'' Special software also makes for the most
expressive CG faces yet seen, a real necessity when you don't want
to waste an all-star voice cast that includes Dan Aykroyd, Anne
Bancroft, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and
Christopher Walken.
</P>
<P>
   On all fronts _ graphic, thematic, character _ ``Antz'' points
to the vast potential computer animation holds while setting
admirably high standards of its own. (And it's only the second
feature ever done this way; Disney/Pixar's ``A Bug's Life,'' which
will really have to be spectacular to compete, comes out at
Thanksgiving). Best of all, it succeeds by following the kind of
elegant logic craven, copycat Hollywood rarely embraces: when
you've got amazing new creative technology, it's time to break the
boring old rules.
</P>
<P>
   Insectopia indeed.

 &HT;    FOR JOHN GLENN, NO LONG GOODBYE TO THE SENATE
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Glenn has no time for long goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Democrat's 24 years in office winked out this morning
amid a flurry of new obligations as he boarded a plane for Houston
to begin the final push in astronaut training before his space
shuttle flight Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   This week has been stacked so heavily with television
interviews, autograph requests, preparations for a long Friday in a
shuttle simulator and what probably was his final vote in the U.S.
Senate Tuesday night, that Glenn never even got a chance to say
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to make sort of a farewell speech on the Senate
floor, but I've been so busy with everything else I just didn't
have time to sit down and put it all together,'' Glenn told a group
of Ohio reporters Wednesday. ``And I did want to do that, and
that's one thing I regret.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not complaining. He's barely even reminiscing right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'll miss it, sure,'' Glenn said. ``But, you know, you
move on to other things, and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, has moved on to the very thing he left 38 years ago
when he chose to pursue a career in politics: the space program.
His nine days in orbit, just his second space flight despite being
known worldwide as an astronaut, will make him the oldest man ever
in space.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Glenn may not be done with his Senate duties,
because he has promised to return if Democratic leaders require his
presence on an ``important'' or ``tight'' vote. But with the
session scheduled to end for the year on Oct. 9, the docket will be
loaded primarily with essential budget bills that aren't likely to
involve margins thin enough to necessitate Glenn's presence. His
final vote was cast on a procedural matter involving a bill to put
a moratorium on letting states tax Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he missed a retirement dinner honoring him and Sens.
Wendell Ford of Kentucky and Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, two fellow
Democrats who entered the Senate with him in 1974. Glenn couldn't
attend because he was at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where
NASA doctors were doing extensive tests to establish baseline
physical data that will be used for comparison when he returns from
his nine days in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means I was giving blood two, sometimes three times a
day..'' Glenn said. ``(But, they) had set it up for a satellite
feed from Houston, so I was in the studio there at NASA and I
participated in the dinner and made some remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Glenn wouldn't contemplate his place in the world as
a national role model, even as he talked about the scheduling
strain of ending a historic career to embark on a historic
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reflected on what it means to have for the kids, for
young people in particular, to have somebody that they look up to.
But as far as that relates to me personally, no, I have not. ...No,
you just get up every day and try and do what you're going to do
for that day and that's it. However people observe that, that's up
to them.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seated in a tiny self-service cafe on Sullivan
Street, Stanley Tucci doesn't look like a man who, at 37, has
achieved the kind of career control most actors only dream about.
He's gazing in consternation at the modest vegetarian sandwich
displayed before him on a piece of white bakery paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe seven dollars for this?'' he asks. ``What's
happened to the Village?''
</P>
<P>
   Uptown prices happened to Greenwich Village a long time ago, but
Tucci's budget-consciousness is a reminder that while he may be one
of the most sought after character actors around these days, he is
also an independent filmmaker, and independent filmmakers know the
value of a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   He gets his money's worth with ``The Impostors,'' an ebullient
new slapstick comedy that opened Friday. Tucci not only wrote,
directed and produced the moderately priced film; he also stars in
it with Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   They play two down-at-the-heels actors who accidentally stow
away on a luxury liner. This is Tucci's sophomore effort, following
``Big Night,'' the surprise 1996 hit he co-wrote with his cousin
and co-directed with Campbell Scott.
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet tale of a gourmet Italian restaurant on the Jersey
shore that fails in the spaghetti-and-meatballs 50s, ``Big Night''
was an unlikely candidate for box office success. ``The Impostors''
looks like a surer bet, but who knows? It's neither mean nor
cynical, and for all the physical clowning, there's not a bodily
fluid in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The film is as blissfully out of sync with the times as its
predecessor. Tucci wants it to succeed, but he has organized his
career for maximum disaster insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say I direct one movie and it's a bomb _ it could take years
to do another one,'' he says. ``I'm lucky because I'm able to do a
few different things. I can write something, I can go act in
something.'' He has. ``The Alarmist,'' a dark, funny comedy
starring Tucci and David Arquette, is to open October 16.
</P>
<P>
   And next month HBO will air its highly touted biopic of Walter
Winchell, directed by Paul Mazursky, with an indelible performance
by ucci as the controversial gossip columnist who wielded a bully's
power in the 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Luck has something to do with the place Tucci is making for
himself, but not that much. A graduate of the acting program at the
State University of New York at Purchase, he first became known for
playing silky villains on television.
</P>
<P>
   Two were especially memorable. In ``Wiseguys'' he was the young,
Harvard-educated mafioso Ricky Pinzolo, who wore black turtlenecks
and squeezed his own vegetable juice when he wasn't taking over the
garment industry and killing anyone who got in his way.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci was 26 at the time, and chillingly good. In 1996, he
played the decadent, baleful socialite-suspect Richard Cross in
``Murder One,'' the Stephen Bochco series that followed a fictional
trial over an entire season. The role won Tucci an Emmy nomination
and many fans, as numerous web sites attest.
</P>
<P>
   That success coincided with the release of ``Big Night,''
creating the synergy needed to kick his career up to a level
commensurate with his talent. But it was Tucci who did the kicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I formed a production company is that I
don't trust anybody to employ me,'' he says. ``Why would I?'' Good
question. In 1995, after a dozen years of steady work in movies,
theater and television, Tucci's career stalled. ``There was this
lull,'' he says, dropping his voice and glancing around the room,
as if the lull might be lurking nearby, waiting to pounce. ``I
couldn't get arrested before ``Big Night,'' if you want to know the
truth. And I had just bought a house. It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of ``Big Night,'' Tucci pounced himself. The
production company he founded with his partner, Beth Alexander,
made deals with Fox Searchlight and October Films. As with ``The
Impostors,'' the terms include creative freedom. ``Otherwise,
what's the point? If you don't trust me, don't give me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci more closely resembles Groucho Marx than Karl, but he's
not the first actor to try to seize the means of production. ``I
wanted to be prepared for when I get older,'' he says, ``and people
would say, `Oh well, we're tired of Stanley, we've seen him enough.
He's so bald. He's so ethnic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He's also so funny. Given his comic gifts, it's easy to imagine
him following a career path similar to Woody Allen's _ or Chaplin's
or Keaton's _ writing and directing films with himself as the star.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion all but gives him the bends. ``Write a movie just
for myself?'' he asks sharply. ``But it's so much more interesting
when you have other people there.'' Warming to his theme, he
exclaims: ``Actors are so wonderful! I want to be able to write for
them all. And work with them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk like that could get a person hooted out of the Directors
Guild, but Tucci seems to mean it. With the casts of his first two
films, he has already made a good start, and ``The Impostors'' is
both a homage to the classic comedies of Laurel and Hardy and the
Marx brothers and a celebration of acting itself.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci belongs to a loose circle of friends that includes some of
the most talented actors in New York, among them Platt, Scott, Hope
Davis and Lili Taylor, all of whom appear to hilarious, sometimes
surprising effect in ``The Impostors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Scott a closet Nazi? And Hope Davis as the moody young
spinster while Lili Taylor plays the madly efficient stewardess
Scott so sternly craves? ``Normally, you'd cast Hope Davis in that
role,'' says Mr. Tucci, ``and you'd give Lili Hope's part. It's
much more interesting to have it the other way around. Lili is
really very funny, sometimes funnier than she knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis, who got to know Tucci when he played her elusive
husband in ``Daytrippers,'' says: ``You'd be surprised how many
directors just put you in a scene and leave all the work up to you.
Stanley knows that decent actors want direction. Often when you
finish a scene, he'll yell, `Keep rolling,' and he'll be shouting
all sorts of ideas _ `Try this! Try this!'
</P>
<P>
   All the while he's laughing, and you think, `How can they use
any of this with Stanley making all that noise?' He's a joyous
person. He's no shrinking violet. But he also believes in what he's
doing. I wouldn't trust him otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Dunsky, who wrote and directed ``The Alarmist,'' dealt with
Tucci from the other side of the camera. In the film, Tucci plays
Heinrich Grigoris, the distinctly shady head of a firm that sells
home security systems (the company logo features snarling Dobermans
neatly labeled ``Safety'' and ``Peace of Mind''); Arquette is his
bright-eyed protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinrich obviously has a dark side,'' says Dunsky. ``He's
conniving and nefarious, but he has this tremendous sweetness and a
weird integrity. Everyone depends on him, and he loves the young
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The part feels more closely tailored for Tucci than any he's
written himself, combining his knack for villainy with the faint
touch of goofiness that inflects his comic persona. Yet he never
dominates the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a wonderful way of bringing other actors into a
scene,'' Dunsky says. As a consequence, ``The Alarmist,'' like
Tucci's own films, is an ensemble piece that showcases everybody's
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci looks terribly L.A. these days _ or at least East Village
_ with his dark, thinning hair bleached palest yellow and smartly
trimmed in a latter-day Caligula cut. He says it's just a leftover
from playing Puck this summer in a film version of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Calista
Flockhart, Rupert Everett and Sophie Marceau.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Michael Hoffman for release next spring,
capped 18 months of nonstop work for Tucci, who returned from
location in Tuscany and promptly fell victim to a short, nasty bout
of Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he'd like to direct a big Hollywood-scale movie
some day, Tucci really lights up when he talks about a script he's
working on for October Films, based on ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' a
famous two-part 1964 New Yorker profile by Joseph Mitchell, the
legendary chronicler of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The film will focus on the relationship between Mitchell and the
eccentric 1940s bohemian his profile immortalized. While it hardly
sounds like the next ``Titanic,'' there's anticipatory buzz about
the project in New York literary circles, and he is hopeful that
Ian Holm, who did a nice, gritty turn in ``Big Night,'' will play
Joe Gould. Asked if he would play Joseph Mitchell, Tucci says he
thinks he wants to give the role to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent with Tucci lays bare the reason for his lack of
self-absorption: He's too interested in everything else. He has a
passion for modern art, particularly the Abstract Expressionists;
he also paints for pleasure and to clear his head. ``I think very
visually,'' he says, ``and when I come back to my work, suddenly I
see relationships that weren't there before. It opens all these
little windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the Katonah, N.Y., area, where he grew up and now
lives with his wife, Kate, and two stepchildren, soon leads Tucci
to discuss New York City's extraordinary gravity-based, fresh-water
reservoir system, a subject on which he waxes ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it sounds silly,'' he says, ``but those reservoirs have
such a huge effect on so much. There's a depth to them, no pun
intended. Well, it's a good metaphor: they're something you draw
from.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes walking through one of the drained reservoirs as a
kid. ``You'd find coins and knives and forks and plates. You'd see
the foundations of the old farms that used to be there, the houses
and barns, and where they cut three or four trees in a row for
somebody's driveway.'' He paints the scene as vividly as any movie.
One can see it now: Stanley Tucci Presents: ``Reservoir!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I like that,'' he says. ``I think it could be a hit.''

TREATMENT OF FORMER DEPUTY LEADER UNSETTLES MALAYSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
suggested Wednesday that his jailed former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
might have punched himself in the eye in order to accuse police of
beating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to some quarters, this is not something that is
impossible as he will gain much mileage if it can be shown that he
is being tortured by police,'' Mahathir said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Anwar's statement in court on Tuesday that he had
been beaten by his jailers would be investigated, but he sounded
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Why was he assaulted, if at all he was beaten?'' Mahathir
said. ``This is to his advantage as it is now seen that he has
already experienced what he had forecast at the very outset. His
prediction was, if arrested he'll be tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal and subsequent arrest of Anwar, 51, who had been
the deputy prime minister and designated successor of Mahathir, 72,
has stirred unexpectedly widespread anger in what had been seen as
one of Southeast Asia's most politically stable nations.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's remarks Wednesday appeared to inflame the
growing condemnation here and abroad of the treatment of Anwar, who
appeared in court for a second day Wednesday with bruises on his
left eye, his neck and his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The Bar Council of Malaysia together with several opposition
politicians spoke out Wednesday to condemn what they said was the
beating of Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   A local human rights group called Suaram said the prime
minister's remarks went ``against every basic principle of sanity
and logic.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's statement was met with puzzlement by some
people here, who are already confused and distressed by this sudden
government turmoil. Some, obedient by habit, nodded their heads and
murmured that the man they call ``Dr. M'' might well be right.
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed outraged. ``He thinks the people are stupid,
accusing Anwar of this and that,'' said a restaurant worker. ``Our
people are not stupid, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Wednesday, Anwar wiped his eye with a
handkerchief and pinched his waistband to signal that he had lost
weight since he was arrested 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded not guilty to a fifth and final charge of performing
illegal sex acts. On Tuesday he pleaded not guilty to four charges
of sodomy and five charges of corruption _ all but one of which
also related to the sodomy charges.
</P>
<P>
   After much talk about sedition and the leaking of secret
documents, as well as of capers with prostitutes and transvestites,
all but one of the 10 charges against Anwar boil down to
allegations of four instances of homosexual acts, which are illegal
here.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is a charge that Anwar tried to use his
influence to deflect corruption charges against an aide.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of homosexual acts were weakened Tuesday when
two men with whom Anwar was accused of having sex appealed their
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's contention that he had been beaten received support
Wednesday after an independent doctor was allowed to examine him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my expert opinion, Anwar Ibrahim was assaulted over the
left forehead and neck and received blunt trauma that resulted in
residual bruises over the left upper and lower eyelids,'' the
doctor, Ahmad Shukri Mohamed, said in a written report after
examining him on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Wednesday, Anwar slipped reporters a scribbled
note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysians should be made aware,'' Anwar said, ``of the
deterioration of their fundamental liberties and the dictatorial
acts of Dr. M.''

COMMENTARY: OCTOBER SURPRISE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has invited Benjamin Netanyahu
and Yasser Arafat back to Washington about two weeks before
Election Day. At that time they are expected to reach interim
agreement on another transfer of West Bank land, with Palestinian
reciprocity, and thereby begin final-settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   I asked the Israeli prime minister if he was familiar with the
American political term ``October surprise'' _ a presidential
announcement designed to influence an election. Bibi seemed
genuinely taken aback: ``I checked my schedule to make sure it
didn't conflict with Succoth,'' he replied, referring to the Jewish
fall festival. ``I wasn't thinking about your elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was, of course; progress toward peacemaking would
enhance his standing the week before voters choose representatives
who will vote on impeachment. His timing, after a long stalemate,
is hardly coincidental, nor is his possible choice of site: Camp
David, scene of President Carter's only historic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the ability to fine-tune the making of world news is an edge
all our campaigning presidents have. More to the point is what lies
behind what Secretary Madeleine Albright calls ``the new urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, urgency comes from his failure to get America to
pressure Israel to cede almost all the West Bank to him on the
installment plan before he makes his final-settlement demand to
partition Jerusalem. His threat to declare a Palestinian state next
May backfired when it became evident that Israel alone would then
decide on borders, annexing what it needed for security.
</P>
<P>
   For Netanyahu, who successfully resisted the salami-slicing of
his bargaining position, urgency to make peace on the local front
is strategic: Iran is building long-range missiles and nuclear
devices, Iraq is shutting down U.N. inspections. He sees
mass-destruction technologists ``gushing'' out of crumbling Russia
to rogue nations, and up to a million more Jewish immigrants to be
absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the urgency is not only to divert attention from
impeachment, but to make history in a hurry _ or at least to be at
center stage when it is made.
</P>
<P>
   What good end may this confluence of urgencies produce?
</P>
<P>
   The president has learned from his diplomatic blunder. Israel
properly ignored his diktat of an additional 13 percent salami
slice of the West Bank because it was too loosely connected to
reciprocal PLO action against Hamas and Hezbollah terrorism, and
because interim handovers stole the land sweetener needed to close
the final deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has changed his proposal to 10 percent plus 3 percent
set aside in what is euphemized as a ``nature preserve'' _ in
effect, buffer zones with joint patrols to deny bases to terrorists
within hand-held-missile distance of Tel Aviv, airports and Israeli
(and Palestinian) settlements. Both sides find this acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   That should bring us through Succoth next week to Camp David 1{.
Clinton, though allergic to the Catoctin Mountain air, is primed to
labor mightily there to announce what will be headlined as a
breakthrough: the launch of final-settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   As the punch line about the Jewish matchmaker goes, ``Now for
the hard part.'' For the Israelis, it will mean giving up more of
the West Bank than many think is wise for the small nation's
territorial security, and risking the conferring of statehood on an
ally of Saddam. For Palestinians, it will mean permanent crackdown
on terror and renunciation of unrealistic and inflammatory claims
on part of Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, a secure final settlement means a new look at
coordinated missile defense. He told Netanyahu he'd been thinking
about it. Israel's Arrow antimissile missile shows promise, but its
U.S.-financed ``bullet to hit a bullet'' is a last line of defense
against weaponry now threatening Israel and American forces near
the Persian Gulf _ and soon to threaten Paris and New York. Only
future U.S. space technology and defense investment will be able to
stop nuclear missiles in their launch phase.
</P>
<P>
   A facile facilitator will do for Camp David 1{. An American
president with a grasp of both the local and strategic security
needs of Israelis and Arabs is required to clamp together a
historic handshake at Camp David II.

ISRAELIS PONDER THE HISTORICAL MEANING OF THE YOM KIPPUR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On Yom Kippur, Israel's streets are, on this one
day, forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   As Israelis observed the Day of Atonement Wednesday, the
ultra-Orthodox and even the adamantly secular, all seemed to be
adhering to the custom of not driving.
</P>
<P>
   The usually hellish streets of the Holy City and the busy
boulevards of Tel Aviv were filled with people strolling.
</P>
<P>
   The religious, dressed in white, fasted from sundown Tuesday to
sundown Wednesday, and walked to and from synagogue, praying and
imbibing the purifying spirit of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis, who make up the vast majority of the country,
tended to take to the wide-open streets not to pray, but to saunter
and chat with neighbors or to ride bicycles, skateboards and roller
blades.
</P>
<P>
   All shops and businesses are shuttered. Buses and trains stop
running. There are no international or domestic flights. Seaports
are closed. Border crossings are sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Here in a nation increasingly divided along religious and
secular lines, Yom Kippur is observed as a time of soul searching
by just about everyone, and each in his or her own way. And this
year, the day has taken on a unique form of collective
introspection as it marks the 25th anniversary of the Yom Kippur
War.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, 1973, Israel's Arab neighbors attacked on the onset
of the holy day as it fell on the Jewish calendar that year. Almost
2,700 Israeli soldiers died in more than two weeks of fighting,
undermining the belief of Israelis that their country had the most
powerful military in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yakov Savir, 50, remembered the day in 1973 that he left his
kibbutz near the Jordan border to board an Egged bus that would
take him to the front lines of battle along with thousands of other
reservists who were rushed into fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs were around us then and we didn't see them,'' he
said Wednesday as he strolled with his wife along Jerusalem's Ben
Yehuda Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now all the signs are around us again, and we still
don't see them. The fight now is between the religious and the
secular and the deep divide over the issue of peace,'' said Savir,
who describes himself as ``agnostic on religion, but a believer in
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The price we will pay if we seize on making the peace work now
will be cheap in comparison to the price we will pay if we have
another war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's newspapers on Tuesday were filled with special
supplements commemorating the 25th anniversary of the war. The
daily tabloid Ma'ariv carried an 80-page section devoted entirely
to introspective and analytical essays surrounded by photographs of
the war, and the leaders, Prime Minister Golda Meir and Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan, who were caught unprepared. The more liberal
broadsheet, Ha'aretz, carried several columns which seemed to make
the case that not only was Israel ill-prepared for war in 1973, it
had also failed to seize earlier opportunities to make peace with
its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yoel Marcus, in a piece sharply critical of what he feels is
Prime Minister Netanyahu's intransigence in the currently
deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace process, wrote, ``As we have
learned from the blindness that led to the Yom Kippur War, history
does not stand still in our region while the leaders of Israel play
chess with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem's Old City at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest
site, the prayers of tens of thousands of Jews echoed off the pink
Herodian stone in the fading light of day just before the fast was
broken. In the nearby neighborhood of Mea Shearim, candle light
flickered inside synagogues as Orthodox men rocked back and forth
as they prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Susser, 25, a yeshiva student wearing a white robe over
his black clothing, said, ``Today is a day we are purified of our
sins. And as a people, we look at the 25th anniversary of the war
as God's miracle. Even though we were not ready, we had a victory.
God showed us on that day, He takes care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, there was the mournful sound of the ``shofar,''
or ram's horn, an ancient Jewish tradition that symbolically opens
the skies for prayer.

FOSSIL WORMHOLES SHED LIGHT ON EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worms may be among the lowliest of creatures, but the discovery
of a bunch of wormholes being reported this week could lead to a
drastic rewriting of the history of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, the new evidence just looks like a hole in
the ground or, actually, a whole network of holes in the ground.
But a team of paleontologists says these burrows were left by worms
over a billion years ago, which could make them the key evidence to
demolish a central belief about when complex creatures first
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   By almost doubling the age at which the first multicelled
animals appeared on Earth, the new find could prove that the
appearance of complicated life forms out of what had been a
menagerie of single-celled creatures did not happen suddenly about
540 million years ago, in what biologists call the Cambrian
explosion _ considered the ``Big Bang'' of evolution. Instead, the
complexification of life was really more of a slow sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   The traces of wormholes, in rocks that date to about 1.1 billion
years ago, were found in central India, in beds of sandstone that
formed when that area was covered by a shallow sea. The discovery
by researchers Adolf Seilacher and Friedrich Pfluger of Yale
University and the University of Tubingen, and Pradip Bose of
Jadavpur University in Calcutta, is being reported this week in the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true, it's staggering,'' said paleontologist Charles
Marshall of the University of California, Los Angeles, in a
commentary accompanying the Science paper. But because the evidence
is indirect _ consisting only of burrows apparently left by the
worms, rather than any trace of the animals themselves _ it is
likely to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, no fossil traces of multicelled animals, with
muscles, guts or other distinctive anatomical features, had been
found in rocks more than 540 million years old, but in the last few
years a few discoveries _ including some of worm burrows _ have
pushed back the first appearance of complex animals to about 580
million years. The new find, if confirmed, would almost double the
known age of the first appearance of animals with more than one
cell and with differentiated body structures.
</P>
<P>
   The worms responsible for the burrows found in the Chorhat
sandstone, formed from sand washed in by storms in a shallow sea
1.1 billion years ago, must have been fairly complex, the authors
say. The type of burrows they made, which are about the width of a
soda straw, have a structure similar to those made by modern worms
that propel themselves along by peristalsis, rhythmic muscle
contractions similar to those that propel food through a digestive
tract. Such worms are far more complex in body structure than more
primitive flatworms and roundworms, suggesting that worms had
already undergone a significant period of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The new find lends strong support to evidence gathered by a
completely different kind of analysis: the study of differences in
the genetic structure of different animal groups, which can provide
a kind of ``molecular clock'' to estimate when certain kinds of
animals first evolved. Some molecular biologists have contended for
several years that the first multicellular animals must have
originated 1.2 billion years ago _ but that conclusion faced
widespread skepticism, largely because no one could find any fossil
evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The molecular work has long established that most of the
(animal) groups we know in the fossil record do go back that far,''
said David Raup, a professor of paleontology emeritus at the
University of Chicago, in an interview Wednesday. The new find
``would be good confirmation for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indirect fossil evidence, such as the burrows found by this
team, have always been controversial because some natural,
non-biological processes can produce similar structures. The debate
is similar to arguments over the significance of tiny shapes found
two years ago in a meteorite from Mars, which some scientists have
interpreted as evidence of Martian microbial life, but others
contend could have been produced by non-biological chemical
processes.
</P>
<P>
   But the team reporting its research this week went to great
pains to analyze the details of the burrows' structure, and say
they have all but ruled out other possible explanations. the
burrows ``can only be explained as the works of macroscopic
wormlike animals,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some others are not so sure. Paleontologist Bruce Runnegar of
UCLA, who specializes in early life, said that ``this is not the
smoking gun... I'd say the jury is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Raup agreed that ``It's easy to get fooled,'' but he said he is
familiar with the work of Seilacher and said he would be ``harder
to fool than anybody.... He knows more about worm trails than
anybody.''

TEXAS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RAUL A. GONZALEZ TO RETIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Justice Raul A. Gonzalez, a former migrant farm worker
who became the first Hispanic to win a statewide election in Texas,
announced Wednesday that he will step down from the Texas Supreme
Court on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The court's senior member, Gonzalez also is the only Hispanic to
ever serve on the court and is one of only two Democrats remaining
on the nine-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   His midterm retirement will give Gov. George W. Bush the
opportunity to appoint another Republican to the court and give the
GOP all the court's seats if Democratic Justice Rose Spector loses
her re-election bid on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Spector faces a strong challenge from Republican Harriet
O'Neill, a justice on the 14th Court of Appeals in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 58, was appointed to the Supreme Court, the state's
highest civil court, by Gov. Mark White to fill a vacancy in 1984.
He had previously been a state district judge in Brownsville,
Texas, and a member of the 13th Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez won his first election to the Supreme Court in 1986,
making history as the first Hispanic elected to statewide office in
Texas. Two years remain in his current term.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years as a judge, Gonzalez said, he has ``attempted to
uphold the public trust by making decisions without fear or
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he added, ``It is time for me to move on to other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly a case of burnout, partly an opportunity for
financial awards out of government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his wife, Dora, plan to remain in Austin, where he
is considering several options for work in mediation and
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Gonzalez worked with his parents, harvesting crops
as far away as California and Washington state before graduating
from high school in Weslaco in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his background and party affiliation, Gonzalez has been
one of the Supreme Court's most conservative justices during an
often-rocky period of major philosophical and partisan changes.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the court 14 years ago, all its members were
Democrats, and plaintiffs' lawyers, who heavily supported the
campaigns of successful judicial candidates, were influential. The
court majority, with Gonzalez often dissenting, issued major
decisions upholding large damage awards for consumers against
businesses, insurance companies and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the pendulum _ pushed by the retirements of Democratic
justices and large campaign contributions from doctors, business
interests and defense lawyers _ began to swing the other way, and
Gonzalez almost became a wartime casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers, women's advocates and even some Hispanic
leaders in his own party tried to unseat Gonzalez in 1994 by
backing challenger Rene Haas, a trial lawyer from Corpus Christi,
in the Democratic primary. Gonzalez, heavily supported by political
contributions from doctors and business interests, won, but only
after one of the most bitterly contested elections in Texas
judicial history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought about tucking it in (quitting) then,'' said George
Christian, a consultant for the Texas Civil Justice League, a
business group that strongly supports the high court's
conservatism. ``He found it very distasteful to have to go out and
raise that kind of money. He is a man of great integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Borges, who monitors the Supreme Court for Texas Watch, a
consumer advocacy group, said he's not sure what Gonzalez's
retirement will mean for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, he was the conservative Democrat,'' Borges
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, Gonzalez also was independent, often dissenting
after conservatives regained control of the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loose cannon. You could never tell where he would
come in on a case,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a deeply religious man, was strongly outspoken against
abortion during his tenure on the court, although the panel rarely
addressed that issue.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Gonzalez wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion
in the court's 6-3 decision upholding a $1.2 million damage award
against anti-abortion protesters who staged large demonstrations at
Houston abortion clinics during and after the 1992 Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez approved the monetary damages, but he believed that the
majority's order restricting ``sidewalk counseling'' by
anti-abortion protesters outside abortion clinics was an
unnecessary restriction on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Gonzalez also warned protesters that
anti-abortion violence and vandalism are counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every intimidating gesture or hateful utterance deafens the
public's collective ear to pro-life (anti-abortion) appeals about
the dignity of the unborn,'' he wrote. &QL;

CLINTON UNVEILS BUDGET SURPLUS, SETS OFF SQUABBLE WITH REPUBLICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, marking a new era in government,
unveiled Wednesday the first budget surplus in a generation and set
off a squabble with Republicans over who deserves praise for the
extra $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the partisan sniping, the fact remained that after 29
years of budget deficits that sometimes reached $300 billion a
year, the federal government had money left over as the 1998 fiscal
year ended at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The figure quoted by the administration was based on
projections. It will take several weeks for all accounts for the
fiscal year to be tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the political battle is what to do with the extra cash.
Clinton warned Republicans not to pass an $80 billion tax cut until
Congress overhauls the Social Security system, and Republicans
complained the president was trying to spend the money on items
such as the census count or troop deployment in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest surplus on record and, as a percentage of
our economy, the largest one since the 1950s. Our economy is the
strongest in a generation. That's why we see the deficit clock has
become a surplus clock,'' Clinton said, a small billboard behind
him flashing ``surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited several former members of Congress, including
Houston Democrat Mike Andrews, who voted for his 1993 deficit
reduction plan. The vote cost some lawmakers their seats in 1994
because the spending blueprint contained tax increases. Clinton
said without their votes for his measure, which passed despite
opposition from every Republican, the surplus would not be reality.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his 1993 plan reduced the deficit by 90
percent while the 1997 bipartisan budget accord with congressional
leaders finished the job and will lead to surpluses for several
years to come. The Congressional Budget Office predicts $1.6
trillion in surpluses over the next 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a landmark achievement not just for those in the room
who have played a role in it, but indeed for all the American
people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, was one of the first Republicans to
criticize Clinton, saying it was the new Republican majority that
took control in 1995 that pushed for the balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I'd like to make is if you want to know who led, the
American people led. Those who should be given credit here, and I
think the lion's share of the credit, are basically the people who
came out and voted for a change in 1994. Elections have
consequences,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So who led? The American people led. Who followed? Republicans
followed. And who got out of the way and reluctantly got out of the
way? Bill Clinton,'' Gramm said, adding that the president wants to
spend $14 billion to $20 billion on ``emergency spending'' for such
items as the census count and troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, long a conservative voice on budget issues, voted against
all the budget-related measures that both sides claim led to the
surplus. He opposed the 1991 deficit reduction measure crafted by
President Bush, Clinton's 1993 budget request and the 1997
bipartisan budget resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gramm) has not tried to claim credit for anything. He's
simply tried to do the work necessary to get that job done,'' said
Gramm spokesman Larry Neal. Neal said Gramm opposes spending any of
the surplus, for either tax cuts or appropriations, until Social
Security is overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, issued a statement claiming
credit for Republicans. She said Clinton's 1993 measure was ``the
largest tax increase in the history of America'' and ``only when
Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 did the march toward a
balanced budget begin.'' Hutchison voted for the 1997 accord.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, estimated the 1998 surplus at $63 billion but still
claimed credit for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the Republican Congress, we've balanced the budget,
reformed welfare, cut taxes and cut spending, which is why we have
a budget surplus today. And since American taxpayers are now paying
more in taxes than the government needs, they have a right to a
refund _ it's their money after all,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston legislator also pushed a five-year, $80 billion tax
cut measure he is sponsoring, but Clinton urged Republicans to hold
off until the Social Security system, which will be bankrupt within
another generation, is reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am well aware that it is a popular thing, particularly
right here just four weeks and change before Election Day, to serve
up a tax cut,'' Clinton said. But he also noted the deficit was
made small because the White House and Congress used the Social
Security surplus to offset the red ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us know this problem is looming out there and will need
money to fix. So I think the American people have waited 29 years,
and I think most Americans would like to see the ink change from
red to black and then just dry a little before we put it at risk,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulated national debt from the 29 years of deficits is
more than $4 trillion. &QL;

BAY STATE FAMILY TO VIEW CANONIZATION CEREMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Benedicta McCarthy, whose recovery from an overdose of
painkillers has been attributed to the miraculous intervention of a
Roman Catholic nun murdered by the Nazis, will be in Rome when the
nun is canonized by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, 14, her parents and 11 brothers and sisters will make
the trip to Rome to witness the pontiff give the official edict
naming Sister Teresia Benedicta a Catholic saint on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logistics of getting all the children, who are scattered
all over the United States, to Rome is a lot of work but we'll all
be there,'' said McCarthy's father, the Reverend Emmanuel Charles
McCarthy, a Melkite priest in the Eastern Rite of the Catholic
Church who is permitted to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Benedicta was born Edith Stein, a Jew, but after converting to
Roman Catholicism and entering a Carmelite convent in 1933 she took
the name of Teresia Benedicta after St. Teresa of Avila.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, she was taken by the Nazis from a convent
in Holland after Dutch bishops spoke out against anti-Semitism. The
Nazis were rounding up anyone with Jewish roots. Stein was murdered
in a gas chamber at Auschwitz on Aug. 9, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1987, when Benedicta McCarthy was two, she swallowed a
massive overdose of Tylenol. Her kidneys and liver ceased
functioning and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital expected
her to die.
</P>
<P>
   As her family prepared for the worst, Charles McCarthy's
sister-in-law suggested that the family ask friends to pray to
Teresia Benedicta.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler had been named for the murdered nun after McCarthy
discovered that the day of the woman's death in a Nazi gas chamber
was also the same day he was ordained a priest _ Aug. 9, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   As his daughter lay near death at MGH, McCarthy, who had kept a
longstanding commitment to lead a retreat near Fargo, N.D., was
telling retreat participants about his gravely ill daughter. At the
exact time, 1 p.m., that he was discussing her, Dr. Ronald Kleinman
of MGH was recording in Benedicta's medical chart that ``this child
has made a remarkable recovery,'' according to McCarthy, who read
his daughter's medical files.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinman, along with Cardinal Bernard Law, also will be in Rome
to witness Benedicta's sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these years I've just pondered what all these means,''
McCarthy said. ``I ponder it in terms of God working through
history with some kind of power we don't understand and in which
the purpose is to ensure that love conquers evil.''

infected 20 percent of its population, desperate Ugandans clamor to
participate in an AIDS vaccine trial. In the past, ethical
guidelines have made it clear that vaccines should be tested where
health care is excellent before they are ever used in places
without a safety net, like Uganda. Now the international medical
community has set aside that requirement. By Michael Specter. A

TOBACCO PROBE (Undated) - Attorney General Grant Woods has asked
the Justice Department to investigate whether the tobacco companies
and former Gov. Fife Symington violated the Hobbs Act for
corruption and influence-peddling when they sat down to agree how
to pull the state Attorney General's Office off the tobacco case.
Mysterious handwritten notes that refer to a ``PR fund`` that the
tobacco companies apparently were to give Symington led Woods to
turn the case over to the feds for investigation. Because his
office has proceeded civilly against the tobacco companies in a

STOCK AND BOND UNDERWRITING SLOWER IN THIRD QUARTER

 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street's core business _ the underwriting of
stocks and bonds _ slowed significantly in the third quarter after
relatively smooth growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Securities firms and banks issued $392.6 billion of bonds and
stocks in the three months ended Sept. 30 amid much more volatile
markets, greater caution among U.S. investors and issuers of
securities, and the swoon in the stock market that began in
mid-July as global economic problems spread _ particularly in
Japan, other Asian countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The volume was up 5 percent from the quarter a year earlier. But
the pace of underwriting has slowed sharply from the first six
months of this year, when banks and securities firms raised almost
$1 trillion as companies issued bonds and shares at record rates in
the most buoyant securities markets in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking of the firms most active in managing securities
issues for the third quarter was led by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which
raised $59 billion, followed by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Salomon Smith
Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street executives, who have had a run of good markets in
recent years were buffeted by this summer's more difficult markets.
``It was tough. The longer the quarter went, the worse it got.
September will show up as one of the worst months in terms of
equity issue business,'' said Steven D. Black, vice chairman and
chief operating officer of Salomon Smith Barney, the brokerage
subsidiary of Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you did, you felt you were trying to catch a
falling knife,'' said Black. ``If you were an issuer, why go into
the market with all the uncertainty? You're better off just to sit
and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see improvement in the equity markets in recent weeks.
``July, globally, was an unbelievably good market,'' said Mark
Hantho, a managing director in equity capital markets at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``In August the brakes were firmly applied;
almost nothing was working in the market. But in September the
market was slowly emerging on a very selective basis,'' with some
big companies gradually coming back to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the summer difficulties in securities markets have taken a
toll on even the best companies. ``In a market crack like we have
had, good and bad names suffer,'' said Vincent Pica, group
president of the capital finance group at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The bond markets practically froze over after Russia defaulted
on some obligations in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The securities industry went ``from printing about $7 billion a
week of investment-grade debt to zero,'' in August, and has only
begun to revive in recent weeks, said Kevin Kelly, the managing
director at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in charge of new bond-issue
business.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said, the industry had continued its recovery,
issuing about $5 billion of investment-grade debt. Recent
debt-issue activity, he noted, involved blue-chip borrowers almost
exclusively. ``We have quite a long way to go before we can get to
covering the gamut of issuers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions also slowed markedly in the third
quarter as raising money for acquisitions suddenly became much more
difficult and company managers grew more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions totaling $327.7 billion were announced
in the third quarter, according to preliminary figures compiled
Wednesday by Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J. That represents a
decline of more than 50 percent from $701 billion of mergers in the
second quarter of this year, although it still represents a
considerable increase from $192 billion of such transactions in
last year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the volume of new securities issues was
particularly pronounced in more speculative markets, such as those
for initial public offerings and high-yield bonds. The industry,
for example, managed 69 initial public offerings to raise $5.3
billion in the third quarter of this year, down substantially from
the 158 such issues that raised $10.4 billion in last year's third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street issued $20.6 billion of high-yield bonds, in the
third quarter, yet in the first six months of the year the
securities industry issued more than $100 billion of such
securities, which are also known as junk bonds. ``It went from
records to wreckage,'' said Richard Peterson, a spokesman for
Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street professionals are pessimistic about the the
prospects for underwriting. ``I don't think it's going to change
till you get some kind of leveling-off process from these wild
swings,'' Black of Salomon Smith Barney said. ``Individual stocks
and industries moving all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Pica of Prudential said: ``There's still a fair amount of
uncertainty out there. `Traditionally October is a tough month.''

MODEL YEAR '99 IS EVOLUTIONARY  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Model year 1999 is an evolutionary one for the world's
automakers, with a tuck here, a tweak there, and a couple of face
lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few models are brand new for '99, plus the re-entries of
a couple of old names, as the manufacturers gear up for the new
millennium. Corvette adds a model, Oldsmobile adds a compact,
Toyota adds a coupe, Buick loses a coupe, and Infiniti resurrects
its entry-level car.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, trucks are huge, as more and more erstwhile car buyers
switch to the beefy, the brawny and the fully loaded. Jumping on
the four-wheel-drive bandwagon is  &UR; Cadillac, which introduces its
first-ever truck, the luxurious  &UR; Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are also big news for Chevrolet, GMC, Ford and Toyota,
with the GM siblings trotting out upgraded  &UR; Silverado and  &UR; Sierra
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The GM pickups are playing catch-up with Ford's highly regarded
 &UR; F-series trucks, updated two years ago and still by far the
bestselling vehicle in the United States. And both companies are
trying to fend off the growing popularity of the macho  &UR; Dodge Ram
and, soon, a full-size V-8 pickup from  &UR; Toyota, the  &UR; Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, gentler side of the truck fence are the new
 &UR; Suzuki
 &UR; Vitara/Chevy Tracker models, all new for '99 despite the continued
Tracker name. Suzuki gets the V-6-powered  &UR; Grand Vitara (sounds
like a lodge leader) with a 140-horsepower V-6. The Tracker has to
wait until next year to be Grand.
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Kia, though beset by financial woes and other heartbreak,
keeps smiling with a soft-top version of its cute-as-a-bug
 &UR; Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Escalade is possibly the world's largest stopgap, hastily
conceived while Caddy prepares its very own sport-utility vehicle.
Caddy makes the end run after watching the Lincoln dealers down the
block eating everybody's lunch with the fast-selling  &UR; Navigator.
Not even to mention Mercedes-Benz's  &UR; ML320.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the $45,000 Escalade trundles out as a revised  &UR; GMC
Yukon
 &UR; Denali with a Cadillac grille, softer suspension and an even
plusher interior. Caddy dealers are rubbing their hands with glee.
At least, they should be. This one is the mother of all
no-brainers.
</P>
<P>
   The summer's General Motors labor strike slowed introduction of
the
 &UR; Chevy Silverado and  &UR; GMC Sierra pickups at a critical time, but,
word is, they're worth waiting for. Styling is slightly revised,
with the notable changes underneath: new engines, brakes and
suspension systems that have improved driveability and garnered
much critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Ford pickups get four doors on their  &UR; Club Cab models, and the
F-series family is joined by a new set of muscle twins, Hans and
Frans. No, wait, it's really the  &UR; F-250/F-350 Super Duty pickups,
which are available with 265-horse V-10 engines or monster diesels
packing 400 pound-feet of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Grrrr.
</P>
<P>
   But let's talk about some fun stuff. Let's talk about the  &UR; New
 &UR; Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's darling continues as a hot property for  &UR; Volkswagen,
with widespread price gouging and much unfulfilled desire. For '99,
the Beetle goes uptown with an optional 150-horsepower,
turbocharged four, borrowed from the  &UR; Passat, and a glass sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   Still no word on a convertible Beetle. Rats!
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Mazda Miata continues to tread its retro path with a
refurbishing that includes a handsome new front end, sleeker body
shape, new interior, more powerful engine and improved suspension.
Still, it keeps the faith as an affordable, enjoyable little sports
car.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ford Mustang celebrates its 35th year (where (begin ital) has
(end ital) the time gone) with a restyling that recaptures many of
the cues of the original, including deeply scooped flanks, ersatz
hood scoop, and taillight design. Both V-6 and V-8 power is up. In
the hot Cobra version, Mustang gets an independent rear suspension
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of power, the  &UR; Corvette hardtop joins the hatchback and
convertible with less weight and a lower price. The
performance-oriented hardtop is offered only with a six-speed
manual. As well it should.
</P>
<P>
   Over at  &UR; Chrysler, there's the new and notable  &UR; 300M sedan, an
athletic version of cab-forward design, and its longer, plusher
sibling, the
 &UR; LHS. The  &UR; Plymouth Prowler, a unique hot-rod roadster and every car
lover's dream machine, also gets the powerful 253 horsepower V-6
from the 300M and LHS.
</P>
<P>
   The hyper  &UR; Dodge Viper gets some wheel and interior options, and
continues being supercool. Chrysler stylists continue to hit as
many home runs as McGwire and Sosa put together.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Jeep Grand Cherokee receives a complete makeover, with a
body that's slicker and more refined but still recognizable, a new
engine, and enhanced off-highway abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's new partner,  &UR; Mercedes-Benz, continues to reinvent
itself with more desirable and technologically advanced machines,
such as the fine and refined  &UR; CLK320 Cabriolet and the V-8-powered
version of its sport ute, the  &UR; ML430.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Mercedes docket is a five-speed manual version of
its supercharged, drop-top sports car, the  &UR; SLK, which corrects the
error of introducing the little terror with an automatic-only in
the first place. Watch sales soar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BMW's new  &UR; 323i and  &UR; 328 sedans appeared over the summer to
replace the 3-series cars. But the real news at BMW is the ugly
duckling that turns into a beautiful swan as soon as you get behind
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Z3 coupe and hotter  &UR; M-coupe might look ungainly to some
eyes, but they do have the advantages of being stiffer and quieter
than the roadster versions, and a few hundred dollars cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Audi introduced its all-wheel-drive  &UR; Avant luxury wagon in June,
and the smaller  &UR; A4 wagon adds a 1.8-liter turbo engine. Soon to
arrive is the exotic  &UR; TT sports coupe with its bluntly purposeful
styling and aggressive manners, going up against the likes of the
 &UR; Porsche Boxster, Mercedes SLK, BMW Z3 and the less-pricey Miata.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Acura introduces a new  &UR; TL, its midlevel car, that's bigger and
more powerful, and the big  &UR; RL gets restyled with a suspension
upgrade and side-impact air bags. Honda joins the mainstream with
its new
 &UR; Odyssey minivan, restyled in the mode of the Chrysler minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Mitsubishi Gallant swims upstream, bigger in all
dimensions, and touting a 195-horse V-6 that puts it on a par with
costlier sedans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toyota is coming out with a swoopy coupe version of its
faithful
 &UR; Camry, and its  &UR; Sienna minivan gets a fourth door. Lexus powers up
its
 &UR; ES300 with a 210-horse, variable-valve-timing V-6, like the one in
the sporty  &UR; GS300.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's new  &UR; Tundra pickup is due in May, posing the first
serious threat to domestic trucks. Toyota planned to call it the
T-150 until Ford fought it off, noting the alarming similarity to
the popular
 &UR; F-150.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nissan, beleaguered by disappointing sales, sadly is dropping
two of its sporty coupes, the Sentra-based  &UR; 200SX and the  &UR; 240SX.
On the other hand, the automaker reportedly is getting ready to
bring back the spiritual successor of the acclaimed 240Z. Let's
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Frontier, Nissan's compact pickup, gets an overdue V-6, at
least in the four-wheel-drive models, and an interesting four-door
model with a full crew-cab treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Infiniti brings back the entry-level  &UR; G20, a rebadged Primera
sold in Japan and Europe, and powered by a 140-horse four-cylinder
engine.
</P>
<P>
   At  &UR; Isuzu, watch for the radical  &UR; VehiCROSS sport-utility
vehicle, introduced two years ago as a concept car.  &UR; Amigo gets a
hardtop model, as Isuzu soldiers on with Honda's old Odyssey, which
it calls the  &UR; Oasis, instead of getting the new one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pontiac has a redesigned  &UR; Grand Am, whose aggressive styling
should be a major hit in high-school parking lots, and  &UR; Buick tunes
its  &UR; Century for better driveability. Could this be the end of
DynaRide?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buick is getting ready to cut the  &UR; Riviera out of the
herd. It's a fate this beautiful coupe doesn't deserve, although it
always was much more amusing to look at than it was to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Another radical-looking coupe makes its entry at  &UR; Mercury. A
hot, new
 &UR; Cougar replaces the stale old Cougar, introducing New Edge styling
to the up-market Ford division.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lincoln has put off introduction of its midsize  &UR; LS cars,
designed for a more youthful market, to work out some bugs. Watch
for these cars, designed on a platform shared with  &UR; Jaguar,
sometime in early 1999.
</P>

   &UR; Oldsmobile's Alero debuted this summer right in the teeth of
the GM labor strike, and few of them made it to showrooms until
recently. The new model is one of Olds' new breed of sporty,
refined cars. But when you don't feel like being sporty (begin
ital) or (end ital) refined, check out the video system built into
the  &UR; Silhouette minivan so that back-seat passengers (i.e., kids)
can watch movies or play videos instead of checking out the
scenery.

   Watch for this feature as an option on every minivan made within

   &UR; Volvo continues to shed its boxy image with the stylish new
 &UR; S80 sedan replacing the S90 sedan. The V90 wagon goes away. And
lest we forget, Volvo introduced the drop-dead gorgeous and quite
sporty  &UR; C70 convertible last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring,  &UR; Saab also introduced its  &UR; 9-3 compact, a slick and
nicely engineered replacement for the 900, following the  &UR; 9-5
replacement of the full-size 9000 last year. At  &UR; Volkswagen later
this year, watch for the new  &UR; Jetta with styling similar to the

   But putting it all in perspective,  &UR; Rolls-Royce and  &UR; Bentley
have rolled out a new set of steeply-high-end automobiles, but with
a couple of twists. Rolls' new $229,028  &UR; Silver Seraph and
Bentley's $215,546  &UR; Arnage sedan both are powered by BMW engines, a
V-12 for the Rolls and twin-turbo V-8 for the Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   And the venerable British automaker now is owned by Volkswagen.
The people's car of Germany. You couldn't make up stuff better than

RUSH TO BONDS PUSHES YIELDS BELOW 5 PERCENT FOR FIRST TIME IN 30
YEARS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Worries about containing the economic crisis abroad
and fears of financial problems at home prompted investors to sell
stocks and buy bonds Wednesday, pushing long-term government yields
below 5 percent for the first time in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 237.90 points, or 2.9
percent, to 7,842.62, but prices of Treasury securities rose,
pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to 4.97
percent, a rate that most of those working on Wall Street have
never seen in their professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   While the bond market has rallied spectacularly since the stock
market peaked in mid-July, the third quarter was the worst for the
Dow in eight years, down 12.4 percent for the three months.
</P>
<P>
   At the close Wednesday, the Dow was down 16 percent since its
peak and just 303 points from its 1998 low on Aug. 31. The only
good news was that the Dow overcame the odds last month.
Historically, September is the worst month for the Dow. But the Dow
rose 4 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the day after the Federal Reserve cut its
short-term interest rate target one-quarter point in an effort to
prevent the financial crisis abroad from derailing the American
economy, all the news seemed to point to things getting worse, not
better.
</P>
<P>
   More companies offered warnings that their earnings would come
in below forecasts, adding to the gloom that has analysts
predicting that earnings will decline in the third quarter for the
first time since the fourth quarter of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation about the collapse of another hedge fund
on the heels of last week's rescue of Long-Term Capital Management,
which needed an infusion of $3.6 billion from Wall Street's major
brokerage firms and banks to stay afloat. While the fund denied the
rumor, the fact that such rumors spread so easily these days is a
sign of negative investor sentiment. The rumor helped drag down
shares of banks and brokerage firms, which have been among the
hardest hit in the stock market decline since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   And even the news of declining interest rates was not all that
positive. ``The current rally is based on growing expectations of
negative economic developments,'' said Robert Barbera, chief
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. Robert DiClemente, the chief U.S.
economist at Salomon Smith Barney, added, ``This is not the way we
would have liked bonds to go through 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while lower interest rates will help home buyers
and consumers, the downward rush in government yields has left the
rates on other debt, like that of corporations, much higher as
investors have chosen the safety of government-backed bonds over
even those of companies with good credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   DiClemente said that overall credit was already tightening as
the cost of corporate borrowing had risen and banks were becoming
more adverse to risk. As the Fed cuts interest rates, he said,
``there is no assurance that financial conditions will be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in interest rates was apparently a key contributor to
the losses at Long-Term Capital, meaning that further declines
could mean harder times for it and other hedge funds. It is also
probably contributing to losses for many Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   All these signals lead many analysts to argue that the Fed rate
cut was not enough. ``I think this is a time when you have to take
pre-emptive action,'' said Nicholas Sargen, the global market
strategist for J.P. Morgan's private clients. In his view, it is
clear that the global economic crisis is now impinging enough on
the American economy to offset any inflationary threat from an
interest rate cut that encourages growth.
</P>
<P>
   The price on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite
direction from the yield, jumped 1 29/32, to 108 4/32. The yield of
4.97 percent was down from 5.09 percent on Tuesday and is off
three-quarters of a percentage point since the Dow hits its peak on
July 17. The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for
home mortgages, dropped to 4.41 percent, from 4.56 percent on
Tuesday, its lowest since the end of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
32.01 points, or 3 percent, to 1,017.01, while the Nasdaq index
dropped 40.21 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,693.84. The Russell 2000
index of smaller-company stocks dropped 2.21 points, or 0.6
percent, to 363.59.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see bond prices go up this much and stock prices go
down this much, the message is clear,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. ``Investors are
becoming much more worried about the economy and earnings than they
had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies issuing third-quarter earnings warnings
Wednesday or after the market closed on Tuesday were RJR Nabisco
Holdings, which cited declining sales in Russia and other republics
of the former Soviet Union; Arch Coal, the second-largest American
coal producer, which said maintenance costs were reducing profits,
and Healthsouth, which runs outpatient surgery clinics and said it
might have to revise its earnings forecast because of price
pressure from managed-care companies. These announcements came a
day after Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Viacom and CBS all fell because
of earnings concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were signals from Europe that earnings are
under pressure there. Benetton Group, the Italian clothing
retailer, said earnings fell 14 percent in the first half of the
year in part because of reduced sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   According to IBES International, which monitors analysts'
earnings forecasts, profits for the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will
fall by 2.2 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and brokerage stocks fell again Wednesday. Chase Manhattan
fell 1~, to 43[, and Citicorp fell 4}, to 93. Oil company stocks
also dropped along with computer stocks, including Microsoft and
Intel.

WASHINGTON UNRESPONSIVE IN FACE OF KOSOVO ATROCITIES

<P>
   BUDAPEST _ While observers and relief workers assess the grisly
murders of 16 villagers in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo,
Washington remains too consumed with its own scandal to focus on
the carnage, US legislators and watchers of the Balkans say.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Western diplomats and reporters viewed in the town
of Gornje Oberinje the gruesome remains of 16 ethnic Albanians, 10
of them women, children and elderly, who had been killed by
gunshots at close range or whose throats had been slashed. One man
had a knife lying carefully on his chest. One of the victims was a
pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   In another reported massacre, 14 civilians were killed Saturday
in the Drenica region. A survivor told Western reporters that men
in Serb police and Yugoslav army uniforms carried out the murders
after ambushing the people, who were hiding in a shack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs deny taking part in the Gornje Oberinje killings.
They also accuse the Western media of implicating the Serbs and in
doing so fueling support for a NATO air strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is true that 16 Albanians were killed in Gornji
Dubrinje, how do Western reporters know that the Serbs are
responsible for the massacres?'' asked the state-run Tanjug news
agency. ``Well, they don't. ...There are no direct witnesses.''
These fresh attacks on Albanians in Kosovo discovered this week
have increased international pressure for NATO air strikes against
Serbia, which has conducted a brutal crackdown on Albanians
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for the President to be able to act, he needs to have the
support of the Congress,'' Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will say today
in a speech before the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. ``If that support is not asked for - and given - because
of the growing chasm created by the impeachment debate, United
States leadership will be forfeited, and the Balkan tragedy will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are fixated on Clinton...and we're not doing
what the American people need us to do'' on Kosovo, added Rep.
Elliot Engel (D-N.Y.), co-chairman of the House Albanian Issues
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Non-governmental organizations seeking action on the Kosovo
crisis are also frustrated. ``It seems very much like the debate
over the Clinton issue is clearly taking attention away,'' lamented
Diane Paul of Human Rights Watch. ``There's a self-absorption going
on in Washington. There's a ship afloat without a captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has raged in Kosovo for the last seven months between
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population in the
province, and Serb forces. The Albanians demand independence for
Kosovo from Serbia, the core republic of what remains of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refuses to grant them
independence. Claiming to quash ``terrorist'' activity of the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the militia of the ethnic Albanians,
Serbian troops have killed Albanians and burned their villages.
Some Serbs living in Kosovo have also died.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has caused many hundreds of deaths and left
homeless an estimated 300,000 people, mostly Albanians. About
50,000 of them are hiding in the mountains -- a situation that
grows more precarious as the brutal Balkan winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council last week warned Milosevic
to stop the assaults of his troops in Kosovo or face a possible
NATO strike. But fighting has continued. Indeed, the situation in
Kosovo continues to follow a gruesomely familiar pattern. Violence
erupts, the West threatens air strikes, Milosevic promises to pull
back his forces and then breaks his promise.
</P>
<P>
   International observers and diplomats accuse Milosevic of
defying the UN Security Council resolution. Great Britain called
for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council today to
discuss the situation. And members of the Contact Group on Kosovo,
which includes the United States, France, Germany, Britian, Russia
and Italy, plan to meet Friday in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic had better start moving now,'' warned British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. Milosevic has insisted that he has
withdrawn his forces, but observers on the ground tell a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs ``have not pulled back at all. That's all just
political rhetoric,'' said Catholic Relief Services' Mark Davidson,
reached in the Kosovar capital of Pristina. Relief workers were
still sending up to 24 trucks of food and supplies to three
different locations several times a week, he said. ``We're a little
bit nervous, but it's not going to stop us.'' The West remains
sensitive to criticism that it waited too long before it got
involved in the war in Bosnia and as a result added unnecessarily
to the carnage there. But the crisis in Kosovo differs because,
unlike Bosnia, it is occurring within the sovereign borders of one
country.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kosovo is a province of Serbia, Milosevic notes that he
has the right to break an armed insurrection within his own
borders. But the severity of the crackdown - including the reported
killing of civilians - has tested the patience of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the current UN resolution is that ``there's no
`or else' to it,'' said Kurt Bassuener, associate director of the
Washington, D.C.-based Balkan Action Council. ``I don't think the
West has learned its lesson,'' he said in reference to Bosnia. Air
strikes, he added, ``would make a final political solution more
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Milosevic understands that we mean what we say, he won't
do anything,'' said Engel, who has gathered nine signatures so far
on a congressional petition calling for use of force by NATO in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is prepared for a possible assault. Outgoing German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl formally offered 14 German Tornado aircraft
for a potential NATO strike. But it remains unclear, say members of
Congress, if NATO must have UN Security Council support before it
acts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Christopher Hill, the United States ambassador to
Macedonia, has been trying to broker a political solution between
the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians. But that process has been
slowed by internal divisions among the Albanians as well as
stand-offs between Serbs and Albanians.

CLINTON PUTS OFF TRIP TO INDIA, PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Wednesday that President
Clinton had put off a visit to India and Pakistan, whose tests of
nuclear devices in May set off alarm around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has decided to postpone his visit to India and
Pakistan, which had been under review, which also means he will not
be making a separate visit to Bangladesh,'' Mike McCurry, the
president's spokesman, said at Wednesday's White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president would go ahead with plans to attend a
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in Malaysia in
mid-November. While he did not say what new countries might be put
on the itinerary now that India and Pakistan are off it, other
White House officials said South Korea and Japan might be added.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year ago, Clinton said he wanted to visit India and
Pakistan this fall ``if all goes well.''
</P>
<P>
   But in May, India exploded five nuclear devices. The United
States imposed sanctions on India and warned Pakistan, India's
longtime enemy, not to set off nuclear devices of its own. Pakistan
did carry out tests, incurring sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The severest sanctions against both countries have been lifted,
and last week India and Pakistan pledged before the United Nations
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would prohibit
nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   But details of the two countries' participation in the treaty
remain to be worked out. McCurry said Wednesday that the atmosphere
was still not conducive to a presidential visit, although he
expressed pleasure that India and Pakistan had announced resumption
of diplomatic talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the issues that we have been discussing with
both governments are complex and we believe will require more time
to be addressed to our mutual satisfaction,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton ``is still eager to make the visit when we have
had further significant progress with our respective security
concerns.''

VITAMINS DRAMATICALLY CUT COLON CANCER RISK: STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a multivitamin pill can reduce the long-term risk of
colon cancer by 75 percent, according to a new study of nearly
89,000 nurses.
</P>
<P>
   No one is yet advising Americans to take vitamins to prevent
colon cancer, but the study and other recent evidence suggest it
should be possible to slash the incidence of the disease, the third
most frequently diagnosed cancer among both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 132,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer
this year amd 56,500 will die from it, according to the National
Cancer Institute. It strikes men and women equally.
</P>
<P>
   Combining vitamin use with other preventive measures _ exercise,
healthy diet, and possibly regular use of aspirin or other
painkillers drugs _ could prevent 90 percent of colon cancer, said
Dr. Edward Giovannucci of Harvard University, lead author of the
study, which appears today in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't happen overnight. While the link between
multivitamin use and colon cancer reduction is the strongest yet
found, the full effect did not appear for 15 years. At the five-
and 10-year marks, multivitamin use was associated with about a 20
percent reduction in risk.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this delayed effect, Giovannucci hypothesized in
an interview, is that colon cancer arises from small growths called
polyps on the lining of the five-foot-long lower intestine, and
``most polyps take 10 or 15 years, or perhaps even longer, to
develop into a colon cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the research was conducted in women, researchers
believe the effect is likely to apply to men as well.
</P>
<P>
   The multivitamin ingredient responsible for curbing colon cancer
is folate, the Harvard group believes, on the basis of animal
research and data from the 21-year-old Nurses Health Study, which
is based at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Folate is essential for two important cellular processes _ the
synthesis of DNA during cell division, and the methylation of DNA,
which determines which genes are turned on or off. Animals
deficient in dietary folate are more likely to develop colon polyps
and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An abnormally low level of methylation marks the earliest stages
of colon cells' transformation from normal to malignant.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies suggested that folate supplements may also
reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood levels of the
amino acid homocysteine, which may be involved in the buildup of
sludgy deposits in artery walls.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nurses Study, other vitamins did not appear to reduce
colon cancer risk. Nor did nurses who ate generous amounts of
folate-rich foods _ largely fruits and vegetables _ have less colon
cancer. This suggests that dietary sources cannot provide enough
folate; the folate in multivitamin pills is in the form of folic
acid, which is more likely to be taken up by the body.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, multivitamin pills sold in the United States have
contained 400 micrograms of folate, an amount that Giovannucci said
is difficult to obtain from diet alone. A six-ounce glass of orange
juice contains about 80 micrograms of folate.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this year, bread, flour, and grain cereals have been
fortified with folic acid _ a federally mandated step to lower the
risk of birth defects involving the spinal cord. However, this
extra dietary folic acid, which may add about 100 micrograms to the
average American's daily intake, may not provide enough of the
nutrient to protect against colon cancer, according to the Nurses
Study results.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research, from the Nurses Study and others, suggested
that regular use of aspirin or other analgesics such as ibuprofen
conferred some protection against colon cancer, reducingrisk by 40
to 50 percent. However, such drugs also increase the risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding, and the large Physicians Health Study
found no colon cancer benefit from giving men small doses of
aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Giovannucci cautioned against relying on pills _ whether
vitamins or pain-killers _ to reduce colon cancer risk. About
one-quarter of Americans are believed to take daily multivitamins
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to suggest that lifestyle isn't important, that
you can just take a multivitamin supplement and aspirin,'' he said.
``Most of the advantages are in overall diet and physical activity.
This finding suggests that an extra boost of folate may be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Schatzkin of the National Cancer Institute agreed.
``I'm a little leery about putting the whole world on folate
supplements on the basis of this kind of evidence,'' he said,
noting that earlier studies involving a different nutrient with
suspected anticancer properties, beta-carotene, surprised
researchers by showing no benefit and perhaps some risk.

HOLY DAY MARRED BY WEST BANK VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Israel observed the Day of Atonement, the quiet
introspection of the Jewish holy day was shattered by sporadic
outbreaks of violence.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 Palestinians and 9 Israeli soldiers were wounded in
clashes in the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday afternoon just before the 24-hour period of
prayerful reflection began, a simmering dispute between Israeli
Arabs and Israeli forces once again erupted, resulting in injuries
to some 30 Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Military security was on high alert. Palestinian lands were
sealed off.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions flared only one day after a round of just-finished
peace talks in the White House in which President Bill Clinton was
unable to push Palestinian and Israeli leaders to break a 19-month
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes are certain to raise tensions as Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
prepare for a summit with Clinton toward the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The sides are deadlocked over a US initiative for an Israeli
withdrawal from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for
tougher Palestinian Authority action against Islamic militants who
have carried out a wave of terror attacks in Israel aimed at
derailing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In the deeply divided city of Hebron, 11 Palestinians and nine
Israeli soldiers were wounded in explosions and shooting just
before sundown Wednesday, which marks the end of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officials said the violence began with a grenade
attack on one of its patrols by a suspected Palestinian assailant.
Palestinian residents of Hebron blamed Jewish settlers for the
violence in the heart of the city close to one of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 Jewish settlers, among the most radical opponents to
the peace process, live alongside more than 100,000 Palestinians in
a city that is holy to Muslims and Jews as the burial place of the
biblical patriarch Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian eye witnesses of the violence told the Reuters news
agency that settlers had opened fire on the Palestinians with
automatic weapons and that one settler threw a bomb which blew up a
Palestinian taxi. Israeli army officials denied that settlers
attacked Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramallah, some 400 Palestinian protesters clashed with
Israeli troops after the funeral of an Islamic militant killed in a
mysterious car explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians marched from Bido village towards a nearby Jewish
settlement following the burial of Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, who
Palestinian security officials have confirmed was a militant member
of the Islamic organization Hamas. The armed wing of Hamas has
carried out a spate of suicide bombings that have killed scores of
Israelis, and it has recently vowed to continue its terror
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Zahran, 35, was killed and brothers Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid
were injured on Tuesday when explosives blew up in their car in an
industrial area near the Palestinian-ruled town of Ramallah.
Palestinian and Israeli security officials initially said that the
three men were believed to have been preparing a bomb for a fresh
terror attack inside Israel. But the dead man's family and Hamas
leadership have claimed that Israel was responsibile for the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Israeli Arab community of Umm el Fahm, tension erupted
Monday and continued Tuesday surrounding a dispute over land which
the Israeli military has sought to overtake for a military training
ground. The Israeli Arabs of the village say the military claim is
a ruse to seize the land to build a new Jewish suburb for the
nearby city of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   During the clashes, Arabs of the village bombarded Israeli
security forces with rocks. Israeli security forces opened fire
with what they call rubber bullets, but which are actually
plastic-coated, steel pellets, injuring some 30 Arab protesters.

FED MOVE DOES LITTLE FOR STOCKS; DOW FALLS 237 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ US stocks wrapped up their worst three-month quarter
of the decade Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average
falling 237 points despite a Federal Reserve interest rate cut that
would normally have buoyed investors' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The stock slide was accompanied by a dramatic runup in the price
of US bonds, a traditional haven in troubled times, that drove
yields on government debt below 5 percent for the first time in
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The combination was hardly what investors or economic
policymakers had been hoping for, and suggested that further
financial turmoil may be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing keeping stock is market afloat is interest
rates and, going forward, it's hard to see how they're going to
help that much,'' said Matthew Ruane, an equity trader with Gerard
Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in New Yok.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming apparent to people that growth expectations for
equities are too high, and the Fed's rate cut was not enough to
change that,' said Richard O. Lodewick, research director for
Boston Partners Asset Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bleak financial news, the US economy continued to
demonstrate substantial strength as it enters its eighth year of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released Wednesday showed that although sales of new
single-family houses fell in August for the second month running,
they still continued at a very respectable pace of 838,000 units a
year. Separately, the index of leading economic indicators remained
unchanged in August after rising in July, suggesting that the
economy will continue growing ``through at least early 1999,'
according to the Conference Board, a New York-based business
research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most statistics are depicting an economy that is still quite
healthy,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief econoist of Prudential
Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the financial front, there was evidence of trends that
could help stablize the markets. Individual investors appeared to
resume their romance with stock mutual funds in September after
yanking a record $11.2 billion during August.
</P>
<P>
   Stock funds took in an estimated $19.3 billion in September,
close to twice what they lost through withdrawals in August,
according to a Bloomberg report that cites Trimtabs.com, a
fund-flow tracking firm. The August withdrawals were the largest
since the 1987 stock crash.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors' return to stocks was not enough to lift
the market Wednesday. The Dow slumped 237.9 points, or 2.94
percent, to close at 7842.62, its most significant decline in
almost three weeks. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index declined 32.01,
or 3.05 percent, to close at 1017.01, and the Nasdaq Composite
Index was down 40.21 points to 1693.84.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the market's decline was at least in part
traceable to disappointment with the Fed's decision Tuesday to
shave only one quarter of a percentage point from the federal funds
rate, the rate at which banks make short-term loans to each other.
Investment professionals had hoped for a half-point reduction. The
rate cut was the first by the central bank since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that what was really behind Wednesday's market
fall was a broad set of fears that are not likely to be erased
quickly. Among them: worries about Brazil where an exodus of cash
and an uncertain outcome to Sunday's election are roiling markets;
continued concern about the stability of banks and other financial
institutions in the wake of the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management L.P. that was rescued last wek by a Fed-orchestrated
injection of private capital, and continued dismay over corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The investment world is in the midst of pre-announcement season,
a nasty period when companies break the news that their financial
performance may not be quite as wonderful as they had previously
let on. Among those delivering disappointments Wednesday were
Northern Telecome Ltd, North America's second largest phone
equipment maker, and RJR Nabisco, the cigarette and cracker
company.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms blamed overseas sales declins for the problem, both
were punished by invstors, who dumped shares of their stocks and
those of related companies. Shares of Northern Telecom dropped 3
5/8 to 32 1/4. Those of Lucent Technologies Inc., which said it is
seeing no slump in its business, fell an even steeper 5 1/4 to 69
1/4. RJR shares declined 1 9/16 to 25 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-month quarter that ended Wednesday, the Dow
shed 1,105 points or 12 percent. The S&AMP;P slid 10 percent and the
Nasdaq declined 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Major market measures reached record highs in mid-July before
beginning a steep six-week tumble that at one point erased 19
percent from the Dow's value. By Wednesday, the 30 stocks in the
Dow were essentially flat for the year, while the S&AMP;P and Nasdaq
were up 4.8 percent and 7.86 percent respectively. Those
performances were the stock indexes' worst since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts said that the indexes' records were not reflective
of the broader market, where the average stock is now 20 percent or
more off it high. ``For the vast majority of stocks, we are in a
bear market,'' said Lodewick.

MODEL YEAR '99 IS EVOLUTIONARY  
 (RESENDING TO DELETE BOLDFACE)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Model year 1999 is an evolutionary one for the world's
automakers, with a tuck here, a tweak there, and a couple of face
lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few models are brand new for '99, plus the re-entries of
a couple of old names, as the manufacturers gear up for the new
millennium. Corvette adds a model, Oldsmobile adds a compact,
Toyota adds a coupe, Buick loses a coupe, and Infiniti resurrects
its entry-level car.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, trucks are huge, as more and more erstwhile car buyers
switch to the beefy, the brawny and the fully loaded. Jumping on
the four-wheel-drive bandwagon is Cadillac, which introduces its
first-ever truck, the luxurious Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are also big news for Chevrolet, GMC, Ford and Toyota,
with the GM siblings trotting out upgraded Silverado and Sierra
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The GM pickups are playing catch-up with Ford's highly regarded
F-series trucks, updated two years ago and still by far the
bestselling vehicle in the United States. And both companies are
trying to fend off the growing popularity of the macho Dodge Ram
and, soon, a full-size V-8 pickup from Toyota, the Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, gentler side of the truck fence are the new Suzuki
Vitara/Chevy Tracker models, all new for '99 despite the continued
Tracker name. Suzuki gets the V-6-powered Grand Vitara (sounds like
a lodge leader) with a 140-horsepower V-6. The Tracker has to wait
until next year to be Grand.
</P>
<P>
   And Kia, though beset by financial woes and other heartbreak,
keeps smiling with a soft-top version of its cute-as-a-bug
Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade is possibly the world's largest stopgap, hastily
conceived while Caddy prepares its very own sport-utility vehicle.
Caddy makes the end run after watching the Lincoln dealers down the
block eating everybody's lunch with the fast-selling Navigator. Not
even to mention Mercedes-Benz's ML320.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the $45,000 Escalade trundles out as a revised GMC
Yukon Denali with a Cadillac grille, softer suspension and an even
plusher interior. Caddy dealers are rubbing their hands with glee.
At least, they should be. This one is the mother of all
no-brainers.
</P>
<P>
   The summer's General Motors labor strike slowed introduction of
the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups at a critical time, but,
word is, they're worth waiting for. Styling is slightly revised,
with the notable changes underneath: new engines, brakes and
suspension systems that have improved driveability and garnered
much critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Ford pickups get four doors on their Club Cab models, and the
F-series family is joined by a new set of muscle twins, Hans and
Frans. No, wait, it's really the F-250/F-350 Super Duty pickups,
which are available with 265-horse V-10 engines or monster diesels
packing 400 pound-feet of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Grrrr.
</P>
<P>
   But let's talk about some fun stuff. Let's talk about the New
Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's darling continues as a hot property for Volkswagen,
with widespread price gouging and much unfulfilled desire. For '99,
the Beetle goes uptown with an optional 150-horsepower,
turbocharged four, borrowed from the Passat, and a glass sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   Still no word on a convertible Beetle. Rats!
</P>
<P>
   The Mazda Miata continues to tread its retro path with a
refurbishing that includes a handsome new front end, sleeker body
shape, new interior, more powerful engine and improved suspension.
Still, it keeps the faith as an affordable, enjoyable little sports
car.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Mustang celebrates its 35th year (where (begin ital) has
(end ital) the time gone) with a restyling that recaptures many of
the cues of the original, including deeply scooped flanks, ersatz
hood scoop, and taillight design. Both V-6 and V-8 power is up. In
the hot Cobra version, Mustang gets an independent rear suspension
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of power, the Corvette hardtop joins the hatchback and
convertible with less weight and a lower price. The
performance-oriented hardtop is offered only with a six-speed
manual. As well it should.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Chrysler, there's the new and notable 300M sedan, an
athletic version of cab-forward design, and its longer, plusher
sibling, the LHS. The Plymouth Prowler, a unique hot-rod roadster
and every car lover's dream machine, also gets the powerful 253
horsepower V-6 from the 300M and LHS.
</P>
<P>
   The hyper Dodge Viper gets some wheel and interior options, and
continues being supercool. Chrysler stylists continue to hit as
many home runs as McGwire and Sosa put together.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee receives a complete makeover, with a
body that's slicker and more refined but still recognizable, a new
engine, and enhanced off-highway abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's new partner, Mercedes-Benz, continues to reinvent
itself with more desirable and technologically advanced machines,
such as the fine and refined CLK320 Cabriolet and the V-8-powered
version of its sport ute, the ML430.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Mercedes docket is a five-speed manual version of
its supercharged, drop-top sports car, the SLK, which corrects the
error of introducing the little terror with an automatic-only in
the first place. Watch sales soar.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's new 323i and 328 sedans appeared over the summer to
replace the 3-series cars. But the real news at BMW is the ugly
duckling that turns into a beautiful swan as soon as you get behind
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 coupe and hotter M-coupe might look ungainly to some
eyes, but they do have the advantages of being stiffer and quieter
than the roadster versions, and a few hundred dollars cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Audi introduced its all-wheel-drive Avant luxury wagon in June,
and the smaller A4 wagon adds a 1.8-liter turbo engine. Soon to
arrive is the exotic TT sports coupe with its bluntly purposeful
styling and aggressive manners, going up against the likes of the
Porsche Boxster, Mercedes SLK, BMW Z3 and the less-pricey Miata.
</P>
<P>
   Acura introduces a new TL, its midlevel car, that's bigger and
more powerful, and the big RL gets restyled with a suspension
upgrade and side-impact air bags. Honda joins the mainstream with
its new Odyssey minivan, restyled in the mode of the Chrysler
minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi Gallant swims upstream, bigger in all dimensions,
and touting a 195-horse V-6 that puts it on a par with costlier
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is coming out with a swoopy coupe version of its faithful
Camry, and its Sienna minivan gets a fourth door. Lexus powers up
its ES300 with a 210-horse, variable-valve-timing V-6, like the one
in the sporty GS300.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's new Tundra pickup is due in May, posing the first
serious threat to domestic trucks. Toyota planned to call it the
T-150 until Ford fought it off, noting the alarming similarity to
the popular F-150.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, beleaguered by disappointing sales, sadly is dropping
two of its sporty coupes, the Sentra-based 200SX and the 240SX. On
the other hand, the automaker reportedly is getting ready to bring
back the spiritual successor of the acclaimed 240Z. Let's hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier, Nissan's compact pickup, gets an overdue V-6, at
least in the four-wheel-drive models, and an interesting four-door
model with a full crew-cab treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti brings back the entry-level G20, a rebadged Primera
sold in Japan and Europe, and powered by a 140-horse four-cylinder
engine.
</P>
<P>
   At Isuzu, watch for the radical VehiCROSS sport-utility vehicle,
introduced two years ago as a concept car. Amigo gets a hardtop
model, as Isuzu soldiers on with Honda's old Odyssey, which it
calls the Oasis, instead of getting the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac has a redesigned Grand Am, whose aggressive styling
should be a major hit in high-school parking lots, and Buick tunes
its Century for better driveability. Could this be the end of
DynaRide?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buick is getting ready to cut the Riviera out of the
herd. It's a fate this beautiful coupe doesn't deserve, although it
always was much more amusing to look at than it was to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Another radical-looking coupe makes its entry at Mercury. A hot,
new Cougar replaces the stale old Cougar, introducing New Edge
styling to the up-market Ford division.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln has put off introduction of its midsize LS cars,
designed for a more youthful market, to work out some bugs. Watch
for these cars, designed on a platform shared with Jaguar, sometime
in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile's Alero debuted this summer right in the teeth of the
GM labor strike, and few of them made it to showrooms until
recently. The new model is one of Olds' new breed of sporty,
refined cars. But when you don't feel like being sporty (begin
ital) or (end ital) refined, check out the video system built into
the Silhouette minivan so that back-seat passengers (i.e., kids)
can watch movies or play videos instead of checking out the
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for this feature as an option on every minivan made within
a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo continues to shed its boxy image with the stylish new S80
sedan replacing the S90 sedan. The V90 wagon goes away. And lest we
forget, Volvo introduced the drop-dead gorgeous and quite sporty
C70 convertible last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Saab also introduced its 9-3 compact, a slick and
nicely engineered replacement for the 900, following the 9-5
replacement of the full-size 9000 last year. At Volkswagen later
this year, watch for the new Jetta with styling similar to the
Passat's. A new generation of the Golf is to arrive after the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   But putting it all in perspective, Rolls-Royce and Bentley have
rolled out a new set of steeply-high-end automobiles, but with a
couple of twists. Rolls' new $229,028 Silver Seraph and Bentley's
$215,546 Arnage sedan both are powered by BMW engines, a V-12 for
the Rolls and twin-turbo V-8 for the Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   And the venerable British automaker now is owned by Volkswagen.
The people's car of Germany. You couldn't make up stuff better than
this. &QL;

CHOICE OF PITCHING NOW PROBLEMATICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There was a feeling of inevitability about the
series when all hell broke loose in the top of the first inning. On
the heels of their 11-3 win in the opener, the Red Sox had a 2-0
lead in Game 2 of their best-of-five American League Division
Series and the Indians were unraveling in front of Baseball
America. Boston was flexing its muscle, and you couldn't find
anyone in Cleveland who believed in the hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe looked like the Red Sox, circa 1990, when Roger
Clemens thought he was a Ninja Turtle and got tossed from a playoff
game in the second inning. This time we had Cleveland manager Mike
Hargrove and starter Dwight Gooden getting the heave from
rabbit-eared/arrogant/gutless plate umpire Joe Brinkman before the
game was two outs old.
</P>
<P>
   The Jake looked like the Paradise Club on Everclear Night, and
for sure, the Red Sox were going to embarrass Cleveland in three
tidy games en route to a date of destiny with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But then it all went the other way. The veteran Tribe awoke and
served Tim Wakefield and Red Sox Nation a 9-5 knuckle sandwich. So
now the series is tied, 1-1, and the Sox face the possibility that
their season could end with Pete Schourek on the mound at Fenway
Park Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen will start for the Red Sox Friday, and he
certainly deserves the nod. Saberhagen won the most important game
for the Red Sox this season when he stopped the bleeding in New
York in May. He is a big-game pitcher and this season wrote one of
the great comeback stories of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Sox have trouble hitting Charles Nagy? What if
Boston loses Game 3? The Sox don't want to talk about the
distasteful possibility, and it makes sense to keep quiet until
they have to make a decision. Bu if things go wrong Friday, Boston
has to pitch Pedro Martinez Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation calls for Saberhagen Friday, lefthander Schourek
Saturday, and ace Martinez in Game 5, if necessary. If Boston wins
Friday, it makes sense to stay in turn. That would set up Pedro for
either Game 5 Sunday (with his regular four days of rest) or Game 1
of the AL Championship Series Tuesday with six days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Sox lose Friday? Can they take a chance on
losing this series in four games with Pedro pitching only once?
</P>
<P>
   No way. The team has committed $75 million to Martinez, and he
showed Tuesday that he has great command over the Indians. Game 1
was over by 4 p.m., which means Pedro actually would be working
with 3 1/2 days of rest if he pitched Saturday night. The Sox would
have to come back with the ace, then empty the gun Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any decision,'' manager Jimy Williams
said when asked about changing the rotation if the Sox go down,
2-1. ``I don't think now is the right time to do anything like
that. I think we are going to stay with our rotation as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan scoffed at any suggestion of
changing the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going on what is planned out,'' said Kerrigan.
``It's what we've planned all year and for the last six weeks. We
don't deal with hypotheticals. We can bring Wakefield back in the
bullpen. Right now we're just thinking about Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that (changing the rotation) is for people who
panic, who don't have a program, who don't have a plan. We can't be
shifting people around when they are used to pitching every fifth
day. It doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield is the X factor. Game 2 was his shortest outing of the
year. He threw only 42 pitches and is capable of pitching every
other day under almost any conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pitch out of the bullpen, I can start Friday, I can
start (Friday) if they want me to,'' he said. ``I let my team down
today. I feel like I didn't even pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pedro starts and wins Game 4, Wakefield probably would get
the nod in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical plan would be to bring Wakefield back Friday,
pitch Saberhagen with an extra day of rest in Game 4, and have
Pedro ready for Game 5. That would give Boston its top three
starters in the final three games. But it would not be fair to
Saberhagen, who is programmed to pitch Friday. Saberhagen wouldn't
entertain any goofy theories about changing the rotation, and who
can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox win Game 3, none of the above matters. But if the
Sox lose Friday, they can't start Schourek (1-3, 4.30) in what
would be the biggest game of the year Saturday. It would have to be
Pedro.

BUSH AGREES TO DEBATE IN EL PASO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday he
would debate Democratic opponent Garry Mauro, who has been
demanding such a meeting for months.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates will meet for an hour-long evening debate in
El Paso on Oct. 16, less than three weeks before the election. It
will be their only debate, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With a powerful lead in the polls, Bush had put off the debate
question for much of the campaign, but he said Wednesday he agreed
to it because he believes it's the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was pleased Bush agreed to the face-off, but he complained
the meeting would take place in far West Texas on a Friday night
when many people would be at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have suggested that, as a result of the polls, I
shouldn't do it. I disagree,'' said Bush, who is some 50 percentage
points ahead of Mauro in most surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes sense for a sitting governor to debate,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has said almost from the start he wanted to debate Bush _
any time, any place. But he expressed disappointment Wednesday
about the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has little to lose because I'll carry El Paso, and it's on
a different time zone in a city a long, long way away and so not
many people will see it,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush said the sponsors picked the time, and he noted
that his 1994 debate against then-Gov. Ann Richards was held on a
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   For Mauro, the debate is an opportunity for the cash-strapped
candidate to get some exposure on television and take a crack at
upstaging his well-funded and popular opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gets to say he didn't duck a debate and has the chance to
score points with the Hispanic community, which traditionally votes
for Democrats. But Bush denied he accepted the El Paso debate in
search of Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to attract the Hispanic vote is through a good
message. The other way to attract the Hispanic vote is to perform
in office,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will be broadcast from the studios of the public
television station at the University of Texas at El Paso. It will
be up to individual stations around Texas whether to broadcast it
live, tape it for another time or not air it at all.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso, a city whose residents sometimes feel forgotten by the
rest of Texas, suddenly has found itself the center of considerable
attention this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has visited the city often as governor, and he made a stop
there the day he formally announced his re-election campaign. Also,
the candidates for lieutenant governor held their only debate there
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Paso has become the symbolic city for Bush and his ability
to convert Hispanic voters to the Republican column,'' said Austin
political consultant Bill Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush is the one that gains on this. Bush gets to say
`I can debate, big deal. Let's go do it, and I'll do it in Spanish
and I'll do it in a city that's historically Democratic,''' said
Miller, who has worked both sides of the political aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauro gets a crack head-on at Bush. There's a lot to be said
for that. That's all you can really ask for in this business is an
opportunity,'' he added.

WEIRD WINS FOR INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In sports, weird can be good, and injustice can be
very, very good.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the first inning Wednesday was certifiably weird. A
manager ejected three pitches into the game _ that's weird. The
starting pitcher ejected for saying something about a controversial
safe call at the plate one batter later _ that's weird. Oh, moaned
the Cleveland Indians, the absolute injustice of it all.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what. All this weird injustice actually led directly
to a 9-5 victory over the Red Sox for the Indians, and if you don't
believe it, just ask them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it made the difference in the ballgame,'' declared
shortstop Omar Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely fired everybody up,'' agreed first baseman Jim
Thome. ``It all worked to our benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the byproduct of it was it turned up our intensity and
it turned our fans' intensity up,'' pointed out manager Mike
Hargrove, who was forced to watch the game on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a playoff situation, you're definitely higher than a kite,
anyway,'' confirmed coach Jeff Newman, who took over the helm after
plate umpire Joe Brinkman gave Hargrove the old heave-ho. ``But
what it did was direct our focus a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we as a team felt, `We've just got to win today,'''
summarized designated hitter David Justice, who had five ferocious
rips at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you refuse to believe that emotion can play a
significant role in the performance of a baseball team, consider
the unarguable fact that the ejection of Doc Gooden and the arrival
of Dave Burba was a very positive happening for the Indians. We
will never know what kind of afternoon Gooden would have had if he
had gotten past the first four batters, but we do know that Mr.
Burba came in to give the Indians 5 1/3 solid innings before
exiting in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   You've undoubtedly seen it, heard about it, or read about it
elsewhere, but here is one more capsule version of what happened in
that bizarre Red Sox first. Gooden became upset with Brinkman's
version of the strike zone en route to a game-opening base on
balls. After the third pitch, Hargrove came out _ arguing balls and
strikes is a no-no _ and that proved to be the end of his day.
Three batters later, with Lewis on second, John Valentin on first,
and one away, Nomar Garciaparra hit one high off the left-field
wall, missing a three-run homer by a foot or less and winding up
with a double. Lewis scored, of course, but Valentin was thrown out
at the plate on a 7-6-2 relay _ except he wasn't. Though Valentin
was quite clearly out, Brinkman called him safe. Gooden, backing up
the plate and thus in a good viewing position, said something to
Brinkman (an ``expletive,'' according to the arbiter) and was
tossed. Enter Burba, with unlimited warmups.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians felt put upon. The Indians felt abused. The Indians
felt trashed. Suddenly, it was Popeye downing the spinach and
growling, ``That's all I can stands; I can't stands no more!''
</P>
<P>
   Burba got Mike Stanley (who had roughed him up for a two-homer
game earlier this season) on a ground out, and he fanned Troy
O'Leary. That stopped the bleeding. The Tribe got one run back in
the first and five more in the second. Tim Wakefield lasted just 1
1/3 innings, which brings up another possible Cleveland benefit
from all the hoo-ha in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wakefield had to wait an extra 20 or 30 minutes to pitch after
he was warmed up,'' pointed out Thome. ``That might have helped us,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield was replaced by John Wasdin. He got Vizquel easily
enough, but Justice hit Wasdin's first pitch for a three-run homer.
That pretty much settled things right there.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was a very lethal man in this one. He had a sacrifice
fly in the first, the three-run homer in the second, and a long
double in the sixth. Mike Benjamin robbed him of a hit in the
fourth and Justice lined viciously to Mo Vaughn in the eighth. He
was the living definition of intensity at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to explain,'' Justice said. ``You're already
intense. You know it's an important game. You know you don't want
to go down, 0 and 2. But when something like that happens, it's
like you're backed into a corner. I'm not saying the umpires are
actually against you, but you feel like the only way to win is to
come out fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff sparked us up,'' said Vizquel. ``It's like, `Hey,
we've got to score some runs or else we're gonna be in trouble.' It
got everybody going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that it made us direct our focus,'' explained Newman.
``Everyone started thinking about `what can I do to help us?' It
made us more competitive. But it wasn't as if we carried over a
vendetta against the umpires after the first inning. That part
didn't carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little upset about the situation and we went out
there with a different level of concentration,'' said catcher Sandy
Alomar. ``We were very selective. We didn't swing at bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice, the Indians need this approach if they are
going to win the series. ``We needed this game today,'' he said,
``and it was a tough game. Against Boston, you've got to play the
full nine innings because they keep coming. You've got no choice
against Boston. If you want to win, you've got to score runs. Jimy
Williams keeps that team coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just baseball. How many times have we seen it in
basketball? The coach or the star player gets tossed, and the team
is aroused. In real life, weird is weird and bad is bad, no
exceptions. But sports aren't real life. The ordinary rules don't
apply, and that is why this best-of-five American League Division
Series is now tied at one game apiece.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Thirteen Israeli soldiers and 11 Palestinian
passers-by were wounded Wednesday when a Palestinian hurled
grenades at an Israeli patrol post in the heart of the divided city
of Hebron, a flash point for violent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the attack took place at 4:30 p.m., close to
a Jewish settler enclave that borders on the casbah, the
Palestinian open-air market, in the Israeli-controlled sector.
Soldiers pursued the suspect, they said, shooting and wounding him
in the leg before he escaped into Palestinian territory, where the
Palestinian police were in charge of apprehending him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand widespread searches to find those responsible,''
Yitzhak Eitan, the Israeli commander for the West Bank, said at a
briefing Wednesday night. ``We demand the Palestinians take
responsibility for what happened here, and to prevent attacks on
Israeli targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebron, a city of 120,000, has been a tinderbox since it was
divided in early 1997 by the last peace agreement signed by the
Israelis and the Palestinians. Israel remains in control of 20
percent of the city, where some 450 Jewish settlers live in armed
compounds, protected by a recently beefed up force of about 2,000
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions run at a constant high, with routine sniper fire and
rock-throwing between the two sides, who live so close together
that the pungent smell of Arab spices wafts through the barbed wire
into the settlers' apartments. But tensions flared with the killing
of a rabbi in late August, after which the settlers raged through
the casbah, overturning produce stands. Just Monday, a Jewish
tourist was shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron was the last city turned over to even partial Palestinian
control as peace talks have been stalled for more than a year and a
half. But in Washington this week, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat agreed to the
essentials of a pact whereby Israel would withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank, if the Palestinians act to insure Israeli
security and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers, who oppose the withdrawal, seized on the attack _
and the suspects' escape into Palestinian territory _ as evidence
that their opposition is warranted. ``That 13 percent is just
another 13 percent of land for them to prepare their attacks and
run back into, as we saw today,'' said David Wilder, a spokesman
for the settlers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, too, linked Wednesday's attack to the
peace talks, saying it could give Netanyahu a last-minute excuse to
walk away from the negotiations, which are supposed to culminate in
a three-way summit meeting in Washington in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever was behind this incident was obviously trying to
thwart the peace agreement,'' Jibril Rajoub, chief of preventive
security in the West Bank, said in an interview. ``If the one who
was behind it was a Palestinian, then it is a free service for
Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub said he was investigating the attack, which he denounced.
``We were informed by Israelis that the one who was behind it
escaped to our areas,'' he said. ``We are checking. But we have no
evidence regarding this accusation.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, Palestinian security officials announced that
they had raided and dismantled a terrorist explosives laboratory in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   After the grenade attack, the Israeli Army imposed a curfew on
Palestinian residents. Jewish settlers were briefly held at the
Cave of the Patriarchs _ believed to be the burial place of the
biblical Abraham _ after they finished the prayers of the Yom
Kippur holiday, then were allowed to move freely through the city
center.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian witnesses asserted that the incident happened
differently, and that Jewish settlers played a role in the
violence. After visiting the wounded, a Palestinian Authority
official, Ali Kawasmeh, said some believed that a settler had
thrown something into a Palestinian jitney that exploded during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Army officials were skeptical, saying that one of
the two grenades aimed at the patrol post had rolled under the
jitney instead. And Palestinian security officials discounted their
version, too.

LOS ANGELES PAID ALMOST $24 MILLION FOR WRONGFUL ARRESTS AT BRIDAL
SHOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County has paid nearly $24 million to
36 people who were found to have been wrongly arrested and in some
cases beaten by sheriff's deputies at a bridal shower in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a jury found that the county sheriff's deputies had
used excessive force and violated the civil rights of the party
guests, most of whom were Samoan-Americans. That verdict was upheld
in July by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, David Dole received a check from
his lawyer for the largest portion of the award, $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet victory,'' said Dole, who was kicked and
beaten about the head and body. He was hospitalized and said he
suffered brain damage and broken bones. The other awards ranged
down to $57,000.
</P>
<P>
   Vina Camper, coordinator for Police Watch, a Los Angeles group
that tracks police misconduct, said the civil rights judgment was
the largest ever returned by a jury against law enforcement in
California. The City of Los Angeles settled the Rodney King beating
case for $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the deputies at the party, made by a neighbor and
shown repeatedly on local television, proved to be crucial evidence
in the trial. It showed dozens of deputies swinging batons, kicking
and hitting the partygoers, who appeared to be offering little
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The victims said the officers had yelled racial slurs at them
during the incident, like ``pineapple head'' and ``coconut head.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department said the deputies had responded to a
call about a street fight in Cerritos, south of Los Angeles, the
night of Feb. 11, 1989. Dozens of deputies, who arrived wearing
riot gear, said that they found a party that was out of hand and
that when they tried to break it up, the guests threw rocks and
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the incident was over, several of the men and women
arrested were bruised and at least one, in addition to Dole,
suffered a broken bone. The sheriff's department said several
deputies had been injured. The charges against those arrested
included assault with a deadly weapon and rioting.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were eventually dropped or dismissed. Those arrested
then filed a civil suit charging the sheriff's department with
false arrest and using excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   The jury eventually awarded the plaintiffs, primarily members of
the Dole and Paopao families, $15.9 million. That amount grew to
nearly $24 million with interest.
</P>
<P>
   Garo Mardirossian, the victims' lawyer, said he was still
waiting for the sheriff's department to discipline the deputies
involved in the melee. &QL;

   DISNEY-HIGH-CULTURE (Burbank, Calif.) _ Like Coke or McDonald's,
the Disney name and brand is so implanted in the culture of the
nation and the world that to say the word is to evoke a wholly
defined universe _ in this case Disney's familiar panoply of antic,
animated icons and competent, comforting family entertainment. To
some they add up to imaginative, benign, pop culture marvels. To
others, they're just superficial cultural junk. ut the storyboard
outside Michael D. Eisner's office is a window onto another side of
the Mouse. Seemingly unnoticed, under Eisner's watch, Disney has
become a purveyor of what can only be described as high culture. By

   SLAM-FILM (Undated) _ Marc Levin's feature film ``Slam'' is a
vivid marriage of ideas usually seen as contradictions: documentary
and fiction, action and poetry, black and white. ``Slam,'' which
opens here on Friday after screening in the New York Film Festival,
is the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua
(Saul Williams) who is imprisoned on a petty drug charge but who
manages to establish his identity and his voice within the
maelstrom of a Washington, D.C. jail. By Laura Winters. (Moved).

   CELEBRATION-TOWN (Celebration, Fla.) _ There are similarities
between the fictional movie town and this post-neotraditional town
built by those masters of make-believe, the Walt Disney Co. Both
are pretty and orderly, populated by smiling, waving residents and
blessed by sunny skies and warm temperatures. And like the movie
town, Celebration has its own unique rules and designs for social
engineering. But, after living here for 15 months, my family can
testify that Celebration is a real place, with its own attributes
and its own problems. Indeed, the town represents an ambitious,
real-life attempt by Disney to employ architecture and urban design
to revive the sense of community and place that Americans tell
pollsters are missing in traditional suburbs. By Douglas Frantz.

   IMPOSTORS-FILM (New York) _ Fox Searchlight on Friday released
``The Impostors,'' an ebullient slapstick comedy about two
down-at-heels actors who stow away on a luxury liner that Stanley
Tucci wrote, directed, produced and stars in with Oliver Platt.
This is his sophomore effort, following ``Big Night,'' the surprise

   KUDELKA-DANCE (Undated) _ James Kudelka walked through the

Broadway in Manhattan as if he belonged there. Although he became
artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada in 1996, his
many years as a freelance choreographer make him feel at home with

   NEW-MUSIC (Undated) _ I have a bad case of the post-avant-garde

Job, he has somehow endured for two decades and 14 records. By Neal

   MOTHER-NATURE'S-RADIO (Undated) _ To hear Mother Nature's radio,
one must travel to an area free of electronic interference (the
desert, the jungle, Siberia, Central Park) with a specially made
very-low-frequency radio receiver tuned below the AM and FM bands.
And that is what a growing number of hobbyists have been doing over
the last few years, attracted not just by the sweet sounds and the
possibility of making discoveries in this bizarre branch of plasma
physics but also by the notion that to hear nature you must immerse
yourself in nature. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).

<P>
   CAGE-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Sonatas and Interludes are either the
sins of John Cage's youth or else the last of his important music.
It depends on what you think music is, and Cage had some different
ideas about that. The longest of these 20 pieces is a little over
four minutes, the shortest not quite two. What made them different
from the other music being written in 1948 was the medium: the
prepared piano, in which keyboard sound is transformed by strategic
insertions of foreign objects onto or between the piano strings.
Attached to a new version of the Sonatas and Interludes, played by
Aleck Karis and recorded by Bridge, is Cage himself in 1982,
reading a paper called ``Composition in Retrospect,'' which he
wrote the year before. ``The music is always going on,'' he says
several times. ``It is we who turn away from it.'' By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).

   ROCK-LESSONS (Undated) _ What life lessons, if any, has rock
handed down to future generations from its boundary-smashing
heyday? In ``That Says It All,'' a catchy Bob Dylan-style ballad on
his exquisite second album, ``Humming,'' the singer-songwriter
Duncan Sheik, 28, offers a short list of resonant catch phrases
slung by 1960s rock gods who are now either graying or dead. By

   STERBAK-ART (Montreal) _ The conceptual sculpture of the
Canadian-based artist Jana Sterbak has inspired reams of humorless,
abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered
metaphors unturned. Yet Ms. Sterbak's work _ seductive, intensely
physical and edged with dark absurdity _ delivers a mind-body
frisson unknowable by intellect alone. In art circles in the United
States, she is perhaps best known for what could be called a piece
of wearable art. ``Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorexic,''
from 1987, is an actual shift of raw, sewn-together flank steak,
which, when fresh, was modeled (but not by the artist) and then
left to hang, rank and wizening, in a gallery. A wider view of Ms.
Sterbak's nuanced provocations will be furnished in a mid-career
survey of her work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago,
from Saturday through Feb. 21. By Ann Wilson LLoyd. (Moved).

   DISNEY-PARKS-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ It's easy to grant that
Disney's theme parks are full of strange creations, but do they

Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, makes an affirmative case.
The work on view may seldom rise to the level of great poetry, but
it does fulfill the Greek idea of poetics as the making of a

cataloguing them for the last several years and has just published
the second volume of a planned trilogy, ``Cereal Boxes and Prizes:
1960s'' (Flake World Publishing). He is also exploring the idea of

 &HT;    Quorum probe could impact its hospitals in Georgia
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fate of Quorum Health Group, whose shares have
plummeted this week on news of a looming federal lawsuit, may
produce some fallout in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Brentwood, Tenn.-based company manages 17 hospitals in
Georgia, and has two others participating in a joint venture in
Macon with Columbia/HCA Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Quorum, which overall owns 18 for-profit hospitals and manages
236 others, almost all of them nonprofits, disclosed this week the
federal government was likely to file suit over company Medicare
billing records.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year probe was prompted by a ``whistle-blower'' _ a
former employee of an unidentified hospital Quorum managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has informed us they will commence litigation
Oct. 5th,'' said spokeswoman Shea Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is under seal until then, she said. Quorum,
the largest manager of nonprofit hospitals in the United States,
said it's cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   News of the litigation drove Quorum shares down 27 percent, to
$15.81 1/4 Tuesday. Shares recovered somewhat Wednesday, closing at
$16.25.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeffrey Villwock of Robinson-Humphrey called the drop
Tuesday an overreaction, part of a general malaise affecting the
whole industry. ``Every health care stock with even a hint of a
problem is down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quorum reported income of $86.7 million on revenues of $1.6
billion in fiscal 1998, ending in June.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities recently have stepped up pursuit
of health care fraud. The biggest target has been Nashville-based
Columbia, engulfed for more than a year in a massive probe into
possible Medicare billing fraud. The impact of the Quorum
investigation on its hospitals in Georgia and elsewhere is hard to
gauge.
</P>
<P>
   But if possible billing problems surface, and are companywide,
some individual hospitals Quorum manages could face potential
liability for questionable practices, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many Quorum-managed hospitals in Georgia are rural facilities,
already rocked by reduced payments from Medicare, Medicaid and
managed-care plans.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the better part of two decades, economists and
elected officials promised that all kinds of good things would
happen if the federal government stopped running huge budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the government closed the books on its fiscal year,
and for the first time since 1969 the budget will show a surplus,
which President Clinton said should be about $70 billion when all
the calculations are completed in the next few weeks. That is
slightly higher than the $63 billion projected earlier this month
by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the payoff?
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the answer is straightforward: Interest rates
are lower than they would be otherwise, a development that has
helped push unemployment down and the stock market up throughout
much of this decade. That shift has also helped establish the
United States as an anchor of stability in a world now at risk from
the deepening global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, some economists and analysts think the benefits
from fiscal prudence have been overstated, and some wonder whether
the projected surpluses will materialize if the economy should slip
into recession. There is still a debate about how much the strong
economy reflects the nation's improved fiscal condition and how
much the improved fiscal condition is a result of the strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some lingering doubt, especially among liberal
Democrats, about whether the fiscal belt-tightening will prove a
good deal for low- and moderate-income people in the long run, or
whether it primarily benefited Wall Street and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no consensus yet about what to do with coming
surpluses, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated will
total $1.55 trillion over the next decade. The debate over tax
cuts, additional spending, reducing the national debt and
strengthening entitlement programs is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a growing battle over whether the government
should consider itself to be in surplus at all, since nearly all of
the excess revenues in coming years come from payroll taxes that
are supposed to be earmarked for the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The dawn of the surplus era passed all but unnoticed Wednesday
in the financial markets, which have long since factored in the
anticipated good news. Meanwhile, in Washington, it was a day for
celebration and contention, with both Democrats and Republicans
claiming credit for the turnaround while laying out their own
priorities for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated his position that the surplus should be kept
in reserve until Congress and the administration settle on a plan
to shore up Social Security for the coming retirement of the
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans kept up their demands that a chunk of the surplus be
allocated to tax cuts so that it is not used for increased
spending, and said that Clinton had already raided the surplus by
proposing as much as $17 billion in emergency spending next year
for domestic and military programs that fall outside the normal
budget process.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the political posturing, there is agreement among many
economists that fiscal rectitude, when combined with unexpectedly
high tax receipts stemming in part from the rapid run-up in the
stock market, helped to push down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That happened because the government's borrowing requirements
declined, and because the absence of fiscal stimulus convinced
investors and the Federal Reserve Board that inflation was less of
a threat.
</P>
<P>
   How much lower rates are than they would have been in the
absence of fiscal improvement is largely a matter of guesswork,
given the myriad of interrelated factors that influence rates.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that lower rates have been a key
factor in keeping the economy growing since 1991 and in generating
new jobs at a healthy pace while stimulating business investment in
productivity-enhancing machinery and computers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many analysts say, the United States is facing a
period of deepening global economic crisis with considerable
strength and resilience, a far cry from its position a decade ago
when it was frequently judged to be in economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of the economy that we're all enjoying now is in
no small part attributable to the efforts we've made to eliminate
the deficit,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office who is now a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, the research group. ``We can be buffeted by
the winds from Asia and the waves from Latin America, and still our
economy chugs along.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, moreover, moving from deficits to surpluses
provides the United States with greater flexibility in economic and
social policy, from cutting taxes to increasing spending and coping
with the strains that will result from an aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our policy for years was driven by nickel-and-diming
the deficit rather than asking what's the right policy,'' said Van
Doorn Ooms, a former chief economist for the House Budget Committee
who is now with the Committee for Economic Development, a
business-sponsored research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we maintain our heads and approach this sensibly, it's much
easier now to take on issues like Social Security and Medicare,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been challenges to the prevailing fiscal
orthodoxy from both the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, many liberals have long been uncomfortable with
the notion that balancing the budget was more important than
financing social programs. To some Democrats, the emphasis on
eliminating the deficit remains little more than cover for
Republicans who want to shrink the size and influence of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But they also acknowledge real benefits from fiscal prudence,
particularly the Federal Reserve's willingness to cut interest
rates early in the Clinton administration and its increased
tolerance for extremely low unemployment rates even as growth has
remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those cuts in real interest rates were very important in
propelling the economy forward,'' said Robert Reich, who was labor
secretary during Clinton's first term. ``On the other hand, deficit
reduction meant cuts in domestic discretionary programs, especially
those for the less well off. And the president was unable to do
anything close to the $50 billion a year in education, training and
research and development investments that he had built his 1992
campaign around.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the sacrifices turn out to be worthwhile will depend on
how well the economy holds up the next time the business cycle
turns down and on how the country chooses to use the coming
surpluses, Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're turned into tax cuts that are mostly for people in
the top 20 percent of income or wealth, then many of the sacrifices
made by those in the bottom half, in terms of programs lost or
investments not made, will have been for very little,'' Reich said.
``If the surpluses are turned into investments in the productive
capacities of people in the bottom half _ education, job
retraining, an expanded earned-income tax credit, for example _
then the payoff may be quite substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a
former Reagan administration budget official, questioned the
premise that eliminating the deficit _ or more precisely,
restraining spending _ had been the key to the economy's strong
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The causality is working in the other direction here,'' Cogan
said. ``The reason we have a budget surplus is not so much because
we have had fiscal restraint _ although we have had more fiscal
restraint in recent years _ but because of a healthy economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogan said the surpluses provided the nation with an opportunity
to change its tax system, strengthen Social Security or reduce the
$5.5 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, the surpluses can also represent a large
problem,'' Cogan said. ``Along with surpluses come, inevitably, the
pressure to spend more, and we're already seeing the manifestation
of that pressure.'
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that the elimination of the deficit has brought
tangible economic benefits is not universally accepted, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we seem to be moving away from chaos and toward
stability,'' Peter Bernstein, an economic consultant in New York,
wrote recently in Challenge magazine. ``It should be good news. And
yet the payoff we were promised from reducing the budget deficit
remains unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein argued that the trade deficit, which some economists
had predicted would fall in tandem with the budget deficit,
remained stubbornly high, even before the Asian crisis sent it even
higher. And he made a case that interest rates, adjusted for
inflation, have actually remained stubbornly high despite the
fiscal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the trade and budget deficits were inextricably
linked may have been questionable from the start, since trade is
subject to political and business influences as well as fiscal
change. And given the tangle of complicated factors that determine
interest rates, it is difficult to say what would have happened to
rates had the nation not balanced its budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernstein also made a point that would resonate with many
economists in a world subject to rapid economic change: that it is
hazardous to assume that changing one element in the country's
economic mix could be counted on to have a certain result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advocates of the mainstream hypothesis fell into error
because they forgot one of the primary lessons of macroeconomics,''
Bernstein wrote. ``Partial equilibrium _ moving one variable while
holding all else constant _ is an interesting but a hazardous basis
for prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   As a case in point, Bernstein cites savings rates. While
deficits declined, reducing what economists call public dissaving,
the savings rate in the private sector was falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profligate private sector, and a swelling stream of both
domestic and foreign investment in the United States, thwarted the
result that the mainstream had assured us was in the cards,''
Bernstein said.

HOPING TO CONTROL SPREAD OF AIDS, CHINA BANS THE SALE OF BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

<P>
   BEIJING _ Reflecting a growing awareness that China's heavy
reliance on paid blood donors is contributing to the rapid spread
of AIDS, a new law banning the buying and selling of blood takes
effect on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Medical centers all over China are bracing for disruptions. To
meet rising medical needs, China's hospitals use a system in which
poor people sell their blood, sometimes to middlemen who falsely
declare that their products have been screened for disease.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for blood, rather than relying on voluntary donations,
has been virtually banned in most countries because it promotes the
spread of AIDS, hepatitis and other infections. People who sell
their blood tend to be at high risk of such diseases and, as has
happened here, unhygienic centers trading in blood for profit may
themselves spread infections.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of a strong cultural aversion to donating blood,
China is unusually reliant on paid sources. According to official
statistics, which some experts consider understated, 40 percent of
all blood used in China has been sold. In some provinces, 90
percent of the blood supply is purchased, according to the official
press, which has carried lurid accounts of the blood trade and its
sometimes disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high dependence on blood sellers, the new law cannot
be fully enforced for some time, senior blood bank officials admit.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Beijing, for example, collects only half the blood
it requires from local donations, and imports the rest from other
regions of the country, said Zhang Lichuan, an official at the
Fangshan Blood Station in a suburb of the city. Much of that
presumably involved paid donors. With the expected scarcity in
coming months, outside supplies are likely to dry up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Beijing will be able to solve the shortage,''
Zhang said. ``If not, blood sellers and dealers may come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals will be forced to reduce the number of transfusions,
officials say _ as they have in the West in recent years, without
ill effect. Beijing hospitals plan to encourage surgery patients to
donate blood in advance. Donation quotas for work places may need
to be increased, officials said, and quotas may be imposed on
private companies and migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, the government tried to encourage
voluntary donations, but to limited effect. Many people fear,
according to traditional belief, that giving up blood will harm
their health. Some simply suspect the hygiene at donation centers
and overall, and there is no ethic of giving blood to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign has been announced to enlist one million medical
workers for donation. Soldiers will be required to donate once
every five years, and college students once during their four years
of school. But all this does not add up to the national need.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 survey by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine
found that in some poor villages, half of all adults were selling
blood once a month or more. Traders known as ``blood bosses'' pay
the sources anywhere from $2.40 in poor villages to $24 in some
cities for each donation of varying amounts, according to various
accounts, then sell it to hospitals at high markups.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, all blood for medical uses here is screened for AIDS,
hepatitis and other diseases. In practice, the testing is not
always done. Official data show that 17 percent of the hundreds of
thousands of Chinese that have tested positive for the virus that
causes AIDS were infected by transfusions.

   UNITED NATIONS _ As NATO readied its forces for possible air
strikes against Yugoslavia Wednesday, the Security Council
scheduled an emergency meeting for Thursday to condemn the
massacres of ethnic Albanians last weekend by Serbian troops in
Kosovo and to consider future moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be no impunity for such an act of ethnic hatred,''
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said at a news conference
in Blackpool, England, where he was attending a conference of his
Labor Party. ``This was not an act of war. This was plain cold
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which takes over the rotating presidency of the
Security Council on Thursday, called for the urgent special
session, backed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Council, which last week demanded an immediate end to
attacks on civilians by the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav army, is
expected to condemn President Slobodan Milosevic's forces in even
stronger terms, although the Council, with no troops at its
disposal, remains divided on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials here reacted Wednesday with shock not
only at the horrific killings of civilians _ women, children and
elderly men shot through the head, mutilated or burned to death in
their homes _ but also at the audacity that Milosevic displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have watched the Yugoslav leader flout world opinion
before through years of fighting in the Balkans, but not as boldly
as he has in recent weeks, as he continues his ruthless suppression
of the ethnic Albanians, a majority in the province where an ethnic
Albanian rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has been battling
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That rebellion, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday,
``can never justify the pattern of terror, including the burning of
houses, looting, killing of livestock and wanton killing that have
been reported in these last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   `` Such actions are totally unacceptable to the international
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was described as ``outraged'' by the descriptions of the
massacres published Wednesday since he had met only Tuesday with
Yugoslavia's foreign minister and delivered a sharp message to him
after hearing reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports are particularly shocking to the secretary-general
in light of denials received from the foreign minister that such
actions were taking place,'' said Fred Eckhard, the
secretary-general's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that the massacres in
Kosovo underline the urgent need for human rights monitors in the
area. Last week, the Security Council made that one of its demands.
The European Union and other organizations have volunteered to
monitor Kosovo, but have been rebuffed by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Cook, the foreign secretary, said that he had been
in touch with the War Crimes Tribunal for the Balkans in The Hague
and had asked its prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, to
investigate the massacres in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Cook also called a meeting in London on Friday of senior
officials from nations that call themselves the contact group on
the former Yugoslavia _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia and
the United States _ to discuss how to settle the problem
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France are opposed or very reluctant to condone the
use of force against Yugoslavia at this stage, and would argue that
further Security Council action is needed before it can be seen to
be condoning NATO action. In the Security Council, China could not
even be persuaded last week to join the warning to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the contact group will also meet in New York
on Thursday at the diplomatic level, envoys said here.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke with
her British counterpart by telephone several times Wednesday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reservations in the Security Council, NATO planning for
air strikes is now complete, Britain's defense secretary, George
Robertson, said Wednesday. He told reporters that the organization
was proposing sharply targeted military strikes on Serb forces, not
random bombing, which would only worsen the situation on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO officials say that military action could begin as soon
as next week, after Annan is expected to report to the Security
Council on Yugoslav compliance with its demands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is far from clear, however, that this link is essential,
since the United States has already stated that NATO has the
authority now to strike the Yugoslav forces attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, last week's Security Council resolution was passed
under a provision of the U.N. charter that makes it enforceable by
military means. On the Security Council, the problem is more
political than tactical.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, also did not rule out
the use of force under the existing Security Council resolution. On
a visit to Azerbaijan, Solana said that NATO's reaction would be
determined by ``what happens on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of Milosevic should be judged by his deeds, not
by his words,'' he said. ``Too many words have not been complied
with by Milosevic.''

VARITEK DOESN'T REGRET NOT THROWING THE BALL

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Kenny Lofton admitted that he was in a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck right there,'' said Lofton. ``They had me stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland center fielder said that getting caught off second
base on Omar Vizquel's fly to left in the second inning with one
out Wednesday was no ruse, no ploy to create a rundown so Joey Cora
could score from third. No, it was a Lofton mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck right there,'' Lofton said, ``and it was just a
case of playing it out to see what happens. You just can't sit out
there and do nothing and say, `You're out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even on a day when much of Boston's pitching seemed to have been
dug out of baseball's deepest archives of horror flicks, the Red
Sox did not help themselves in the field. ``We made some mental
mistakes out there,'' said third baseman John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Primary among them was the play in the second. Vizquel hit a fly
to medium left that was caught by Troy O'Leary. What happened next
caused both Lofton and Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek to be caught
in a freeze frame.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary threw home, but his throw sailed above the head of
Valentin, the cutoff man, which immediately made the situation more
complex. Cora bluffed for home and headed back to third. As he was
doing that, Lofton was some 25 or 30 feet off second, ripe for the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck in no man's land there,'' said Lofton. ``It was a
case that if (Varitek) throws to second to get me, then maybe Joey
takes off for home.''
</P>
<P>
   If O'Leary's throw home had been low enough for Valentin to
handle, the third baseman might have been able to pounce on Lofton
more easily and perhaps make the play for the third out. But the
throw flew into Varitek's glove at the plate, and the catcher chose
not to throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was to keep the runner on third from
scoring,'' said Varitek. ``So what I did was I immediately checked
him and I started to run (toward Lofton near shortstop). But I was
off balance and I didn't want to throw the ball when I was off
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   As Varitek recalled the play, Lofton ``already had enough
momentum toward second base, so I didn't make the throw. I mean, we
have two outs, and the most important thing is outs. I just thought
at the time that I was making sure the runner at third was not
going to score. I didn't think two things about it when it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But then David Justice, the next Cleveland batter, swatted a
three-run homer, the telling blow in the Indians' 9-5 win in Game 2
of the American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek was asked if he had any regrets then about holding the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' said the catcher, who also had a record two
passed balls on Tim Wakefield knucklers. ``I mean, it was a
mistake. (Justice) hit a mistake pitch. I don't second-guess not
throwing the ball, not in the least bit.''
</P>

   For his part, Justice was understandably grateful. ``I was
standing back there behind the plate and I was able to see what was
going on,'' said the DH. ``Kenny is really so fast, so Varitek not
wanting to make a mistake with a throw, he probably just played it
cautious. That's probably why he didn't throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably another reason why the Red Sox lost.

WRESTLING WITH BIBLICAL CRITICISM: IT'S NOT SUNDAY SCHOOL

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``What do you mean,'' exclaimed one student, ``that there's no
evidence for a worldwide flood?''
 &HT;    My colleague explained again that no reliable historical or
scientific evidence exists to prove Noah's Ark. The students --
shocked by his scholarly bombshell -- struggled to maintain their
composure.
 &HT;    Every fall, in college and seminary classrooms across the
country, first-year religion students encounter ideas upsetting to
their faith. Most expected Bible courses to be like Sunday school.
They did not expect rigorous critical challenges to the Hebrew and
Christian scriptures.
 &HT;    Biblical criticism is not new. For more than a century, biblical
scholars have employed literary, historical, and other critical
methods to the Bible to better understand its context and message.
 &HT;    Whether they realize it or not, most church people understand
basic biblical criticism. My Sunday school teacher said that Moses
wrote the first five books of the Bible. Yet, when I read the text,
I noticed something odd. Moses wrote his own death scene! How could
that be?
 &HT;    Being curious, I spotted other contradictions. Why did Genesis 1
and 2 seem so different? Why did Peter deny Jesus on six occasions
instead of three? Why were Luke's and Matthew's accounts of Jesus'
birth distinctive?
 &HT;    As if the Bible's internal discrepancies were not enough,
teachers provided additional difficulties to ponder: what about
dinosaurs? a six-day creation? Adam and Eve? a bodily resurrection?
By high school graduation, believing in the Bible is tough.
 &HT;    Then a final blow: some Harvard Ph.D. spouting off about
``myth.'' What's a student to think?
 &HT;    Biblical scholarship explores questions raised by both the text
and by knowledge external to the scriptures. Often their
conclusions -- such as the biblical flood is a myth -- prove
disconcerting to people of faith. Ministers, priests and rabbis
often sidestep these issues with their congregations.
 &HT;    Conservatives insist that Isaiah himself wrote the book of the
Bible that bears his name, while more recent scholarship indicates
that two or three people wrote the book. As we quipped in seminary,
``Three Isaiahs just doesn't preach well.''
 &HT;    Silence regarding these questions helps no one. How do believers
deal with intellectual problems raised by the Bible -- as well as
controversial findings of biblical scholars?
 &HT;    One possibility is, of course, to chuck it. When some people
encounter these problems, they reject the Bible -- ``a bunch of
myths and superstitions'' -- as in any way meaningful to life.
 &HT;    But doubters and atheists aren't alone in chucking it. Believers
often dismiss science, history or biblical scholarship as ``secular
humanism.'' They ridicule science, doubt the findings of history
and archeology, and refuse to engage contemporary intellectual
debate. They sometimes construct elaborate pseudo-scholarship to
prove their beliefs -- and prove that secular scholarship is a
conspiracy undermining Christian truth.
 &HT;    A second possibility is to compartmentalize one's faith and
intellectual life. This option, encouraged by public education, is
an easy way around the tensions. Be devout on the weekend. But in
class or on the job, just do your work. Don't let religion intrude
on your study of biology or anthropology; don't let biology or
anthropology trouble your private prayer. Science is science. Faith
is faith.
 &HT;    Most of us, however, do not live in neat, little boxes. We may
try to bracket, but eventually stuff spills over the edges. Some
professor's lecture sends you reeling. A co-worker commits an
egregious ethical violation. Faith and life collide.
 &HT;    The third -- and most difficult -- option is to allow faith and
intellect to speak with one another. Because of the pressure to
separate religion from other spheres, any attempt to integrate --
rather than segregate -- heart and mind can be daunting. Yet the
pursuit of wholeness -- spiritual and intellectual -- is central to
the quest to know and love God.
 &HT;    To integrate faith and learning, the conversation must consist
of equal partners. One should be fully open to the questions of
both belief and inquiry. Faith and intellect are equally challenged
and challenging. Everything is up for grabs -- with all the
tensions, ambiguities, paradoxes and problems. And therein lies the
adventure.
 &HT;    I commiserate with my students struggling with Noah's story. It
took years for me to accept that the first chapter of Genesis is
poetry, that no wise men showed up at Jesus' birth, and Paul did
not write I Timothy.
 &HT;    Wrestling with contemporary biblical criticism has helped me to
understand that historic literalism and scientific accuracy are not
the Bible's point.
 &HT;    This knowledge, much to my surprise, did not lead to infidelity.
Rather, it has led to a deeper experience of God through the
biblical texts. I've learned to ask different questions of the
Bible -- broader, more relevant, and tougher questions about
meaning, faith and ethics.
 &HT;    Biblical scholarship makes me a better Christian -- not a
secular humanist or atheist.
 &HT;    It may not preach easily, but ultimately, it preaches well.

DAVID SCHIPPERS: DEMOCRATIC OUTSIDER LEADS GOP INQUIRY ON CLINTON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Schippers, chief investigator on the House
Judiciary Committee, and his boss, Rep. Henry Hyde, bowed their
heads together at a ceremony in Cleveland three years ago and left
church a pair of papal knights.
</P>
<P>
   The honor, given to several hundred Roman Catholics who promote
the church's interests, rekindled the two men's acquaintance,
Schippers said, but it also bestowed on them privileges, like
trotting into a Catholic church on a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I run into anyone on the way to the gallows,'' Schippers
also said, ``I can pardon them.''
</P>
<P>
   That may seem an unlikely stroke of charity for the lawyer
heading the Republican inquiry into possible impeachment charges
against the president of the United States. But President Clinton
could do much worse than Schippers, a salty Chicagoan whose
Democratic bloodline runs hard through a clan of police captains
and firefighters, and, most recently, a ``radical feminist''
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm a Democrat, that is not a title,'' he said,
clearly relishing his role as outsider on the committee, ``that is
a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Schippers was the man chosen to face off against
Clinton, a president he voted for twice, was a curious stroke on
the part of Hyde and Republican leaders, who hope, against most
odds, to maintain at least the veneer of bipartisanship during the
inquiry. So far, the proceedings have been chiefly marked by raw
party disputes, and Schippers has had little power to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day the panel will vote on whether to proceed
with an impeachment inquiry, Schippers will formally address the
Judiciary Committee for the first time, as he and his Democratic
counterpart, Abbe Lowell, discuss the evidence sent to Congress by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Democrats have complained that,
so far, committee staff members have spent most of their time
poring over the documents simply to decide what to release, not to
judge their substance.
</P>
<P>
   It is Schippers' task, as well as Lowell's, to analyze the
evidence and determine whether Starr's case is legally sound,
leaving it up to the committee to decide whether to go forward with
impeachment.
</P>

evidence and determine whether Starr's case is legally sound,
leaving it up to the committee to decide whether to go forward with
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rancor on the panel, Schippers said he would strive
for fairness, regardless of the difficulties, something his current
and former colleagues say has characterized his style since way
back. And he is likely to go about it in an unorthodox manner, at
least for Washington, keeping a respectable distance from the
television lights, the city's power clutch and the carpeted aisles
at Brooks Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Schippers chose to ignore Washington's stable of
lawyers and criminal investigators, bringing with him a team of
specialists from Chicago, including former prosecutors, agents from
the FBI and Internal Revenue Service, and the current tactical
sergeant for the Chicago Police Department. He also brought his son
on board as a lawyer, which left him open to charges of nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``zero'' Harvard Law School graduates on the team, he
said. ``These lawyers are all guys who squeaked through law school
in South America, for all I know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers agreed to take the Judiciary Committee job in March,
he said, because Hyde asked him. ``The last thing in the world I
wanted is to come out here and do this,'' said the 68-year-old
defense lawyer and former prosecutor who first met Hyde in 1969,
when they both served on an anti-crime panel in Chicago. ``I
figured I had put in my time. I had no political or professional
ambition. I don't want to write books or go on television or be a
big star. My philosophy is come out here, do the job and get out,
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Schippers sees it, he has already peaked professionally,
at 30, back when he slapped handcuffs around the wrists of
legendary Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana.
</P>
<P>
   That was during the 1960s, when Schippers fell in with Robert
Kennedy's gangbusters vision and went to work for the Justice
Department. He eventually became the chief of the organized crime
and racketeering section in Chicago, where he came up with a plan
to immunize Giancana, which got him laughed out of every boss'
office along the food chain until he got to the attorney general
himself, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we immunized Giancana, that started the house of cards
falling in the Chicago outfit for two, three years there,''
Schippers said.
</P>
<P>
   His run-ins with ``the outfit'' never worried him too much, he
said. ``I wouldn't screw around with their family and they wouldn't
screw around with mine,'' he said. ``It was an unholy agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neighbors could not help but feel a pang of anxiety
about the possibility of a neighborhood blood bath, so, one week,
they took up a collection, knocked on Schippers' door and handed
him a gift. It was a set of oversized numbers for the front of his
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want anybody to make a mistake, am I right?''
Schippers asked his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Justice Department in 1967, Schippers went
into private practice and made a living defending a ``jillion'' law
enforcement agents and wading though labor cases. More recently, he
dabbled in sexual harassment lawsuits, on both sides of the issue,
and spent time on cases involving race and religious
discrimination. He is also on the public defender's panel, taking
any case offered to him that does not involve the mob or drug
peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' rumpled demeanor and streetwise, self-effacing charm
tend to dust over a streak so tough that even one of his daughters
was stunned to see that side of him during a courtroom visit.
Although not as smooth and intellectual as his counterpart, Lowell,
he brings doses of common sense to the job, colleagues and aides
say, and few reasons to blur his focus, mostly because he is near
retirement and does not crave the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings an extraordinary sense of fairness to whatever he
does, practical and in a legal sense,'' said Daniel Martin, a
lawyer with the Federal Defender Program who has worked as
co-counsel with Schippers on several long cases. ``He's a very
pragmatic man who can separate the wheat from the chaff.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he thought that Schippers would bring to the table a
touch of something else that was now sorely lacking in the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's the kind of fellow who gets too involved in
the partisan issues,'' he said, although Republican aides said he
had been tough on Democrats, perhaps to show he can be impartial.
``To the extent that this can be a charade or a Republican witch
hunt, he won't fall prey to that. He won't fall prey to
counter-opinions, either. It's probably one reason why Hyde tapped
into him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a childhood spent at Wrigley Field and in parochial
school, Schippers said he thought about joining the priesthood
during a stint at Quigley South Preparatory Seminary. Then he
decided that ``women were not just soft boys,'' and that he had had
``enough of this nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   He married, and Catholic to the core, he said, began ``producing
children at an obscene rate'' _ ten in all, to be precise, children
who in turn gave him 25 grandchildren. Evenings, he attended Loyola
Law School, a pursuit that crossed his mind at the seminary, when,
after taking a test, a priest told him he had managed to get every
answer wrong, but every reason right.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent a lot of time fishing recently, at least until the
call came in January from Hyde, a casual longtime friend. Hyde told
Schippers' at the time that his task would be to set up a framework
for overseeing the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But ``between the first call and the actual personal meeting,
guess what happened?'' Schippers asked. ``Here comes the beret.''

 &HT;    Cat colony at museum causing trouble
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The curator, the cat lady, the trapper
and the good lieutenant all agree on one thing: The insanity must
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how, they're not sure.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that a social crisis is nearing critical mass
here, and it involves wild cats.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the feral Pulitzers or Kennedys again. This time it's
the street felines at the Henry Flagler Museum.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, a colony of cats has roamed the 8 acres
around the stately mansion, oblivious to the fact that the great
architect was a dog lover. They were given charming names _ Peanut
Butter, Champagne, Fluffy and Fluffy Jr., Zipper, Nutmeg, John
Wayne and Marmalade _ and led charming lives.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, John Blades took over as the museum's curator. He
wants the cats to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not belong here,'' he says. ``They have infested the
carpets with fleas. They have caused damage. They are a health and
safety nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, a security guard stepped on a cat and turned
his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a workers comp claim,'' Blades says. ``I'm hoping and
praying no visitor is injured or gets cat-scratch fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The new curator's position infuriates Catherine Bradley, known
throughout the island as the ``Cat Lady.'' Each day for the last 13
years, she has taken a wooden box full of food to the side gate at
the Flagler Museum to ensure that the cats have full bellies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know each of the cats at the museum,'' she says. ``I have a
photographic memory.''
</P>
<P>
   This comes in handy because Bradley admits to caring for 300 of
the island's feral cats, the names she has given them being too
numerous to recount here. In another life, Bradley used her
sophisticated, British bearing to strike real estate deals. She
sold John Lennon's mansion, among others. Now she runs her Palm
Beach Cat Rescue league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work 100 hours a week,'' she says. ``I'm weary. It's
laborious work. The cats are heavy. I don't need another battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what she got recently when Blades decided to
take bold action against his purring squatters. This brings us to
Robert Freeman, the trapper, owner of Grizzly's Wild Animal
Service. Blades hired him to trap the cats _ humanely, of course _
and remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love cats,'' Freeman says. ``I am an animal lover. When I'm
called in, there's already a problem. But that woman (Bradley) is
creating a monster. Someone will have to stop her. I'm just trying
to curb her form of insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly's has trapped five cats and taken them to shelters,
including the Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control Division.
Which is where Lt. Gina DiPace enforces the law _ or tries to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our new ordinance, the person who is the feral cat
care-giver is responsible to see that they are all spayed,
tattooed, and gotten their microchip and their shots,'' DiPace
says.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``feral cat care-giver'' is new to the county's
lexicon. It was born in June when Bradley convinced Palm Beach
County commissioners that people should be allowed to look after
wild cat colonies, so long as the care-givers register with animal
control officers and follow their rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat unclear exactly what the rules are, however.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, Freeman traps the cats and takes them to a
shelter, where Bradley retrieves them, spends up to $200 in fees,
then returns them to the museum _ much to the horror of the
curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous and irresponsible,'' Blades says. ``I'm
tired of being cast as the bad guy. She is expecting to pursue her
obsession on people's private property.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat lady believes the conflict is mostly a human thing:
``It's become a personal thing. Some people aren't used to having
their authority challenged. He's always putting down my program.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades says the cats absolutely will not stay. Bradley fed all
14 of them again Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's taking them back there?'' asked an incredulous Lt.
DiPace. ``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Freeman, the trapper: ``Help me. I'm losing my mind.''

GOVERNMENT TO BAN INSTALLATION OF 2 KINDS OF HIGHWAY GUARD RAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Spelling of thrie-beam in 9th and 11th grafs cq.) 
 (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Federal Highway Administration is banning, as of
Thursday, all further installation of two popular kinds of guard
rail along government-financed highways after determining that the
guard rails cause full-sized pickup trucks to roll over during
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks are designed to climb up and over obstacles, a
feature that is useful on muddy farms and construction sites but
can be dangerous when they hit guard rails. Most sport utility
vehicles are based on pickup designs and some ride even higher off
the ground, leading many researchers to suspect that sport utility
vehicles may also fare poorly when they strike guard rails. But few
tests have been done with such vehicles, which have only recently
become popular, so nobody knows whether they pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials said there were no plans to replace
hundreds of thousands of miles of guard rails because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 Americans are killed each year when their vehicles
leave the road. About 1,100 of these deaths occur in crashes that
begin when vehicles hit guard rails. Many other deaths occur in
crashes that begin on the road and then send one or more vehicles
into the guard rails, but the government lacks accurate statistics
on these crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Umbs, the chief of the safety designs and operations
division of the Federal Highway Administration, said changes in the
nation's highways inevitably lagged behind changes in what
Americans drive, including the the fast-growing popularity of sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The best answer is for people
to drive more carefully in vehicles that are harder to handle, Umbs
said, while declining to discuss specific classes of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers should know their vehicles and the capabilities of
their vehicles and drive accordingly,'' Umbs said. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration already requires labels on
small and mid-sized sport utility vehicles, warning that they are
more likely than other vehicles to roll over during sharp turns.
</P>
<P>
   When two-wheel-drive pickups were pushed into the two banned
guard rails at a 25-degree angle at 62 miles per hour in tests over
the last several years, the vehicles consistently rolled over,
although they stayed on the road. The reason apparently lies in how
the front ends of pickups are designed, said King Mak, who oversaw
the tests at the Texas Transportation Institute, a state agency in
College Station that does virtually all of the nation's guard rail
research under contracts from the federal government and guard rail
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles have
wheels that are fairly exposed, with little protection for the
wheels from these vehicles' high bumpers and minimal wheel wells.
The positioning of the wheels makes it possible for drivers to
scale muddy mountain trails.
</P>
<P>
   But in tests, the pickup wheels climbed up one of the banned
rails, a thrie-beam rail that looks like a triple ripple when
viewed from the side. The pickup wheels also tended to snag on the
support posts of the other kind of banned rail, a corrugated metal
beam that looks like the letter W from the side and is mounted to
the post with steel blocks that tend to twist on impact.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel problems caused the pickups to roll over in tests with
both types of guard rails, which account for roughly half of the
nation's guard rails.
</P>
<P>
   The thrie-beam rails can be fixed by replacing steel support
posts with wooden posts, while the W-beam rails can be fixed by
replacing the steel blocks with wooden blocks, which are thicker
and twist less, Mak said.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles have more weight on the rear tires and so
may be less dangerous than pickups upon impact with guard rails, he
said. A two-wheel-drive Ford Explorer and a two-wheel-drive
Chevrolet Tracker, for example, did not flip over in tests at a
shallower angle than was used for the pickup tests.
</P>
<P>
   But no tests have been done on four-wheel-drive sport utility
vehicles, which tend to ride two or three inches higher, so nobody
really knows what happens when they hit guard rails, Mak said. A
federally financed review of national crash records has found that
sport utility vehicles are a little less likely than cars to hit
guard rails, but are more than twice as likely to roll over when
they do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety experts are starting to advise drivers of pickups
and sport utility vehicles to drive more slowly and cautiously on
bridges and twisting roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going at a lower speed, your propensity for getting
up and over the barrier is lower and your propensity for rolling
over is lower,'' said Dean Sicking, director of the Midwest
Roadside Safety Facility at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading Democrats and Republicans here are being
haunted by youthful voices of 24 years ago, during Watergate. The
voices are their own.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by a sense that the hypocrisy is getting thicker than
their sideburns of yore, Republicans and Democrats are turning
history and memory into political weapons as they square off over
possible impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, their proxies, President Clinton and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, exchanged accusations of conflicting standards
in the Watergate and Lewinsky inquiries. On Capitol Hill, Democrats
and Republicans clashed over how precisely the investigation of
this president should mimic the inquiry about President Richard M.
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   To Republicans, the Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry of
1974 is now a model of congressional restraint and judiciousness.
To Democrats _ who had previously called for the Watergate-style
rules _ that is now too broad an approach.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Democrats noted with delight that minority
Republicans in 1974 were granted subpoena power _ a precedent not
all Republicans are thrilled with.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Democrats and Republicans reached no agreement
on the scope of the investigation Wednesday. Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the committee's chairman, dispatched a letter to Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, its senior Democrat, gently suggesting he
was being a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde wrote, ``I want to propose that the model for impeachment''
that the committee should follow ``is the one that you helped to
write in 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott started Democratic aides rummaging through the archives of
his quotations by saying on Tuesday that ``bad conduct'' might be
an impeachable offense. They popped up with a dusty defense of
Nixon by Lott, who was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in
1974. He said that a president should be removable ``only for
serious misconduct dangerous to the system of government'' and not
for ``general misbehavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, White House spokesman Mike McCurry accused Lott of an
apparent ``double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His constitutional thinking has undergone quite an
evolution,'' he observed, adding: ``I think he kind of got caught
up in the reverie of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, had his own quotation at the
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Bill Clinton who seems to have undergone a convenient
memory lapse,'' he said. ``In 1974, Bill Clinton said a president
should be impeached if he admits to lying and interfering with a
government investigation. In 1998, Bill Clinton believes it's his
right not only to lie to the American people and thwart lawful
investigations of his conduct, but to lie under an oath before
God.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 7, 1974, Bill Clinton _ then a shaggy-haired law
professor at the University of Arkansas _ criticized his opponent
in a congressional race for opposing Nixon's resignation. He was
quoted the next day by the Arkansas Gazette as saying there was
``no question that an admission of making false statements to
government officials and interfering with the FBI and the CIA is an
impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comment in the town of Flippin, where he would
later make an investment in Ozarks property known as Whitewater
that, through many twists and turns, would bring him to the brink
of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, Watergate and Clinton's predicament over Monica
Lewinsky _ which still lacks a catchy, one-word nickname _ bear no
resemblance. McCurry appeared at his daily briefing Wednesday armed
for a question about comparisons to Watergate. He got it, and
almost ran out of breath as he rattled off a lengthy list of the
accusations against Nixon, including that he ``misused the FBI,
(and) the Secret Service, to conduct unlawful wiretapping of
American citizens'' and that he ``maintained a secret unit in the
White House to violate the constitutional rights of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   After pausing slightly for air, McCurry added indignantly, ``So
there's no parallel whatsoever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet there is something of a parallel _ at least through the
looking glass _ in the political commentary. Back in 1974, Conyers
complained about White House ``stonewalling,'' while then-Rep. Lott
_ in remarks that make James Carville sound like a plagiarist _
objected to ``15 months of the most intensive investigation of any
president of the United States, perhaps of any man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott added, ``Could any man withstand such scrutiny, could any
man go through all of this without some evidence of a questionable
statement under pressure, or while frustrated, or even without
revealing some mistakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Such sweeping comments aside, Lott and Conyers, in their remarks
in the committee, built their attacks or defenses out of the
specific facts of Watergate. Transcripts are packed with period
references to tax evasion, wiretapping and bombs falling on
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of musty quotations, Conyers came under criticism
from Republicans Wednesday for having switched his thinking in the
debate over how broad an inquiry the Judiciary Committee should
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In internal negotiations, Conyers had been seeking a time limit
on the inquiry. Republicans pointed out that on the House floor in
February 1974, Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., then the committee's
chairman, derided the notion of a time limit as ``totally
irresponsible and unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said that Conyers, then a member of the
Judiciary Committee, cast his vote against a time limit.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Conyers said that the situations were not comparable,
because, unlike in Watergate, most of the facts are already known
about Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a House resolution charged the Judiciary Committee to
``investigate fully and completely'' whether sufficient grounds
existed to impeach Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, such a resolution would give the committee power to
pursue any impeachable offense, meaning it would not have to come
back to the full House for authority to widen its scope if it
wanted to go beyond the accusations related to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has consistently refused to rule out looking beyond the
Lewinsky matter, although he has also said that he wants to keep
the investigation focused. The Democrats want any investigation to
be limited to the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
deceptions about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the House Democrats had been pressing for a Watergate model
_ which would also provide them with subpoena power _ so they found
themselves in an awkward position Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to report that we have been given a
Watergate-type set of rules, which is what we have been asking
for,'' Conyers said, before going on to criticize such rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that this investigation should be open-ended like
Watergate, as the speaker continues to insist, is preposterous,''
he said. ``Watergate involved a wholesale corruption of government
which extended through the FBI the CIA and other federal agencies.
This matter involves the concealing of a private affair for which
the vast majority of facts is already known.''

MIAMI BUSINESSMAN INDICTED FOR MAKING ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted a Miami
businessman on charges of making illegal contributions to
Democratic candidates, including $23,000 in allegedly fraudulent
donations to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-count indictment, returned in Federal District Court
here, accused Mark Jimenez of defrauding the Federal Election
Commission and conspiring to commit criminal violations of election
laws by using straw donors to make a total of $39,500 in political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who did not return phone calls to his office, is the
chief executive of Future Tech International Inc., a distributor of
computer components and peripherals. The indictment contended that
the contributions were made in the names of employees of Future
Tech and a company owned by a close relative of Jimenez, who later
reimbursed the employees with his own or his company's money.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Jimenez's actions illegally impeded the
commission in regulating elections and were intended to seek
influence for himself and his company with political leaders and
officials of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The charges involve contributions to the Clinton-Gore primary
election committee in 1996 and to other Democrats, including the
1994 re-election campaign of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
The indictment said that improper contributions were also made to
three Democratic senatorial candidates in 1996, Robert Torricelli
of New Jersey, Thomas Strickland of Colorado and Roger Bedford of
Alabama, and a House candidate, Ann Henry of Arkansas. All except
Torricelli were defeated by their Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication from the indictment that any of the
candidates knew that the contributions were made through what are
known as conduit contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Wednesday that the
prosecution was the 12th campaign finance case brought by the
Justice Department, and indicated that the campaign finance unit
``is not letting up.''
</P>
<P>
   But four of the charges accusing Jimenez of false statements
could be in jeopardy. The accusations are similar to counts that
were thrown out on Sept. 10 by a Federal District judge in
Washington, who ruled against the department in the case of Maria
Hsia, another Democratic fund-raiser accused of violating campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   In that ruling the judge, Paul Friedman, threw out five of six
counts against Ms. Hsia, saying the government made an ``Alice in
Wonderland-like maze of logical leaps and tangled inferences'' to
build a theory that the judge said ``defies logic and stretches
almost beyond recognition the two criminal statutes on which it
relies.''
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they were considering an appeal of the
ruling in the Hsia case. In addition, Ms. Reno is considering
whether to seek an independent prosecutor to investigate other
potential illegalities stemming from Clinton's re-election
campaign. She has until November to decide whether to seek such an
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 90-day inquiries centers on whether Vice President Al
Gore was truthful in his statements about his telephone fund
raising from the White House. Another focuses on whether Harold
Ickes, a former deputy White House chief of staff, lied about
efforts to assist the Teamsters union in a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The third inquiry is centered on whether the president violated
federal election laws in an effort to raise millions of dollars
that was diverted to state parties to finance political advertising
campaigns.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even after many lesser stocks had faded, America's
blue chips sailed into the third quarter seemingly headed for yet
another year of improbably outsize gains. On July 17 the Dow Jones
industrial average reached 9,337.97, with commentators still
talking of the just-right ``Goldilocks economy'' and mulling the
existence of a possible ``new era.''
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be the pinnacle. Before long, the blue chips
joined the rest of the stock market in a general slide as an array
of negatives came together at once. Wednesday the Dow dropped
237.90 points, dragging the popular index back into minus territory
for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big consumer stocks are the ones that took the beating,''
said Rao Chalasani, investment strategist at Everen Securities in
Chicago, summing up the worst quarter for the stock market in eight
years. ``Finally things started catching up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi, consultant on trading strategy to Deutsche Bank
Securities, said, ``It was like a New Year's Eve party that ended
at 11 o'clock. People were still dancing when the music stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian problems flared again, Russian leadership grew shakier,
the hoped-for gentle deceleration of the U.S. economy suddenly
threatened an acute profit squeeze and President Clinton's grip on
the White House came into serious doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of tumbling prices preceded a gut-wrenching drop on the
final day of August, a 512.61-point reality check that was the
second-biggest point loss on record. After this, the Dow and the
rest of the market regained some footing before sagging again at
quarter's end.
</P>
<P>
   There was little that escaped the third-quarter carnage. The
30-stock Dow industrials dropped 12.39 percent during the
July-September period, the worst since its 14.86 percent decline in
the third quarter of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.30 percent and the
Nasdaq market index _ bolstered by a few technology giants _ eked
out a gain of sixty-onehundreths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of this summer's swoon remains. Nervousness and
volatility now mark most trading sessions. The specter of an
overseas meltdown, profit erosion and other worries are beginning
to be reflected in the American economy in the form of lower
capital spending, diminished consumer confidence and more caution
among lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous market leaders have warned recently of profit
shortfalls, further battering their shares. Coca-Cola, for example,
lost 32.6 percent of its share value during the past three months.
American Express lost 31.8 percent; Sears, Roebuck, 27.6 percent,
and Walt Disney and J.P. Morgan 27.7 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find another time in recent stock market history when the
thinking shifted so dramatically,'' said Byron Wien, chief U.S.
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``This is a major change
in attitude _ and it probably isn't over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the shift was reflected in statements _ and
this week in action _ by the Federal Reserve, where officials kept
reappraising the balance of economic and financial risks and found
that concern about unsustainably rapid growth and revived inflation
had given way to their opposites. On Tuesday the Fed cut the target
rate for short-term interest rates, the first reduction in nearly
three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a single quarter, observed Marshall Acuff, equity strategist
at Salomon Smith Barney, ``you've seen Fed policy go from
potentially restrictive to neutral to ease'' as it became
increasingly worried about exposure to foreign economic and
financial storms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow components, the biggest loss was 38.1 percent by
the Travelers Group, which succumbed to the general implosion of
financial shares and the large foreign exposure of Citicorp, its
merger partner, Citicorp. finished the quarter at 93, barely half
its April peak of 182.
</P>
<P>
   As always, however, there were exceptions _ stocks that powered
through the downdraft, indeed attracting some money pulled from
those that stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, for example, soared 41.7 percent to close at
$65.75, a performance that topped the company's 37 percent surge
during the spring when its market value surpassed that of General
Motors. IBM, not that long ago mired in the category of fallen
star, climbed 11.5 percent over the summer, the second-best Dow
performer, following a 10.5 percent second-quarter gain.
</P>
<P>
   The top Dow stock among its eight quarterly gainers was Philip
Morris, up 17 percent, as the legal cloud over tobacco issues
lifted a bit and some skittish investors, mindful of the company's
strong food and Miller beer businesses, turned defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of two other major brewers, Anheuser-Busch and Coors, had
strong summers before surrendering some gains in the quarter's
final week.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities, another defensive sector that benefits from falling
interest rates as well, bucked the down trend, too. The Dow Jones
utility average rose 4.4 percent for the quarter, with Peco Energy
up 25.3 percent and Con Edison up 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Health-related issues also showed resilience. Johnson &AMP; Johnson
climbed 5.7 percent, and Long's Drug soared 39.2 percent as the
second best gainer among the S&AMP;P 500. Amoco, which British
Petroleum is buying, jumped 29 percent to top a generally stable
energy group as depressed oil prices edged higher.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts took some comfort in scattered strength among
cyclical stocks because their continued slump could have pointed
toward recession. International Paper, for example, was the third
strongest Dow stock during the quarter, rising 8.4 percent, while
Alcoa was right behind with a gain of 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the domestic economy is healthier than we anticipated,''
Birinyi said.

 &HT;    Distribution of collegiate group funds at issue
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Ohio _ Should universities be allowed to provide
operating money to student organizations geared toward a single
racial or sexual orientation while denying Christian student
organizations or political groups similar funding?
</P>
<P>
   The question lies at the heart of a federal lawsuit filed
Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati in which four
Christian organizations and 11 students at Miami University
challenge the constitutionality of the school's policies on
allocating student activity fees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit _ filed against Miami's president, vice president of
student affairs and dean of students _ claims that the university's
practice of refusing to allow Christian student organizations
access to student-activities money used to subsidize dozens of
other student groups violates the Christian organizations'
free-speech rights. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages and
a court order barring Miami from using its current funding system.
About $34 per student is collected annually to support more than
120 campus organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The issues have raged on other college campuses, and in other
courtrooms as well: Members of Wright State University's College
Republicans group stirred controversy in February 1997 in a letter
to the student newspaper challenging the spending of university
money on specialized student groups. The controversy culminated in
a spirited 90-minute debate and public forum attended by 150
students featuring members of the Republican group, WSU's Black
Student Union and a gay and lesbian student group.
</P>
<P>
   WSU's funding policies are similar to Miami's: student groups
that are religious or political in nature may apply for one-time
grants to pay for special events, but generally do not receive
operating subsidy as do many other student organizations. However,
unlike Miami, WSU does not collect student-activity fees separately
from general fees, WSU officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the
University of Wisconsin at Madison could not force students to
finance campus groups that engage in political and religious
activities. For now, the ruling applies only to campuses in
Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. Three university students had sued
the Madison college in 1996. In February 1998, five students at the
University of Minnesota filed a similar lawsuit against their
school.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has not affected private colleges such as the
University of Dayton and Cedarville College as much as it has
public universities. UD officials said student organizations raise
their own operating money but can apply for grants to pay for
seminars, speakers, newsletters and similar activities.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials indicated they would vigorously defend their
position, pointing out two of the student religious groups suing _
a group called For the Love of God, and Sigma Theta Epsilon, a
Christian fraternity _ received student fee money last year. The
Christian Council and the Christian Coalition are also listed as
plaintiffs in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about access to funding. It's about using
mandatory fees to support religion,'' Miami spokesman Richard
Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials say they know they have students from many
diverse religions on campus and don't believe it's fair to use
student activity money to support a particular religious group.
Even academic honorary organizations, which exclude most students,
are not eligible for operating subsidies from student activity
fees, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Campus-based religious and political organizations may apply to
student government for funding for specific events and are eligible
for office space. But because the First Amendment prohibits public
funding for religious and political activities, the groups are not
eligible for operating subsidies from the university, Miami
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Blankenship, an attorney who filed the lawsuit on
behalf of the student organizations and students, said funding
should be open to all student groups, regardless of ideological
advocacy. Blankenship said some of the students he represents have
attempted for years to change Miami's policy, ``but they basically
were just getting stonewalled by the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials said Blankenship's clients were asked to
participate in a review of the school's funding methods for
religious and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose litigation over working within the system,'' said
Richard Nault, Miami's dean of students.

WHITE HOUSE CRISIS CATCHES ATTENTION OF AMERICA'S YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-CONGRESS and CLINTON-SCHIPPERS) 
(JT) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crisis in the White House has caught the attention of
America's young people, according to a poll released Wednesday,
with parents reporting that as many as 30 percent of their
teen-agers had watched part of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony and 21 percent had read at least part of the Starr
report.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Clinton arising out of his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky have led to more
family discussions about politics, according to the poll, which was
conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and The Press.
Almost half the parents of children over 13, a third of those with
children from 11 to 13, and almost a quarter of those with children
8 to 10, said they had discussed politics with their children more
than usual since the Lewinsky case erupted in January.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted on Sept. 19-23, was based on telephone
interviews with a nationally representative sample of 597 parents
with children 8 to 17. The margin of sampling error is plus or
minus five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Children of different ages reacted differently, the parents
reported. While most children, at every age, were interested in
what would happen to Clinton, teen-agers were more often amused by
the accusations against the president than disturbed by them, while
children 8 to 10 were more confused by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an upside to this, in that it's getting more people to
talk about politics,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the research
center. ``But clearly with people saying it's making their kids
lose respect for politics, and the kinds of things people are
talking about, it's not good for America's youth. I was struck that
so many parents of the younger children felt it would be harmful to
their long-term views of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Among parents of children 8 to 10 years old, 42 percent said the
Clinton-Lewinsky situation would harm their child's view of
government, while among the parents of teen-agers, only 29 percent
had that view, and 20 percent said the White House crisis would
help their child's view of government.
</P>
<P>
   Republican parents tended to take a more negative view of the
impact on their children than did Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the polling we've done on this, the responses reflect
politics more than gender or anything else,'' Kohut said, ``and
it's true in parenting, too. These kids are clearly reflecting what
their mommies and daddies say, and the mommies and daddies are
clearly passing their views on to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan politics influenced both how much a family talked about
the White House crisis and what they said, the poll found.
Republican parents were far more likely than Democratic ones to
report that they had talked with their children about the scandal,
that their children were discussing the matter with their friends,
and that the scandal was making their children lose respect for
politicians. While 74 percent of the parents who disapprove of how
Clinton is handling his job said they had talked to their children
about whether he lied, only 47 percent of those who approve of the
president had done so.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, parents of teen-agers were more likely to have talked
with their children about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
than about the home-run race in baseball, while parents of younger
children were more likely to have discussed the baseball story than
the political one.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clinton-Lewinsky situation came up in conversation
between parents and children, most parents said, the talk was about
morals and values. But those with older children, especially, said
their discussions had also covered sex, their own views on Clinton
and whether he had lied, and whether the president should be
punished or forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, a child's age played a major role in
determining whether the sexual aspects of the situation had been
discussed. Only 17 percent of parents with children 8 to 10 had
talked about whether Clinton had sex with Ms. Lewinsky, and 33
percent had talked about sex in general. Among the parents of
teen-agers, 58 percent talked about Clinton's sexual behavior and
72 percent discussed sex in general.
</P>
<P>
   Across all age groups, fewer than one-third of the parents had
discussed the impeachment process with their children.

BLUNT ADVICE FOR IMF IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's former tax chief urged the West on Wednesday
not to provide further financial aid unless Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov takes drastic measures to develop a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF should learn a lesson from the past five years,'' the
former official, Boris Fyodorov, said, referring to the
International Monetary Fund. ``The IMF was pretending that it was
seeing a lot of reforms in Russia. Russia was pretending to conduct
reforms. The Western taxpayer was paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov, an ardent pro-capitalist and veteran of Russia's
rough-and-tumble political wars, has long been known for his
outspokenness. But he is also the rarest of political figures: a
former aide who was in the inner councils of government just days
ago and is willing to talk openly about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed on Monday from his posts as Russia's tax chief and
main economic strategist at the insistence of the Communists,
Fyodorov on Wednesday described a government that was clueless in
the face of growing economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The government's commitment to economic reform is so shaky that
the West would do more harm than good if it provided fresh help at
this time, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the Group of Seven industrialized nations
should present Russia with a list of 10 steps to build a market
economy and make sure they are carried out before handing over
billions of dollars in new loans and aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand from Russia drastic economic reforms,'' he told a group
of Western correspondents. ``Giving us drugs in the form of more
money does not help Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's assessment came as Primakov's team is struggling to
put together an economic plan to rescue the nation from its
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant Daily reported on Wednesday that Yuri
Maslyukov, the Communist aide who oversees economic policy, was
urging the nationalization of commercial banks, the creation of a
government Reconstruction and Development Bank to funnel credits to
Russian industry and a large increase in the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting disarray within the government's ranks, Viktor
Gerashchenko, the Communist who is head of the central bank, said
later that he differed with some of these proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov said that most of the government's plans appeared to be
very sketchy when he left government a few days ago and that the
nation's top leaders had little sense of what to do.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin had all but detached himself from
economic policy, preferring to spend his limited energy on
diplomatic issues, Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not really work for long on any program,'' Fyodorov
said. ``The president is 99 percent'' about military and foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, the former foreign minister and intelligence chief who
became prime minister this month, has the primary responsibility
for the economy. But he has little understanding of the intricacies
of modern economics and tax policy, Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very far from the economy all his life,'' Fyodorov
said. ``I think at this stage he practically does not understand
it.

BURBA READY FOR THE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Mike Hargrove made it clear to Dave Burba what he
wanted from his new long reliever before Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians manager's speech was partly a pep talk, but part may
have been premonition. Although Hargrove had penciled in Doc Gooden
as the starter, he wanted Burba, a starter in 31 of his 32
appearances this season, to be ``on call'' all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dave before the ballgame that I wanted him available
from the first pitch on,'' said Hargrove, ``because even if Doc got
in a little bit of trouble, I wasn't going to mess around. I was
going to go to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Burba found himself on the mound when Gooden was
ejected by plate umpire Joe Brinkman for protesting a play at home
after throwing only 22 pitches in the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   All Burba did was respond with perhaps a series-saving
performance. He worked 5 1/3 strong innings, allowing four hits and
three runs, as the Indians beat the Red Sox, 9-5, and tied the
best-of-five American League Division Series at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   For Burba, the last week had been a deflating experience. A
starter in Hargrove's rotation all season, the righthander had won
15 games, as many as anyone on the staff. But, facing a short
series, Hargrove had to decide whether Gooden or Burba would join
Jaret Wright, Charles Nagy, and Bartolo Colon in the playoff
rotation. The odd man out would be relegated to long relief.
</P>
<P>
   Burba didn't really like the role, but he was prepared for it
mentally, if not physically. ``I was just stretching in the
bullpen,'' he said. ``When I saw Doc get thrown out, I knew I was
going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba's one bonus was that he was allowed as much time as he
needed to prepare, because in the case of ejections and injuries,
relievers are allowed unlimited warmup pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Burba, ``was a huge advantage for me. I could go
about getting ready almost like it was a normal start. I could tell
what pitches were working.''
</P>
<P>
   After working his way out of the mess _ and the 2-0 deficit _
that had been created when first Hargrove and then Gooden were
tossed for altercations with Brinkman, Burba settled into a rhythm
that had the Red Sox off balance for the next five innings.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed a run in the third, but by then, the Indians owned a
7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the sixth, Burba was starting to wobble, allowing the Red Sox
to load the bases with none out. But he took the heat out of the
rally by inducing Darren Bragg to hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Third base coach Jeff Newman, filling in for Hargrove, felt
Burba had done more than his share and went further into his
bullpen to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 45,229 at Jacobs Field responded with a
standing ovation in appreciation of Burba's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Burba feels his role will remain the same for the rest of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Mike had stated it to me earlier when he told me
that I would be in the bullpen for the playoffs,'' Burba said. ``He
told me I was best suited for that situation because I had the
experience. Especially the way I pitched today, I don't think it's
going to vary one way or another whether I start or relieve. I
think that Mike is pretty happy with the way things went today, and
I probably will remain in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove isn't so sure. ``Right now I look at (Gooden and Burba)
changing roles here for a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's role was just fine with Burba.

 &HT;    Young student pushes peers to excel in school
 &HT;    By Derek Ali

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Children all over the world want to be like Mike.
</P>
<P>
   But after his exhilarating, edge-of-the-seat, motivational
presentation Wednesday, students at Van Cleve School for the Arts
want to be like Donte'.
</P>
<P>
   That's Donte' Shackelford, a 12-year-old Fairview student who
has already written a book (School Is My Job), served as a
consultant for a DMHA youth program and shared stages at Ohio
rallies with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Bishop Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be like him and get good grades,'' said Dontay
Oliver, 10, a fifth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Donte's baby face belies his ability to generate floor-shaking
enthusiasm while leading more than 400 students in chants. The
self-described ``infotainer'' even got the teachers and staff
rocking to his beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is your job, there is no excuse for failure. If you
can't read, you can't write. If you can't write, you can't spell.
If you can't spell, you will fail. If you fail, you will sell. If
you sell, you sail, straight to jail'' he shouted, reciting from a
poem from his book.
</P>
<P>
   Students clearly saw the charismatic, 4' 8'', 80-pound
youngster. What they didn't see was his hard work and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Donte', who has been a motivational speaker since he was 4 years
old, spends at least four hours daily practicing and studying and
researching material he presents publicly. That's after six hours
of school, an hour of homework and 30 to 45 minutes of chores.
</P>
<P>
   Don Blanton, the student assistance provider at Van Cleve, said
he invited Donte' because he can ``help motivate our students in
their school work and show them how important school is and what
school can do for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Donte' said, ``I'm glad kids my age, my peer group, are looking
up to me. I'm also glad knowing they can do it too. All they have
to do is put their minds to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerrelle Franks, a 12-year-old sixth grader said, ``I think it
was a good program because they were communicating to the little
kids to keep them in school and not to do drugs. This program's
original to the kids and they reached out to the kids very
strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Donte's interest in motivational speaking grew from observing
his role model and uncle, Black Brothers Involved/Black Sisters
Involved founder, Marlon Shackelford. Shackelford, his 4-year-old
son Marlon Jr. and 7-year-old Andre Peterson, also participated in
Wednesday's program.
</P>
<P>
   Donte' described the elder Shackelford as ``my mentor, my
friend, my surrogate father and role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Shackelford and his wife, Pam, are Donte's first audience,
Shackelford said. ``We look at good, excellent and great. The goal
for him right now is to be excellent so he can one day become
great. Our definition for great is when you can take your gift and
help others.''

VALENTIN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The game began at 1:07 p.m. By 1:09, Jacobs Field
had been transformed into the Land of the Attitudinal. You saw
players cursing umpires, umpires cursing players, and a manager
getting ejected after watching only three pitches. And all that
happened before an umpire named Joe Brinkman got cussed out for
what he saw, or didn't see, on a first-inning play at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that Midwesterners have the gentlest souls
in the nation. If that is true, those peaceful types weren't among
the 45,229 fans here Wednesday for Game 2 of the Red Sox-Indians
American League Division Series. We're not saying it was hostile.
We're not saying people should have chilled out and listened to
some tapes of waves rolling and birds chirping. We'll just direct
you to The Play at the plate, a play that established the rhythm of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I out?'' Sox third baseman John Valentin asked, long after
his team lost, 9-5. He was talking about The Play. He was told he
was definitely out. ``Oh, (expletive),'' he said. He smiled. It was
strange. You would have fainted if you had seen anyone smile two
hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove had been thrown out of the
game for arguing balls and strikes with Brinkman, Indians starter
Dwight Gooden decided he would go back to work and not worry about
the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was challenging me,'' Gooden said. ``He was taking off
his mask and saying something. I couldn't even understand what he
was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden stopped listening. He had to deal with Valentin on first
base and Darren Lewis on third. So the man everyone knows as Doc
struck out Mo Vaughn for his only out of the day. But Nomar
Garciaparra got ahold of Gooden's 22d and last pitch, a fastball,
and drove it to left field. Lewis scored easily. Valentin had been
running on contact and was already heading toward third when he saw
left fielder Brian Giles with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that Giles made a clean pick of the ball off the wall,''
Valentin said. ``I knew it would be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Except it wasn't close. The ball came in to catcher Sandy Alomar
long before Valentin got to the plate. Alomar did all the things
they teach you in Little League. He blocked the runner's path. And
he tagged him on the forearm. You looked for the ball to squirt out
of the glove; it didn't. You looked for some quirk, some
complicated slide that would allow Valentin to score; neither was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see the replay?'' Alomar said. ``I saw it three times.
I tagged him. It wasn't even close.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman didn't think so. In fact, he didn't think a lot of
things. He thought Gooden was throwing balls rather than strikes.
He thought Gooden was showing him up and tried to tell him about
it, gesturing toward the mound. ``I couldn't hear him,'' Alomar
said of the umpire. ``It's so much noise out there, sometimes you
can't hear people standing real close to you.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brinkman called Valentin safe at the plate when he obviously
was not safe. The score was 2-0. Gooden went up to Brinkman and
said, ``Get in the (expletive) game.'' Brinkman told Gooden to get
out of the game. The pitcher charged after the umpire. The crowd
cursed and gestured at Brinkman, too. Hours later, a television
reporter would do a live report, saying Brinkman needed an attitude
adjustment. And a radio reporter would tell his listeners that he
had a problem with Brinkman because he sets up ``in a different
area code than the catcher'' to do the very intimate job of calling
balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying it was a hostile scene, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's teammates held him back. You could read his lips and
see that he was not saying very nice things. Earlier, Hargrove
could be seen telling Brinkman, ``Don't (expletive) touch me.''
After the game, Gooden said he had no intentions of hurting the
umpire. ``I just wanted to give him my hat and glove and tell him
that he could pitch,'' Gooden explained.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Cleveland clubhouse said the incident inspired the
team, a team that has been playing placidly for the past couple of
months. By the second inning, the Indians had scored six runs and
gotten the best of Tim Wakefield. It was obvious that the series
was going to be tied. And in the ninth inning, when Mike Jackson
and Valentin had words after the reliever threw inside, it was also
obvious that animosity was going to be hanging around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wearing those elbow pads for a reason,'' Jackson said.
``It looked like he was trying to dive into the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin said he was just playing his game. And Alomar said the
two men just had ``a misunderstanding.'' It certainly wasn't the
first one of the day.

DAVID SCHIPPERS: DEMOCRATIC OUTSIDER LEADS GOP INQUIRY ON CLINTON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (deletes repeated grafs 9 and 10, `Democrats have complained...'
and `It is Schippers' task...')   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Schippers, chief investigator on the House
Judiciary Committee, and his boss, Rep. Henry Hyde, bowed their
heads together at a ceremony in Cleveland three years ago and left
church a pair of papal knights.
</P>
<P>
   The honor, given to several hundred Roman Catholics who promote
the church's interests, rekindled the two men's acquaintance,
Schippers said, but it also bestowed on them privileges, like
trotting into a Catholic church on a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I run into anyone on the way to the gallows,'' Schippers
also said, ``I can pardon them.''
</P>
<P>
   That may seem an unlikely stroke of charity for the lawyer
heading the Republican inquiry into possible impeachment charges
against the president of the United States. But President Clinton
could do much worse than Schippers, a salty Chicagoan whose
Democratic bloodline runs hard through a clan of police captains
and firefighters, and, most recently, a ``radical feminist''
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm a Democrat, that is not a title,'' he said,
clearly relishing his role as outsider on the committee, ``that is
a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Schippers was the man chosen to face off against
Clinton, a president he voted for twice, was a curious stroke on
the part of Hyde and Republican leaders, who hope, against most
odds, to maintain at least the veneer of bipartisanship during the
inquiry. So far, the proceedings have been chiefly marked by raw
party disputes, and Schippers has had little power to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day the panel will vote on whether to proceed
with an impeachment inquiry, Schippers will formally address the
Judiciary Committee for the first time, as he and his Democratic
counterpart, Abbe Lowell, discuss the evidence sent to Congress by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Democrats have complained that,
so far, committee staff members have spent most of their time
poring over the documents simply to decide what to release, not to
judge their substance.
</P>
<P>
   It is Schippers' task, as well as Lowell's, to analyze the
evidence and determine whether Starr's case is legally sound,
leaving it up to the committee to decide whether to go forward with
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rancor on the panel, Schippers said he would strive
for fairness, regardless of the difficulties, something his current
and former colleagues say has characterized his style since way
back. And he is likely to go about it in an unorthodox manner, at
least for Washington, keeping a respectable distance from the
television lights, the city's power clutch and the carpeted aisles
at Brooks Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Schippers chose to ignore Washington's stable of
lawyers and criminal investigators, bringing with him a team of
specialists from Chicago, including former prosecutors, agents from
the FBI and Internal Revenue Service, and the current tactical
sergeant for the Chicago Police Department. He also brought his son
on board as a lawyer, which left him open to charges of nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``zero'' Harvard Law School graduates on the team, he
said. ``These lawyers are all guys who squeaked through law school
in South America, for all I know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers agreed to take the Judiciary Committee job in March,
he said, because Hyde asked him. ``The last thing in the world I
wanted is to come out here and do this,'' said the 68-year-old
defense lawyer and former prosecutor who first met Hyde in 1969,
when they both served on an anti-crime panel in Chicago. ``I
figured I had put in my time. I had no political or professional
ambition. I don't want to write books or go on television or be a
big star. My philosophy is come out here, do the job and get out,
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Schippers sees it, he has already peaked professionally,
at 30, back when he slapped handcuffs around the wrists of
legendary Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana.
</P>
<P>
   That was during the 1960s, when Schippers fell in with Robert
Kennedy's gangbusters vision and went to work for the Justice
Department. He eventually became the chief of the organized crime
and racketeering section in Chicago, where he came up with a plan
to immunize Giancana, which got him laughed out of every boss'
office along the food chain until he got to the attorney general
himself, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we immunized Giancana, that started the house of cards
falling in the Chicago outfit for two, three years there,''
Schippers said.
</P>
<P>
   His run-ins with ``the outfit'' never worried him too much, he
said. ``I wouldn't screw around with their family and they wouldn't
screw around with mine,'' he said. ``It was an unholy agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neighbors could not help but feel a pang of anxiety
about the possibility of a neighborhood blood bath, so, one week,
they took up a collection, knocked on Schippers' door and handed
him a gift. It was a set of oversized numbers for the front of his
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want anybody to make a mistake, am I right?''
Schippers asked his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Justice Department in 1967, Schippers went
into private practice and made a living defending a ``jillion'' law
enforcement agents and wading though labor cases. More recently, he
dabbled in sexual harassment lawsuits, on both sides of the issue,
and spent time on cases involving race and religious
discrimination. He is also on the public defender's panel, taking
any case offered to him that does not involve the mob or drug
peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' rumpled demeanor and streetwise, self-effacing charm
tend to dust over a streak so tough that even one of his daughters
was stunned to see that side of him during a courtroom visit.
Although not as smooth and intellectual as his counterpart, Lowell,
he brings doses of common sense to the job, colleagues and aides
say, and few reasons to blur his focus, mostly because he is near
retirement and does not crave the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings an extraordinary sense of fairness to whatever he
does, practical and in a legal sense,'' said Daniel Martin, a
lawyer with the Federal Defender Program who has worked as
co-counsel with Schippers on several long cases. ``He's a very
pragmatic man who can separate the wheat from the chaff.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he thought that Schippers would bring to the table a
touch of something else that was now sorely lacking in the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's the kind of fellow who gets too involved in
the partisan issues,'' he said, although Republican aides said he
had been tough on Democrats, perhaps to show he can be impartial.
``To the extent that this can be a charade or a Republican witch
hunt, he won't fall prey to that. He won't fall prey to
counter-opinions, either. It's probably one reason why Hyde tapped
into him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a childhood spent at Wrigley Field and in parochial
school, Schippers said he thought about joining the priesthood
during a stint at Quigley South Preparatory Seminary. Then he
decided that ``women were not just soft boys,'' and that he had had
``enough of this nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   He married, and Catholic to the core, he said, began ``producing
children at an obscene rate'' _ ten in all, to be precise, children
who in turn gave him 25 grandchildren. Evenings, he attended Loyola
Law School, a pursuit that crossed his mind at the seminary, when,
after taking a test, a priest told him he had managed to get every
answer wrong, but every reason right.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent a lot of time fishing recently, at least until the
call came in January from Hyde, a casual longtime friend. Hyde told
Schippers' at the time that his task would be to set up a framework
for overseeing the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But ``between the first call and the actual personal meeting,
guess what happened?'' Schippers asked. ``Here comes the beret.''

JUSTICE HAS A RED SOX-BEATING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Game 1 produced one hit in four at-bats during a
dismal 11-3 pounding. It also produced something else in David
Justice: a sense of urgency, if not anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cleveland Indians were to make a repeat trip to the World
Series as American League champions, if they even were to get as
far as the AL Championship Series, they could not afford to fall
behind by two games to the Red Sox in the best-of-five AL Division
Series _ at home, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Justice knew what was at stake here. As a playoff veteran, the
Indians designated hitter also knew that the momentum of a series
can sometimes be changed by one person.
</P>
<P>
   This was how he responded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   First inning; Red Sox leading, 2-0; Indian runner on third, one
out: Boom. Justice lofts a fly to deep center, scoring Kenny
Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   Second inning; Indians leading, 3-2; two out; runners at second
and third: Boom. Justice homers into the right-field stands off
reliever John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, a close game becomes a laugher and the Indians
are on their way to a 9-5 victory and a 1-1 series tie heading to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, who has struggled all season after coming back from
knee surgery, made it clear that he understands his role against
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston never gives up,'' he said. ``I don't think you can
score enough runs to make them lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice's power totals have been down this year _ 21 home runs,
88 RBIs _ but the 32-year-old veteran, once a staple of the Atlanta
Braves' championship outfield, believes his knee has something to
do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my power stroke goes hand in hand with my consistency
in hitting,'' said Justice. ``When I came off my knee surgery, my
knee bothered me. When it was sore, I wasn't able to drive the ball
like I know I'm capable of. When it's gotten stronger and felt
pretty good, I hit the ball pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice, Lofton, Sandy Alomar, and Manny Ramirez collected eight
of the Indians' nine hits and all eight of their RBIs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Indians are to knock off the Red Sox, Justice knows such
production must continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had Kenny and Sandy up here, we'd tell you we'd love to
play our best every game,'' Justice said. ``But I think our fans
understand the effort we put forward. I'm happy we came out and
swung the bats well _ myself, Sandy and Kenny and a few other guys.
We needed this game. We needed to score runs because I felt the Red
Sox were going to score. We have to score. I do feel satisfied that
we swung the bats well, and we just have to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove also knows where the Indians must look for
help. ``Those are the three guys that everybody targeted here that
had off years,'' said Hargrove, referring to Justice, Lofton, and
Alomar. ``I think it's ironic that these guys have stepped up big
the way they have. It doesn't surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're winners, they're good players, and they're good
hitters. They have been good in big situations in the past and they
continue to be.''

`THE IMPOSTERS' RUN OUT OF STEAM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Rich Irwin) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget sinking an ocean liner or restaging the
Normandy Invasion. The toughest thing to do in movies is make a
successful farce. Stanley Tucci, who wrote and co-directed the
sleeper hit ``Big Night'' two years ago, gives it a game try with
his new film, ``The Impostors,'' and he triumphs over the form for
about an hour. After that, the wheels come off, the manic energy
begins to flag and the film dissolves into the froth. Farce claims
another victim.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean ``The Impostors'' doesn't have its moments. It
has quite a few good bits, in fact. The movie begins with a
brilliant piece of silent filmmaking that calls to mind the best
work of Buster Keaton. Mixed in with the opening credits, two men,
Arthur (Tucci) and Maurice (Oliver Platt) are shown quarreling at
an outdoor cafe. Tensions escalate, a knife is pulled and Platt
dramatically keels over dead. It looks like Laurel and Hardy have
gone gangster.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice isn't really dead, of course. It turns out that he and
Arthur are perpetually out-of-work actors who go around New York
staging these kinds of scenes to practice their craft. In this
case, Arthur is very upset because it was his turn to die. ``You
stole my death,'' he complains bitterly. Arthur lives to die, you
see.
</P>
<P>
   After an attempt to extort a few cream puffs from a baker goes
hilariously awry, Arthur and Maurice find themselves with tickets
to the theater as a consolation prize. They go, even though the
show stars a hambone actor, Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina), whom
they despise. One thing leads to another, and soon the two are on
the run from police over a misunderstood altercation with Burtom in
a bar. Maurice and Arthur hide in a crate, which, naturally, gets
loaded on a departing ocean liner which, naturally, counts Burtom
as one of its passengers. So the chase continues, this time on
water.
</P>
<P>
   The ship contains a wide assortment of oddballs and Tucci has
cast some of the independent film world's finest actors wonderfully
against type to play them. Lili Taylor, usually the social outcast,
plays Lily, the ship's ingenue head stewardess, while the beautiful
Hope Taylor portrays a comically morose passenger. (``All is
death,'' she says with utter conviction.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Buscemi is a suicidal lounge singer, Campbell Scott the
German head steward with eyes for Lily, and Billy Connolly a tennis
pro with improbable eyes for Maurice. (His pickup line: ``I once
wrestled a man on the steps of the Acropolis when the sun was at
its peak, wearing only what God Almighty sent me into the world
with. Can you picture that?'') Woody Allen also has an unbilled
cameo as a Broadway director.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone looks like they're having a ball, and the cast's
enthusiasm for the material proves contagious. There are many
laugh-out-loud moments. Unfortunately, Tucci isn't able to sustain
the momentum throughout the entire film. The turning point comes
when the plot abruptly reverses course, with Arthur and Maurice
doing the chasing instead of being chased. From there, ``The
Impostors'' takes on a forced, stilted tone. Too many characters
and too many subplots sink this movie faster than the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough business,'' Tucci's Arthur says at one point
about acting.
</P>
<P>
   He could well have been talking about making a farce, too.

DOLE URGES GOP FAIRNESS IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader and
presidential candidate, warned Wednesday that to avoid a backlash,
congressional Republicans must be scrupulously fair as they move
toward an impeachment inquiry into President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans have to be very careful,'' Dole said at a
Boston campaign stop. ``When you are the majority party, I don't
care what the issue is, you've got to be very, very careful that
you are not only fair, but that you are perceived as being fair,
and it really is not only perception, it is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Senate Republican leader also said that if both sides
wanted, he might be willing to play an elder statesman's role in
the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were asked by people on each side to try to be helpful, I
think obviously you have an obligation to do things like that,''
said Dole, who was in Massachusetts to endorse the former
congressman, Peter G. Torkildsen, in his rematch battle against US
Representative John F. Tierney in the 6th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Dole said he thinks that the inquiry into President Clinton's
conduct must move forward, and that all the facts must be fully
examined before any resolution is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Republican said the key vote on an impeachment
inquiry would take place not in the highly polarized House
Judiciary Committee, but on the House floor. He also recommended
that Republicans model their process on the Watergate congressional
inquiry, which was managed by the majority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess at least half the Democrats are going to vote
for it, maybe more,'' Dole said. ``I mean, if they take some of the
Democratic concerns and use the old Watergate resolutions drafted
by Democrats, how are Democrats going to vote against it?''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat and member
of the House Judiciary Committee, disputed that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Watergate, the evidence was released only after the
committee had reviewed it thoroughly and established its relevance
to the case against President Nixon,'' Meehan said in a separate
interview. ``It would be impossible, even retroactively, to follow
the precedent set under Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, mayors from 41 cities signed a letter to
Congress urging them to decide Clinton's fate quickly and to focus
on solving the problems facing American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, delivered Tuesday to congressional leaders, was
signed mainly by Democrats, but included Republicans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said his colleagues are frustrated
that the legislative process has been ``paralyzed'' over the Monica
S. Lewinsky scandal. Menino thinks that the public humiliation
Clinton has suffered should be punishment enough, and he is opposed
to impeachment or censure.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Investigators were trying Wednesday to
get a wounded ethnic Albanian man who survived a mass shooting out
of Serbia to testify about the execution at a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, about 35 years old, was among 14 men who were
ordered to lie face-down against a fence and systematically shot by
one or more Serbs, said Western diplomats who interviewed the man
on Tuesday. His identity was kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The witness was shot in his left arm and leg and badly wounded,
but managed to survive by pretending to be dead, diplomats said the
man told them.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators from the International War Crimes Tribunal,
based in the Hague, Netherlands, were in Kosovo Wednesday to look
into the matter, one of two executions of ethnic Albanians that
witnesses said Serbian forces carried out in central Kosovo on
Saturday. The 13 men were killed in the village of Golubovac, while
18 members of an extended family were killed about four miles away
near Gornji Obrinje.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities Wednesday denied that their forces were
involved in the killing of the 18 women, children and elderly
people of the Deliaj clan near Gornji Obrinje. But the Serbian
authorities did not address the question of culpability for the 13
deaths in Golubovac that the survivor said he had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   The killings took place in an area where Serbian forces had been
shelling and burning villages in a campaign of intimidation against
ethnic Albanian civilians. Kosovo, once an autonomous province, is
fighting for independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Bozidar Filic, the Serbian police spokesman in Pristina,
the capital of Kosovo, said Wednesday that it was not possible that
Serbian police had shot the civilians in Gornji Obrinje. Police
units involved in ``breaking up terrorist bands'' in the area were
under the direct command of their superior officers who submitted
regular reports about their activities, he said. The officers, he
said, did not report any incidents involving the killing of women,
children or the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army did not issue any statements Wednesday,
although witnesses implicated them in the deaths of the Deliaj
family.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the official Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, which
usually reflects the position of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, said the reports of the killings of the Deliaj clan were
made by ``foreign media'' anxious to advance the calls for NATO
intervention in the conflict between the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have called on Milosevic in the last week to end
his tank and artillery operations against the separatist guerrillas
and attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians and their property or face
possible military action.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent move to comply with the NATO demands, the Serbian
government said on Monday that the offensive had ended and all was
quiet in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Two long convoys of Serbian police and Yugoslav troops were seen
by Western diplomatic monitors on the roads Wednesday, indicating
the offensive might be over. One was heading north to Pristina, the
other was heading out of Pristina farther north.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats and monitors remained unconvinced. It was
``too early to say'' whether the convoys on the move were merely
intended to make it ``look as though the troops were going back to
barracks,'' one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor told diplomats that 14 men between the ages of 18
and 35 from different villages in the area had been selected for a
firing line from a larger group of men. They were told to lie face
down on the ground against the fence of a house, the survivor said.
After shots were fired by what the survivor described as at least
one Serbian policeman but possibly more, one of the Albanian men
cried out that he was still alive. The man who cried out was
immediately shot dead, the survivor recounted.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were said to have been returned to their villages and
buried before diplomats arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the survivor, Western officials here said that the
killing of the 13 Albanian males provided the best case for
prosecution at the war crimes tribunal, which has established
jurisdiction over the Kosovo conflict. Another witness, Adem
Hoxhaj, said he saw the shooting from nearby.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the most vivid description so far of the shooting
of the Deliaj clan came from a member of the family who said he saw
Serbian forces approach but did not see the actual slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the diplomats said the survivor was ``an important
witness'' and ``we are very concerned about getting him to the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to get the survivor to the Hague is developing
into a test case of how the tribunal can exercise jurisdiction in
Serbia, which is now the dominant part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government has refused to recognize the authority of
the war crimes tribunal and granted visas for only two
investigators from the Hague. One of the tribunal investigators was
scheduled to talk to the survivor Wednesday, a Western official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, who are police detectives on loan to the
tribunal, have no power of extradition or mandate to decide how to
get the survivor who remains seriously wounded and needs medical
treatment, to the Hague. The investigators were discussing with the
International Committee of the Red Cross and Western diplomats how
to proceed, the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, lashed out at the foreign
press Wednesday for some reports of the civilian killings that
mentioned the possibility that they were a reprisal for the
reported deaths of Serbian police officers killed recently when
their vehicle hit a land mine in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policemen are mentioned now, but only in the context of
speculation that Albanian civilians were killed in retaliation,''
Tanjug said. The news agency said seven police officers were killed
in the incident while other reports said five died. Mines in that
area, a former stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, are
believed to have been planted by the separatist fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Western monitors assessing the military situation in Kosovo said
there was significantly less shelling Wednesday. But shells were
fired at four villages east of Suva Reka Wednesday morning, an area
that had been sealed by the Serbs until Wednesday, monitors said.
Columns of smoke from burning buildings were easy to see a few
miles away Wednesday, and people who had fled their homes said
there were Serbian police around their village.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Vranici, men and women were returning to their homes
after an ordeal with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, they heard warning shots that an attack on
the village was under way, so they fled up the mountain in a
caravan of vehicles. On Monday morning, Serbian police invited them
to come back, saying they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   But when they agreed to return, the villagers said, police took
about 250 men, loaded them onto buses and took them away. The women
were bused away separately, they said. Many of the women were
returned to the village on Monday and others Wednesday. Late
Wednesday afternoon many of the men were returned as well. They
said about 50 of their number were still in Serbian custody.
</P>
<P>
   On their return Wednesday afternoon, the villagers found the
bodies of two ethnic Albanian men on the ground at the mosque of
Vranici. One of them, Hafir Elshani, had been shot in the chest and
his nose had been cut off. The other man, Milam Bugari, had been
shot at close range behind the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers found that many of the convoy of 250 or so cars
and tractors they had abandoned on Sunday had been set on fire or
vandalized and their belongings had been strewn on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Because Milosevic has been criticized by the West for allowing
about 50,000 Albanian refugees to live outdoors, the operation by
Serb police in Vranici seemed designed to create chaos and fear but
insure that those forced to flee their homes would not end up in
the forest.

   JERUSALEM _ Thirteen Israeli soldiers and 11 Palestinian
passers-by were wounded Wednesday when a Palestinian hurled
grenades at an Israeli patrol post in the heart of the divided city
of Hebron, a flash point for violent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the attack took place at 4:30 p.m., close to
a Jewish settler enclave that borders on the casbah, the
Palestinian open-air market, in the Israeli-controlled sector.
Soldiers pursued the suspect, they said, shooting and wounding him
in the leg before he escaped into Palestinian territory, where the
Palestinian police were in charge of apprehending him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand widespread searches to find those responsible,''
Yitzhak Eitan, the Israeli commander for the West Bank, said at a
briefing Wednesday night. ``We demand the Palestinians take
responsibility for what happened here, and to prevent attacks on
Israeli targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebron, a city of 120,000, has been a tinderbox since it was
divided in early 1997 by the last peace agreement signed by the
Israelis and the Palestinians. Israel remains in control of 20
percent of the city, where some 450 Jewish settlers live in armed
compounds, protected by a recently beefed up force of about 2,000
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions run at a constant high, with routine sniper fire and
rock-throwing between the two sides, who live so close together
that the pungent smell of Arab spices wafts through the barbed wire
into the settlers' apartments. But tensions flared with the killing
of a rabbi in late August, after which the settlers raged through
the casbah, overturning produce stands. Just Monday, a Jewish
tourist was shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron was the last city turned over to even partial Palestinian
control as peace talks have been stalled for more than a year and a
half. But in Washington this week, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed to the
essentials of a pact whereby Israel would withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank, if the Palestinians act to insure Israeli
security and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers, who oppose the withdrawal, seized on the attack _
and the suspects' escape into Palestinian territory _ as evidence
that their opposition is warranted. ``That 13 percent is just
another 13 percent of land for them to prepare their attacks and
run back into, as we saw today,'' said David Wilder, a spokesman
for the settlers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, too, linked Wednesday's attack to the
peace talks, saying it could give Netanyahu a last-minute excuse to
walk away from the negotiations, which are supposed to culminate in
a three-way summit meeting in Washington in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever was behind this incident was obviously trying to
thwart the peace agreement,'' Jibril Rajoub, chief of preventive
security in the West Bank, said in an interview. ``If the one who
was behind it was a Palestinian, then it is a free service for
Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub said he was investigating the attack, which he denounced.
``We were informed by Israelis that the one who was behind it
escaped to our areas,'' he said. ``We are checking. But we have no
evidence regarding this accusation.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, Palestinian security officials announced that
they had raided and dismantled a terrorist explosives laboratory in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   After the grenade attack, the Israeli Army imposed a curfew on
Palestinian residents. Jewish settlers were briefly held at the
Cave of the Patriarchs _ believed to be the burial place of the
biblical Abraham _ after they finished the prayers of the Yom
Kippur holiday, then were allowed to move freely through the city
center.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian witnesses asserted that the incident happened
differently, and that Jewish settlers played a role in the
violence. After visiting the wounded, a Palestinian Authority
official, Ali Kawasmeh, said some believed that a settler had
thrown something into a Palestinian jitney that exploded during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Army officials were skeptical, saying that one of
the two grenades aimed at the patrol post had rolled under the
jitney instead. And Palestinian security officials discounted their
version, too.

CLINTON EXULTS IN FIRST US BUDGET SURPLUS IN 29 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Wednesday celebrated the first US
budget surplus in 29 years, calling it a ``gift-giving achievement
for generations'' and an example of America ``at the top of its
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the last day of the 1998 fiscal year to announce
the estimated $70 billion surplus, wretching up a debate with
Republicans over who should claim credit for the surplus and how it
should be used.
</P>
<P>
   At an elaborate ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building
near the White House, Democrats lavished Clinton with praise for
his stewardship of the improved economy. The president, in turn,
gave some of the credit to Democrats who voted for his 1993
economic plan, which raised taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers and
cut government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned Republicans to resist the election-year urge to
cut taxes and not ``start spending a little here, a little there, a
little yonder on the tax cuts just because we're a few weeks before
an election,'' and to reserve the surplus for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders countered that it was Clinton who was trying
to spend the surplus, not on a tax cut but on government programs.
They criticized him for failing to give them credit for the
surplus, and argued that they were the original deficit hawks who
held Clinton's feet to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the president seems to want to take credit for balancing
the budget and building the surplus...the credit belongs to the
American taxpayer, the Federal Reserve Board and yes, the combined
efforts of Congress and Congresses, the president, this one, past
presidents,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the chairman of the
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton said the $70 billion surplus, which is an based
on an estimate and will not be official until the end of the month,
``launches a new era of budgets and surpluses,'' his former labor
secretary, Robert B. Reich said such an assessment was
``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, who teaches economics at Brandeis University, said the
surplus was largely a result of tax revenues from affluent
taxpayers who have benefited from the booming economy, and that the
economy probably wouldn't continue to grow at its current pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will enter into a recession, at some point, probably within
the next few years, and then tax receipts, even from the
higher-income individuals, will likely fall,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, looming liabilites connected to Social Security and
Medicare, which are not expected to have enough money to pay their
bills as the nation's population ages, will affect the budget,
which showed a record $290 billion deficit for 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nation's $5 trillion-plus debt that resulted from
years of deficit spending, the surplus was greeted with fanfare by
the White House, which invited seven former Democratic members of
Congress who lost their bids for re-election after supporting
Clinton's 1993 economic plan to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Also invited was Kay McClure, who owns a family business in West
Virginia that makes precision tools for heavy construction
projects. She credited the company's expansion to an improved
economy and low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A billboard with flashing orange lights heralded the surplus,
which the White House sought to put in context, saying that the
last time there was a surplus was when Neil Armstrong walked on the
Moon, a can of Coca-Cola was 15 cents and the Boston Celtics were
the NBA champs. The past year's surplus is the largest ever in
dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   Besides celebrating the surplus, Clinton promoted his proposed
budget, which includes tax credits in such areas as education and
child care, offering it up as an alternative to using the surplus
for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against tax cuts,'' Clinton said. ``But we don't
take any money out of the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a tax cut ``is a popular thing, particularly right here,
just four weeks and change before an election day, to serve up a
tax cut,'' Clinton said, would be wrong before Social Security had
been shored up.
</P>
<P>
   The American people, he said, ``have waited 29 years, and I
think most Americans would like to see the ink change from red to
black and then dry a little before we put it at risk.''

INDIANS WHIP BOSOX, 9-5, RESPONDING TO EARLY LOSS OF GOODEN AND
HARGROVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The tale of two pitchers nearly turned into the tale
of the tape Wednesday when the anxious Cleveland Indians met the
Boston Red Sox in Game 2 of this American League division series at
Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be a showdown between Dwight Gooden, the
once- celebrated veteran in search of his first post-season
victory, and Tim Wakefield, Boston's soft-throwing knuckleball
pitcher, became something akin to a pre-fight press conference gone
awry, with Gooden, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove and home plate
umpire Joe Brinkman exchanging everything but punches only minutes
after the game's first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's yelling, cursing and posturing resulted in the
ejections of Hargrove and Gooden before the day's second out had
been recorded and had the crowd of 45,229 spectators screaming for
Brinkman's neck. The fans' hostility must have been accompanied by
panic as everything pointed to their Indians, who had dropped six
of their last seven games, losing their second contest in as many
days and being on the brink of elimination from this
three-of-five-games series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians, all but written off by many onlookers after
Tuesday's Game 1 debacle, responded to the adversity by fighting to
a 9-5 victory that restored their hopes of winning a second
straight pennant and evened the series at one game apiece heading
into Friday's Game 3 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   With four hits, including doubles by Sandy Alomar and Kenny
Lofton and a homer by David Justice, the Indians scored five runs
in the second inning to take the lead for good and knock Wakefield
out of the game after 1 1/3 innings. The Cleveland right hander
Dave Burba, a starter during the season, earned the victory,
allowing three runs on four hits in 5 1/3 innings in relief of
Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, who doubled in the sixth and scored Cleveland's eighth
run when Manny Ramirez doubled in the next at bat, said the
ejections inspired the Indians, who led by 6-2 after two innings
and 7-3 after three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew how important this game was but I think what
happened in the first inning really upped our intensity,'' Justice
said. ``I don't want to say the umpires are against us, but then
you look across the field and see the Red Sox want to beat you and
then something happens early and you feel like, `Man, everyone is
against us.' I think that makes the players dig down inside, come
together, and up our intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontations began almost immediately as Gooden began
complaining about Brinkman's calls after running the count to 3
balls, no strikes against the leadoff hitter, Darren Lewis. Without
uttering a word, the 33-year-old right hander threw his hands into
the air in exasperated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to quell a possible blowup, Hargrove went to the mound
to calm down Gooden and then headed toward Brinkman. Chest to chest
and nose to nose, the two began arguing and moments later Hargrove
was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I felt I had to, and Joe did too,'' said Hargrove,
who after being ejected and going into the dugout returned to the
field to extend his argument with Brinkman. ``For me, it's one of
those things that happens in the heat of battle. Not once would I
ever question an umpire's integrity or his competitiveness. It was
just a difference of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   His next pitch a ball, Gooden walked Lewis and then the next
batter, John Valentin, before striking out Mo Vaughn, the hero in
Boston's 11-3 Game 1 victory. Just when it seemed that Gooden's
tensions had eased, he gave up a double high off the left-field
wall to clean-up hitter Nomar Garciaparra. After Lewis scored
easily on the hit, Valentin sprinted toward the plate, hoping to
avoid shortstop Omar Vizquel's throw to Alomar at home.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Vizquel's throw reached Alomar in time and
that the catcher tagged out the sliding Valentin a couple of inches
in front of the plate. But Brinkman called him safe, giving the Red
Sox a 2-0 advantage and prompting Gooden, who was backing up Alomar
on the play, to curse at him on his way back to the mound. Without
hesitation, Brinkman ejected him, sending Gooden to the dugout with
the shortest outing of his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a situation where he was in bad position,'' said
Gooden, who had to be restrained from going after Brinkman by three
Indians coaches. ``He was right there where I was standing to see
the play. I can't even say he missed it. For whatever reason, he
wanted to say safe. I was shocked. It wasn't a bang-bang play. He
was out by a few feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman issued this written statement after the game: ``The
ejection on Hargrove was questioning balls and strikes. The
ejection on Gooden was that he screamed an expletive right in my
ear. That's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   With DWIGHT GOODEN and TIM WAKEFIELD combining for less than two
innings of work, both MIKE HARGROVE and Boston manager JIMY
WILLIAMS said Wednesday's starters might be used in relief later in
the series. Wakefield, who lost his second straight postseason game
to the Indians, said he hopes to get another start. ``I told DENNIS
ECKERSLEY that I feel like I didn't even pitch,'' Wakefield said
... The starting pitchers in Game 3 will be right hander CHARLES
NAGY (15-10, 5.22 ERA) for Cleveland and right hander BRET
SABERHAGEN (15-8, 3.96 ERA) for Boston. Saberhagen was 2-0 with a
0.75 ERA against the Indians during the regular season. &QL;

A MODERN-DAY TALE OF HEAVEN AND HELL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Rich Irwin) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Computer graphics technology has been put to all
kinds of silly cinematic uses in recent years. Think last summer's
dueling space rock movies. Think ``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, creating multiple visions of heaven and hell
seems _ make that is _ a much more uplifting purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What originally drew me in was the idea of using the
technology for making something other than an explosion, an alien
or a dinosaur,'' says Robin Williams, who plays a recently deceased
doctor wandering vivid afterlife environments in the
soul-searching, new feature film ``What Dreams May Come.'' ``That,
combined with the emotional journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a challenge trying to keep emotionally alive in the
face of all these special effects,'' adds Williams, who had to play
heart-wrenching scenes against backdrops of floating cities and
battleship graveyards _ that were created months after his
performance by complicated, work-intensive computer programs.
``When you're standing in a field full of orange balls, it's hard
to be in a state of catharsis. It's some sort of Method hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as hard, though, as creating a hell, and its opposite, that
could credibly translate the ideas of Richard Matheson's source
novel to the screen. Since making a cult hit out of Matheson's
``Somewhere in Time'' two decades ago, producer Stephen Simon has
been trying to turn his friend's novel into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon and his producing partner Barnet Bain not only had to
wait for CG technology to advance to a point where it could realize
the story's celestial dreamscapes. They had to find a director who
had a persuasive inkling of what the afterlife should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conceit of the movie is that you create your own
post-death reality,'' Simon says. ``And the script (by Ron Bass,
the superhot scripter of ``Waiting to Exhale'' and ``My Best
Friend's Wedding''), as wonderful as it was, did not distinguish
your picture from my picture, or anybody else's.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was a question of whose paradise would define
a $75 million production that would obviously have to appeal to a
wide range of people. People who, inevitably, would have varying
views on life after death.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand director Vincent Ward didn't have a clue at first.
Trained as a painter and known for such visually striking,
metaphysically themed romances as ``Navigator'' and ``Map of the
Human Heart,'' he was initially flummoxed by the story _
essentially, a kind of contemporary ``Orpheus'' in which Williams'
spirit tries to retrieve that of his suicide wife's (Annabella
Sciorra) from a psychic purgatory of her own making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in telling personal stories about individual
experiences, and I try to present them in an individual way,'' says
Ward. ``So I like to craft worlds for my central characters that
don't just relate to objective reality, but are also very much
emotional and psychological landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was faced, here, with a screenplay that I loved. But I
didn't know how you create heaven and hell in the 20th century. I
wanted to make it a visceral experience for people, and after about
a month of thinking about it, I came up with the idea of making
(Sciorra's character) a painter and art restorer.''
</P>
<P>
   That led fairly naturally _ as Williams' character passes
through various stages of death, then through other beings'
afterworlds _ to a digital display of art motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor awakens from his coma, for example, in an
impressionist-inspired field of brightly colored flowers that
squish into oily swirls. When disorientation and panic grip him, he
finds himself atop awesome mountains that, according to Ward, evoke
``romantic German painting of the 19th century, a particular look
that was tempestuous, lonely, when man was smaller than nature. All
of that seemed to serve a story about a man who's in paradise, but
his paradise is hell without the woman he loves.''
</P>
<P>
   A younger spirit's heaven resembles the warmly colorful fantasy
paintings of magazine artist Maxfield Parrish. A stairway to heaven
was influenced by a John Martin engraving, while medieval woodcuts
and Gustave Dore's infernal etchings informed some of the film's
darker dimensions. The ship's graveyard, Ward admits, ``was just an
image I had in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these fantastic realms required a year and a half's
worth of programming and virtual artistry _ Ward reckons it took
between nine and 20 man hours of post-production to create every
four seconds of CG footage. For many of the eye-popping sequences,
a process called Lidar was employed. Designed for military mapping
purposes, the laser range-finding technology supplied data that
could be used to reconstruct, in a computer, acres of footage (the
orange balls Williams mentioned were used as plotting points).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the camerawork to be like a documentary in paradise
but look like a painting, so I could just move anywhere, be
hand-held, be shot from water, whatever,'' Ward explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was to shoot (the live action) during the day, then
have the Lidar crew come in at night and map the area
three-dimensionally. The two shots would be married together
digitally later on, and then you could change all the elements you
liked. If you were adding computer-generated flowers or anything
like that, it gave you a terrain in three dimensions that you could
move through and change perspectives in.''
</P>
<P>
   All very high tech. But the digital wizardry also inspired some
very human, humorous moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I'd come and take all my clothes off and these
two guys would put dots, like Band-Aids, all over my body,''
explains Cuba Gooding Jr., who plays a kind of celestial
orientation guide who initially appears as a kind of humanoid blur.
``Then I'd put a mesh around my waist and that's how I'd do the
scene. We did this scene where I had to walk into this Baptist
church full of people at 4 in the morning. They were going, `This
boy ain't got no clothes on!' That was pretty funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Less humorous for Gooding, who is a born-again Christian, were
the film's decidedly nontraditional concepts. But after insisting
on a dialogue change or two, he was able to reconcile the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the positive message that was coming from the movie, no
matter what your religious background,'' the Oscar-winning ``Jerry
Maguire'' actor says. ``I do believe there is a heaven, I do
believe there is a hell, they're both very real. But the Bible says
that `in my house there are many mansions,' and in essence I think
that means that heaven and hell are what we imagine them to be. A
movie making that statement is something that I supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Bain, whose company, Metafilmics, is dedicated to
producing films with spiritual themes, say they hope ``Dreams''
will spark debate among viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a test screening, we walked out to the parking lot and
five people who had seen the film were having a really heated
argument about aspects of the film, how it conflicted or conformed
to their belief systems,'' Simon recalls. ``They were really,
really going after each other. Barnet and I looked at each other
and said, `We did our job.' This film provides no answers. It asks
a lot of questions, which the audience can then determine for
themselves when they go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Metafilmics was set up with a view to bringing to an audience
stories that inspire, that empower, that model relationships that
give folks greater insight into the choices they make and how they
behave,'' adds producer Bain, whose screenwriting credits range
from a British ``Carry On'' comedy to a film about Jesus.
``Metafilmics makes films about utopian futures. We have a history,
for a lot of years now, of making big, epic spectacles about
dystopias, about post-apocalyptic futures. Our company is really
about putting an end to this kind of existential, romantic,
tortured artist vision of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``This genre has the best track record of commerciality that
there is,'' Simon says of positive fantasy films. ``They just don't
make enough of 'em. If you make `Ghost,' it's an extraordinary
success, but there's no follow-up to it. You make `Die Hard,'
you're gonna make 30 imitators. But the industry is starting to
recognize that there is a hunger in the audience for movies that
really look upon our humanity as being not debauched, but something
really beautiful and extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that. Of course, statements like these leave the
Metafilmics guys open to charges of excessive New Aginess. But
they're as serene as producers can get about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? Maybe it's good, maybe it's not good, but we
are the New Age filmmakers,'' Barnet reckons. ``To have your work
reflect the biggest, most passionate questions of your life and
your relationships is terrific. To hide from it because somebody's
going to take a potshot? Look, they're going to take potshots
anyway. We might as well be out there and doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd add one word,'' Simon, always in touch with his inner
producer, says. ``If they're going to call us New Age filmmakers, I
hope they add the word `successful'.''

IT'S BEST TO TAKE HIGH ROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; TOMS PLACE, Calif. _ Great views, sheer granite, afternoon
thunderstorms, few visitors _ all can be expected from a late
summer or fall hike into Pioneer Basin over Mono Pass Trail. But
one of the 9-mile hike's biggest attractions should be appreciated
even before lacing up the wafflestompers: the starting elevation.
</P>
<P>
   At 10,300 feet, the trailhead at Mosquito Flat Trail Camp is one
of the High Sierra's tallest accesses from the east. And that makes
the climb to the trip's high point _ 11,920-foot Mono Pass _ a
veritable breeze compared to other backcountry options. Trekkers
ascend less than 1,700 feet and crest out in just 3{ miles.
</P>
<P>
   From the Inyo National Forest parking lot, a footbridge over
Rock Creek points the way toward walk-in camp sites that serve as
staging areas for backpackers. Those ready to hike will follow the
creek upstream; chipmunks scurry as the sign to the John Muir
Wilderness greets passers-by on the dusty road.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the first of many ups on the day, a junction
offers hikers the alternative of hoofing to Morgan Pass via
pristine Little Lakes Valley or to Mono Pass. Veer right to Mono
and in two turns pass the equestrian trail used by those starting
from the Rock Creek pack station. Soon the U-shaped profile of the
glacier-formed valley comes into full view and jumping trout can be
spied in the lakes for which it is named. Standing guard to the
southeast is 13,748-foot Mount Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   As the trail winds below 12,835-foot Mount Starr, it's difficult
to judge the location of Mono Pass under all that granite. But as
one passes the sign to Ruby Lake in a small, gentle basin 1.8 miles
in (elevation 11,100 feet), the route becomes apparent _ a series
of zigs and zags point west, traversing Starr's base and a clutter
of lupine and Indian paint brush. To the southwest, glorious Ruby
Lake is hemmed in by 13,451-foot Mount Mills, Mount Abbot (13,704
feet), Mount Dade (13,600-plus feet) and Bear Creek Spire
(13,720-plus feet).
</P>
<P>
   The trudging pays off as a wide bend in the trail reveals an
exceedingly simple final push north to the pass, following the
contours of Starr's western shoulder. Plan on 2{ hours to the
summit, which a sign atop states is 11,920 feet but which
topographic maps suggest is higher than 12,000 feet. William Brewer
and his survey party crossed this spot marking the boundary between
Inyo and Fresno counties on Aug. 2, 1864, but the pass might not
have been named until many years later.
</P>
<P>
   The day's goal _ Pioneer Basin _ can be spotted after trotting
beyond Summit Lake in what is now Sierra National Forest. Many
similar basins define the Mono Divide high country, but Pioneer is
the only one clearly visible from this vantage. Six switchbacks
lead to Trail Lakes (11,200 feet), a pleasant site for lunch. If
it's a tent city, which it can be in warmer months, move down
another eight zigzags to a meadow that affords stellar views of the
Mono Creek watershed.
</P>
<P>
   From here, it's 34 turns downward through foxtail pines to
Golden Creek (9,650 feet), 2.8 miles from Mono Pass. Upstream about
a mile lies Golden Lake. Instead, head downstream six switchbacks
to the junction with the trail to Fourth Recess Lake, which can be
seen through the pines en route. Bear right, and a couple of
switches later come to the turnoff to Pioneer Basin, a
three-quarter mile hike from Golden Creek. (Those who hope to
explore Mono Creek either in addition to Pioneer Basin or to its
exclusion will want to track westward from here down aptly named
Mono Creek Trail. It winds beyond the Third, Second and First
recesses and Hopkins and Laurel Creek trails to the Pacific Crest
Trail/John Muir Trail and Lake Thomas Edison.)
</P>
<P>
   At this point the day's roller-coaster ride takes an upward
swing for the last 2 miles to several secluded camp sites at the
largest of the Pioneer Basin Lakes. Note a fork eight-tenths of a
mile up; take the trail to the right, a more gradual climb that
gets one farther into the basin covering the same distance. The
other path was described as ``disturbing'' by one fellow hiker for
it is terribly steep and deeply rutted by equestrian traffic.
</P>
<P>
   After ascending a mild ridge line, the mellower track crosses
the basin's primary outlet stream; angler's take heed, for you will
want to hike down from camp later on to this spot and fish upstream
and in the brook trout-infested pond situated a short distance to
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Move up the basin to the lake, which is flagged on topo maps by
elevation 10,862; excellent camp sites are found on the eastern
shore, not far from its outlet.
</P>
<P>
   As you bed down for the evening after more than seven hours of
backpacking, think of how the journey could have been far more
exhausting had the parking lot been any lower.
</P>
<P>
   If You're Going ...
</P>
<P>
   Mono Pass Trail starts out from Mosquito Flat Trail Camp at the
terminus of Rock Creek Road, which takes visitors south from Toms
Place on Highway 395 to Little Lakes Valley.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the Eastern Sierra trailhead, drive north about six
hours on highways 5 and 14 to 395. Turn left at Toms Place, some 20
miles northwest of Bishop. Drive 10 miles to road's end and park.
Backpacker parking and a single night of camping for staging are
free.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness permits for overnight trekking into Pioneer Basin and
other backcountry sites are required during the backpacker-quota
period _ the last Friday in June through Sept. 15. Permits are $3
per person and can be reserved up to six months in advance by
calling the Inyo National Forest Wilderness Reservation Service,
(888) 374-3773.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing licenses are required for anglers ages 16 and older.

HARGROVE, GOODEN CROSSED BRINKMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ This was the first statement of the defendant, one
Dwight Gooden, in the case of Richie Phillips's Sometimes
Confrontational Men in Blue vs. Cleveland's Men in White.
</P>
<P>
   Legal beagles call a defendant's first utterances ``spontaneous
outbursts'' and often assign more credibility to them than later
versions of the same incident. Gooden would tell his story
repeatedly after Wednesday's bizarr-o baseball game between the Red
Sox and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, here are defendant Gooden's first utterances
regarding his first three pitches in a first inning that could have
come only from the mind of Monty Python:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go and ask Joe Brinkman (one of Richie Phiillips's
Confrontational Men in Blue, the plate umpire) Wednesdaywhat
happened,'' Gooden began. ``Myself? The first pitch (to Boston
leadoff hitter Darren Lewis) was obviously a ball, and the next two
I thought were strikes. I never said a word (to Brinkman).
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked in (toward Brinkman). And then he took off his
mask and then he was going off. I don't know what he was saying.
Then I just put my hands up and I was saying to myself, `Let's get
back to work and let's play the game.' I wasn't saying anything to
him. Obviously, I thought those balls to Lewis were strikes, and
when it went to ball three, I didn't say a word. (Brinkman) took
off the mask and he wanted to provoke me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Darren Lewis, a disinterested witness, gave his version.
Lewis saw the first three pitches and heard the discourse between
plaintiff Brinkman and defendant Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking at Doc (Gooden), so I don't know if he felt
they were good pitches or not,'' said Lewis. ``Basically, Joe just
told him, `They were low.' That's what the umpire said. Joe said
they were low, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove came to the
mound. ``Mike asked me what I thought of the pitches,'' said
Gooden. ``I told Mike that I thought they were strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Defendant Hargrove agreed with the version of defendant Gooden.
``I felt that Doc was a little upset and I wanted to calm him
down,'' Hargrove said in his statement to the court of public
opinion. ``I also wanted to stop anything that was going on between
him and Joe Brinkman if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas for fans of decorum, Hargrove had a word or three for
Brinkman as he headed back to the Cleveland dugout. A brouhaha
ensued. ``I'm not really getting into the specifics of it,'' said
Hargrove. ``It was just a difference of opinion. I did what I had
to do and Joe did what he had to do. And Joe is very good at what
he does.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Brinkman was very good (and very quick) at
ejecting Hargrove. After only three pitches of a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ejection of Hargrove,'' Brinkman said in a prepared
statement that was read to baseball's court, ``was (for)
questioning balls and strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The first inning progressed as well as it could amid the boos
and catcalls from the home folk of Jacobs Field. Lewis walked. John
Valentin walked. Mo Vaughn struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra then hit a drive a foot short of a home run in
left, a drive that easily scored Lewis from second. Valentin
chugged toward home as cutoff man Omar Vizquel fired to catcher
Sandy Alomar, with Brinkman off to the side of the plate and Gooden
not far from the umpire. Valentin slid arm first, a fadeaway slide.
Alomar applied the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin appeared out.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman called Valentin safe.
</P>
<P>
   Eruptions occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, meanwhile, was irate at the call and said several words
to Brinkman as the pitcher headed back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked by him and I just said to him, `Hey, let's just get
into the (expletive) game,'' Gooden said. ``Oh, (Valentin) was out.
He was definitely out. I mean, it wasn't a case where (Brinkman)
was in a bad position to make the call. I was standing right by him
and I couldn't even say he missed the call. For whatever reason, he
wanted to say (Valentin) was safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Brinkman said, ``The ejection of Gooden was
that he screamed an expletive right in my ear and I ejected him.
That's all there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, as 45,229 fans of the team in white uniforms
volunteered to testify. Gooden had walked past Brinkman when the
umpire ejected him and never saw that he had been tossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was back toward the mound and the other umpires told me I
was tossed,'' said Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   Another eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I just gave the umpires the glove and hat and told them,''
Gooden testified, ``and I said, `OK, you guys go out and pitch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Manager and starting pitcher gone after only one out in the
first inning. A long delay for Dave Burba, Gooden's replacement, to
warm up, a delay that cost Boston starter Tim Wakefield any chance
to retain the rhythm he had achieved in his pregame warmups.
Cleveland pummeled Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarr-o baseball.

INVESTORS FLED FUNDS IN AUGUST, THEN BUY BACK IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unnerved by Wall Street's summer gyrations, mutual fund
investors yanked a hefty $11.2 billion out of stock funds in
August, the first month in eight years that money has flowed out of
such funds.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals by fund shareholders, reported Wednesday by the
Investment Company Institute, were the highest ever, and came as
this decade's bull market ran out of steam. August's redemptions,
or the amount of money flowing out of equity funds, surpassed the
level following the October 1987 crash, when panicked investors
pulled $7.5 billion out of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite global market volatility, however, investors began
buying again in September, according to some early reports.
</P>
<P>
   The data from ICI, a trade group, suggests that contrary to what
many market watchers suggest, fund investors do not simply sit
tight when stocks take a roller-coaster ride. Instead, they jump
into action, not only shovelling money into more conservative
investments such as bond and money market funds, but dumping stock
funds as well. Money market funds attracted a record $50.9 billion
in August, topping the previous record in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have poured money into stock funds during the 1990s,
reaping strong returns, helping to fuel history's longest bull
market , and sparking the fund industry boom.
</P>
<P>
   Like August, September has had its share of market turmoil,
including a 2.9 percent drop Wednesday in the Dow Jones industrial
average. But many indexes ended up last month. After losing 14.6
percent in August, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a proxy for the
broad market, gained 6.2 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to that relative improvement, mutual fund companies
said September sales were on track to reverse August's activity.
Still, investors, who entered September smarting from the Dow's 6.4
percent drop on Aug. 31, began buying stock funds only in the last
10 days, fund firms said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund
firm, estimated net sales, which is total sales minus redemptions,
of stock funds at $500 million in September after outflows of $1.8
billion in August. Bond funds attracted $500 million, more than
three times August's level, spokesman Scott Beyerl  &UR;  &LR; said. But net
sales of ultra-safe money market funds slowed dramatically to $500
million from $4.5 billion in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are returning somewhat to the equity market,''
Beyerl said, adding that growth funds, which invest mostly in
large-company stocks, and sector funds, which concentrate on a
particular industry, were the most popular at Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, stock funds took in a healthy $19.3 billion in
September, according to estimates by Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a fund
tracking firm in Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both August and September were volatile months on Wall Street,
which raises the question of why investors dumped stock funds in
one month but slowly came back the next. The ICI data may suggest
that investors will shrug off volatility if the market is generally
heading upward, as it did last month relative to August. By
contrast, August's gyrations drove market indexes below their July
peaks.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, fund houses spent August preparing for higher
redemptions, cheap buying opportunities, or both. The average
equity fund had 6 percent of its assets in cash at the end of
August, up from 5.2 percent the month before, ICI said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the mutual fund industry lost 8.2 percent of its assets
in August, finishing that month with net assets of $4.73 trillion.
Stock funds saw 15.9 percent of their assets, or $447 billion,
erased, mostly due to lower stock prices than to redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds hold around 19 percent of all publicly &UR;  &LR; traded US
stocks, which makes them significant players during market swings.
Still, August's stock fund outflows represented less than half a
percent of stock funds' total assets, ICI said. By contrast,
outflows in October 1987, when the market plunged 22.6 percent,
equalled 4.5 percent of assets.

WINSTON CUP A LITTLE TOO PREDICTABLE FOR BRUTON SMITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know that NASCAR Winston Cup championship chase that has you
riveted in front of the TV for three-plus hours each weekend?
</P>
<P>
   You know those heated battles for track position and every
valuable Winston Cup point?
</P>
<P>
   You know all the strategy that goes into deciding between two
tires vs. four tires, a pound of air here and a round of wedge
there?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you do, because these are some of the ingredients that have
made big-league stock-car racing the fastest growing spectator
sport in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then why is racetrack developer Bruton Smith so concerned?
</P>
<P>
   Because Smith, as chief executive officer of Speedway
Motorsports Inc., has taken a hard look at NASCAR ticket sales from
across the country. And he senses that the fans who loyally have
filled the grandstands, including at his five racetracks, are
becoming bored with the show NASCAR is cranking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, every week it's the same thing,'' Smith said
during a conference call this week. ``It's either car 24 (Jeff
Gordon) or car 6 (Mark Martin) racing with each other. You can bet
that last 100 miles, there they are. Are the fans tired of that? I
think they are. Thank God that Ricky Rudd won on Sunday (at
Martinsville (Va.) Speedway). I hate to say this _ and I know you
won't print it _ but it's getting rather monotonous.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, like Smith really doesn't want or expect his comments to
get back to NASCAR president Bill France Jr., vice president for
competition Mike Helton and Gary Nelson, Winston Cup Series
director.
</P>
<P>
   Next to France, Smith is viewed by many as the second-most
powerful man in the sport. He also is a practical businessman. As
the series settles into Smith's Charlotte Motor Speedway for the
UAW-GM Quality 500 this weekend, the race for the championship of
NASCAR's 50th season is shaping up into a one-on-one matching
Gordon and Martin. And yet all of the seats at CMS _ the crown
jewel of Smith's motorsports empire _ were not sold as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The outcome of Cup races has become a little too
predictable. Gordon, who is bidding for his third championship in
four years and second in a row, has a 199-point lead over Martin
after 27 events.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has his now obligatory 10 victories in the bag, and
Martin has a career-high six. They are 1-2 in victories and have
finished first and second in six races. Gordon and Martin also
stand 1-2 in money won, laps led and miles led. Sunday's NAPA
AutoCare 500 at Martinsville marked the first race this season that
neither Gordon nor Martin led a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smith is not criticizing either Gordon and the crew at
Hendrick Motorsports or Martin and his team at Roush Racing for
doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I'm thinking about is these guys don't race side by
side. These fans like that. They like some rubbing,'' said Smith,
who spent approximately $3 million to revamp his Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth earlier this summer to address that problem,
as well as water leaks in turns 1 and 4. ``Right now the cars
aren't handling the way they could handle. Maybe if we make some
changes on these race cars, where these guys can drive them easier
... if they could do that, the racing could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a veiled reference to the 5-and-5/inch rear spoiler and
front air dam rule instituted by NASCAR this season to take away
aerodynamic downforce and slow the cars down through the corners by
making them a little less stable.
</P>
<P>
   H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, the president of CMS and Smith's trusted
comrade, joined a chorus of drivers critical of the lack of
downforce on the 3,400-pound Cup cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best racing out there is in the (NASCAR) Busch
Series because the cars have more downforce, less horsepower and
are easier to drive,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest that even with some sort of aero tweaking,
Gordon and Martin would not end up dominating a given race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it'd be great to have more than two cars competing for the
win,'' Smith said. ``I hope NASCAR will take a hard look, so we can
get these guys racing the way they used to race.'' &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ford Taurus owner/driver Ricky Rudd's victory at a boiling
Martinsville Speedway on Sunday was not only one of the most
courageous performances of the Winston Cup season. It also struck a
blow for that vanishing breed known as the single-car team. Through
27 races, only Rudd (1), Bobby Hamilton (1) and Bobby Labonte (2)
have scored victories for the sport's so-called ``little guys.'' In
fact, Hamilton and Morgan-McClure Racing remain the only single-car
Chevrolet team to have won a Cup race since the start of the 1995
season. ...
</P>
<P>
   Cup regular Ken Schrader will become a multi-teamer when Kenny
Wallace joins Andy Petree Racing next year. The addition of Wallace
to Petree's Chevy lineup has received Schrader's endorsement. ``I'm
all for it, the key factor being Kenny Wallace,'' said Schrader,
who is 11th in points, 23 behind John Andretti with six events to
go. ``We just feel we can help ourselves with a better budget, more
equipment, more personnel and more knowledge. I believe that two is
better than one _ two that are close are definitely better than
one. But I don't believe three is better than two or four is better
than three.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's annual Winston Cup prerace extravaganza at Charlotte
Motor Speedway has been billed as ``Showdown at Charlotte,'' and is
scheduled to feature Batman and Robin pitted against the Joker in a
battle royale for Gotham City _ or at least as it exists on the CMS
infield. Here is the plot, as explained by H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler,
CMS president and general manager and promoter par excellnce: ``The
Joker captures the Speedway, and Batman rescues the whole (Winston
Cup) field. We've got car chases and something might get up in the
air.'' Gee, you hardly ever see that during one of these shows at
CMS _ fireworks and assorted explosions. ``We need some humor in
this sport,'' Wheeler said. ``You go into the (Cup) garage area and
nobody's having any fun. They're up too tight. Maybe this will
loosen them up a bit.'' Keeping with the program, Dale Jarrett will
drive a Batman-themed No. 88 Ford and teammate Kenny Irwin Jr. will
compete in a Joker-themed No. 28 Taurus on Sunday. &QL; 
CART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Championship Auto Racing Teams released a series record
20-race schedule for 1999 on Monday, and the lone Texas stop is
booked for the streets of downtown Houston on Sept. 26. That is the
date for the second annual Texaco Grand Prix of Houston. And they
haven't even run the inaugural Houston race yet. It's scheduled for
Sunday at 3 p.m. on a 1.68-mile temporary course surrounding the
George R. Brown Convention Center. The course length appears mighty
short, until you consider that the ultra successful Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach is contested over a 1.586-mile street layout.
``The length is not the difference. It's the layout,'' said Michael
Andretti, the Newman/Haas Racing star who has scored 15 of his
career 37 CART victories in street races. ``You look on paper at
what it's going to be and you can't tell. I know it's going to be
very wide for a street circuit. That's one positive. Maybe there'll
be a spot for passing at the end of the straightaway. That's always
the biggest complaint on a street circuit, there's no place to
pass. Hopefully, they'll have a place.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Andretti's comments fit nicely into A.J. Foyt's view
of CART's first foray into his hometown. Foyt, first four-time
winner of the Indianapolis 500, is aligned with the all-oval Pep
Boys Indy Racing League in its rivalry with CART. But Foyt, whose
67 Indy-car victories top the all-time list, could care less about
this weekend's FedEx Championship activities. ``It's not really
Indy-car racing,'' Foyt said. ``That's actually Formula One racing.
And to me, (CART is) just a secondary Formula One racing they're
running. We're (IRL) a different league of racing. We're actually
oval racing. And I don't mind a good road course _ a ``good'' road
course. But this stuff of running downtown ... that ain't racing.''
...
</P>
<P>
   Andretti also held out little hope of CART ever racing at the
1.5-mile Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, where the 24-degree
banked turns could be expected to whip the cars around well in
excess of 230 mph. That's even with the addition of the Handford
Device rear-wing flap employed by CART for the first time at the
2-mile, 18-degree banked Michigan Speedway in July. ``Politically,
we were ready to race there,'' said Andretti, referring to TMS.
``It was a safety issue, and I believe it still is an issue for us.
Even with the Handford Device, with that amount of banking and that
layout, we'd be going way too fast. We feel it would be way too
dangerous. The Gs )gravity forces) we'd pull through the corners
would be the biggest of anywhere else we've raced. I think it's a
safety issue more than anything.'' &QL; 
FAST LAPS &QL; 
TMS ANNOUNCEMENT SET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A ``major announcement'' regarding the 1999 racing season at
Texas Motor Speedway is scheduled for this afternoon. Pep Boys Indy
Racing League driver Greg Ray of Plano is to join Eddie Gossage,
executive vice president and general manager of TMS, which
sponsored Ray at the Indianapolis 500 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, league officials continue to firm up next year's
schedule. An 11-race tour, same as this year despite the loss of
New Hampshire International Speedway, is expected to be announced
between now and the season finale at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on
Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 schedule will likely see the race at Charlotte Motor
Speedway moved from its late July date to a spot in May, before the
running of the 83rd Indianapolis 500. That will give the teams a
major speedway shakedown heading into the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. &QL; 
NUTS AND BOLTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen of
Arlington has qualified for only eight of 17 events heading into
the Parts America Nationals at Heartland Park Topeka (Kan.) this
weekend. Allen has 10 elimination-round victories in the Outlaw
Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   Newly crowned NTB Trans-Am Series champion Paul Gentilozzi heads
to the season finale in downtown Houston this weekend with seven
victories and nine poles (in 12 starts) in his Corvette. Included
were four flag-to-flag victories.
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel veteran Jack Hewitt became the first driver in the
18-year history of the 4-Crown Nationals to sweep all four features
at Eldora Speedway in Rossburg, Ohio. Hewitt, 47, won the 50-lap

U.S. REPEATS CALL FOR FORENSIC INQUIRY IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-MASSACRE, KOSOVO-U.N.) 
(mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States once again Wednesday called for
forensic experts to investigate massacres of Kosovo villagers, as
NATO ambassadors met in Brussels and the United Nations Security
Council set an emergency session for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still no sign that Western nations had resolved to
strike against Serbian troops carrying out President Milosevic's
crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. NATO weaponry and
soldiers were gathering, in various stages of readiness, should the
West decide to use force.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is in the last phases of its planning process, and we
believe that NATO is for all practical purposes prepared to act,''
said a State Department spokesman, James Foley. ``Clearly,
Milosevic has begun to get the message that military action is a
live and real prospect if he doesn't reverse course.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We've got to see on the ground real evidence that he
has ended the repression, he's withdrawn the forces as called for
by the Security Council, or else.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said it was ``very
important to us that international forensic experts be allowed to
inquire further on these events,'' referring to witness reports of
massacres against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these atrocities are part and parcel of the horror that
has been under way in the Balkans for years, and in Kosovo since
Serb authorities moved in a very dangerous and very outrageous way
against those Kosovar Albanians who are attempting to get some
freedom of expression with respect to their own political rights,''
McCurry said. ``The use of military force as an option should come
if we have exhausted the efforts to resolve this on a diplomatic
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high degree of resolve, both within the Security
Council and within the alliance, to see that we deal with what is
going to be an unspeakable tragedy, especially as winter
proceeds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``NATO has the authority to undertake military action
on its own initiative but we would certainly welcome any statement
from the Security Council that supported NATO's determination to
act.''

USS INDEPENDENCE PASSES INTO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUGET SOUND NAVAL SHIPYARD, Wash. _ It was a moment of crisp
ceremony and spontaneous tears as they lowered the flag for the
last time on the USS Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old aircraft carrier, until Wednesday the oldest
warship on active duty in the Navy, passed into history in a
decommissioning ceremony here that drew senior Navy officials and
scores of carrier veterans from all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned in 1959 at the height of the Cold War, the
80,000-ton carrier saw duty in practically every crisis and war in
the subsequent four decades, said Navy Secretary John Dalton, who
served a brief training tour on the carrier in 1961 as an Annapolis
midshipman and who returned Wednesday to speak at its retirement.
Over its lifetime, the Independence had 386,000 ``traps'' _
controlled aircraft landings using the flight deck arresting gear _
and steamed more than 3 million miles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing to a long row of sailors along the rail on the
Independence's four-acre flight deck, Dalton said, ``Anyone who
believes that Navy ships are simply steel and cable, oil and iron,
has not walked the deckplates of USS Independence and felt the
powerful presence of naval history _ American history _ in every
frame and compartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship, which has been based on both coasts and in Japan,
served in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, took part in combat
operations in Vietnam, Grenada and Lebanon, and was the first
carrier rushed to the Persian Gulf after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Mike Bowman, commander of Pacific Fleet naval air
forces, choked back tears as he read the official message ordering
the carrier's decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   Although the carrier's retirement has been long planned _ the
Navy is continuing to commission new nuclear-powered Nimitz-class
flattops _ Dalton yesterday took note of the Pentagon budget
strains that have caused shortages in key personnel and a falloff
in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton said the Navy has sufficient operating funds for now, but
warned of ``clouds on the horizon'' if Congress fails to provide a
proposed short-term infusion of money. Dalton, who has already
announced his resignation as the Navy's civilian chief, added it is
imperative that Congress approve two more rounds of base closings
to save unneeded expenses of operating obsolete facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet has shrunk by 45 percent from about 600 ships to 350
today, but support bases have been cut by only 17 percent, Dalton
said. ``Clearly we have too much infrastructure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton said personnel support _ including pay, quality-of-life
programs and retirement compensation _ should have the Navy's top
budget priority. ``It doesn't matter about the other (budget
programs) if we can't keep the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's ceremony, Dalton presented the carrier and its
crew with the Navy Unit Commendation award for their role in
several military emergencies during 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence took part in a surge of Navy warships to the
Taiwan Strait in 1996 to signal U.S. resolve in the rise of
tensions between China and Taiwan. And earlier this year the
carrier was rushed to the Persian Gulf for five months as the
Pentagon beefed up naval power in a standoff with Iraq over United
Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 1,500 Navy officers, family members and
veterans rose to applaud as the ship's last skipper, Capt. Mark
Milliken, marched aboard his command for his final order: ``Debark
the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Navy band played, the crew of 1,100 sailors marched from
the flight deck down to the pier gangways in a long line of white
uniforms. The final act of the ceremony was to lower a
one-of-a-kind flag _ the original Navy jack with the ``Don't Tread
on Me'' motto _ that is flown only aboard the oldest warship on
active service.
</P>
<P>
   The flag has been transferred to the USS Kitty Hawk, now the
Navy's senior ship.

FRACTIOUS GAME LEAVES RED SOX IN 1-1 PLAYOFF TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Indians spotted the Red Sox a manager,
a starting pitcher, and a two-run lead four batters into Game 2 of
their American League Division Series Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Add some eyeblack and Ninja Turtle shoelaces, and the ejections
of Indians manager Mike Hargrove and pitcher Dwight Gooden by plate
umpire Joe Brinkman would have been Roger Clemens-Terry Cooney all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   But a loss of composure doesn't always translate into defeat,
despite the pathetic playoff example set by Clemens and the Sox
eight years ago in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of surrender, the Indians opted for inspiration. With
Red Sox starter Tim Wakefield barely sticking around longer than
Gooden, and with a Jacobs Field crowd of 45,229 energized by the
first-inning fireworks between Brinkman and the home side, the
Indians rallied for a 9-5 win behind Gooden's emergency stand-in,
Dave Burba, to even the best-of-five series at a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proved they played better without me,'' said Indians
manager Mike Hargrove, who apparently succeeded in igniting his
team as much as irking Brinkman when he was tossed for complaining
that the umpire not only ruled Gooden's first three pitches were
balls but engaged the Indians righthander in discussing his calls,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously _ I mean, I think it's seriously,'' Hargrove said
with a laugh, ``if it turned up our intensity and our fans'
intensity, then it did some good.''
</P>
<P>
   David Justice hit a three-run home run off reliever John Wasdin
in a five-run second inning, which might have ended sooner if
rookie catcher Jason Varitek had been less cautious when he had
Kenny Lofton trapped between second and third after the runner in
front of him, Joey Cora, elected to stay put on Omar Vizquel's
one-out fly ball to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck out there,'' said Lofton, but it was Varitek who
became momentarily unglued, electing to check Vizquel at third and
hold on to the ball while Lofton retreated safely to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mental mistake,'' said third baseman John Valentin.
``He should have thrown the ball. Maybe he didn't want to throw the
ball away. That was his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say he was afraid to throw the ball, but you've
got to play aggressively. Unfortunately, he didn't throw the ball
and the next guy hits a home run. Stuff like that happens all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians then had an answer each time the Red Sox tried to
climb back into the game, knocking out seven extra-base hits,
including six doubles, and putting runners on base in every inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give them credit,'' Red Sox pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan said. ``Their backup starter was better than our backup
starter. That's what the game boiled down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden walked the first two batters, Darren Lewis and John
Valentin, whiffed Mo Vaughn, then was gone when he barked in
Brinkman's face after Nomar Garciaparra doubled _ missing a home
run by 6 inches _ and the umpire called Valentin safe when replays
showed he was clearly out despite his best headfirst slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ejection of Hargrove was (for) questioning balls and
strikes,'' Brinkman said in a statement released by the league.
``The ejection of Gooden was that he screamed an expletive right in
my ear and I ejected him. That's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   All there was? That was only the beginning of it. Gooden, who
had been backing up home plate when he crossed paths with Brinkman,
had to be restrained from charging the umpire when he returned to
the mound and discovered belatedly that he'd been ejected. Then he
had to be physically wrestled back to the Indians dugout by coach
Jeff Newman, who'd become manager-for-a-day when Hargrove was
tossed. Then Gooden toosed his cap and glove onto the field in
Brinkman's direction, hollering, ``Here, you pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching was left to Burba, who was supposed to be
Cincinnati's Opening Day starter but was traded here the day before
the season. He seized this opening, limiting the Red Sox to a run
through 4 2/3 innings before tiring in the sixth, when the Sox
scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   But despite three RBIs from Garciaparra, giving him seven in two
games, the Sox could not overcome the early exit by Wakefield, who
couldn't blame Brinkman for his unscheduled departure.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who was forced to warm up twice because the top of
the first lasted so long, was charged with more runs (5) than he
got outs (4) in his shortest outing of the season. A 17-game winner
in the regular season, Wakefield gave up a run in the first when
Lofton walked, stole second, and eventually scored on Justice's
sacrifice fly, then failed to survive the second, when he gave up a
single to Travis Fryman, doubles to Sandy Alomar and Lofton, and a
walk to Cora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Wakefield said. ``I told Eck (Dennis
Eckersley) when I came into the dugout, `I feel like I didn't even
pitch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Justice hit the first pitch he saw from Wasdin, a split-fingered
fastball, into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Wasdin's splitter breaks away from lefthanded hitters.
Not this time. ``It cut down and in and right into his sweet
spot,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   There was one last sour note before this one was over, when a
fastball by Indians closer Mike Jackson came thisclose to creasing
Valentin's nose. Valentin made a move toward Jackson, the pitcher
started flapping back, benches and bullpens emptied, but there was
no rumble, only grumble.
</P>
<P>
   And when the noise ended, there were flights to Boston to be
made. Game 3 is Friday at Fenway Park, Bret Saberhagen vs. Charles
Nagy, barring ejections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy we've got going Friday is a big-game pitcher,'' Mo
Vaughn said. ``The big win to get was Game 1. It would have been
beautiful to win Game 2, but it's tough. For them, the season was
on the line.''

ON FILM, CAMPO CAN'T SEE 0-4 'SKINS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ When Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo watches
film of the Washington Redskins offense, he sees a unit that belies
its winless record. And it has not taken much preaching by Campo
for his players to see the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Darren Woodson contends the 0-4 Redskins have
offensive firepower similar to the Denver Broncos, a team that went
through the Cowboys for 515 yards in Week 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move the ball probably better than anyone we will play
this year,'' said Woodson, whose club has not won in Washington
since 1994. ``They are not as consistent as the Broncos. But just
look at their talent. They match up with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have been matched against some of the league's best
teams in the Broncos, San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks and New
York Giants. Yet coach Norv Turner's club is ranked fourth in total
offense (376.3 yards per game), and tied for third in total first
downs (83). Wide receiver Michael Westbrook leads the league with
418 receiving yards, and has five receptions of 26 yards or longer.
Running back Terry Allen is 10th with 339 rushing yards and a 4.7
yards-per-carry average.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' efforts, however, have been undone by turnovers
and penalties. They have an NFL-worst minus-11 turnover ratio,
resulting in 59 points for their opponents. They have committed
penalties at the worst times, with three negating two touchdowns
and a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake parade has been led by quarterback Trent Green. With
play that has been at times terrific, and at other times
terrifying, Green has been intercepted five times and lost four
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnovers and penalties have been really frustrating
because that's been a strength of our team the last few years,''
said Turner, whose club's plus-13 turnover ratio the two seasons
before 1998 was fourth-best in the NFL. ``Most of the turnovers
have been related to the passing game. We've got to do a better job
there, a better job protecting the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has been productive when protected. In three starts in
place of Gus Frerotte, Green has six touchdowns and 1,044 yards
passing, third most in the league. But the Redskins' line has
allowed 18 quarterback sacks, fourth worse in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Campo intends to apply heavy pressure on Green to add to the
total. Yet the task figures to be challenging. The Cowboys average
a mere two sacks per game. This weak pressure has been underscored
by the slow development of defensive ends Kavika Pittman (one sack)
and Greg Ellis (one sack). And so Cowboys coaches are prepared to
bring an all-out assault at Green, while hoping the coverage
abilities of cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith can bail
them out against the likes of receivers Westbrook and Leslie
Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to blitz, no doubt,'' said linebacker
Randall Godfrey, whose new role as a pass rusher this season has
netted him one sack. ``If you look at the successful teams in the
league, they all do some kind of stunting, something to get to the
quarterback. You just can't let a guy sit back there and pick his
targets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Outscored 80-30 in the second half, the Redskins have been
forced to play catch up, rendering their running game useless. Yet
Allen has been solid while the games have been competitive. Of his
339 yards rushing, 266 have come in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   When their opponents have rushed for more than 100 yards, the
Cowboys have lost both games. The Broncos beat the Cowboys with big
plays from Terrell Davis. The Raiders, meanwhile, were not
necessarily dominating on the ground. But they ran enough (37
times) to take the pressure off quarterback Jeff George, who
attempted 20 passes and was not intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins hope to employ this same strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys, with tackles Leon Lett and Chad Hennings
nearing full strength, appear to be ready for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has consistently hammered the ball down our throats,''
Campo said. ``The thing we've got to do is eliminate the big plays.
And the Redskins have the ability to make big plays. They spread
the ball around and get up field. They've just shot themselves in
the foot this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hope they pull the trigger again Sunday.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced on Wednesday that the
government was ending the fiscal year with a budget surplus of $70
billion, the first since 1969 and the largest on record. ``It is a
landmark achievement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight at midnight,'' the president declared in a ceremony
here as the clock ticked toward the close of the 1998 fiscal year,
``America puts an end to three decades of deficits and launches a
new era of balanced budgets and surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president's celebration of the surplus did little to
mask an untidy budget process that is unfolding on Capitol Hill and
must be resolved in the next nine days, before Congress adjourns
for the fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is contributing to the untidiness: both the
administration and congressional Republicans have found the
emergence of an extra pot of $70 billion or so _ the exact size
will not be known until after a couple of weeks, when the
government makes a final accounting _ too tempting to ignore,
especially in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to use part of the surplus to finance a tax
cut, while the administration wants it to bolster Social Security
and pay for other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new fiscal year begins on Thursday, Congress has
finished work on only 2 of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the
government running beyond Monday night. As a result, Congress and
the president have agreed to a stopgap measure to finance most of
the government through Oct. 9, a device used in 8 of the last 10
years to buy the two sides more time to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm over the surplus has been tempered by the
international markets' growing turmoil, which has made it unclear
how long the United States can expect to sustain its own economic
growth. Indeed, whether the annual surpluses projected for the next
decade will materialize if the nation slips into recession is just
one of the questions being debated by wary economists.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of a surplus, anticipated for months, once
seemed to offer the nation the opportunity for a philosophical
debate over its direction in a new era of plenty. But that debate
has been cut short in the last several weeks by the drive on
Capitol Hill to impeach the president over the Lewinsky scandal,
and the budget process, surplus and all, has been all but lost in
the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Congress, reflecting a rift within the Republican
Party between deficit hawks and supply side tax-cutters has not
even passed a budget resolution this year. Instead it is using last
year's agreement, which does not project a surplus until 2002, as
its spending guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are starting a new fiscal year, and the road map is
still in dispute,'' Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., who is a member of
the House Budget Committee, said incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   In place of a broader debate in the era of surplus is the
horse-trading and the philosophical standoffs over abortion, issues
that have characterized the endgame of every recent budget season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance at the end of the session is there is no
alliance, except to spend money and get out of town,'' said Rep.
Tom Coburn, a conservative Republican from Oklahoma who wants
Congress and the president to stay within the spending limits to
which both agreed in the budget-balancing agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said for months and reiterated on Wednesday that he
wants to save the surplus to bolster the Social Security system for
retiring baby boomers. At the same time, the administration is
seeking to spend an extra $17 billion for ``emergencies'' that it
did not calculate in its budget. These emergencies include the
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, fixing the Year 2000 computer bug,
improving security at U.S. embassies around the world and providing
disaster relief to American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The president on Wednesday soft-pedaled his recent criticisms of
Congress, but did urge Republicans not to ``squander'' the surplus
before Social Security is secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we squander this surplus and start spending a little here,
a little there, a little yonder on the tax cuts, just because we
are a few weeks before an election, before we take care of this,
what are we going to do when times get tough?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   With his ceremony on Wednesday, the president was able to appear
as if he were responsible for the surplus, and he extended credit
to Democratic members of Congress who voted for his tax increase in
1993. This annoyed Republicans, who resent Clinton's ability to
take credit for events for which they feel responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's trying to make everybody assume that just
because he raised taxes in 1993, he balanced the budget,'' said
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. Reflecting a long-standing gripe that
Republicans have with Clinton, he added: ``The president today even
took credit for welfare reform, which he vetoed twice.''

POWER, PITCHING, DEFENSE _ BRAVES SHOW ALL IN 7-1 WIN OVER CUBS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From start to finish, Game 1 was an impressive display
by the Atlanta Braves. They showed power. They got superb pitching
and fielding. And when it was over, the Chicago Cubs had been
pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Tucker's two-run home run providing an early lead,
and Ryan Klesko's seventh-inning grand slam turning the game into a
rout, the Braves opened the playoffs with an easy 7-1 victory over
the Cubs Wednesday before 45,598 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz became the all-time leader in postseason victories
(11), holding the Cubs to one run and five hits through 7 2/3
innings of dominant work. In 21 postseason starts, Smoltz has an
11-3 record, and Wednesday's win moved him past Whitey Ford and
Dave Stewart, both of whom had 10 postseason victories.
</P>
<P>
   It may not get any easier for the Cubs, who will face another
quality starter in Tom Glavine on Thursday night, followed by Greg
Maddux, who will pitch for the Braves in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the playoffs was difficult for the Cubs. But to get
past the Braves, the Cubs will have to find a way to get past
Atlanta's starting pitching. ``Smoltz was the story of the game,
and made us look like we weren't out there fighting,'' said Jim
Riggleman, Chicago's manager. `He wouldn't let us get on base
hardly. And if we put a base runner on, it seemed like he just
turned it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying for the playoffs by winning a one-game playoff
Monday against the San Francisco Giants, the Cubs hoped to ride
that emotion into Wednesday's game. Instead, the Braves rode the
arm of Smoltz, who struck out six, did not walk a batter, and
prevented the Cubs from reaching second base until the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the best stuff, but I got away with some
pitches, and the defense was outstanding,'' said Smoltz, who had a
superb 17-3 record during the regular season. ``I'm just going to
continue doing what I've been doing all season, and hopefully it
will be a magical year and we can celebrate a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves never looked back after Tucker's two-run home run in
the second inning against Mark Clark, Chicago's starting and losing
pitcher. Tucker's blast was set up by a Chicago mistake. With two
outs in the bottom of the second, Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez
failed to end the inning, when he juggled a slow ground ball by
Andruw Jones, allowing him to reach base on an error. Tucker
followed with a drive into the right field seats on a 3-2 pitch,
giving the Braves and Smoltz an early lead on two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta added another run in the sixth inning to go ahead, 3-0.
After back-to-back singles by Andres Galarraga and Klesko, Jones
hit a sacrifice fly to right field that scored Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the crowning blow, Klesko's grand slam to right field
in the seventh inning against Chicago reliever, Matt Karchner.
Clark started the inning by walking Smoltz, so Riggleman called on
Felix Heredia in relief. But affer Walt Weiss grounded into a
fielder's choice, Heredia walked Keith Lockhart and Chipper Jones
to load the bases. Riggleman replaced Heredia with Karchner, who
got Galarraga to pop out. But after reaching a 3-2 count to Klesko,
Karchner threw a fastball that Klesko powered over the right field
wall, giving the Braves a 7-0 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   With Smoltz pitching, that was far more offense than Atlanta
needed. Tyler Houston hit a solo home run in the eighth inning
against Smoltz to account for Chicago's only run. Sammy Sosa, who
led the Cubs to the playoffs with his remarkable 66 home run
season, went 2 for 4 with a single and a double, and he received a
standing ovation as he stepped into the batter's box in the first
inning. But the Braves kept Sosa in the park, and he was one of the
few Cubs who looked comfortable at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   A key point in the game occurred in the top of the seventh, with
the Cubs still trailing just 3-0. Sosa led off the inning with a
scorching line drive double down the left field line, but he was
stranded at second base, as Smoltz reached back for something
extra. Mark Grace, 0 for 4, flew out weakly to centerfield. The
next better, Henry Rodriquez, was a strikeout victim, then Smoltz
got Gary Gaetti on a ground out to second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs will start Kevin Tapani in Game 2, and, as expected,
Kerry Wood was added to Chicago's playoff roster Wednesday, and he
may start Game 3. Wood, a 21-year-old rookie phenom who has been
sidelined with a sore elbow, was 13-6 this year, with 233
strikeouts in 166 2/3 innings. While getting Wood back would give
the Cubs a lift, they need a win in Game 2 to avoid falling behind,
2-0, in the three-of-five game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came down here to win two games, and now we're down here to
win one,'' said Grace. ``We're still a confident bunch. We've
bounced back all year, so we have to try and bounce back
tomorrow.''

GIULIANI TARGETS ANOTHER NEW YORK NUISANCE: THE POTHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having all but declared victory in his war on crime
and tackled such urban nemeses as squeegee men, jaywalkers and
reckless cab drivers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Wednesday
that he was on the verge of eliminating one of New York City's most
irritating ills: the pothole.
</P>
<P>
   The city has made steady progress toward eradicating potholes in
recent years, mostly because the winters have been mild, Giuliani
said. The city filled 64,309 potholes in the 1997 fiscal year and
71,633 in the 1998 fiscal year, and transportation officials said
yesterday that they hoped to fill 85,000 by the end of this
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that goal, 35 construction workers will fan out in
teams to fill what Giuliani claimed were the last 25,000 potholes
scarring city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some motorists, whose shocks and struts have long battled the
city's legendary potholes, were enthusiastic, although a bit
skeptical, that the mayor could win this latest battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's put himself on the line with this one,'' said Roberto
Williams, a cabbie driving in lower Manhattan Wednesday. ``But I'd
be in favor of it. I need those potholes fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was characteristically resolute, saying his plan was
``very, very well designed'' and vowing that the streets would be
``in the best possible shape'' by early December, when Operation
Pothole Blitz is scheduled to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potholes, of course, are a perennial issue, problem, complaint
in the city of New York,'' Giuliani said, standing near a gaping
hole that city workers had cordoned off in Queens. ``Even Los
Angeles, which has a lot of traffic, doesn't really have the kind
of repetitious traffic that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came two weeks after Giuliani released his
annual management report, which contained mostly good news, but
revealed that only 44 percent of potholes were being repaired
within 30 days of being reported.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials said they did not find Giuliani's plan
especially daunting, because the city has an unusually small number
of potholes this year.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 25,000 potholes that city officials say exist these
days are nothing compared to the 200,000 that scarred city streets
in 1994, after one of the most bruising winters on record. That
winter, a round-the-clock pothole SWAT team filled 85,000 potholes
in 10 days _ more than one for each of the roughly 79,000 blocks in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two mild winters, so we're pretty much ahead of the
curve,'' said Maria Smith, a spokeswoman for the city Department of
Transportation. ``It's a good time to get every single last one of
them out of here, before we have a bad winter again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said that while the repair teams would hunt for
potholes daily, the transportation department would also post
fliers in dozens of libraries, community centers and schools with
numbers for residents to call to report potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation groups were enthusiastic about the plan
Wednesday, saying it would affect more people than any of
Giuliani's previous quality-of-life campaigns. New York is
notorious for having some of the country's most perilous potholes,
said Douglas Love, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the mayor's action and look forward to
the day when we can cruise down silky smooth roads,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   But the pothole campaign did not escape criticism Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ludovic Blain, legislative advocate for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said the city should focus on other
problems that were mentioned in the mayor's management report, like
slow police response time to emergencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who has challenged several of Giuliani's
quality-of-life crackdowns, said the mayor was focusing on potholes
in an attempt to raise his national image but that he was ignoring
more complex issues facing the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can argue with eliminating potholes,'' Siegel said.
``The only question is whether this should be a high priority in a
city where there are serious systemic problems with regard to race
relations, poor people and many social justice issues that he
hasn't addressed.''

   WASHINGTON _ Leading Democrats and Republicans here are being
haunted by youthful voices of 24 years ago, during Watergate. The
voices are their own.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by a sense that the hypocrisy is getting thicker than
their sideburns of yore, Republicans and Democrats are turning
history and memory into political weapons as they square off over
possible impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, through their proxies, President Clinton and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott exchanged accusations of conflicting
standards in the Watergate and Lewinsky inquiries. On Capitol Hill,
Democrats and Republicans clashed over how precisely the
investigation of this president should mimic the inquiry about
President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   To Republicans, the Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry of
1974 is now a model of congressional restraint and judiciousness.
To Democrats _ who had previously called for the Watergate-style
rules _ that is now too broad an approach.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Democrats noted with delight that minority
Republicans in 1974 were granted subpoena power _ a precedent not
all Republicans are thrilled with.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Democrats and Republicans reached no agreement
on the scope of the investigation Wednesday. Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the committee's chairman, dispatched a letter to Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, its senior Democrat, gently suggesting he
was being a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde wrote, ``I want to propose that the model for impeachment''
that the committee should follow ``is the one that you helped to
write in 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott started Democratic aides rummaging through the archives of
his quotations by saying on Tuesday that ``bad conduct'' might be
an impeachable offense. They popped up with a dusty defense of
Nixon by Lott, who was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in
1974. He said that a president should be removable ``only for
serious misconduct dangerous to the system of government'' and not
for ``general misbehavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, White House spokesman Mike McCurry accused Lott of an
apparent ``double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His constitutional thinking has undergone quite an
evolution,'' he observed, adding: ``I think he kind of got caught
up in the reverie of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, had his own quotation at the
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Bill Clinton who seems to have undergone a convenient
memory lapse,'' he said. ``In 1974, Bill Clinton said a president
should be impeached if he admits to lying and interfering with a
government investigation. In 1998, Bill Clinton believes it's his
right not only to lie to the American people and thwart lawful
investigations of his conduct, but to lie under an oath before
God.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 7, 1974, Bill Clinton _ then a shaggy-haired law
professor at the University of Arkansas _ criticized his opponent
in a congressional race for opposing Nixon's resignation. He was
quoted the next day by the Arkansas Gazette as saying there was
``no question that an admission of making false statements to
government officials and interfering with the FBI and the CIA is an
impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comment in the town of Flippin, where he would
later make an investment in Ozarks property known as Whitewater
that, through many twists and turns, would bring him to the brink
of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, Watergate and Clinton's predicament over Monica
Lewinsky _ which still lacks a catchy, one-word nickname _ bear no
resemblance. McCurry appeared at his daily briefing Wednesday armed
for a question about comparisons to Watergate. He got it, and
almost ran out of breath as he rattled off a lengthy list of the
accusations against Nixon, including that he ``misused the FBI,
(and) the Secret Service, to conduct unlawful wiretapping of
American citizens'' and that he ``maintained a secret unit in the
White House to violate the constitutional rights of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   After pausing slightly for air, McCurry added indignantly, ``So
there's no parallel whatsoever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet there is something of a parallel _ at least through the
looking glass _ in the political commentary. Back in 1974, Conyers
complained about White House ``stonewalling,'' while then-Rep. Lott
_ in remarks that make James Carville sound like a plagiarist _
objected to ``15 months of the most intensive investigation of any
president of the United States, perhaps of any man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott added, ``Could any man withstand such scrutiny, could any
man go through all of this without some evidence of a questionable
statement under pressure, or while frustrated, or even without
revealing some mistakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Such sweeping comments aside, Lott and Conyers, in their remarks
in the committee, built their attacks or defenses out of the
specific facts of Watergate. Transcripts are packed with period
references to tax evasion, wiretapping and bombs falling on
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of musty quotations, Conyers came under criticism
from Republicans Wednesday for having switched his thinking in the
debate over how broad an inquiry the Judiciary Committee should
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In internal negotiations, Conyers had been seeking a time limit
on the inquiry. Republicans pointed out that on the House floor in
February 1974, Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., then the committee's
chairman, derided the notion of a time limit as ``totally
irresponsible and unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said that Conyers, then a member of the
Judiciary Committee, cast his vote against a time limit.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Conyers said that the situations were not comparable,
because, unlike in Watergate, most of the facts are already known
about Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a House resolution charged the Judiciary Committee to
``investigate fully and completely'' whether sufficient grounds
existed to impeach Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, such a resolution would give the committee power to
pursue any impeachable offense, meaning it would not have to come
back to the full House for authority to widen its scope if it
wanted to go beyond the accusations related to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has consistently refused to rule out looking beyond the
Lewinsky matter, although he has also said that he wants to keep
the investigation focused. The Democrats want any investigation to
be limited to the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
deceptions about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the House Democrats had been pressing for a Watergate model
_ which would also provide them with subpoena power _ so they found
themselves in an awkward position Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to report that we have been given a
Watergate-type set of rules, which is what we have been asking
for,'' Conyers said, before going on to criticize such rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that this investigation should be open-ended like
Watergate, as the speaker continues to insist, is preposterous,''
he said. ``Watergate involved a wholesale corruption of government
which extended through the FBI the CIA and other federal agencies.
This matter involves the concealing of a private affair for which
the vast majority of facts is already known.''

PBS' `EVIL' WELL-CRAFTED BUT COLD TO THE TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newest ``Mystery!'' sleuth isn't portly, whiskered or
pleasantly eccentric. He doesn't even have the weary humanity of
Jane Tennison.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Inspector Dave Creegan (Robson Green) is steel,
stainless and humorless.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shock, in the last hour of ``Touching Evil,'' to hear him
tell a joke. Even then, it's more calculated than mirthful. He's
got a nervous police decoy to calm. It's more telling to watch
Creegan at a raucous children's party with his two kids.
</P>
<P>
   The independent British production premieres Thursday on PBS
with a two-hour story line. Two more ``Touching Evil'' cases unwind
in four one-hour installments beginning October 8.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott (``Cracker''), the screenwriter who created Creegan,
also concocted the elite Organized and Serial Crimes unit, or OSC,
where Creegan and his mates tilt with some of Britain's most
demented criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's case, which resonates through all six hours of
the ``Touching Evil'' series, involves a pharmaceutical engineer
(Ian McDiarmid) who is suspected of abducting three English
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the OSC is on the case when several patients die of
drug overdoses at a London hospital; someone is practicing murder
under the banner of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   On October 29 and November 5, the OSC tracks a cyberspace Web
master who uses a computer fantasy game to manipulate youths into
crimes that begin with the mutilation of horses and escalate to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Gruesome murder. Animal mutilation. Euthanasia. Child abduction.
Obviously, Abbott means to punch emotional buttons and not write an
armchair ``Mystery!'' He scrambles the brain and flutters the
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Creegan nor the production style is any comfort.
``Touching Evil'' is an icy, off-putting and downbeat piece of
business. Even England itself looks coldly impersonal. And then
there's Creegan.
</P>
<P>
   Robson never invites you to cozy up to Creegan. With his sharp
features and brilliant blue eyes, he looks like a cross between a
young Paul Newman and Brian Benben. He bears a scar above his left
eye, from a bullet wound; that experience figures in the euthanasia
story.
</P>
<P>
   His divorce appears to have left him bitter. He's brusque,
intense, impulsive and occasionally flashes an eruptive temper. If
he isn't a manic-depressive, he could probably fool the OSC
assessment team.
</P>
<P>
   You get the impression that Creegan takes personally every
brutal crime committed in Great Britain. Probably in the former
colonies, too.
</P>
<P>
   The only softening element for Creegan and for ``Touching Evil''
is Creegan's partner, Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker). She's not
exactly Oprah Winfrey herself, but she seems capable of spending a
couple of hours a day away from her job.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Creegan become casual lovers midway through the
series. It's not even officially underscored as a plot development;
it just seems to happen.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Touching Evil'' isn't for everyone. It's for the viewer who
prefers a boa constrictor over a puppy as a pet.
</P>
<P>
   This is cold-blooded, reptilian television. But it's good
cold-blooded, reptilian television.

 &HT;    Springs to shut down mill, modernize its other plant
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRIFFIN, Ga. _ Springs Industries Inc. said Wednesday it will
close Griffin's oldest textile mill and spend $26 million to
modernize its other Griffin plant as it cuts costs and brings its
towel manufacturing up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred jobs will be lost, or about 16 percent of Springs'
1,900-person work force in Griffin, when the project is completed
in mid-1999. Besides adding 55,000 square feet to the second plant,
Springs is spending $40 million to build a weaving plant in
Hartwell, Ga. Springs is based in Fort Mill, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Springs' Dundee Mills Plant 1 _ Dundee Mills was purchased by
Springs in 1995 _ opened in 1888. It takes in raw cotton and
manufactures towels under the brand names of Dundee, Centennial and
Spring Maid.
</P>
<P>
   But the rambling facility, which has been added onto and
revamped many times, just isn't suited for another overhaul,
Springs spokesperson Betty Turner said. Springs, a maker of home
furnishings and specialty fabrics, announced in March it would cut
costs and modernize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Textile manufacturers always have to be on the lookout to
reduce costs,'' said analyst Kay C. Norwood at Interstate/Johnson
Lane. Discount retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart Corp.
``fall over themselves to see who can cut costs first, so there's
constant pricing pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said Springs' third-quarter earnings will come in below
last year's $1.19 per share because of problems keeping inventories
under control. The company is expected to earn 77 cents, the
average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Springs, with 1997 revenue of $2.23 billion, operates plants in
10 states.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the company said it would close a 69-year-old
textile mill in Rock Hill, S.C., and fire 480 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Springs shares have fallen more than 42 percent since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the loss of jobs comes just days after
Thomaston Mills said it was closing a plant in Griffin, sending 150
employees to its plants in Pike and Upson counties.
</P>
<P>
   Spalding County Commission Chairman Martha McDaniel noted
Spalding County, which once was dominated by textile mills, has
several new companies, including Caterpillar, Hoshizaki and Nacom,
looking for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago this would have been devastating,'' McDaniel
said. ``It still is sad for the people who have worked at the mill
for years to have to leave, but the ones who want to work should be
able to find jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said affected workers will get the first shot at
vacancies at other Springs plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people of Spalding County, it's a landmark,'' McDaniel
said. ``If Springs is not going to use it, I'd like to see it
converted to loft apartments or turn the property into a park.''

TRADER MAY HAVE CAUSED $150 MILLION LOSS AT AT&AMP;T PENSION FUND  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A trader in Boston cost a pension fund for employees
of AT&AMP;T Corp. $150 million in 1996 as he made huge unauthorized
bets on the direction of technology stocks, the Securities and
Exchange Commission contended in a lawsuit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the trader, Bing Sung, also lost $12 million
belonging to a pension fund for Massachusetts teachers and state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Sung managed hundreds of millions of dollars for the two funds
for at least three years while he was chief investment officer of
Rhumbline Advisers, a firm that mostly manages funds meant to
mirror the performance of stock indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission sued Sung, 51, in federal district court in
Boston, accusing him of securities fraud and seeking unspecified
monetary damages. The commission also announced Wednesday that
Rhumbline and its chief executive, John Nelson, had agreed to fines
and other penalties to settle an SEC proceeding against them for
failing to adequately supervise Sung.
</P>
<P>
   Rhumbline agreed to a censure, to improve its monitoring of
employees' compliance with securities laws, and to pay a $50,000
fine. Nelson agreed to pay a $10,000 fine. He also agreed to stop
serving as an investment adviser for three months and to relinquish
his supervisory role for an additional nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're at the helm, you're at the helm,'' Nelson said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ``We hired a lot of expertise and I
put confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson founded Rhumbline in 1990 after serving as a division
head for State Street Bank. He said his company no longer traded
options and would concentrate on index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home in Andover, Mass., Wednesday night, Sung would
say only that, ``I deny categorically all of the charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Sung joined Rhumbline in 1991 after serving as chief trader for
Harvard Management Co., which invests Harvard University's
multibillion dollar endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Sung's losses, as described by the commission, fall well short
of recent unauthorized losses at Daiwa Bank, Barings PLC and Showa
Shell Sekiyu, each of which came to more than $1 billion, as well
as the $350 million in false profits that Joseph Jett, the bond
trader, was accused of creating while at Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the losses would overshadow the $128 million lost by the
Common Fund, which invests for colleges, in 1995 because of
unauthorized trading at First Capital Strategists Inc. That episode
prompted many institutional investors to tighten their controls on
outside money managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of unauthorized trading and failure to disclose, this
ranks up there,'' Grant Ward, an assistant district administrator
for the SEC's Boston office, said. ``You have to have systems in
place to monitor what's going on. Rhumbline didn't have the people
or the systems in place to monitor what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the AT&AMP;T and Massachusetts funds were able to absorb a
multimillion dollar loss. When the alleged fraud was first
discovered, in September 1996, the AT&AMP;T fund held about $47
billion. The Massachusetts fund holds about $22 billion. The $150
million loss is roughly equivalent to only one day's revenue for
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's lawsuit followed a two-year investigation by the
commission. According to the SEC's complaint, all of Sung's $150
million in losses for the AT&AMP;T fund were realized in the third
quarter of 1996 but came after almost two years of unauthorized
trading.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Rhumbline had agreed to manage
AT&AMP;T's options programs in a conservative fashion, with no
potential losses on index options of more than $6 million, and
limiting the writing of options for technology stocks to $25
million in underlying value. But beginning in early 1995, according
to the complaint, Sung began to exceed those limits while at times
misleading AT&AMP;T. In late 1995, Sung secured waivers from normal
limits on options trading at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange by fraudulently saying he was
hedging $9 billion in stock holdings by AT&AMP;T, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Sung's positions grew so large that by September 1996, the
options on the Nasdaq 100 index in AT&AMP;T's Rhumbline account made up
two-thirds of the entire market for those options, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They engaged in hedge activity that was far riskier than we
had authorized and for amounts that were far in excess of that we
authorized,'' Eileen Connolly, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tanya Styblo Beder, principal for Capital Market Risk
Advisors Inc., which consults investors on risk controls for their
investments, said AT&AMP;T potentially could have done more to protect
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate thing here is that this is not a new fraud and
there are many well-established techniques in the marketplace for
avoiding this sort of risk fiasco,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, AT&AMP;T has put in place daily electronic monitoring of
trades made on its behalf, Ms. Connolly said. She said those
measures would help insure that the company could not be taken
advantage of by unauthorized trading in the future.
</P>
<P>
   R. Scott Henderson, executive director and general counsel for
the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board,
which oversees the Massachusetts fund, said Rhumbline had
reimbursed the fund for less than half of the $12 million in
losses. Ms. Connolly said AT&AMP;T had received a small amount, but
that it was a mere fraction of $150 million.

 By JAMES RUSSO, with SERGIO R. BUSTOS in Miami 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MADRID _ It may not be as known as Spain's telecom and banking
invasion of Latin America in recent years, but it's just as
aggressive: Since 1996, Spanish gas company Repsol has invested
heavily in the region, US$1.8 billion in 1997 alone _ 53.3 percent
of the company's total investments that year and a 100 percent
increase over 1996. And it's not over yet: The company plans to
increase that amount by $3 billion over the next five years,
according to Repsol president Alfonso Cortina.
 &HT;    ``Expansion in Latin America is a key part of our strategy for
the future. It's an emerging geographical area with growing
economic markets and huge competitive advantages,'' he says.
 &HT;    Latin American profits reached $20 million last year, but should
increase ten-fold over the next five years, Miguel Angel Remon,
Repsol's chief of strategic planning, told a recent press
conference in Madrid.
 &HT;    Yet, some analysts caution against cheering so soon.
 &HT;    ``The feeling among analysts is that Repsol paid too much for
its assets,'' says Jason Feer, publisher of the U.S.-based
newsletter Latin America Energy Alert. ``The other complaint is
that Repsol, by paying such high prices, has pushed up the prices
of other [oil and gas] assets.''
 &HT;    The Latin America expansion was spurred by a combination of
factors, including the company's goal to reduce dependence on the
Spanish market and the fact that the other European markets are
mature and oil-saturated. At the same time, Repsol was aiming at
the development of electricity generation projects utilizing gas.
 &HT;    Repsol has been concentrating on establishing integrated
operations throughout Latin America including production, refining,
transportation and marketing, as well as power generation in new
markets with large population centers and growing energy demands.
 &HT;    In its short stint in Latin America, Repsol has already become a
major oil company in Argentina, thanks to its 56.7 percent share in
the Argentine giant Astra and that company's proven reserves of 151
million barrels of oil and net reserves of 1.3 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas.
 &HT;    ``When construction is completed on the Atacama pipeline in
Argentina, Repsol will be supplying gas to the center of Argentina,
Bolivia, Chile and Brazil,'' Cortina says.
 &HT;    Repsol is currently present in nine Latin American countries:
Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil,
Argentina and Trinidad Tobago.
 &HT;    In Mexico, Repsol has a 50 percent ownership of Gas Natural
Mexico, which in March obtained a concession for the distribution
of natural gas in Monterrey, and is working on getting the
concession for the Mexican capital.
 &HT;    With that concession and those in Buenos Aires, Bogota and Rio
de Janeiro, Repsol now distributes gas in four of the region's
seven largest cities.
 &HT;    Repsol also sells petroleum products through service stations,
specifically in Ecuador, Peru and Argentina.
 &HT;    ``Within the next few years we plan to have 1,000 service
stations in Argentina, 120 in Peru, and 170 in Ecuador,'' Cortina
says.
 &HT;    Repsol's exploration and production strategy is to use Astra as
a vehicle for the company's expansion in Mercosur, and the group's
own Repsol Exploration division for expansion in the rest of the
continent. It also wants to give priority to gas exploration in
Argentina and Bolivia in order to integrate gas reserves and
electricity generation.
 &HT;    As far as refining and marketing activities goes, the company
will concentrate in Argentina through Astra and in Peru through
Repsol Peru, with no short- to medium-term plans to expand those
activities to other Latin American countries.
 &HT;    But Cortina says the industry can expect Repsol to be placing
special emphasis on its gas distribution networks and the
generation of electricity through its seemingly endless gas
reserves.
 &HT;    Feer says it may take at least a couple of years to see if the
company's strategy pays off. ``It's unreasonable to expect
fantastic results this year, but you should see some results by the
year 2000.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, company officials are bullish on both Latin
America in general and their company specifically. Says Remon: ``We
have great confidence in the future of the region, and that view is
being shared by more and more people every day.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: HEDGE FUND DIDN'T GET A BAILOUT, OR WARRANT ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HEDGEFUND-REGULATE) 
(lb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judging from the volume of criticism, William
McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, made a
dreadful mistake when he orchestrated a ``bailout'' of Long-Term
Capital Management, the multibillion-dollar investment fund that
bought most of its assets with borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, wonders
out loud why the government needed to rescue private investors.
Jeff Faux, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, spoke for
many on the political left when he questioned the fairness of
rescuing millionaire speculators when the government turns its back
on bankrupt companies that employ low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics ask whether the Fed's action creates a destructive
incentive, known as a moral hazard, for banks and securities firms
to lend recklessly to investment funds, assured by last week's
action that the government would not let their investments go belly
up.
</P>
<P>
   Good questions all. But the Fed has even better answers. The
truth is that it orchestrated no bailout, created no moral hazard
and set no bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's clean up some language. There was no bailout,
because the Fed turned over no taxpayer money to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital is a hedge fund, a type of investment fund
that caters only to investors who are rich and sophisticated. The
investors raised a few billion dollars of their own and borrowed
tens of billions more from banks and securities firms like Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   For three years its investment strategy worked brilliantly, but
its investments soured this year. Because the firm had borrowed to
the hilt, losses turned to disaster when creditors demanded their
money.
</P>
<P>
   That, says professor George Benston of Emory University, ``sets
up a classic free-rider problem.'' Each creditor grabs for its
money while there is still money to grab. But if all the creditors
grab at once, the fund will be forced to sell assets hastily,
guaranteeing stupendous losses. A fire sale of securities would put
the fund in about the same position as a family forced to sell its
suburban mansion in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``What McDonough appears to have done,'' Benston suggests, ``is
to use the credibility of the Fed to bring the creditors together
for their mutual benefit.'' Working together, they can keep the
fund alive at least long enough to sell off its assets in an
orderly, patient and perhaps even profitable manner.
</P>
<P>
   A bailout for the rich? For all the prattle, the fact is that
the partners come away nearly empty-handed. The creditors, a
consortium of banks and securities firms, have pledged to put up
$3.6 billion in exchange for 90 percent ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Moral hazard? The deal nearly wipes out the misbehaving
speculators and forces inattentive creditors to fork over money and
take over the wreckage they indirectly sponsored. This deal hardly
offers comfort for repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been talk that the deal smacks of hypocrisy. The
United States lectures the Japanese to let the market weed out
bankrupt banks and companies. But it is a stretch to connect the
dots between last week's deal and Japan's neglectful bank
regulators or its ``convoy'' system, under which strong companies
prop up the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's deal puts creditors in charge of a mop-up exercise.
There is nothing to suggest they will keep the fund in business
longer than it takes them to get back the best value for its assets
_ unless they decide it can generate long-term profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed-brokered deal raises the larger question of when the
government should rescue bankrupt companies. Bailing out
nonfinancial companies rarely makes sense, because a government
that protects losers will attract losers galore. But politicians
sometimes cannot resist bailing out the likes of Chrysler and
Lockheed _ huge corporations whose demise threatens thousands of
workers _ even though research shows that few if any jobs are truly
saved.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, however, are special. Burton Malkiel, an economics
professor at Princeton University, argues that bailing out banks
makes sense ``because taxpayers are already on the hook for the
federally insured deposits.'' And the government needs to protect
the nation's money supply.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are unwilling to extend the safety blanket
beyond banks even though the failure of hedge funds, securities
firms and other financial concerns could in theory touch off
cascading defaults that could infect banks because their loans
would go unpaid or the value of their other assets would plummet.
But it is easy to exaggerate the threat, and besides, the Fed can
pump up an economy temporarily dragged down by sluggish credit
markets.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave the debate over Long-Term Capital? It
is not a bank, nor does its collapse appear to threaten the
solvency of banks. It does not, then, warrant a bailout. It didn't
get one. McDonough merely helped creditors take over the firm and
spare themselves needless losses. Score one for McDonough's good
sense.
</P>

 Por JAMES RUSSO, con SERGIO R. BUSTOS en Miami 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MADRID _ Quiza no sea tan conocida como la invasion espanola de
la banca y las telecomunicaciones de America Latina en los ultimos
anos, pero tiene el mismo impetu: desde 1996, la compania espanola
de petroleo y gas Repsol ha invertido fuertemente en la region,
US$1.800 millones solo en 1997, el 53,3 por ciento de la inversion
total de la empresa ese ano y 100 por ciento mas que en 1996. Y aun
no ha terminado: planea aumentar esa cifra en US$3.000 millones en
los proximos cinco anos, segun su presidente, Alfonso Cortina.
 &HT;    ``La expansion en America Latina es parte clave de
nuestraestrategia para el futuro. Es una region geografica
emergente, con crecientes mercados economicos y enormes ventajas
competitivas,'' dice.
 &HT;    Las ganancias latinoamericanas llegaron a US$20 millones el ano
pasado, pero esa cantidad debe aumentar 10 veces en los cinco anos
proximos, dijo Miguel Angel Remon, director de planificacion
estrategica de Repsol, en una reciente conferencia de prensa en
Madrid.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, varios analistas advierten que aun es pronto para
cantar victoria.
 &HT;    ``La opinion de los analistas es que Repsol pago demasiado por
sus activos,'' dice Jason Feer, editor del boletin Latin America
Energy Alert, publicado en Estados Unidos. ``La otra queja es que
Repsol, al pagar esos altos precios, ha hecho subir los precios de
otros activos [petroleo y gas]``.
 &HT;    La expansion en America Latina recibio el estimulo de una
combinacion de factores: el objetivo de la compania de reducir su
dependencia del mercado espanol y que otros mercados europeos estan
maduros. Al mismo tiempo, Repsol apuntaba al desarrollo de
proyectos de generacion electrica a gas.
 &HT;    Repsol se ha concentrado en la creacion de operaciones
integradas en Latinoamerica, como produccion, refinacion,
transporte y mercadeo, asi como generacion electrica en nuevos
mercados con una gran concentracion demografica y una gran demanda
de energia.
 &HT;    En su breve periodo en America Latina, Repsol ya se ha
convertido en una importante petrolera en Argentina, gracias a su
participacion del 56,7 por ciento en el gigante argentino Astra y a
las reservas comprobadas de la compania de 151 millones de barriles
de petroleo y reservas netas de unos 37 millones de metros cubicos
de gas natural.
 &HT;    ``Cuando se termine la construccion del oleoducto Atacama en
Argentina, Repsol suministrara gas al centro de Argentina, Bolivia,
Chile y Brasil,'' afirma Cortina.
 &HT;    Repsol tiene presencia en nueve paises de America Latina y el
Caribe: Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brasil,
Argentina y Trinidad y Tobago.
 &HT;    En Mexico, Repsol es propietaria del 50 por ciento de Gas
Natural Mexico, que en marzo obtuvo la concesion para distribuir
gas natural en Monterrey, y trata de obtener la concesion de Mexico
DF.
 &HT;    Con esa concesion y las de Buenos Aires, Bogota y Rio de
Janeiro, Repsol ya distribuye gas en cuatro de las siete mayores
ciudades de la region.
 &HT;    Repsol tambien vende productos de petroleo en gasolineras,
especificamente en Ecuador, Peru y Argentina.
 &HT;    ``En los proximos anos planeamos tener 1.000 gasolineras en
Argentina, 120 en Peru y 170 en Ecuador,'' dice Cortina.
 &HT;    La estrategia de exploracion y produccion de Repsol consiste en
usar a Astra como vehiculo de la expansion de la compania en los
paises del Mercosur, y utilizar la division de exploracion de
Repsol para la expansion en el resto del continente. Tambien quiere
priorizar la exploracion de gas en Argentina y Bolivia con el fin
de integrar las reservas de gas y la generacion de electricidad.
 &HT;    En cuanto a las actividades de refinacion y mercadeo, la empresa
se concentrara en Argentina a traves de Astra, y en Peru a traves
de Repsol Peru, sin planes a corto o mediano plazo para extender
esas actividades a otros paises latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Pero Cortina dice que el sector puede esperar que Repsol haga un
enfasis especial en sus redes de distribucion de gas y en la
generacion electrica a traves de sus reservas de gas, al parecer
infinitas.
 &HT;    Feer dice que puede tomar por lo menos un par de anos para ver
si la estrategia de la compania da resultado. ``No es razonable
esperar resultados fantasticos este ano, pero debemos ver algunos
resultados para el ano 2000.''
 &HT;    Entretanto, los ejecutivos de la compania sienten un gran
optimismo hacia America Latina en general y hacia su empresa en
particular. Dice Remon: ``Tenemos una gran confianza en el futuro
de la region, y esa vision cada dia la comparten mas personas.''

   LAS MINAS, Dominican Republic _ Miguel Montero and his family
fled their home in this remote precinct of the town of San Juan
last week after radio reports warned that a hurricane was headed
their way.
</P>
<P>
   But once Hurricane Georges completed its violent journey through
here, the Monteros returned to a scene that left them stunned: the
flood waters had swept their home and nearly half of this small
village into the murky depths of the nearby San Juan River, leaving
almost nothing behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lost,'' said Montero, a slight, 23-year-old man whose
family has been forced to sleep on the floor of a baseball stadium
in the center of San Juan along with hundreds of his fellow
villagers. ``Everything we had is gone. There is no trace that we
were ever here.''
</P>
<P>
   While most people in this Caribbean nation begin the arduous
task of repairing their homes, schools and businesses, few in this
forsaken village have been left with anything to repair. Their
homes have nearly all disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges dealt one of its most devastating blows to the
15,000 people living here and in the surrounding villages on the
western edge of this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Houses were either swallowed by the engorged river or toppled
and buried in mud. Trees were shredded and in many cases uprooted.
The stench of rotting animal carcasses fills the air. And the local
coffin maker, who normally makes 10 a week, says he is suddenly
filling orders for 12 a day.
</P>
<P>
   As Frank Monte de Occa, a migrant worker who lost his home, put
it: ``We have become a community of refugees. We have nowhere to
go. I don't know how we will ever recover from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with rescue workers arriving and wreckage from the storm
being slowly cleared away, many residents are already trying to
look past this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Montero said his two nieces, ages 6 and 3, and a nephew,
2, drowned in the surging waters that swept through the area in the
pre-dawn hours of Sept. 22, but Montero, a tall man with sunken
eyes and leathery skin, says he has not allowed himself to linger
on it too much, saving his energy for rebuilding his home.
</P>
<P>
   He has urged his sister, the mother of the three children, to do
the same. ``She is completely devastated,'' Montero said. ``But I
told her not to dwell on it because it would only make things
worse. The dead are dead. There's nothing we can do. The living
must continue living.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Minas, nestled in between mountains about a hundred miles
west of the capital city, Santo Domingo, is a poor community of
farm workers that had the terrible luck of being in the way of the
hurricane as it barreled along the southern coast of the island
before shifting violently inland and crossing the border into
Haiti, the Dominican Republic's neighbor on the island of
Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane struck hardest in Las Minas and other small towns
and villages in the west, where the bulk of the nation's 249
storm-related deaths occurred, according to American officials
coordinating rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it took nearly a week for any help from outside to
arrive in the mountainous region because Las Minas and the other
neighboring small towns had been cut off by flood waters and broken
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   That has deepened the misery here and forced people to make do
with what little food and water they had before the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea of when we'll begin putting our lives back
together again,'' said Manuel Pineldo, whose home was destroyed and
whose brother was swept away by surging flood waters and drowned.
``We live in a province that is cut off from everything. The help
we need isn't arriving.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The despair can be seen almost everywhere. People dig pots,
pans, dresses and clothing from mounds of mud.
</P>
<P>
   They draw buckets of drinking water from and bathe in a river
being dredged for dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They sift through the rubble of their former houses, scavenging
for nails, lumber and other costly and scarce building material
that they can use to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Or they load pickup trucks with mattresses, sofas and whatever
else they can salvage to take on their journey to find a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine Morillo Sanchez is one of those who returned to see
what could be saved from his house, a small one-room structure made
of timber and sheets of tin that was almost miraculously left
standing. There was not a lot left inside: four wooden chairs, a
small table, a mattress spring, his baby's crib _ and the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much left worth saving,'' said Sanchez, a timid
and soft-spoken man who took such pride in his little house that he
actually bothered to paint its tin exterior purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``the good thing is we're alive.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sanchez, his wife and two children, ages 2 and 11
months, are staying at a shelter until they can figure out what to
do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has devastated us,'' said Sanchez, 31, who makes his
living by running errands for a local bank president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only uplifting thing in Las Minas these days is the
resilience and resolve of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Blasmaria Diaz, a 23-year-old migrant worker, toiled beneath a
blazing sun on a swampy field where his house once stood, prying
its tin roof from the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to rebuild it over there,'' he said, almost
confidently, as he pointed to a field far from the river, a place
where he things he will be safer. ``I don't know how long it will
take. But I'm going to rebuild it eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenida Encarnacion, a 37-year-old bodega owner who lost both her
home and business, somehow found it in herself not to be bitter _
or at least show bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the hurricane struck, Ms. Encarnacion and her
three children arrived at a shelter that officials had set up at
the local baseball stadium. Bracing for the worst, she took as many
goods from her store as she could carry: bottles of orange juice,
rolls of bread, boxes of cookies and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate that I have food to feed my children with,'' she
said sitting in a small, cramped room inside the stadium. ``There
are so many others who are going hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, one big question on most people's minds is what will
become of La Minas. Some say they fully intend to rebuild their
homes and stay. But others say that would be fool-hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Berna de Lozanto, a 23-year-old mother of three, is in the
latter camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous area,'' she said Wednesday afternoon,
pointing to the river. `I will never come back. Not with my
children. Not with that river there.''

   JERUSALEM _ Thirteen Israeli soldiers and 11 Palestinian
passers-by were wounded Wednesday when a Palestinian hurled
grenades at an Israeli patrol post in the heart of the divided city
of Hebron, a flash point for violent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the attack took place at 4:30 p.m., close to
a Jewish settler enclave that borders on the casbah, the
Palestinian open-air market, in the Israeli-controlled sector.
Soldiers pursued the suspect, they said, shooting and wounding him
in the leg before he escaped into Palestinian territory, where the
Palestinian police were in charge of apprehending him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand widespread searches to find those responsible,''
Yitzhak Eitan, the Israeli commander for the West Bank, said at a
briefing Wednesday night. ``We demand the Palestinians take
responsibility for what happened here, and to prevent attacks on
Israeli targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebron, a city of 120,000, has been a tinderbox since it was
divided in early 1997 by the last peace agreement signed by the
Israelis and the Palestinians. Israel remains in control of 20
percent of the city, where some 450 Jewish settlers live in armed
compounds, protected by a recently beefed up force of about 2,000
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions run at a constant high, with routine sniper fire and
rock-throwing between the two sides, who live so close together
that the pungent smell of Arab spices wafts through the barbed wire
into the settlers' apartments. But tensions flared with the killing
of a rabbi in late August, after which the settlers raged through
the casbah, overturning produce stands. Just Monday, a Jewish
tourist was shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron was the last city turned over to even partial Palestinian
control as peace talks have been stalled for more than a year and a
half. But in Washington this week, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed to the
essentials of a pact whereby Israel would withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank, if the Palestinians act to insure Israeli
security and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers, who oppose the withdrawal, seized on the attack _
and the suspects' escape into Palestinian territory _ as evidence
that their opposition is warranted. ``That 13 percent is just
another 13 percent of land for them to prepare their attacks and
run back into, as we saw today,'' said David Wilder, a spokesman
for the settlers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, too, linked Wednesday's attack to the
peace talks, saying it could give Netanyahu a last-minute excuse to
walk away from the negotiations, which are supposed to culminate in
a three-way summit meeting in Washington in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever was behind this incident was obviously trying to
thwart the peace agreement,'' Jibril Rajoub, chief of preventive
security in the West Bank, said in an interview. ``If the one who
was behind it was a Palestinian, then it is a free service for
Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub said he was investigating the attack, which he denounced.
``We were informed by Israelis that the one who was behind it
escaped to our areas,'' he said. ``We are checking. But we have no
evidence regarding this accusation.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, Palestinian security officials announced that
they had raided and dismantled a terrorist explosives laboratory in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   After the grenade attack, the Israeli Army imposed a curfew on
Palestinian residents. Jewish settlers were briefly held at the
Cave of the Patriarchs _ believed to be the burial place of the
biblical Abraham _ after they finished the prayers of the Yom
Kippur holiday, then were allowed to move freely through the city
center.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian witnesses asserted that the incident happened
differently, and that Jewish settlers played a role in the
violence. After visiting the wounded, a Palestinian Authority
official, Ali Kawasmeh, said some believed that a settler had
thrown something into a Palestinian jitney that exploded during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Army officials were skeptical, saying that one of
the two grenades aimed at the patrol post had rolled under the
jitney instead. And Palestinian security officials discounted their
version, too.

PAC-10 TEAMS CAN'T EVEN SPELL RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you were in Lincoln, Neb., Tallahassee, Fla., or simply
watching The Weather Channel last Saturday, there wasn't much
reason to cheer for the Pac-10. The conference that seems
perpetually incapable of producing a national champion put its
prestige on the line with three marquee games before the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
   Make that two games, but more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   First to Nebraska, where the Cornhuskers throttled Washington
55-7. It was only the Cornhuskers' largest victory ever against a
top-10 opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to crawl into a hole,'' Washington quarterback
Brock Huard said. ``It was just a bad, bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard, considered one of the top quarterbacks in the country,
was waving the white flag by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Stop hitting me.' He was starting to whine a
little,'' said Nebraska defensive end Chad Kelsay. ``But his
offensive line wasn't giving him much protection and it had to get
old time after time having guys in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Florida, things were only slightly better. USC produced
23 yards passing and was pushed around like a 98-pound weakling in
a 30-10 loss to Florida State. Perhaps indicative of where the
Pac-10 stands today, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden couldn't
resist taking a minor dig after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nearly like a child in that game,'' Bowden said. ``It
was all because of having USC in our stadium. I nearly couldn't
believe it. Twenty years ago, USC was playing for national
championships and we were little ol' Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   The one contest in which it looked like the Pac-10 would save
some face is becoming the most lingering embarrassment. UCLA's game
with Miami was canceled, uh, postponed, by Hurricane Georges, the
hurricane that went everywhere but Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bruins are clearly the superior team, their manhood
is being challenged in Miami. Hurricanes officials are portraying
the Bruins as losing their nerve by backing off attempts to
reschedule the game. Miami athletic director Paul Dee said Tuesday
the Hurricanes want to reschedule, but UCLA has scheduling
``impediments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the University of Miami, we really don't have any
impediments,'' Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about UCLA's ``impediments,'' Dee responded, ``You'd have
to ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrows are coming from all directions and with good reason.
The Pac-10 is offering little resistance from critics who believe
the conference remains too pass-happy and finesse-oriented to ever
seriously compete against the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   As far restoring its national reputation, the Pac-10 won't have
many more chances as the teams settle into conference games. That
means teams will beat up on each other and there's little hope of
watching a Pac-10 team in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mourning a friend: The day after he rushed for 318 yards
against Rice _ the second-highest single game total in school
history _ Texas running back Ricky Williams learned he had lost a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Williams won the Doak Walker Award, which is given
to the nation's top running back. Sunday, Walker, the former SMU
star and the 1948 Heisman Trophy winner, died from complications of
being paralyzed in a skiing accident in January.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Walker became friends, particularly after Walker
suffered his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to dedicate the season to him and try to win the
award that carries his name,'' said Williams, who is third
nationally in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look at his photo in my locker, I'll think of
everything he stood for,'' Williams said. ``Things like humility
and being well-liked and respected by everybody. I'll try to
emulate him as much as I can. He had accomplished so much in his
life, but he was very humble.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Team cheerleader: Where else but Vanderbilt could a
cheerleader end up playing on the football team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girls talked me into trying out for cheerleading,'' said
Thomas Gallant. ``A friend of mine was already on the squad and
said, `Just come out and meet the girls,' and I said, `OK.' I threw
a couple of them in the air and it was kind of fun so I decided to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always talked to my cheerleading partner about what it would
be like to be out there playing.''
</P>
<P>
   So he tried out for Vandy's team last spring and has earned some
playing time on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kelly Adams, Gallant's former cheerleading partner: ``I was
a little concerned about him playing in the SEC. There are some big
guys out there and I didn't want him to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bet the over: The Minnesota-Purdue game Saturday will make
bookies earn their money when it comes to the over-under line. The
two teams have combined for 437 points and 5,104 yards of total
offense in their last five meetings. That's an average of 87.4
points and 1,021 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   The scores: 59-43 in 1997, 30-27 in 1996, 39-38 in 1995, 49-37
in 1994, 59-56 in 1993. (The Gophers won in 1993 and 1995, Purdue
in 1994, 1996 and 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   __ On the hot seat: Speculation increases daily that South
Carolina coach Brad Scott is in serious trouble even though his
contract was extended last year and runs through 2001. ``I'm not
worried about that a bit,'' Scott insisted last week, which means
he is probably in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,052 fans who watched the 38-0 loss to Mississippi State
was the smallest turnout since the stadium was expanded prior to
the 1996 season. Doesn't that still make the stadium the
second-largest city in the state? &QL; 
TOP 10 &QL; 
1. Nebraska (4-0): Too bad Huskers can't expose K-State as fraud
now instead of later. &QL; 
2. Ohio State (3-0): Buckeyes get first test with Penn State. Will
they choke? &QL; 
3. Kansas State (4-0): Enough with the victories over all those
directional schools. &QL; 
4. Florida State (3-1): Seminoles defense makes up for
inconsistency of QB Chris Weinke. &QL; 
5. LSU (3-0): Best team in country that remains question mark but
keeps winning. &QL; 
6. Tennessee (3-0): Big surprise here. Houston coach Kim Helton
likes Vols over Bruins. &QL; 
7. UCLA (2-0): Miami Hurricanes not nearly as big a headache as
Hurricane Georges. &QL; 
8. Florida (3-1): Gee, now Steve Spurrier says he'll finally start
recruiting a kicker. &QL; 
9. Syracuse (2-1): Orangemen have regrouped nicely from early loss
to Tennessee. &QL; 
10. Penn State (3-0): Even with bye, somehow a two-touchdown
underdog to Ohio State. &QL; 
__ Five more to watch: Virginia (4-0), Colorado (4-0), Texas A&AMP;M
(3-1), Georgia (3-0), Oregon (4-0).

 &HT;    Stocks' quarter worst since '90
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market ended its worst quarter in eight
years Wednesday with the bears seemingly in control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, fearing banks will be hurt by trouble at some hedge
funds and disappointed by the size of the Federal Reserve's
interest rate cut, accelerated the selling they began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also blamed the market's bearish mood on investor worry
about third-quarter profits, problems in Asia and Japan, and
closer-to-home currency problems in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was hoping the Fed would lower rates, but when a cut
finally came Tuesday, the quarter-percentage-point decline in
federal funds _ to 5.25 percent _ failed to satisfy U.S. investors.
Europeans regarded the rate cut as too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But as small as it was, some analysts viewed it as a significant
recognition by the Fed that foreign currency problems have replaced
inflation as the main threat to the U.S. economy _ a threat the
rate cut was designed to thwart.
</P>
<P>
   Fed defenders say the rate cut was most likely the first of
several cuts by a central bank that chooses to be cautious, but has
demonstrated a willingness to go as far as necessary to get its job
done.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction by many banks was to cut their prime rate from 8.5
percent to 8.25 percent. The prime is a benchmark for many business
and consumer loans, including home equity lines and credit card
rates. That came as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell
below 5 percent for the first time. What happened was that the
flight from stocks to bonds pushed Treasury prices higher. That
lowered yields, which move opposite to price.
</P>
<P>
   The selling of stocks pushed the Dow Jones industrial down 2.9
percent and the Nasdaq composite down 2.3 percent. The Dow's
decline _ nearly 238 points _ was its seventh-biggest one-day point
drop.
</P>
<P>
   While all the major stock averages posted their worst
July-September losses since the third quarter of 1990, a number of
factors help put the sell-off in perspective:
</P>
<P>
   --The losses were smaller than in 1990. The Dow's loss was 12.39
percent vs. 14.86 percent eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   --Unlike 1990, when the losses occurred throughout the quarter,
most of this year's damage was done in July and August. September,
historically a down month for stocks, saw the Dow post a 4 percent
gain in volatile trading.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with interest rates low, inflation under control and the
Fed moving to protect the economy, the stock market's biggest
challenge is the prospect of some dismal corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   And the omens have not been good. Company after company came
forth in September with disappointing advance announcements,
including Coca-Cola, Gillette, RJR Nabisco Holdings, Nike, Deere
and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   First Call, a Boston-based research group that tracks analysts
earnings estimates, said third-quarter profits are expected to
decline for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estimates for the third quarter are showing the steepest
downward revisions than for any quarter since the 1990-'91
recession,'' said First Call research director Charles L. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But an earnings decline is not the same as a loss, and some
analysts argue that earnings growth of any size against a strong
U.S. economic backdrop will set the stage for a bullish rally. Some
analysts believe the worst of the sell-off is already over, as
reflected in the September upturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of encouraging technical market indicators
that support our view that the lows for the year have been seen,''
said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he noted that bearish sentiment among Wall Street
professionals is at the highest level since 1994 _ a positive
signal for contrarians.

IMF ISSUES PESSIMISTIC ASSESSMENT OF RUSSIAN, JAPANESE ECONOMIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-IMF) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusually pessimistic report, the
International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that it now expects
the Russian economy to contract by 6 percent this year and next,
and Japan to sink into its deepest recession since the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued a day before finance ministers from around
the world arrive here for annual meetings of the World Bank and the
IMF, also drastically scales back estimates of how fast other
economies will grow. It urges 90 percent of the world's central
banks to cut interest rates in an effort to spur growth and calls
for greater cuts in the United States. The Federal Reserve on
Tuesday announced its first cut in three years _ a modest
quarter-percent off one of its key short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the IMF puts the very best spin on bad news. Repeatedly
it has said the Asian crisis _ and its destabilizing effects around
the world _ was abating. On Wednesday, instead, it warned that
``Chances of any significant improvement in 1999 have also
diminished and the risks of a deeper, wider and more prolonged
downturn have escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   Another notable change in this report was the call for interest
rate cuts. Just months ago, the IMF was prescribing high interest
rates in Thailand, Korea, Indonesia and then Russia, confident that
once their currencies were stabilized there would be a chance to
cut rates again and resume growth. But now the IMF _ and the U.S.
Treasury, which deeply influences the fund _ regard the choking off
of growth as the greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   The news about Russia came as the World Bank, in another blow to
the government of President Boris Yeltsin, suggested that it might
have to cancel $6 billion in planned aid for the country. The money
was promised in July, before Russia let its ruble devalue and
forced out virtually all of its economic reformers. Since then the
IMF has suspended its aid &UR; to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; p
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not a total of $6 billion for the 18-month period
makes sense is, I think, debatable at this point,'' Johannes Linn,
World Bank vice president for Europe and Central Asia, told a news
conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on Wednesday, the IMF predicted that world growth
would be limited to 2 percent this year. That is a huge step
backward: A year ago, before its last annual meeting in Hong Kong,
the fund forecast that the global economy would expand by 4.3
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's slowdown is perhaps the most worrisome news. The fund
predicted that the world's second largest economy would shrink by
2.5 percent this year. Until recently, most economists have guessed
that Japan's growth would be zero to minus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's growth is critical because it serves as the engine for
other Asian economies. But the downturn in Japan is so severe that
the country's banks have stopped lending _ causing a credit crunch
that is freezing economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's revised figures also show that five of Asia's most
critical economies will be deep in recession this year: Malaysia,
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and South Korea. Indonesia's
downturn will be the worst, and rice shortages there are
increasingly severe. China's economy, the IMF said, will grow at
5.5 percent, making it the healthiest major economy in the region.

EARLY EJECTIONS SERVE AS INDIANS' WAKEUP CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Down 1-0 in the series, behind 2-0 early in the
game, with even the umpires ]apparently against them, the Cleveland
Indians responded yesterday like defending American League
champions.
</P>
<P>
   They came out fighting. Or, at the very least, yelling and
cursing. Their response led to the early ejection of their manager
and their starting pitcher, but the ultimate result was worth it: a
9-5 Game 2 victory against the Red Sox that sends the series to
Boston tied at a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that showed as much emotion as a sleepwalker for most
of the regular season, the game was a revelation. The Indians could
play a fiery brand of baseball, as Cleveland players acknowledged.
It just took a brouhaha with an umpire to ignite them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were intense coming in knowing that we can't go to Boston
down two games,'' said Indians' hitting star of the day, David
Justice, who drove in four runs with a home run and a double. But
it was the two swift ejections, he added, that took his team's
intensity to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say the umpires are against us,'' Justice
said, ``but when you look across the field and see the Red Sox want
to beat you, and then something happens early and you feel like,
man, everyone is against us. I think that makes the players dig
down inside, come together, up our intensity and just go take it.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened early to motivate the Indians was that Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove and starting pitcher Dwight Gooden were
thrown out of the game in the first inning by home-plate umpire Joe
Brinkman.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove was tossed, Brinkman said in a prepared statement, for
``questioning balls and strikes'' to leadoff hitter Darren Lewis.
``The ejection of Gooden, which came three batters later, occurred
after Gooden, ``screamed an expletive right in my ear,'' Brinkman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's dismissal followed what appeared to be a blown call at
the plate that cost the Indians a run and an out. Brinkman ruled
Boston base runner John Valentin safe at home even though videotape
replays indicated Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar appeared to have
tagged Valentin out well before he touched the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The run, coming on a double by red-hot Nomar Garciaparra, gave
the Red Sox a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's surprise dismissal turned out well for the Indians,
however, and not just because of the spark it provided. It also
caused Cleveland to go to the bullpen for Dave Burba, a starter all
season long who Hargrove had moved to a long relief role for the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Burba came on with a runner in scoring position, down two runs
and stopped the Red Sox's momentum, quickly ending the first inning
without further damage and pitching well into the sixth. He left
with the Indians leading 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a fantastic job for that club, bottom line,'' Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave stepped up huge for us today,'' Hargrove said. ``He came
in in a tough situation. He threw strikes and he got us out of the
\Rfirst\S inning with only two runs being scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba's performance bought the Indians time to mount a comeback.
They got one run back in the first on a Justice sacrifice fly.
Cleveland took a 6-2 lead in the second inning when nine men went
to the plate. Justice's three-run home run off Boston reliever John
Wasdin, who replaced knuckleballer Tim Wakefield in the inning, was
his ninth career postseason homer.
</P>
<P>
   Justice has been plagued by knee problems all season that he
said have affected his hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it felt pretty good,'' he said, ``I hit the ball pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   With the series tied heading to Fenway Park, Hargrove also was
feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go in there,'' he said, ``feeling good about winning
today when we had to. Now it's down to a best of three.''

BANK ROBBERS BRANCH OUT INTO LANDSCAPING
</HEADLINE>
 THE BUSH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Their landscaping was excellent. Their bank robbing
needed a little work.
</P>
<P>
   In a move evoking cartoon coyotes sneaking up on the Roadrunner,
two men who robbed a Bank of America branch Wednesday apparently
camouflaged their hiding spot near the entrance with a half-dozen
waist-high shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Two bank employees who arrived to open the South Hulen Street
branch about 8 a.m. paid no attention to the additional bushes
until the masked men burst out and ordered them into the bank at
gunpoint, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They noticed the additional shrubbery there, but really
attributed it to landscapers who had not necessarily cleaned up
after they trimmed,'' said Darryl Ewing, a Bank of America
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery plan swiftly unraveled from there.
</P>
<P>
   A bank employee included a dye pack in the bag of money from the
safe. The remotely activated device was triggered when the robbers
tried to get out the locked back door, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The robbers found the keys and unlocked the back door, but not
before the dye pack exploded, staining the money red. The robbers
dropped the bag of cash on the bank floor and fled, leaving the
money _ and the bushes _ behind.

<P>
   ``One is assuming that the bad guys brought it,'' police Lt.
Alice Adams said about the shrubbery. ``We won't know that until we
catch them and they tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams didn't know whether the bushes were collected as evidence,
and she speculated that they may have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that people who rob banks buy their own
shrubs,'' she said.

OFF CITY ON GULF COAST, CASINOS RIDE OUT STORM
</HEADLINE>

   BILOXI, Miss. _ The locals call it the Mississippi Miracle. But
proud as they are of the glittering gambling casinos that over the
past six years have turned this once-seedy Gulf Coast town into
something akin to Atlantic City South, the people of Biloxi have
always had in the back of their minds that, well, if the time ever
comes when the chips are really down during hurricane season,
Biloxi might need a more heavenly kind of miracle.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike Atlantic City, N.J., and for sure unlike the desert
city of Las Vegas, Biloxi is one gambling town that requires, by
law, that casinos float.
</P>
<P>
   This is not some kind of enticement concept, anything but.
Rather, it is a legal conceit whose intent is to isolate gambling,
confine it, so that the sensibilities of those who see wagering as
sin or socially destructive are salved. That concession is no small
consideration down here in the Bible Belt or in parts of the
straight-laced Midwest, where casinos are often required to float
on rivers.
</P>
<P>
   If Las Vegas had a floating casino requirement, they'd put the
paddle wheeler Delta Queen in the middle of a big pond out among
the plastic magnolias and cactus and have some Rhett Butler
character _ cheroot, riverboat gambler's white hat and all _
greeting patrons at the gangplank. They may yet do that. But here
in Biloxi, with a couple of exceptions, casino operators have met
the boat requirement by building businesslike, windowless gaming
rooms on huge barges, then permanently snugging up the barges so
close to waterside hotels that they look like extensions of the
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 6,000 gamblers who visit almost-tropical Biloxi each
day never know they are afloat as they work the tables and slots of
what is now the third busiest gambling town in the country, behind
Las Vegas and Atlantic City. But they are afloat, hence the concern
about the eventual Big Blow.
</P>
<P>
   It came shortly before dawn on Monday when Hurricane Georges
pounded ashore, fixing its eye on Biloxi and then battering its
already deserted casino row with 100-mph-plus winds.
</P>
<P>
   Trees and billboards went down. Shingles, siding, even entire
houses went flying. A 10-foot tidal surge, combined with more than
a foot of rain, left water, sand, sailboats, fish and not a few
alligators and snakes in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the barges _ the anchor, as it were, of a $2 billion
investment in Biloxi by gambling operators _ rode it out with only
minor damage. So, too, did the adjacent hotels, though several
hundred of the 14,000 rooms suffered water damage when their
windows were smashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always said we could build casinos that would ride one out
and we did,'' Harry Joachim, the executive director of the Biloxi
Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday, relief in his voice, as repair
crews and cleanup teams labored to put everything back in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say we weren't lucky,'' he added, ``because
the whole Gulf Coast was pretty lucky this time around. But we came
through as advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most casinos will probably be shut down for the better
part of a week for repairs and refurbishing, which will cost them,
together, better than $3 million a day in gambling revenue, and
perhaps that much more again in lodging, restaurant and other
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to come out of this OK but it's going to set
them back a bit for a while in revenue and the number of patrons
playing,'' said Jason Ader, a gambling analyst for Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   At least one casino, Treasure Bay, could be shut down for almost
two weeks. Its barge, which actually looks like a pirate ship
instead of part of a hotel, suffered some hull damage _ above the
waterline _ when surging seas slammed it against some pilings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed to pull itself away from the shore and ride
out storms while moored fore and aft between two sets of big
posts,'' Barbara Shattles, Treasure Bay's executive vice president,
said. ``But it cut loose a little bit too much and took some hard
banging. Still, we consider the system a big success.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other Biloxi barges not only do not look like pirate ships
or any other kind of vessel but also do not sit as exposed to open
water as the Treasure Bay barge, which is docked on the beach
front. Some are nestled in coves, while others lie behind
breakwaters, protective measures that stood up well against
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Biloxi, at Gulfport, the Copa, another casino that
more resembles a boat than a barge, rode out Georges by taking on
water as ballast. It, too, suffered only minimal damage, according
to gaming officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty good about the way things turned out,'' Chuck
Patton, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission,
said. ``The fact is, for all the dire warnings, the casinos are
designed to take a lot more than Georges offered. But let's hope
that test never comes.''
</P>
<P>
   How much more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Upwards of 200 miles an hour,'' Ms. Shattles of Treasure Bay
said. ``But that's something you don't even want to think about,
especially if you lived through Camille back in 1969. I did. When
she came ashore here, she was blowing a 150 miles an hour and more
and it was terrifying, just absolutely terrifying. We got
flattened.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council on Wednesday scheduled an
emergency meeting for Thursday to condemn the massacres of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo that witnesses attributed to Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be no impunity for such an act of ethnic hatred,''
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said at a news conference
in Blackpool, England, where he was attending a conference of his
Labor Party. ``This was not an act of war. This was plain, cold
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which takes over the rotating presidency of the
Security Council on Thursday, called for the urgent special
session, which the United States backed.
</P>
<P>
   The Council, which last week demanded an immediate end to
attacks on civilians by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, is
expected to condemn President Slobodan Milosevic's forces in even
stronger terms than it did then, although the Council, with no
troops at its disposal, remains divided on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, however, has completed planning for possible air strikes,
Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson, said Wednesday. He
told reporters that the organization was proposing sharply targeted
military strikes on Serbian forces, not random bombing, which would
only endanger civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO officials say military action could begin as soon as
next week, after Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports to the
Security Council on Yugoslav compliance with its demands. It is far
from clear that this link is essential, since the United States has
already stated that NATO has the authority now to strike the
Yugoslav forces attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But any ultimate action would depend on support from the Clinton
administration. A spokesman for the State Department, James Foley,
said Wednesday, ``Military action is a live and real prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain whether the administration, preoccupied by
the Lewinsky scandal and facing November elections, will determine
to strike at the Serbs. And even if it does, Milosevic appears so
defiant of world opinion that he might be willing to withstand an
air strike in order to crush the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Security Council resolution was passed under a
provision of the U.N. charter that makes it enforceable by military
means. But there is dissent on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France are very reluctant to condone the use of force
against Yugoslavia at this stage, and would argue that further
Security Council action is needed before it can be seen to be
condoning NATO action. In the Security Council, China could not
even be persuaded last week to join the warning to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials at the United Nations reacted Wednesday
with shock not only at the horrific killings of civilians _ women,
children and elderly men shot through the head, mutilated or burned
to death in their homes _ but also at the audacity that Milosevic
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have watched the Yugoslav leader flout world opinion
before through years of fighting in the Balkans, but not as boldly
as he has in recent weeks, as he continues his ruthless suppression
of the ethnic Albanians, a majority in the province where an ethnic
Albanian rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has been battling
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That rebellion, Annan said Wednesday, ``can never justify the
pattern of terror, including the burning of houses, looting,
killing of livestock and wanton killing that have been reported in
these last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such actions are totally unacceptable to the international
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was described as ``outraged'' by the descriptions of the
massacres published Wednesday since he had met only on Tuesday with
Yugoslavia's foreign minister and delivered a sharp message to him
after hearing reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports are particularly shocking to the secretary-general
in light of denials received from the foreign minister that such
actions were taking place,'' said Fred Eckhard, the
secretary-general's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that the massacres in
Kosovo underline the urgent need for human rights monitors in the
area. Last week, the Security Council made that one of its demands.
The European Union and other organizations have volunteered to
monitor Kosovo, but have been rebuffed by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Cook, the foreign secretary, said he had been in
touch with the War Crimes Tribunal for the Balkans in The Hague,
Netherlands, and had asked its prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada,
to investigate the massacres in recent days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cook also called a meeting in London on Friday of senior
officials from nations that call themselves the contact group on
the former Yugoslavia _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia and
the United States _ to discuss how to settle the problem
peacefully. In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
spoke with her British counterpart by telephone several times
Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, did not rule out the
use of force under the existing Security Council resolution. On a
visit to Azerbaijan, Solana said NATO's reaction would be
determined by ``what happens on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of Milosevic should be judged by his deeds, not
by his words,'' he said. ``Too many words have not been complied
with by Milosevic.''

 &HT;    Rich's doing far more than moving furniture at `flagship'
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Depending on which floor you're on, the Rich's at
Gwinnett Place mall either looks like the classiest store in the
chain or a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   Practically everything is new upstairs, where hardwood fixtures
and racks gleam in brightly lit departments. But it's a virtual war
zone on the level below as shoppers dodge construction workers
scrambling to finish a major overhaul by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   This is no run-of-the-mill renovation, though. The changes under
way at Gwinnett Place signify a new direction for the Atlanta-based
Rich's/Lazarus/Goldsmith's division of Federated Department Stores,
which is revamping the store at a cost of $20 million _ double what
the entire mall is spending on its current renovation project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gwinnett Place store represents a strategy we either have
or will replicate in other cities,'' said Russell Stravitz,
chairman and chief executive of the $2.17 billion division. ``This
is our new flagship department store, which is designed to be the
dominant department store in its trading area.''
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is being rolled out in the Gwinnett Place
store, which generates the highest volume in metro Atlanta,
Stravitz said. ``Atlanta is very important to our strategy,'' he
said. ``We will probably have three to four of these flagships
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, along with the nearly identical Lazarus and Goldsmith's
chains, is Federated's third-largest division behind Macy's East
and Macy's West. Rich's currently has 13 stores in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Since Federated merged with Macy's in 1994, industry observers
and shoppers have wondered how the precarious competition with
Rich's would pan out in metro Atlanta, where you'll find both
anchors in seven of the area's 13 major malls. But in a rare media
interview, Stravitz outlined a strategy that would indicate Rich's
has dug in its heels on its home turf _ at least for the immediate
future.
</P>
<P>
   The guts of the new flagship strategy, Stravitz says, is pulling
the furniture out of the main store and showcasing it in a
50,000-square-foot free-standing showroom, as it did outside
Gwinnett Place earlier this year. ``This allows us to expand the
department store fully so that we have very large apparel and soft
lines,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the furniture from the 270,000-square-foot Gwinnett
Place store allowed Rich's to expand all departments 30 percent to
40 percent. The new flagship stores are larger than most Rich's,
which range from 150,000 to 225,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The departments also are better organized, Stravitz said.
``We've put all the women's apparel on one floor so that it's
easier to shop,'' he said. Everything associated with men's
merchandise has been grouped together, too.
</P>
<P>
   Like many department stores, Rich's is courting designer-hungry
shoppers who have embraced certain brands so much that designer
labels are popping up all over the store. From shirts to sheets,
Tommy Hilfiger is hot. So is Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to designer brands, department stores are increasing
private labeling because it tends to deter price comparisons, and
it's more profitable because no middlemen are involved. Plus, it
allows retailers to distinguish themselves with something other
than price.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept of differentiation is fuzzy within Federated,
which carries the same private labels under different department
store names. Federated's private labels, which include Charter
Club, Alfani and Inc., generate about 15 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Rich's/Lazarus/Goldsmith's division, the main
distinguishing feature among the nameplates is the sign on the
outside of the building. Everything inside is the same, except for
differences in regional merchandise, where Federated has made great
strides in tailoring its inventory on a store-by-store basis,
Stravitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Through high-tech scanners, individual cash registers track and
reorder individual items as they are sold. ``In many cases, the
customer is (restocking) the merchandise herself,'' Stravitz said.
``Because everything is electronically tracked, we can be back in
stock as quickly as one week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, along with other Federated stores, is also tackling its
customer service image, which began sliding in the late 1980s and
early 1990s as management became preoccupied with cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have said they didn't have time to help customers
because the cutbacks forced them to take on other jobs like
stocking or cleaning. ``We are trying to create more time for sales
managers and associates to spend more time helping customers,''
Stravitz said.
</P>
<P>
   At Rich's, for example, the staff has been split into teams. The
merchandise crew starts at 3:30 a.m. to stock and clean so the
sales staff is free to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious customer service effort is the company has
ditched individual registers for large, clearly marked checkout
stations at the juncture of departments. ``It's very clear where
you can get service now,'' Stravitz said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of 93 department stores in the Federated family to
undergo a major remodeling project, the timing of the new Rich's at
Gwinnett Place is particularly crucial, analysts and observers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get this done before the Mall of Georgia came
in,'' said Brenda Gilpatrick, an Atlanta-based retail marketing
consultant. Rich's pulled out of the Mall of Georgia, which has
signed Dillard's, Nordstrom and Lord &AMP; Taylor as anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rushing on this one because when Nordstrom opened at
Perimeter Mall, Rich's got caught with its pants down,'' Gilpatrick
said. Rich's was still in the midst of a major renovation at
Perimeter when Nordstrom opened in February.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it's a matter of time until Federated pares down
the overlap between the Rich's and Macy's chains, which go after
the same middle-to-upper-scale customer. Tight-lipped Federated
executives say they're holding on to the brand names to preserve
the local identities of various chains, but analysts say customers
could care less.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things start opening like Mall of Georgia or Nordstrom,
all that history goes out the door. There's no loyalty among
customers today _ all they see is Tommy Hilfiger or Donna Karan,''
said Prudential Securities analyst Wayne Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Federated would not likely give up anchor spots to competitors
when it decides to consolidate, but it may split up its merchandise
to have women's apparel in one store spot and menswear in another,
said Hood, who noted such a plan would fit in with its merchandise
expansion strategy at Gwinnett. ``Just because they're building the
bricks and mortar doesn't mean they won't eventually change the
identity.''

CONGRESS TO DEBATE GREATER OVERSIGHT OF HEDGE FUNDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the financiers who rescued Long-Term Capital
Management try to salvage what is left of the hedge fund, Congress
will debate whether these secretive, risky investment funds that
cater to the very rich should be subject to greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The House Banking Committee will take up the issue Thursday at a
hearing where Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,
William McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, securities officials and top financial regulators will
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital nearly collapsed last week from an enormous
amount of bad bets with borrowed money in turbulent global markets.
A group of big banks and brokerage houses, fearful that a collapse
would further destabilize the markets, rescued the fund with a $3.6
billion package of loans.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as hedge funds have been around, since the late
1960s, Congress and regulators have struggled over how to properly
supervise investment funds that can cause financial damage but are
organized in ways that escape securities laws and minimize the
information they must disclose.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, future attempts to bring about greater
governmental oversight of hedge funds might become mired in the
same tangled issues, politics and complicated details that have
kept regulators away.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, lawmakers are long on concern but short on specific
ideas. Following other hedge fund calamities, whether the 1992
Salomon Brothers ``squeeze'' on the government securities market
using hedge funds or the 1994 collapse of the $600 million Askin
Capital Management hedge fund, hearings, reports, studies and
recommendations have flowed from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been mild tweaks in existing regulations even
as the industry has expanded to about 4,500 domestic and offshore
funds with nearly $300 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the types of financial transactions done by
hedge funds have become more complicated and could present greater
global risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedge funds have been allowed to exist in a regulatory black
hole,'' said Edward Markey, D-Mass., and member of the House
Banking Committee. ``Hedge funds are defined by what they are not.
They are not mutual funds. They are not banks. They are not
brokers. They are constructed in ways in which the wealthiest
people in America can invest and do it without any regulation. And
this creates huge problems since hedge funds have acted so
irresponsible as to threaten a global financial collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Greenspan has dismissed the need for more oversight,
saying that hedge funds are ``strongly regulated by those who lend
the money,'' mainly banks and Wall Street firms. But even Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, who is not scheduled to testify, has
admitted the free market may have faltered. In response to
Greenspan's comment, Rubin said: ``That assumes the creditors are
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty of regulating hedge funds is the
slipperiness about what a hedge fund is. No precise legal
definition exists. The term ``hedge fund'' is not even used in
federal securities law. Generally, though, hedge funds in the
United States are private partnerships of wealthy, sophisticated
investors that buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and more
exotic derivative securities, using sophisticated strategies to
make bets on their direction.
</P>
<P>
   Offshore hedge funds are usually mutual funds headquartered in a
tax haven country, with some structured so that they can accept
American customers.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1992, a joint report on hedge funds by the Treasury,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Fed concluded that
``regulators have little access to information about these entities
and their day-to-day activities'' and warned of the ``potential of
these funds, due to their size, active market presence and use of
leverage, to cause market disruptions.'' Hedge funds are generally
not subject to SEC oversight because they are private. They do not
have to register with the SEC as broker-dealers and provide
disclosure because they fall under a ``trader'' exemption because
hedge funds trade for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds escape oversight, too, from the Investment Company
Act of 1940, which regulates mutual funds, because, again, hedge
funds do not make public offerings. As a result, hedge funds are
exempt from regulations on disclosure, fees and borrowing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conversely, hedge funds face indirect regulation since they do
business with regulated entities, banks and brokers. Moreover,
since 1992, when efforts at hedge fund regulation began, leading
hedge fund managers have learned to play the Washington game and
have effectively avoided closer government scrutiny through adroit
lobbying and heavy campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge fund managers were especially active in 1994, when a
Democrat-controlled House Banking Committee considered federal
hedge fund oversight, and three leading managers, including Julian
Robertson of Tiger Management, contributed $550,000 in soft money
to Republicans. When Republicans took over Congress in 1994, a
``Large Trader Reporting System'' for hedge funds seriously
considered by the Democrats died quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The main regulatory question raised by the Long-Term Capital
episode was why banking regulators never saw early warning flags
that would have indicated banks had extended too much credit to an
already overly indebted fund. Banks lending to Long-Term Capital
are regulated primarily by the Federal Reserve and by the State of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was asleep at the switch,'' said Paul Roth, vice
chairman of the American Bar Association's task force on hedge
funds. ``It's not like the banks making these loans don't have
sufficient regulatory oversight. There is sufficient regulation in
place, but it's a question of whether the people were paying
attention to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Ely, head of an Alexandria, Va.-based bank consulting firm,
said the focus of regulatory concern in Long-Term Capital should
have been over threats to the safety and soundness of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-Term Capital would have never been able to grow and have
the leverage it had, if it had not been lent the money,'' said Ely.
</P>
<P>
   One question securities regulators will be examining is whether
brokerage firms' loans to Long-Term Capital were made through their
broker-dealer operations, which are regulated by the SEC, or by

   Despite concern about what happened at Long-Term Capital, even
advocates of more scrutiny profess some cynicism.

   ``It's like going back to the savings and loan crisis, which
caused us so much grief,'' said Thomas Petri, R-Wisc., who
advocates higher bank premiums for higher risk activities.

SAUDI PRINCE MEETS CHIEFS OF BIG OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quarter-century after Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil
industry, putting narrow limits on investment by Western oil
companies, the heir to the Saudi throne, Crown Prince Abdullah, has
asked top executives of seven major U.S. oil companies how his
financially pressed country should be developing its vast oil and
natural-gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Saudis are now prepared to shift policy and open
their vast oil reserves and refining industry to investment by U.S.
companies remains unclear, according to several participants in a
private meeting held on Saturday in McLean, Va., at the residence
of the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   But a person who attended the meeting, Nat Kern, president of
Foreign Report, a Washington consulting company to the oil industry
that also publishes a newsletter, said in an interview that there
was an openness by the crown prince and by Saudi Arabia's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   He related that they were saying, ``Tell us what things would be
beneficial for us.'' And when the oil executives held a general
discussion of ideas for exploration and production, the Saudis
nodded in agreement. ``There were no taboos,'' he said. ``They were
open-minded. Before, they were closed-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said that both sides realized
they needed each other, more than in the past, and that this would
lead to more cooperation. Richardson added that he would visit
Saudi Arabia in December, the first time a U.S. energy secretary
has been there in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the meeting were top executives of Mobil, Exxon,
Texaco, Chevron, Atlantic Richfield, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum.
The Washington Post reported the meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since nationalization, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, has
produced and refined most of the oil. Production now amounts to 8
million barrels a day, making Saudi Arabia the world's largest oil
exporter.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil, the biggest U.S. investor in Saudi Arabia, and some other
companies have been allowed to develop petrochemical and lubricant
plants, but Saudi Arabia has kept foreign companies from moving the
vast fields into production and out of basic refining.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lucio Noto, chairman and chief executive of Mobil,
said in a statement that the meeting was ``about the sharing of
ideas.'' He added that the discussions were not specific on whether
the exploration and production of oil fields or the refining
industry would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lower oil prices have severely cut into the revenue of Saudi
Arabia, which has been running huge budget deficits, even though
its proved reserves of 260 billion barrels are the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors, like Kuwait, have been courting Western oil
companies and attracting big investments. Iran, which is off limits
to U.S. companies, has been seeking to open its industry to
European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Associates, a
consulting group based in Boston, said that with lower oil prices
the Saudis could be seeking partners so they would not have to
absorb all the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are benefits in sharing the risk with other companies,''
he said.

HARGROVE, GOODEN HAVE DIFFERENT TAKES ON EJECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Indians manager Mike Hargrove and starting pitcher
Dwight Gooden had somewhat different takes on the first-inning
debate with plate umpire Joe Brinkman that led to their ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden said he didn't think he deserved his dismissal, nor did
he expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think so, especially with the playoffs. They are very
intense,'' Gooden said. ``By no means did I think I was going to
get thrown out, and I didn't even know I had been thrown out until
I got back to the mound and the rest of the umpires told me I had
to leave the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gooden-Brinkman conflict, which led to Hargrove's ejection,
began after Brinkman called three consecutive balls to Boston
leadoff hitter Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I thought the first pitch was a ball and the next
two pitches were strikes,'' he said. ``When it went 3-0, I didn't
say a word. He took off his mask and said something.''
</P>
<P>
   What did he say to get ejected after Brinkman called Boston's
John Valentin safe at home four batters later?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really nothing to get kicked out,'' Gooden said.
``Now, if I did say something to offend him at that time, I think
it should have been a warning or something. There have been times
when I had disagreements with umpires and said something a whole
lot worse than that and they just say, `Hey, Doc, knock it off,' or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hargrove: ``The main reason I came out (to the mound) was
that I felt Doc was a little upset and I wanted to calm him down. I
had other reasons for going out there, but that was the main one.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what Hargrove did to warrant ejection, he said, ``It was
just a difference of opinion. For me, it's one of those things that
happens in the heat of battle where everyone's competitive.'' &QL; 
GAME OF STRATEGY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both teams went to their stoppers in somewhat unusual
circumstances. Boston manager Jimy Williams brought in ace Tom
Gordon with his team trailing by three runs in the eighth inning.
Gordon was wild, and allowed a run that increased the Indians' lead
to 9-5 entering the ninth. Gordon last pitched Sunday, and with an
off day today, needed work.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians called on Mike Jackson in the eighth inning, one
inning earlier than usual. He got the final six outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not been able to rest Mike Jackson in the last 10 days
of the season, I think (pitching him two innings) would be a major
concern,'' Hargrove said. ``Given the fact that he has been a setup
man who has gone two innings at a time until this year, and given
the fact that we have a day off (today), it's not a major concern
right now.'' &QL; 
WAKEFIELD STRUGGLES &QL; 
Anticipating his start against Cleveland yesterday, Red Sox
knuckleballer Tim Wakefield said the key to his success would be to
``throw strikes, get as much movement as possible and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield got movement but didn't throw strikes and what
happened was that he was out of the game by the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield allowed five runs on three hits with two walks. He
threw 42 pitches, half of them balls. &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indians hitters laced six doubles in the game, setting a
Division Series single-game record.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek set a dubious record. His two
passed balls equaled a Division Series mark for a single game.

PRESIDENT BALKS AT $1 MILLION DEAL WITH JONES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton conferred with his lawyers for
nearly an hour Wednesday about his next move in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit, and White House officials said he was
deeply reluctant to meet her price of $1 million to settle the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers have adopted a take-it-or-leave it strategy,
suggesting that they would consider reducing their demand by only a
small amount. The White House made a counteroffer last week saying
it would pay her $500,000 to settle the lawsuit, but Mrs. Jones'
team rejected that proposal immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton were receptive to settling the
suit for the first time because Mrs. Jones has dropped her demand
that Clinton apologize to her.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced on Wednesday that the
government was ending the fiscal year with a budget surplus of $70
billion, the first since 1969 and the largest on record. ``It is a
landmark achievement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight at midnight,'' the president declared in a ceremony
here as the clock ticked toward the close of the 1998 fiscal year,
``America puts an end to three decades of deficits and launches a
new era of balanced budgets and surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president's celebration of the surplus did little to
mask an untidy budget process that is unfolding on Capitol Hill and
must be resolved in the next nine days, before Congress adjourns
for the fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is contributing to the untidiness: both the
administration and congressional Republicans have found the
emergence of an extra pot of $70 billion or so _ the exact size
will not be known until after a couple of weeks, when the
government makes a final accounting _ too tempting to ignore,
especially in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to use part of the surplus to finance a tax
cut, while the administration wants it to bolster Social Security
and pay for other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new fiscal year begins on Thursday, Congress has
finished work on only 2 of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the
government running beyond Monday night. As a result, Congress and
the president have agreed to a stopgap measure to finance most of
the government through Oct. 9, a device used in 8 of the last 10
years to buy the two sides more time to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm over the surplus has been tempered by the
international markets' growing turmoil, which has made it unclear
how long the United States can expect to sustain its own economic
growth. Indeed, whether the annual surpluses projected for the next
decade will materialize if the nation slips into recession is just
one of the questions being debated by wary economists.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of a surplus, anticipated for months, once
seemed to offer the nation the opportunity for a philosophical
debate over its direction in a new era of plenty. But that debate
has been cut short in the last several weeks by the drive on
Capitol Hill to impeach the president over the Lewinsky scandal,
and the budget process, surplus and all, has been all but lost in
the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Congress, reflecting a rift within the Republican
Party between deficit hawks and supply side tax-cutters has not
even passed a budget resolution this year. Instead it is using last
year's agreement, which does not project a surplus until 2002, as
its spending guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are starting a new fiscal year, and the road map is
still in dispute,'' Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., who is a member of
the House Budget Committee, said incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   In place of a broader debate in the era of surplus is the
horse-trading and the philosophical standoffs over abortion, issues
that have characterized the endgame of every recent budget season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance at the end of the session is there is no
alliance, except to spend money and get out of town,'' said Rep.
Tom Coburn, a conservative Republican from Oklahoma who wants
Congress and the president to stay within the spending limits to
which both agreed in the budget-balancing agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said for months and reiterated on Wednesday that he
wants to save the surplus to bolster the Social Security system for
retiring baby boomers. At the same time, the administration is
seeking to spend an extra $17 billion for ``emergencies'' that it
did not calculate in its budget. These emergencies include the
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, fixing the Year 2000 computer bug,
improving security at U.S. embassies around the world and providing
disaster relief to American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the administration is dipping into the surplus
to pay for these efforts. But Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the
White House Office of Management and Budget, said that under budget
rules, a lifting of spending limits to pay for emergencies was
permitted and that the surplus was not being tapped. Republicans
say this is a distinction without a real difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spend the money, you reduce the surplus,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who heads the Senate Budget Committee and
has strongly opposed the effort by House Republicans to spend part
of the surplus on a tax cut. The House passed an $80 billion tax
cut last week, but the Senate appears ready to kill it; if not, the
president has promised a veto.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the projected surplus has deepened the rift within
the Republican Party, separating further the deficit hawks devoted
to staying within spending limits from the supply-side tax-cutters
who say lower taxes would spur growth.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Republicans appear prepared to go along with most
of the president's requests and spend at least $13 billion on the
emergency programs. This despite some grousing over the apparently
elastic definition of ``emergency,'' which provides for events like
the year 2000 computer glitch and the Bosnia mission, both of them
issues for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The president on Wednesday soft-pedaled his recent criticisms of
Congress, but did urge Republicans not to ``squander'' the surplus
before Social Security is secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we squander this surplus and start spending a little here,
a little there, a little yonder on the tax cuts, just because we
are a few weeks before an election, before we take care of this,
what are we going to do when times get tough?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   With his ceremony on Wednesday, the president was able to appear
as if he were responsible for the surplus, and he extended credit
to Democratic members of Congress who voted for his tax increase in
1993. This annoyed Republicans, who resent Clinton's ability to
take credit for events for which they feel responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's trying to make everybody assume that just
because he raised taxes in 1993, he balanced the budget,'' said
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. Reflecting a long-standing gripe that
Republicans have with Clinton, he added: ``The president today even
took credit for welfare reform, which he vetoed twice.''

FOR WASHINGTON MUTUAL'S KILLINGER, NOW COMES THE HARD PART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In his eight years as chief executive of Washington
Mutual, Kerry Killinger has transformed the company from a small
Seattle-area savings bank and home lender to a multi-billion,
coast-to-coast financial giant.
</P>
<P>
   He did it while maintaining the sort of understated approach
that leads one area banker to describe him as ``a really nice
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing all that may have been the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Washington Mutual Inc. officially takes control of its
latest acquisition, H.F. Ahmanson &AMP; Co., a deal that boosts its
assets to $150 billion, gives it more than 1,000 branches from the
Pacific Northwest to California and Florida, and makes it the
eighth-largest bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Killinger's abilities as an administrator and leader will be
tested as never before. Washington Mutual is no longer a company
whose most distant branches could be driven to in a day.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the size of Washington Mutual that's
different. So is the level of attention Killinger, 49, now a
national figure in the banking industry, and Washington Mutual
receive. There are more customers, more shareholders, more
community groups, more media, all clamoring for a piece of
Killinger's time and scrutinizing ever more intently what the
company does.
</P>
<P>
   Will Kerry Killinger be able to continue Washington Mutual's
success and maintain the executive and personal style that achieved
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder if he'll have to adjust his style,'' says R. Jay
Tejera, a banking industry analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels in
Minneapolis who has followed Washigton Mutual and Killinger for
years. ``One of the things he does is deliver a high-touch style of
management ... The demands are a lot tougher ... Expectations are
very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Killinger are betting he won't change. Says John
Ellis, president of the Seattle Mariners, former chief executive of
Puget Power and a Washington Mutual board member for more than 20
years, ``So far he has demonstrated this remarkable ability to be
used more and more and still keep the bank on course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get forced to make adjustments, but I don't think you
fundamentally change who you are,'' says Craig Tall, Washington
Mutual executive vice president. ``I don't think Kerry's going to
change who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Killinger acknowledges that times have changed since he made it
a point to visit every branch every six months. But his management
style is not materially different, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to have an approach that is hands-on, to be a company
of doers,'' he says. ``Naturally it's a challenge to adapt to the
size and requirements'' of a larger company and that may mean
substituing regional meetings with groups of employees for those
individual visits.
</P>
<P>
   But the intent is still the same, he adds. ``We still try to
reach the people.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a lot to suggest, when Killinger was named chief
executive in 1990 and chairman in 1991, that Washington Mutual
would approach the end of the decade as the nation's biggest
thrift. There was some question whether it would make it very far
into the 1990s as an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   When Killinger took over, Washington Mutual had limited
territory; competitors, meanwhile, were bulking up by merger.
Earnings were lackluster. ``We were not a very efficient company,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   There were also, as Ellis recalls, some questions about whether
someone with a background in investment research like Killinger was
the right person to get Washington Mutual out of its fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the bank when he did was fortuitous both ways,''
Ellis says. ``We did not need an old-time conventional banker ....
Small banks would not be able to survive in the new environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Killinger started out by asking the board ``to endorse a
commitment to being an independent company, subject to earning that
right to remain an independent.'' Earning that right meant
improving Washington Mutual's financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Killinger laid out this plan: emphasize Washington
Mutual as a consumer bank; shed underperforming businesses that
weren't related to that core consumer banking business; improve
operating efficiency; and diversify geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Then Killinger and his management team went out and did it.
Eventually Washington Mutual expanded as far as Utah. Then came
California: Washington Mutual bought American Savings, wrested
Great Western away from a hostile takeover bid by Ahmanson, at one
time the nation's biggest thrift, then eventually got Ahmanson
itself.
</P>
<P>
   To build its consumer banking business, Washington Mutual
launched a free-checking campaign. That was an effective move for
several reasons; checking accounts are a low-cost source of funds
with which to make loans, and they're considered the core account
with which to attract and retain customers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked both because of its execution and some
fortuitous developments over which Washington Mutual had no
control. The emphasis on consumer banking came as many customers
were feeling whiplashed by mergers among commercial banks. The
stock market's strong performance in the 1990s allowed Washington
Mutual to use its increasingly valuable shares to do deals.
Favorable interest rates and economic climate also helped.
</P>
<P>
   But companies can't expect strokes of good fortune to do all the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is take whatever external environment is given to
us and work with that,'' Killinger says. When California's economy
was in the tank, Washington Mutual deliberately stayed out of that
market and concentrated on the more vibrant Pacific Northwest. When
California improved, Washington Mutual made its move.
</P>
<P>
   Says James Grabicki, a Port Townsend banking consultant who once
ran a thrift that Washington Mutual bought, ``His timing has been
impeccable.''
</P>
<P>
   Killinger has long been a man on the move. He finished his
bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Iowa in a
combined four and a half years. ``I had one ambition, to get
through as quick as possible and get out in the real world,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Killinger's time at Spokane-based investment firm Murphey Favre
proved valuable for two reasons: it gave him insights into Wall
Street he used later when he was trying to convince the investment
community that his planned acquisitions would work. It also got him
into Washington Mutual, when it bought Murphey Favre in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Killinger remark on his direct, unaffected manner
_ ``What you see is what you get,'' says his wife of nearly 30
years, Debbie. He exudes energy. Says one Washington Mutual
officer, it's a ``real positive energy, not the kind that wears you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   He lacks the self-aggrandizing bombast of some chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the years I've known Kerry, I've never known him to raise
his voice,'' says Tom Cleveland, formerly head of Enterprise Bank
(now part of Washington Mutual) and now head of Access Capital in
Bellevue. ``He's very aggressive, make no mistake about it.'' But
what he has accomplished has been done ``without a lot of
chest-pounding.''
</P>
<P>
   That, along with the allure of working for a growing and
successful company, helps account for the low level of turnover in
Washington Mutual's executive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's created an unusually high level of teamwork for a company
that size,'' says Tejera, the banking industry analyst. ``He has
pulled a lot of these people along with him. It's a very young
group. He's given these people a lot of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Killinger's success isn't due just to those at Washington
Mutual. At every annual meeting Killinger concludes the
introduction of directors and officers by presenting his wife,
whose music teacher from the fourth to the 12th grade was
Killinger's father. ``She has always been a good balanced
adviser,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the job, Killinger channels his energy into a manic
style of landscaping (``If you have him prune, you will not have to
do it for a long time,'' Debbie says) and a seemingly endless
series of remodeling projects at his Bellevue home. As a young
couple in Spokane the Killingers bought a series of run-down
houses, fixed them up and sold them. Their two sons were paid 25
and 10 cents an hour for pitching in, and got ``profit sharing''
when properties sold.
</P>
<P>
   The days of remodeling houses as a side business are over,
although Debbie Killinger says Washington Mutual managers at one
point asked her to suggest another home improvement project to her
husband ``because we need a break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to build things and tinker with things,'' she adds.
``He likes to build things in business.''
</P>
<P>
   What Killinger and his fellow executives have built, with the
latest deal, is a huge opportunity. California is already the
biggest market for Washington Mutual, and Ahmanson merely bolsters
its presence there. Adding Ahmanson also adds heft in Florida, and
introduces Washington Mutual to a new state _ Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual is moving into California at an opportune
time, says Alan Fisher, executive director of the California
Reinvestment Committee, when two of its biggest competitors there,
BankAmerica and Wells Fargo, are going through mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the opportunities made possible by expansion are
greater, so are the potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   As others have proven to Washington Mutual's benefit, mergers
are minefields of hazards that, negotiated badly, can blow up with
fouled customer accounts and defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very comfortable, in the sense we've done this over and
over again,'' says chief financial officer William Longbrake. In
fact, Washington Mutual has executed nearly two dozen mergers and
acquisitions in its growth spurt, including two huge ones (American
and Great Western) in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market will be watching closely for problems. After
hitting a 52-week high of $51.67 a share in May, the company's
stock tumbled to $30 in August (it closed Wednesday at $33.75).
Some of that is due to the market swoon; some is the work of a
squeezing of interest rate spreads. But it's also due to concern
over whether Killinger can deliver on the cost savings he has
promised that will result from the Ahmanson deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lies ahead, Killinger is likely to study the landscape
and move accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put yourself in position,'' he says, ``and good things can
happen.''

 &HT;    Parties argue about scope of impeachment inquiry
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republicans push for a wide-ranging impeachment
inquiry of President Clinton, the senior Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee said Wednesday he would support the same rules
as governed the Watergate probe, but not its open-ended scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to report that we have been given a Watergatelike
set of rules,'' said Michigan Democrat John Conyers, the ranking
member and the only lawmaker remaining on the panel from the 1974
impeachment inquiry of former President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   But Conyers told reporters that the inquiry into whether Clinton
committed perjury, obstructed justice and abused his presidential
powers to conceal an adulterous relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
a former White House intern, did not warrant the broad mandate
given to investigators on the Watergate panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that this review should be open-ended like
Watergate, as the speaker continues to insist, is preposterous,''
said Conyers, referring to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, (R-Ga.).
``Watergate involved a wholesale corruption of government which
extended through the FBI, the CIA and other federal agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But pushing aside the Democratic demands to limit the
investigation's scope, the Republican-led committee unveiled a
draft resolution calling for Watergate-style proceedings. The
committee is planning to debate the resolution Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed outline would give committee investigators broad
authority to subpoena witnesses and evidence without a committee
vote if Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Conyers agreed. It also
would let the president and his lawyers attend all executive
sessions and hearings, cross-examine witnesses, object to evidence,
suggest consideration of additional evidence, and respond to all
evidence presented.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent closed-door meeting with Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D-Mo.) about the status of the impeachment process,
Gingrich was reported to have said that the impeachment inquiry
should include allegations that may stem from other ongoing
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also has said the investigation's scope is in the hands
of one person: Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told reporters the Judiciary panel would not be limited to
the material sent to Congress from independent counsel Kenneth
Starr. ``No, we're not restricted,'' Hyde said. ``I think it is our
duty to look at all of the evidence, including exculpatory.''
Gephardt and Conyers recently have asserted that any impeachment
inquiry should have a time limit, a restriction on the focus of the
inquiry and a definition of what is impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Conyers supported an unlimited timetable and an
open-ended inquiry for the Watergate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry noted Wednesday that another
member of Congress during the Watergate era, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.), seems to see things differently this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, a congressman in 1974, voted against the Nixon articles of
impeachment, but now says that even ``bad conduct'' could warrant
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1974, Trent Lott signed a minority report for the committee
that was quite clear,'' McCurry said. ``It was the kinds of crimes
that subvert the Constitution and damage the country. And the
question before the House is: Does the president's conduct in this
instance rise to that level? And we argue it does not.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry went on to attack the way Republicans have handled the
investigation and committee proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of focus, a lack of discipline,'' he said.
``They're kind of running around _ they want to bring back Rep. Dan
Burton and Sen. Al D'Amato _ for a reprise of their greatest
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton (R-Ind.) ran the House campaign fund-raising probe and
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) ran the Senate inquiry into Clinton's Whitewater
land dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Clinton stem from a more than four-year
investigation that has cost more than $40 million, according to
General Accounting Office audits released Wednesday. First assigned
to investigate the president's involvement in Whitewater, Starr has
spent nearly $33.5 million since taking over the probe in 1994.
Starr's predecessor, Robert Fiske, spent $6 million, making the
cost of investigating the Clinton administration almost $40 million
_ a number that will climb significantly when updated with the past
six months' activity.
</P>
<P>
   The most costly independent counsel probe was Lawrence Walsh's
$48.5 million, six-year investigation of the Reagan
administration's Iran-Contra dealings.
</P>
<P>
   As both parties prepare for Monday's deliberations on the call
for a formal impeachment inquiry, committee staffers are combing
through the documents from Starr's office to back up their
presentation of facts. About 5,000 of the remaining 50,000 pages
are expected to be released to the public in a two-volume set as
early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The final document dump is expected to include transcripts of
secret grand jury testimony from high-level Clinton aides and taped
conversations between the former intern and Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal says he
raised a question about Lewinsky with Hillary Rodham Clinton and
was told not to worry, that the president was ``ministering to a
troubled young person.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Clinton adviser Dick Morris' testimony says the White
House has a ``secret police'' unit of aides who would try to
intimidate women who say they were involved with Clinton. But
Morris said Tuesday he relied on published accounts and affidavits
and had no firsthand knowledge of such an operation.

IRAQ STIFFENS DEFIANCE OF U.N. DEMANDS FOR ARMS CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq on Wednesday hardened its defiance of
Security Council demands that it allow spot arms inspections to
resume. At the same time it publicly staked its hopes of ending
sanctions by calling on Secretary-General Kofi Annan to take over a
major review of Baghdad's stalemated relations with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes Iraqi officials are working diplomatic circles
to try to reopen Security Council splits as Baghdad moves into a
critical period in its relations with the organization, which is
now united in demanding Iraqi cooperation before any concessions
are made.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the effects of the embargo on Iraq ``tantamount to
internationally proscribed acts of genocide,'' Foreign Minister
Mohammed Said al-Sahaf of Iraq told the General Assembly in a
speech that an across-the-board look at more than eight years of
sanctions could break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   But he appeared to assume that Iraq could expect the broad
review _ different from periodic reviews of sanctions, which have
now been suspended _ before making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, Iraq stopped on-site inspections by arms monitors,
prompting the Security Council resolution that freezes the regular
60-day reviews but leaving open the chance to look at the bigger
picture if _ and after _ Iraq falls back into line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for Iraq to believe that it can renegotiate
the resolution and thereby change the sequence of events,'' said
Peter Burleigh, the acting U.S. representative. In an interview
Wednesday, Burleigh said he knew of no one who was prepared to make
that case for Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the only permanent Security Council member
to refuse to meet this week with Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister and a liaison aide with the United Nations on sanctions.
Aziz has met envoys from Britain, China, France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who have been the strongest supporters of the
United States on Iraq, take over the rotating presidency of the
Council on Thursday for the month of October.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, and the
International Atomic Energy Agency are due to present major reports
to the Council amid reports that Iraq has continued to try to
assemble parts for a range of prohibited weapons through purchases
abroad or in cooperative efforts with friendly nations like Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   At the independent Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, the
research director, Steven Dolley, said Wednesday that in nuclear
weapons Iraq might be ``just a Russian smuggler away'' from being
able to build a bomb with illegally obtained material. Large
stockpiles of natural uranium also remain in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Large questions also surround chemical and biological weapons
programs, UNSCOM arms inspectors say.
</P>
<P>
   Some Security Council members say that all questions about
possible weapons can never be answered and that the Council should
begin closing files wherever possible as an incentive to Iraq. The
diplomats say it was a mistake not to have closed the nuclear file
in July, when it came up for review.
</P>
<P>
   Restitution is being paid to victims of the Iraqi campaign
against Kuwait through the U.N. Compensation Commission in Geneva,
which has been given one-third of all money earned on limited Iraqi
oil sales through the program that is intended to counter the
problems that Iraqis face because of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Geneva, where the Compensation Commission once
languished for lack of money before the ``oil for food'' program,
the panel announced Wednesday that it had paid $1.9 billion in
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and some U.N. officials have been critical of the Security
Council decision to take the first 30 percent off oil sales for
compensation rather than allowing it all to go to food, medicine
and other urgent civilian needs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Baghdad, Denis Halliday, who resigned as head of
the program in Iraq and is leaving the United Nations, called the
results of the oil sales ``a shot of oxygen for Iraq and the people
of Iraq.'' He said that the country had received more than 7
million tons of food since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Halliday, who is to meet 40 members of Congress next week to
assess the effects of the sanctions, said he was uncomfortable with
what he called the incompatibility of tough sanctions' inflicting
suffering on one hand and relief aid on the other, both coming from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think nobody anticipated the duration of these sanctions,''
he said, ``and therefore the human cost that they represent in
terms of child mortality, infant mortality, chronic and acute
malnutrition, and the collapse of many of the most positive aspects
of Iraq's society.''

PROFITABLE DAY FOR MABEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ John and Betty Mabee's Advancing Star lost a
photo finish to Dance Parade in the Autumn Days Handicap on opening
day of the Oak Tree season at Santa Anita, costing the Mabees
$40,000 in purse money.
</P>
<P>
   Do not feel sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the San Diego couple sold Worldly Manner, the
nation's top-ranked 2-year-old, for a price confirmed to be in the
neighborhood of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A `Godfather' offer,'' said Rick Taylor, racing manager for
the Mabees' Golden Eagle Farm. In other words, an offer they
couldn't refuse, even though Worldly Manner is a leading prospect
for next May's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, despite the gaudy price, probably didn't set any kind
of thoroughbred record. But it's distinctive in another way: The
Mabees and Taylor don't expect to know until today who the buyer
is, because he or she wanted to remain anonymous for some reason.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Bob Baffert, who trained Worldly Manner to win three
of four races, most recently the Sept. 9 Del Mar Futurity, thinks
the son of Riverman is going to Kiaran McLaughlin's barn in
Kentucky. McLaughlin trains for Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al
Maktoum and other Dubai-based owners, so it's a good bet there's an
Arab connection here.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Worldly Manner won't run here in the Oct. 11
Norfolk Stakes, the local prep for the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the offer came through a Kentucky bloodstock agent
in September, and the Mabees waited until after the Del Mar
Futurity to set a price, which, to their surprise, was accepted.
The money was wired to the Mabees Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said at Santa Anita that one reason the Mabees were
willing to part with Worldly Manner is that they have ``a very deep
bench this year.'' He said they're excited about colts by Seeking
the Gold, General Meeting and Avenue of Flags, all scheduled to
make their debuts in November and December, as well as Del Mar
Futurity runner-up Daring General.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even if Worldly Manner races for another owner, the Mabees
would share in his success because of the increased value of his
dam, Lady Pastor, whom they own, and her future offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the $5 million can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabee, 77, made a fortune with the Big Bear grocery chain
and founded Golden Eagle Insurance in 1984. But last year, he was
forced to sell the insurance company following a battle with
California regulators over business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabees' best-known racehorse was Best Pal, the 1991 Kentucky
Derby runner-up whose $5.6 million in earnings set a record for a
California-bred.
</P>
<P>
   All of which puts the $100,000 Autumn Days in perspective,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Advancing Star and jockey Chris McCarron led in midstretch but
lost by a head to Dance Parade ($7) and Kent Desormeaux in the
6{-furlong turf race. Dance Parade earned $60,000 for Prince Fahd
Salman.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 14,641 attended the first of 32 days of racing at the
30th Oak Tree meet.

 POSSIBLE IMF BAILOUT STIRS BRAZILIANS' BITTER MEMORIES OF '80s 
(See also IMF-REPORT and RUSSIA-IMF)  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With the International Monetary Fund's
annual meeting about to start in Washington, with officials'
weighing the cost and wisdom of bailing out Brazil from its
deepening economic crisis, the prospect of a rescue package,
however urgent, is stirring bitter memories among a cross-section
of Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazilian officials have been negotiating the size and
conditions of possible aid for weeks, and the IMF said Wednesday in
Washington that it was negotiating a substantial aid package, the
issue is so sensitive that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
hoping to be re-elected on Sunday, has not announced a formal
request to the fund for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped Cardoso's main opponent, Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva, of the left-of-center Workers' Party, from attacking
Cardoso as a slave of foreign bankers. In the free air time that
candidates receive, the Workers' Party shows Cardoso with head
bowed as an announcer discusses the sacrifices that foreign lenders
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva has called the administration's attempts to negotiate
an accord with the fund a crime and said it would ``tighten one
more knot on the neck around Brazilians.''
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in Jornal do Brasil, the newspaper, struck the same
theme, showing a drowning man being thrown a noose.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, due after the elections, will depend on the winner
and the course of negotiations with the monetary fund. Talks with
the United States and the fund have focused on a loan package most
likely to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had a bruising experience with the fund in the '80s, and
the effects linger. A new accord, even attached to billions of
dollars, is widely seen an admission of the government's failure to
put its house in order and a humiliating surrender of sovereignty
over economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The government in has recent years made once unimaginable
strides in cutting inflation, from 3,000 percent a year four years
ago to 3 percent this year. But its budget deficit has ballooned,
to 7.2 percent of the gross national product, and a broad measure
of the flow of goods and services, the current account, is running
a deficit close to $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deficits are not new. But the shortage of credit for emerging
markets has pushed Brazil to the brink of crisis. Since the Russian
crisis began last month, foreign reserves have shrunk, from $70
billion to $42 billion, despite moves to protect the currency by
doubling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil today is different from the country that defaulted on its
foreign debt in 1981. It is six economic plans later. Many of the
officials who lashed out at the monetary fund for imposing stiff
conditions for aid 10 years ago are struggling to hold firm to
stability and have answered the crisis with pledges to cut
entitlements and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   But among ordinary Brazilians, the IMF is associated, if not
faulted, for a punishing recession through the 1980s and with
issuing spending limits that Brazil failed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the idea that by freezing prices and other gimmicks
you could get somewhere,'' said Sebastian Edwards, a professor of
international economics at UCLA who wrote ``Crisis and Reform in
Latin America'' (Oxford University Press, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Although it signed 11 agreements with the monetary fund
throughout the '80s, Edwards said, Brazil insisted that because of
its size and importance, it should not be subject to the same
conditions as other nations in trouble.

ROGUE TRADER COSTS RHUMBLINE, AT&AMP;T PENSION FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bing Sung is a numbers man, a Harvard Ph.D in
statistics, one among an arcane breed of securities traders whose
investment theories have been compared to the complicated
mathematics of nuclear physics.
</P>
<P>
   For almost four years, few could have been more pleased with his
methods than RhumbLine Advisors, the Boston money management firm
that hired him, and AT&AMP;T Corp.'s pension fund, one of his largest
clients.
</P>
<P>
   But in a complaint, the Securities and Exchange Commission
alleged Wednesday that the 51-year-old Sung's claims about the
fund's performance were a fiction and that he had actually lost
$150 million through unauthorized trading. After suffering setbacks
during 1995's rollercoaster market, Sung tried to regain ground for
more than a year, making improper trades and misrepresenting them
to AT&AMP;T, the SEC alleged. The same improper trading cost the
Massachusetts state employees pension fund, another RumbLine
client, $12 million, according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``His theory crumbled and then he got over his head,'' said
Grant Ward, assistant district administrator in the SEC's Boston
office.
</P>
<P>
   Sung, who faces a possible ban from the securities industry, did
not return calls to his home in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said its pension funds, which are managed by more than 50
outside firms and held a total of $47 billion at the time of of
Sung's trades, were able to absorb the loss. In fact, the company's
pension trust had a $1.6 billion net gain in the period that the
losses occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But officials warned that Sung's case illustrates an alarming
problem in the securities industry: Rogue traders can often operate
undetected for years and, left unsupervised, can cause serious
financial harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went on for almost two years,'' said the SEC's Ward.
``And nobody was there looking over his shoulder. AT&AMP;T could handle
the losses, but maybe in another situation the outcome is worse.
What we're saying is that this stuff goes on despite the best
intentions of the firm and the clients, and the exposure is very
large.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides filing the complaint against Sung, the SEC has settled
charges against firm and its chief executive, John D. Nelson, for
failing to adequately supervise Sung. Under the settlement, the
firm has agreed to pay the SEC $50,000, and Nelson $10,000, the SEC
said. Nelson neither admitted nor denied responsibility for Sung's
trades in agreeing to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to hide anything,'' Nelson told Bloomberg
News. When the losses were discovered, he said, ``I went to the
clients and I went to the SEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Sung, a native of China, approached RhumbLine in 1991, according
to the SEC's complaint, filed in US District Court in Boston. He
came with an impressive background. He was a former partner of
Harvard Management Co., which manages Harvard University's
endowment, and developed a quantitative trading strategy that
involved writing options on stock indexes, such as Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed that RhumbLine, one of only 50 minority- or
wommen-owned money mangement firms in the country, start an
investment program using the strategy. Nelson hired Sung as his
chief invesment oficer. In return for future equity in the firm and
salary, Sung agreed to work for a year without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sung brought the brains, and Nelson brought the clients,''
including the AT&AMP;T pension fund, the SEC's Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, all seemed to go well. Sung's strategy involved
writing options _ essentially bets that certain market indexes
would rise or fall. To limit the risk of each bet, AT&AMP;T required
Sung to buy an offsetting option, which hedged against big losses
but also lowered overall returns.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy, backed by complicated mathematical formulas,
worked only as long as US markets remained stable. In 1995, the
markets swung wildly, and the AT&AMP;T account began to lose money.
What happened next, according to the SEC complaint, is a tale of
what can go wrong when a trader is given free rein.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than telling AT&AMP;T what was happening, Sung secretly
changed the nature and size of his bets beginning in January 1995,
the SEC alleged. He stopped buying the offsetting options AT&AMP;T
required. By February, his losses totaled more than $6 million,
exceeding AT&AMP;T's cap on losses by $38,600.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T learned of the loss, Sung's client rebuked him and
said they'd take away the account if he didn't ``trade in a more
disciplined manner,'' the SEC complaint alleged.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1995, Sung again secretly embarked on trades that
violated AT&AMP;T's restrictions, writing huge options on technology
indexes, including the Nasdaq 100 and the Philidelphia
Semiconductor Index, the complaint alleged.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get around regulations limiting such trades,
Sung allegedly falsified an application to the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, saying he managed $9 billion in AT&AMP;T assets. Sung
was then able to fill the AT&AMP;T account with securities that at one
point represented two-thirds of the entire market for options on
the Nasdaq 100, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Sung's scheme seemed to work, depsite his ``excessively risky
trading,'' the complaint said. ``By the June 1996 quarterly
closing, the AT&AMP;T account had made up its earlier losses and had
cumulative realized profits for the year of nearly $3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the third quarter of 1996, Sung increased the ``magnitude
and and riskiness of his unauthorized trading,'' the SEC said. He
wrote ``enormous unhedged'' options against hundreds of millions of
dollars in underlying assets. They would have been profitable if
the market had continued to decline. But it didn't. Sung lost
another $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of disclosing the improper trades, Sung ``repeatedly
doubled his bets that the market would decline,'' the SEC said.
AT&AMP;T's entire $150 million loss came in that quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19, 1996, Nelson discovered the extent of the losses
and informed AT&AMP;T, which closed the account the next day.

JOHNSON MAY START AGAIN SATURDAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Randy Johnson has a four-game losing streak in the
playoffs after being outpitched by Kevin Brown on Tuesday in
Houston's 2-1 loss to San Diego. But Johnson may get a chance to
break that streak _ and possibly face Brown again _ sooner than
anybody thought.
</P>
<P>
   With his team in an early hole, losing at home and trailing by
1-0 in the three-of-five-game division series, Houston Manager
Larry Dierker Wednesday raised the possibility of starting Johnson
in Game 3 in San Diego on Saturday. Dierker said he had heard the
Padres might start Brown on Saturday on three days' rest, something
San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy and the Padres' pitching coach, Dave
Stewart, confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Brown, who struck out 16 Astros in Game 1, does not
pitch on Saturday, Johnson might.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might do it if it gets down two games to none,'' Dierker
said. ``It could get to the point that even if it isn't the best
idea, you're going to get killed in the media if you don't do it.''
Shane Reynolds of the Astros will face Andy Ashby of the Padres in
Game 2 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to think about it very much until after
tomorrow's game,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Johnson allowed two runs and nine hits, with a walk
and nine strikeouts, in eight innings. He did not pitch on three
days' rest this season, but Dierker said, ``When he first came
over, he told me he could do it.'' In 1995, Johnson won the
deciding fifth game of the Seattle Mariners' dramatic division
series victory over the Yankees, pitching three innings of relief
on one day's rest after he had pitched seven strong innings to win
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Houston's Mike Hampton (11-7, 3.36 earned run
average) and San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock (9-7, 3.93 ERA), both
left-handers, are scheduled to start on Saturday. But the Astros,
who have never reached the World Series, acquired Johnson at the
trading deadline to get them there. ``We're not going to get to the
World Series without him winning a few games,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Brown can pitch on short rest. He
started Game 1 on three days' rest and turned in one of the most
dominating performances in playoff history, striking out more
batters (16) in a post-season game than anyone but Bob Gibson of
the St. Louis Cardinals, who had 17 strikeouts in Game 1 of the
1968 World Series against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And on Aug. 20, in his first start on three days' rest since
1994, Brown pitched six and a third scoreless innings in a victory
over Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, that's an option,'' Bochy said. ``It's a possibility.
We'll see how he's feeling on Friday. It's something we talked
about earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said, ``I'll do whatever they want me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Much hinges on what happens here Thursday, when the right-hander
Ashby (17-9, 3.34 ERA) faces the right-hander Reynolds (19-8, 3.51
ERA). ``It's not a must-win situation for us,'' Dierker said. ``But
it's close.''
</P>
<P>
   A Houston victory, on the other hand, may increase the chances
of Brown's starting Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even looking that far ahead,'' Stewart said. ``But
if we leave here with a split, I don't know what they're going to
do with Randy, but with Kevin on the mound, we have a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was 10-4 as a starter in post-season and World
Series games, often pitched on three days' rest himself during the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncommon for today's pitchers to go on three days' rest,
but it was not uncommon in the 1980s and early '90s,'' he said. ``I
preferred pitching every fourth day, and Kevin is really similar to
that. He'd pitch every third day if I allowed him to. He's blessed.
He's got a rubber arm.''

DAN QUISENBERRY, 45, SUBMARINE-STYLE PITCHER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Quisenberry, the star reliever of the Kansas City Royals who
was known for his delivery of submarine-style pitches on the mound
and one-line quips off the field, died Wednesday at his home in
Kansas City, Mo. He was 45.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry had been suffering from brain cancer. He underwent
surgery on Jan. 8 for removal of 80 to 90 percent of a tumor, then
had surgery again in June when the cancer spread.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry could not blow a pitch past a batter, prompting him
to bemoan his Peggy Lee fastball, as in ``Is That All There Is?''
He was not imposing on the mound _ his 6-foot-2-inch, 180-pound
frame was nothing special and his bushy red mustache never seemed
very sinister. But Quisenberry had superb control, forcing hitters
to grind his sinker into the dirt instead of waiting for the pitch
they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The movement on his sinkerball, and the unorthodox style with
which Quisenberry delivered it _ bringing his right hand within six
inches of the mound as he began his motion _ made him the major
leagues' premier relief pitcher during the first half of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry set what was then a major league record for saves in
1983, compiling 45, and he had 44 saves the following year. Except
for the strike-shortened 1981 season, he led the American League in
saves every year from 1980 to 1985, and his total of 244 places him
14th on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched for the Royals in the 1980 and 1985 World Series and
was a three-time American League All-Star. His career record was
56-46.
</P>
<P>
   And Quisenberry was durable, never going on the disabled list.
In 674 major league games _ with the Royals from 1979 to mid-1988,
the St. Louis Cardinals for a season and a half and the San
Francisco Giants briefly in 1990 _ Quisenberry never started a
game.
</P>
<P>
   After Quisenberry's rookie year of 1979, his manager, Jim Frey,
impressed with the performance of the Pirate submariner Kent
Tekulve against the Orioles in the World Series, asked Tekulve to
tutor Quisenberry.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been pitching sidearm-style, the transformation
befuddled Quisenberry at first. But he soon flourished as a
submariner.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry became one of baseball's highest-paid players,
signing a so-called lifetime contract in 1985 that included a
long-term real estate venture with the Royals' co-owner Avron
Fogelman. The deal was estimated to be worth at least $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all his success, Quisenberry, who is survived by his wife,
Janie; a daughter, Alysia, 18, and a son, David, 17, reveled in
poking fun at himself. After losing to the Phillies in Game 5 of
the 1980 World Series _ the second time Philadelphia had rallied to
beat him _ Quisenberry remarked how ``we have our backs against the
Berlin Wall _ East side.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Royals defeated the Cardinals in the 1985 World
Series, President Reagan phoned the Kansas City locker room and
spoke to Quisenberry. He mistakenly called him Jim.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the Royals were invited to the White House Rose
Garden, at a time when the president's differences with his chief
of staff, Donald Regan, were well publicized. The president
apologized to Quisenberry for getting his first name wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry replied, ``That's OK, Don.''

<P>
   TOMS PLACE, Calif. _ It took me a quarter-century of backpacking
in the High Sierra to finally SEE what John Muir was talking about
when he described its signature granite pinnacles as the ``range of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   A mid-September sunset made the old man of the backcountry's
famous words sing _ from the brilliant orange plumes of clouds over
Mount Gabb to the crimson dancing above Mount Crocker to the
cardinal bouncing, appropriately, off Mount Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a `range of light' light show, brought to you by Mother
Nature,'' said Mill Valley backpacker Brian Muir (no relation) as
the campfire crackled in the heart of the John Muir Wilderness and
Sierra National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Pioneer Basin and the Mono Divide high country, where
sundown's reflections are just one of a plethora of ``trip-makers''
visitors can expect upon completing the 9-mile trek to this
10,800-foot perch at timberline.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a single beautiful butterfly that a hiker might
remember most. Or a patch of wildflowers where no others exist. Or
the sight a lone falcon making a meal of a gopher. Or the maniacal
midnight yips of coyotes. All can leave indelible impressions for
years after journeying to this unspoiled outpost.
</P>
<P>
   For my hiking partner and me, it was the tiny body of water on
the southeastern edge of the basin we dubbed Ego Pond. It didn't
matter how close you stood, how pretty the cast or how battered the
dry fly, but more times than not the insect imitation would find
its way into the maw of a vibrant brook trout.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't large _ most were 6 to 9 inches. But the dark-brown
and olive-green fish with the distinctive red spots and blue halos
were finning through the shallows in big numbers. And we must have
caught all of them, twice.
</P>
<P>
   As Orinda angler and backpacker Gary Hallam put it, ``There's a
lot of little ones, but at least they're biting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the catches you'd like to keep on the hook to
entice more worthy specimens, but the fish just don't get that big
up here, unless, perhaps, you throw some smelly processed bait to
the bottom of a larger, deeper lake. This was fly-fishing and the
drama was taking place on the water's surface as brooks sucked up
Sierra green dots, California mosquitoes, float n' fools and other
dry flies with zeal.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was magnified many fold by the stellar view. Due
south lies Third Recess and Fourth Recess _ deep chasms in the Mono
Divide that carve their way toward Mount Gabb, Mount Dade, Mount
Abbot and the glaciated north face of Mount Mills. Eastern access
to the region is via 11,920-foot Mono Pass and originates along
Rock Creek; the western portal is Lake Thomas Edison, and hikers
enter up Mono Creek Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The autumn weather in the High Sierra is fickle. Brisk winds
skitter afternoon thunderstorms across 13,000-foot peaks until
dissipating into the starry night; daylight brings cloudless and
breeze-free skies. All the fine happenings at Ego Pond were etched
into our minds under boundless blankets of azure. It was a perfect
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Our party of two had initial illusions of grandeur _
day-tripping each morning to a new destination. Maybe to Fourth
Recess Lake once and on to Third Recess in the afternoon. Perhaps
up Hopkins Creek, one basin to the west, another day. Or up to
Golden Lake for a gander.
</P>
<P>
   But once we discovered the qualities of Pioneer Basin and the
successes of fly-fishing its streams and pond, we needed look no
farther.
</P>
<P>
   As for the day trips, we scoured the basin for untested waters
and scaled its northern ridge _ the boundary between Fresno and
Mono counties, and Sierra and Inyo national forests _ to get a
better lay of the land from an 11,600-foot vantage. A party
surveying the area from 1907-09 named the basin for the 19th
century pioneer railroad builders. It is framed by four peaks that
take their names from the ``Big Four'' who financed and built the
Central Pacific Railroad _ 12,838-foot Stanford to the northeast,
Huntington (12,394 feet) to the southeast, Hopkins (12,304 feet) to
the southwest and Crocker (12,458 feet) to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But the conifer-lined waters below beckoned. We landed 100 trout
in two days, most prevalently brooks, followed in much lower
numbers by goldens, then rainbows. An 11-inch 'bow fooled on a size
No.16 female Adams was tops for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   I experimented with nymph patterns for 30 minutes _ a half an
hour longer than I should have _ catching zip on a small beadhead
red brassie but picking up a nice golden on a beadhead zugbug.
Topwater flies were much more productive.
</P>
<P>
   The key to fishing dry patterns at elevation is not so much
keeping an eye on the fly in waiting for the strike as it is
looking for the brilliant orange, crimson and cardinal that mimic
John Muir's sunsets in the bellies and sides of the game. Every
time a fish hits, its telltale hues are revealed in the crystalline
waters. Every time. And that's what you wait for to set the hook.
</P>
<P>
   That flash is what memories are made of.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the fishing was the trip-maker for Hallam's son, Zack,
who hooked an 11-inch golden on a red-spooned spinning lure in the
largest of the seven primary Pioneer Basin Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest golden I've ever caught,'' he said upon
exiting the basin on the third day or a four-day outing. ``Now if I
can just make it over that pass (Mono) without passing out.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was more impressed with the blooms. ``The wildflowers
are spectacular up here _ lupine, Indian paint brush, aster,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the flowers, fall is also marked by fewer crowds.
Many hikers are willing to accept chillier weather for more
solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, I don't want to go back to L.A.,'' said
Ann Patterson of Venice, visiting Pioneer Basin by horse from her
camp in Third Recess. ``I thought it was great to go right after
Labor Day, when there are a lot fewer people and yet the weather is
not bad yet but definitely cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll appreciate _ or regret _ that when the chill from an
understuffed sleeping bag keeps you up at night and makes you less
likely to chase off chipmunks and other food bandits stalking your
food in the moon shadow of 12,404-foot Robber's Roost.
</P>
<P>
   But a few restless nights are made a heck of a lot easier to
endure when the last thing you spy before zipping the tent is a
``range of light'' light show.

PANEL SEEN SET TO DROP STARR COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee is poised to reject
several of the independent counsel's 11 allegations that President
Clinton committed acts warranting impeachment, according to
committee members in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee plans vigorously to pursue several
perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges lodged by independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr, the lawmakers said recently that Starr
has failed to produce evidence to support a number of his other
allegations, including the charge that Clinton abused the power of
his office.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote early next week to
recommend a full-scale impeachment inquiry, and the House is
expected to approve the recommendation quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation, the Judiciary Committee chairman,
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, Wednesday proposed broad,
Watergate-style plans for the inquiry, rebuffing requests by
Democratic members to limit the scope of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the focus of the inquiry could quickly narrow, according to
Judiciary Committee members, because Starr appears to have
overreached in claiming he had ``substantial and credible''
evidence to support at least two of his five allegations that
Clinton attempted to obstruct justice and his single charge that
the president abused the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many committee members said they expect the impeachment
inquiry to be pared to the core question of whether Clinton
committed perjury by lying to a federal grand jury. ``That's what I
want to focus on,'' said Representative Lindsey O. Graham, a South
Carolina Republican.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of lawmakers on the 37-member committee, such as
Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, want to dissect
every element of each allegation Starr has leveled against Clinton.
Barr is among more than 50 House members who have called for
Clinton to resign, and he was one of the first lawmakers to urge
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, a few of the 16 Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee have said they believe none of Starr's charges against
Clinton warrant impeachment, generally because the allegations stem
from Clinton's consensual sex with Monica S. Lewinsky and what they
describe as his effort to conceal an adulterous affair from his
family.
</P>
<P>
   But even some committee Democrats who oppose impeaching Clinton
see a chance to reach agreement with Republicans over dropping a
number of Starr's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the facts, as outlined by the independent
counsel, rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors,'' said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat. ``We could
limit the scope of this inquiry, which would result in a
less-contentious process that would not go on and on for over a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Republicans on the committee balked at publicly
rejecting several of Starr's allegations before a formal inquiry
begins, several of them voiced opposition to particular charges,
most notably the abuse-of-power count.
</P>
<P>
   To support the charge, Starr said Clinton violated his
``constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws'' by, among
other things, invoking executive privilege in an attempt to block
his lawyers from testifying before a grand jury about their private
conversations with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe invoking executive privilege is an abuse of
power,'' said Representative George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania
Republican, echoing several other GOP committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also asserted that Clinton abused the power of his office
by misleading his family, his staff and the Cabinet about his
illicit affair. As a result, Starr alleged, many of the president's
allies, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, ``relied on and publicly
emphasized the president's denial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we want to impeach the president because his
wife defended him on television,'' said Representative Bobby Scott,
a Virginia Democrat who serves on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's charge that Clinton tried to obstruct justice by
delaying his grand-jury appearance for seven months and lying to
potential grand-jury witnesses, his aides, about the Lewinsky
matter also appeared to lack merit as an impeachable offense,
according to committee members in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also questioned the wisdom of pursuing Starr's
allegation that Clinton should be impeached for attempting to
obstruct justice by lying about his relationship with Lewinsky to
his secretary, Betty Currie. ``Lying to one's staff is not an
impeachable offense,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``refusing an invitation to appear before the grand
jury,'' Frank said, ``even Miss Manners wouldn't go after someone
over that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few committee members have steadfastly refused to comment on
any of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   However, many members have expressed confusion about what
constitutes an impeachable offense. Under pressure from Democrats,
Hyde has called for a hearing on the issue, although no date has
been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   As for the formal impeachment inquiry, Hyde released a proposed
resolution that would grant committee investigators broad authority
to call witnesses and subpoena evidence. The full committee would
not be required to vote on each legal maneuver so long as Hyde and
the panel's top Democrat, Representative John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, agreed on them.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee ``is authorized and directed to
investigate fully and completely whether sufficient grounds exist
for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional
power to impeach William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United
States of America,'' according to Hyde's proposed resolution. The
wording of the resolution is identical to that used for the
impeachment inquiry of Richard Nixon in 1974, except for the the
name of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Clinton's lawyers could participate in all the
inquiry proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers criticized the resolution because it proposes no
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders were busy last night trying to draft an
alternative to Hyde's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being considered by Democrats is to have the
Judiciary Committee or the entire House vote on censuring Clinton
instead of starting impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the final batch of Starr's investigative material
that the Judiciary Committee approved making public is scheduled to
be released Friday, although the release could be delayed until
Saturday.

GARRETT KEEPS EMOTIONS IN CHECK DESPITE OUTCOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Cowboys quarterback Jason Garrett doesn't expect to
have any lingering effects from Sunday's 13-12 loss to the Oakland
Raiders _ despite his two costly interceptions _ for the same the
reason he didn't get too excited about his play in the Cowboys'
31-7 victory against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I try to do is keep it normal,'' said Garrett, who
has completed 30 of 61 passes for 444 yards, including one
touchdown pass and two interceptions in two starts in place of
injured starter Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was excited about the outcome of the Giants game.
But it was just one game. I think you have to treat it that way
when you win and treat it that way when you lose. It's hard to do.
But you try to keep it as normal as possible and get back to
work.''
Aikman throws
Aikman threw pass routes to receivers yesterday for the first time
since suffering a fractured collarbone against the Denver Broncos.
Aikman threw crisply and didn't seem to experience any problems
with his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who is scheduled to have his shoulder X-rayed again on
Monday, is expected to return for the Oct. 11 matchup against the
Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the final decision on
whether Aikman plays against Carolina could be affected by the
outcome of Sunday's game against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   How Aikman feels and the assessment of the coaches and trainers
will carry the most weight, Jones said, but he admitted a victory
in the crucial NFC East matchup could influence the team to rest
Aikman another week.
Linebacker, tackle visit
Linebacker Purcell Gaskins and defensive tackle Nathan Davis were
given tryouts by the Cowboys yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskins, a second-year player out of Kansas State, received more
of an informational visit, since the Cowboys are stocked at
linebacker with Tuesday's signing of Myron Smith.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 6-foot-5, 312-pound Davis, a former track
All-American at Indiana in the shot put and a second-round pick of
the Atlanta Falcons in 1997, is intriguing to the Cowboys because
of his size and athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has been out of work since quitting the Falcons two
days into this season's training camp, has visited eight teams in
the past seven days, including the Cowboys. Two of the teams
already have offered practice-squad contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys were going to take a couple of days
before making a decision on Davis. To make room, the Cowboys would
have to put linebacker Nate Hemsley, who is out until at least
December after undergoing ankle surgery, on injured reserve.
Briefly
That Cowboys tight end David LaFleur has only caught two passes,
and none since the season opener, is no surprise. Although he
expects LaFleur to get the ball more, coach Chan Gailey favors
throwing to wide receivers, as his offensive philosophy puts an
emphasis of getting more speed on the field in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith (strained hamstring), Daryl Johnston (swelling left
knee) and Leon Lett (sprained left knee) did not practice yesterday
for precautionary reasons. However, all are listed as probable for
Sunday's game against the Redskins.

BRAVES OVERWHELM CUBS, 7-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three months ago during a rehabilitation stint at
Single A Macon, Atlanta Braves righthander John Smoltz recalled,
his confidence had reached its lowest ebb. After offseason surgery
on his right elbow and a spring spent mostly on the sidelines,
Smoltz had serious doubts about his future when an inflamed elbow
sent him to the disabled list on May 24, one day after he lasted
just two innings against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really struggled to win in the minors,'' Smoltz said. ``I
really wondered if I wanted to continue and how many years I had
left.''
</P>
<P>
   WednesdayNow it's obvious that Smoltz has plenty of good years _
and good times _ left in his right arm. Enough, perhaps, to carry
the Braves to another World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 17-3 regular season, Smoltz became the winningest
pitcher in postseason history Wednesday when he stifled the Cubs,
7-1, before 45,598 fans at Turner Field in the opener of their
best-of-five National League Division Series. Smoltz's 11th
postseason victory, which broke a tie with Whitey Ford and Dave
Stewart, was a vintage performance.
</P>
<P>
   He answered Atlanta's call to arms with a smoldering 116-pitch
effort, which included 81 strikes. He threw seven shutout innings,
striking out six, before he made his only mistake, surrendering a
leadoff homer to Tyler Houston in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a day where I didn't have the best stuff, but I got
away with a lot of pitches and the defense was outstanding,'' said
Smoltz. ``This game meant a lot to me for a lot of reasons, and it
meant a lot to Dr. (Joe) Chandler (Atlanta's team orthopedic
surgeon) and all the things we've been through. The good Lord's
blessed me to be able to keep doing this. I would've never believed
that I'd be here today, in the playoffs, with the ability to throw
the way I did today.''
</P>
<P>
   But here was Smoltz, shining in the postseason _ again.
</P>
<P>
   He got plenty of defensive and offensive support, in particular
from outfielders Michael Tucker and Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who had entered the postseason in a 29-for-156 (.186)
slump, provided an unlikely source of power with a two-run homer in
the second off Cubs starter Mark Clark that gave the Braves a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Andruw Jones made it 3-0 in the sixth with a sacrifice
fly, Klesko, who like Tucker made a couple of splendid catches,
delivered the crushing blow, a grand slam in the eighth for a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said he had no concerns about his
team's physical and mental state after it clinched the NL wild card
with an emotional 5-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants in a
one-game playoff Monday night at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Riggleman. ``Our guys were preparing hard
before the game. During the game, they did everything they could to
get something going. Smoltz was just the story of the game. He made
us look like we weren't out there fighting. He wouldn't let us get
on base hardly. We just couldn't get it going against him.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing Sammy Sosa, the 66-home run man who is considered
a shoo-in as MVP, to reach in the first inning on a broken-bat
single to left, Smoltz retired the next five batters, two via
strikeouts, before he gave up a sharply hit single to left to
Clark. Then he tightened the screws on the Cubs, retiring the next
eight batters before Lance Johnson blooped a two-out single to left
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart ended that threat with a leaping stab of Mickey
Morandini's sharply hit line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's fly brought in Andres Galarraga, who had led off with a
single to left and advanced to third on Klesko's single up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa led off the seventh with a double that rattled around the
corner in left. But the Cubs stranded him when Smoltz got Mark
Grace to pop to center, struck out Henry Rodriguez, and ended the
inning by inducing Gary Gaetti to ground out to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was the guy, for me, who I didn't want to beat me because
he's hit me so well,'' Smoltz said. ``He was a big out. It seems
like I've pitched against him for 15 years, so I've got a lot of
respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs imploded in the seventh. Smoltz drew a leadoff walk
that prompted Riggleman to give Clark the hook. After Felix Heredia
came in and got Walt Weiss to force Smoltz, he proceeded to load
the bases on back-to-back walks to Lockhart and Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Galarrraga popped out to Grace, giving Heredia some wriggle
room. But Klesko jumped on a 3-2 pitch and put the game out of
reach.

DATA VENTURE BY TOYOTA AND SONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Two of Japan's mightiest companies are teaming up with a
relative unknown to develop a business service that provides data
transmission, perhaps challenging the domain of another Japanese
corporate titan.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Corp., maker of some of the most popular consumer
electronics and movies, and Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest
automaker, have reached an agreement with Internet Initiatives
Japan, to create a company that will offer Japanese businesses a
cheaper way of sending data over telephone lines than is currently
available.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will compete directly with Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which controls more than 90 percent of the burgeoning
market in data communications in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   No formal announcement has been made, because final details of
the agreement remain incomplete, but Sony and Internet Initiatives
confirmed that they and Toyota had a deal to create such a
business. The deal was first reported in Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
Japan's leading business daily.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture is a step by Sony toward bridging the gap
between the audiovisual and technology sides of its business, and
at a relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   The initial investment will be around 100 million yen, or
$741,000 at current exchange rates. Toyota and Sony will each own
30 percent of the new company, and the rest will be held by
Internet Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to build a network across Japan that uses leased
fiber-optic cables designed to carry large quantities of data
efficiently and to start offering the service nationally next
spring and internationally by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Toyota has a significant stake in Teleway Japan
Corp., which has such a fiber-optic network, the new company may
lease its pipelines from Teleway.
</P>
<P>
   Teleway is in the process of merging with KDD, the nation's
largest long-distance telephone-service provider, and Toyota will
end up with somewhat less than 10 percent of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   But Teleway is just one of several companies from which the new
venture is considering leasing cables, a spokeswoman for Internet
Initiatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiaki Iba, a telecommunications analyst at ING Barings, said
he doubted that the new venture would cut into NTT's dominance.
``Maybe it will be a kind of scratch on the side of the elephant,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iba contended that without ownership of the cables that transmit
the data, the new venture would be unable to gain a competitive
advantage. ``As long as they run it as a resale business, it's not
sustainable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman for Internet Initiatives said the lines for the
new venture would be leased virtually in perpetuity. And NTT's
president, Junichiro Miyazu, did not dismiss the new venture's
potential, saying that not only did he expect it to present a
challenge, but that other companies would also enter the fray. ``It
may become a threat for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony-Toyota-Internet Initiatives alliance contends that it
will have a significant cost advantage over NTT that it can pass on
to customers. The advantage derives from its plans to lease lines
designed specifically for data traffic, which are proliferating
worldwide. NTT relies on lines designed to carry voice traffic, and
while it doubles as a data carrier, it does so more expensively,
Internet Initiatives' spokeswoman said.

 Crisis in Minority Home Ownership   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Citing government figures that show African Americans and Latinos
in California falling further behind whites and Asian Americans in
getting home loans, a San Francisco consumer group yesterday called
on the Federal Reserve to hold an emergency meeting ``to save
minority homeownership.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a letter to Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President
Bob Parry, the Greenlining Institute and more than two dozen
minority business and civil rights groups said that just-released
1997 lending statistics show that ``the minority inner-city home
ownership crisis is even greater than the (Long Term Capital
Management) investment fund crisis that caused Chairman Greenspan
and your New York Federal Reserve counterpart to take unprecedented
action to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Although conventional home loans to Hispanics and blacks were
up 3.6 percent and 9.7 percent respectively last year over 1996,
they paled in comparison to mortgage loan increases overall.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the number of Asians and whites who received new
conventional home loans last year was up 37 percent and 38 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   More alarming is the three-year trend, said Greenlining
Institute Policy Director Robert Gnaizda. The number of
conventional home loans to Latinos and African Americans declined
15 percent from 39,692 to 33,576 from 1994 through 1997. Over the
same period, home loans to whites increased by more than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in lending rates occurred despite growing
prosperity in the past few years, large increases in minority
populations in the home-buying age bracket, and the fact that 72
percent of whites already own homes. By contrast, just 42 percent
of Latinos and African Americans own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlining called on Parry to copy the Fed's bailout strategy
for the Long Term Capital Management, which helped save the wealthy
investors. ``Here's a crisis within the Fed's jurisdiction,'' said
Gnaizda. ``Hedge funds are not,''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlining would like the San Francisco Fed to host an
emergency meeting attended by the CEOs of California's largest
lenders. The aim would be to create a five-year plan to help
eliminate the present racial divide in home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco did not immediately
say it will hold a special meeting, but indicated it is concerned
by the lending trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data surprise us,'' said Fed
spokeswoman Sallie Weissinger. ``They raise concerns on our part
about mortgage credit for minorities and low-income individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   However, before agreeing to hold a special meeting, she said the
Fed wants to examine the data to see if there are any ``unusual''
reasons that might explain the statistics.

SPENCER ON TRACK FOR STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So who is Shane Spencer? And why hasn't somebody
begun a campaign to put him in the Yankee Hall of Fame? All right,
all right, so maybe it's a tad early _ like 10 or 12 years _ to be
anointing him for the pinstripe pantheon. But that doesn't obscure
the fact that the 26-year-old rookie outfielder has taken New York
by storm with a September out of Joe Hardy's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It continued Wednesday night when Spencer, making his postseason
debut, launched a second-inning homer that gave the Yankees a 1-0
lead over the Texas Rangers in Game 2 of their American League
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   If first impressions are a gauge, the Yankees are correct in
projecting Spencer as a star of the future. The Rangers didn't need
any convincing _ and that was before Spencer victimized them
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player who has had an unbelievable September,''
said Texas manager Johnny Oates. ``He's having a lot of fun, and
the fans love him. He has hit three grand slams and definitely has
power. Do not take him for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can, at least not anymore. During the final month of the
regular season, Spencer batted a team-high .421 with 8 home runs
and 21 runs batted in. Three of the homers were grand slams _ one
against Baltimore and two against Tampa Bay. And seven of the
homers came in the last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a fluke, but Spencer's minor league credentials argue
against that notion. At Triple A Columbus this season, he batted
.322 with 18 homers and 67 RBIs in 67 games. A year ago, he hit 30
homers at Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many felt his addition to the playoff roster was window
dressing. It would mean using him in left or center instead of
Darryl Strawberry or Tim Raines. But Strawberry was scratched
Wednesday night for medical reasons. And playing Raines on a
rain-soaked field is a risk. So why not give the kid a break?
</P>
<P>
   ``We did,'' said Yankees manager Joe Torre, who freely
acknowledges that Spencer has greatly exceeded expectations. ``I
hit three grand slams in 17 years. He's hit three in nine days. He
did it against righthanded and lefthanded pitchers. He's been in
the organization a few years and was with us early and didn't get a
chance to do much of anything. It was like he shouldn't be here
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that really wasn't fair to evaluate because he didn't play
much. We brought him back and he's more comfortable. He's done
everything that you'd like to see from a young player. He's shown
us power. He's pretty much been in a groove, and I hope there is
something left.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer well knows it's not easy to crack the Yankee lineup, but
he wasn't overwhelmed after getting the nod Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay prepared all the time,'' he said. ``So I wasn't
surprised. In fact, I think I like it that way. I don't know if my
home runs should be called sudden or not. I was hitting them in the
minors. I've worked on hitting them for seven or eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's doing it on the big stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting,'' he said. ``You get to go places.
People recognize you while you're eating dinner. I'm not used to
that. The guys are enjoying it because the media goes to my locker
instead of theirs. Meanwhile, I'm having fun. I'm glad I made it
with the Yankees. This way, I can say I made it with the best
organization ever instead of a team that finished at .500.''

 The Magic of Failure   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The license plate on Kamran Elahian's Ferrari F355 reads
``Momenta.'' Which says a lot about the man who drives it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Momenta is not a wildly successful company. In fact, it was one
of the biggest flops in Silicon Valley history, a maker of
pen-based computers which burned up $40 million in financing in
less than three years before going belly up.
</P>
<P>
   Elahian co-founded Momenta International in 1989 and was its
chief executive. He was fired six months before the company filed
for bankruptcy in the summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For Elahian, that was the low point in what otherwise has been
an exceptional career as an entrepreneur. Prior to Momenta, he
co-founded two successful companies, and since then, he has
co-founded a fast-growing chipmaker, NeoMagic of Santa Clara, and
two other promising companies _ PlanetWeb, whose software connects
the Internet to consumer electronics products, and Centillium,
which has developed a chip set for high-speed Internet access. He
is the chairman of all three.
</P>
<P>
   So why put Momenta on his license plate?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to remind me not to be too proud,'' he says. ``Unlike
other entrepreneurs who put the names of successful companies on
license plates, I decided to put my biggest failure. That way, I
have to be reminded of it every time I get in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Elahian, who now is 43, not only speaks openly about Momenta's
failure _ he considers it the crucible that has given him humility
to go with his face-sweeping smile.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year after Momenta went under, Elahian traveled the
world. Part of the odyssey involved doing things, like learning
French, for which he had never had time. And part of it was just
soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite confused about what I had done wrong,'' he
recalls. ``And I had started to lose confidence. When you get the
rug pulled out from beneath you, you start to question whether you
can create a successful company, get products out and make the
right calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that part of my failing was that I had thought I
couldn't do anything wrong. I had started to believe my own PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem also was that the market just wasn't ready
for computers that used pens to input information. Another
pen-based computer company, Go, used up $75 million before its
investors pulled the plug. And of course there was the Apple
Newton, the most famous flop of all.
</P>
<P>
   If Elahian was down on himself, venture capitalists apparently
didn't share his pessimism. When he put together a team of former
Cirrus Logic engineers to start NeoMagic in 1993, financing proved
no problem at all. Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Sequoia
Capital and U.S. Venture Partners all invested in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other people who went through an experience like
Momenta wouldn't have bounced back as quickly as Kamran did,'' said
Jim Lally, a partner at Kleiner Perkins and a friend of Elahian.
``That's a real tribute to his positive attitude. It lets him
accomplish things that others couldn't accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1993, NeoMagic makes graphics chips that are widely
used in notebook computers. Last year, it had earnings of $20.8
million _ its first annual profit _ and sales of nearly $125
million, up from $41 million the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   NeoMagic has made a rich man of Elahian, the son of an Iranian
entrepreneur who owned a string of stores selling eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Tehran, Elahian immigrated to the United States after
high school and went to the University of Utah. (His grades weren't
great, so he couldn't get into a lot of schools.) He took college
seriously, however, graduating with a double major in computer
science and mathematics at age 20. Two years later, he got his
master's in computer graphics, also from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Elahian started his career in 1978 designing automation software
for Hewlett-Packard. But in 1981, he got the entrepreneurial bug
and co-founded his first startup, CAE Systems, which made
computer-aided engineering software. Within three years, it was
bought by Tektronix for $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Elahian co-founded Cirrus Logic, a graphics chipmaker,
and stayed with it until 1989, when it went public. Cirrus sales
grew to more than $1 billion in 1996 before the company began to
founder, unable to come up with new products for the emerging 3-D
market.
</P>
<P>
   Elahian happily concedes that he likes the risk that comes with
startup companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love risks,'' he says. ``My basic view of life is that you
have to dream to be happy and you have to try to make your dreams
come true. And to make dreams come true, you have to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Federman, a partner at U.S. Venture Partners, says
Elahian's secret is ``an incredible thirst for new things. He has
incredible leg drive, and he's interested in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that occupies a lot of Elahian's time these
days is Projectneat, the nonprofit organization he started to
connect poor schools worldwide to the Internet. In its first two
years, more than 2,600 schools have been wired using equipment
donated by Projectneat.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the money for the organization comes out of
Elahian's own pocket. This year, he has donated $2.7 million, and
he hopes to raise a total of $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a donation to make something happen that he believes in,
and it's an incredibly impressive thing,'' said Kleiner's Lally.

 Ellen Hancock Hasn't Slowed After Apple   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Ellen Hancock only has an hour.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as a last-minute interview wraps up, she's traversing
the United States for several weeks on an exhaustive tour of which
Jack Kerouac &UR;  &LR; would have approved.
</P>
<P>
   There's a computer conference in Cape Cod, Mass. A board meeting
in Hartford, Conn. Analyst meetings in New York, Boston, Houston
and Denver. And a customer meeting in New York. If all goes well,
she might even squeeze in a stop at the Greenwich, Conn., home she
shares with her husband, Jason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's tiring,'' the personable CEO of Internet company
Exodus Communications in Santa Clara says, wearily nodding her
head. ``After a while, you ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits that the fast-track schedule sometimes can be as
hair-raising as a Keystone Cops caper. Hancock laughingly recalls a
$390 taxi cab fare she rang up a few weeks ago after missing a
flight from Lake Tahoe to San Francisco. She made her speaking
engagement with 10 minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The breakneck pace perfectly suits Hancock's self-described
``type-A personality.'' Her hard-driving work ethic and technical
expertise propelled her to the position of highest-ranking female
executive at IBM Corp., Apple Computer and National Semiconductor,
and established her as a female pioneer in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellen came up through the corporate ladder and broke the glass
ceiling in the technology arena for women,'' said Anna Lloyd,
president of The Committee of 200, a Chicago organization
representing nearly 400 prominent female leaders and executives in
the United States. Hancock also is a member. ``She demanded to be
included in that all-male-bastion world, and they obliged because
of her hard work and intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   George Scalise, the former chief administrative officer at Apple
and National Semiconductor who worked with Hancock, calls her a
``very bright, dedicated woman with a deep understanding of
computer software.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is putting her expertise to use these days at Exodus, a
350-person company that went public in March. Exodus is a provider
of Internet network-management tools for the likes of USA Today,
Hewlett-Packard, GeoCities and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a jam-packed calendar, Hancock relishes her role,
logging 12-hour workdays and burning the oil replying to e-mail in
her South Bay condo at night and on weekends. (Hancock typically
commutes to Connecticut every two weeks to catch up with Jason, her
husband of 27 years who retired from IBM after 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you have to work harder,'' Hancock said. ``I don't
mean to be sexist, but guys are reading novels on flights and I'm
plugging away on e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Plugging away is nothing new for Hancock, 54, the eldest of four
overachievers who grew up in Connecticut. She said her father, who
was president of a New York advertising company, had a particularly
profound influence on her. ``I got a lot of encouragement from
home,'' she said. ``My parents were blind to gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock also is a devout Catholic. She went to all-girl schools,
regularly attends church and carries rosary beads in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock excitedly points out a photo on her office wall, showing
her handing the Pope an IBM ThinkPad laptop. ``Most nervous moment
in my life,'' she recalls. ``I was afraid I would call him your
highness instead of your holiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Possessing so much faith, Hancock appeared to be a natural fit
for the highly charged environment of the Macintosh faithful.
Instead, her one-year tenure at Apple as chief technology officer
was anything but positive. The Apple faithful charged that she was
a corporate suit who lacked imagination and technical acumen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Along with her mentor, former Apple CEO Gil Amelio, and
fellow Apple executives, Hancock was ousted in a high-tech power
struggle shortly after Steve Jobs rejoined &UR;  &LR; the company in late
1996 as part of Apple's $400 million acquisition of Next Software
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was gracious in face-to-face meetings, but behind the
scenes, he called everyone in upper management a bozo,'' Hancock
said. ``It felt like a reverse merger. Gil, myself and the rest of
the executive team are gone. Steve is now interim CEO, and his Next
team is running things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you bounce back, and I have,'' Hancock continued. ``I'm
onto the Exodus chapter of my career.''

 &HT;    Cope on pole; Gordon slips
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Did Halloween come early to Charlotte Motor
Speedway Wednesday night?
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain that Derrike Cope won his first career pole,
for Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500, after failing to qualify in four
other events? That Jeff Gordon didn't make the top 25? That Mark
Martin was bumped from the pole by Cope?
</P>
<P>
   Cope, the 41st driver on the 1.5-mile track, surprised all with
his pole-winning speed of 181.690 mph, just a tick faster than his
inside front row partner Martin's 181.220 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of adversity, a year of uncharted territory
that has limited us,'' said Cope, referring to the beating he took
in accidents at both Atlanta and Texas. ``To win the pole is
self-gratifying for me toward my crew. I knew we had a shot at it,
and I wanted it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cope broke his ribs, sternum and shoulder in Atlanta, then
aggravated the condition in Texas, where he hit a slick spot on the
track and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's poor lap was one he expected, but not to the extent of
not qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we tested here we weren't going to be good in
qualilfying,'' Gordon said. ``I'm not real concerned because I know
we've got a good race car. We misjudged a little bit, and I got a
little bit looser than I was expecting to get for qualifying. I'm
disappointed we didn't go faster, but I'm thankful to get this out
of the way so we can get ready to race.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, Gordon's slip was no more than a blip on the screen,
even though the crowd stood and roared when his speed was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real good lap for us,'' Martin said of his second-place
lap. ``This is a moody old girl here, this track, especially when
it comes to sun and cloud cover and nighttime and everything else.
I expect Jeff got into a little bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Buckshot Racing team announced Wednesday that
two-time Busch Series champion Larry Pearson will drive the No. 00
Pontiac and with a new sponsor, Cheez-It Snack Cracker, for the
1999 Busch season. Kenneth Campbell, formerly with the Timber Wolf
team, will oversee the program from their headquarters in
Spartanburg. Buckshot Jones will move to the Winston Cup circuit in
'99, with headquarters in a new shop in Spartanburg. Ricky Pearson
will be crew chief of the Winston Cup team. ...Todd Bodine returns
to the Busch circuit in '99 with Team 34, reuniting with the Frank
Ciccio/Scott Welliver team where he enjoyed much success in the
early 1990s.

 &HT;    Smoltz' performance puts him in lead line-up
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They knew John Smoltz would show up. He does so by
habit, the primary reason he has now won more postseason baseball
games than any man in history.
</P>
<P>
   The question remained, who among the Atlanta Braves would join
him? Michael Tucker and Ryan Klesko stood up first Wednesday
afternoon. For the long-deprived Cubs Nation, this news was not
good.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's two-run homer in the second inning started what
Klesko's grand slam in the seventh finished. The Braves and Smoltz
rolled over Chicago in the first game of the National League
Division Series, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz' performance _ one run on five hits in 7 2/3 innings _
was good for his 11th victory in the postseason, erasing a record
co-held by Whitey Ford and Dave Stewart, who each made 22 career
postseason starts. This was Smoltz's 21st.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me. but it means more that the team I play
for allowed me to do this,'' said Smoltz, whose only mistake was a
lead-off homer by ex-Brave Tyler Houston in the seventh. ``I've
piched 21 games now, and they all have been incredible. But it's
the product behind me that has allowed it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine faces Kevin Tapani tonight in Game 2, and the odds
are not with Chicago. The Braves, 4-0 in Game 1 play of the
division series, are 10-1 in all LDS games, and Glavine is unbeaten
in three career division series starts.
</P>
<P>
   Even after holding Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga to one
single on Wednesday, the Cubs were victimized by two of the least
successful Braves, a dark harbinger. Both homers came with two out,
both with 3-2 counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's big because Michael and Ryan were big factors,''
manager Bobby Cox said. ``Mike's cooled off the last 1 1/2 months
or so, but he's got a good swing. The playoffs are different.
Anybody can be a hero in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   After Andruw Jones reached first in the second on shortstop Jose
Hernandez's error, Tucker, who had struck out once every 3.7
at-bats this season, worked a 2-2 count against Cubs starter Mark
Clark. After holding up on a low forkball that filled the count,
Tucker was surprised by a ball over the heart of the plate and
blasted it five rows deep into the right-field stands. With Smoltz
in the on-deck circle, Clark threw the second forkball the one
place that he couldn't. The lead was tonic for Smoltz, who opened
awkwardly and needed a pair of outstanding catches by Klesko and
Tucker to get out of the early stages. But he proceeded to retire
10 of 11 men in faced from the third on, until Sammy Sosa led off
the seventh with a double. Then came his best work. Mark Grace
(.333 career average) was induced to pop-out to center, Henry
Rodriguez went down swinging and Gary Gaetti ended the inning on a
check-swing ground-out.
</P>
<P>
   That, aside of Houston's homer, was the extent of Chicago's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoltz was the story,'' said Cubs manager Jim Riggleman. ``He
made us look like we weren't fighting because he wouldn't let us
get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his time of year,'' Jones said. ``When he takes the
mound, he goes out there expecting 100 percent to win. If we give
him a little bit of a cushion, it's Katy-bar-the-door. Tuck got the
homer, you could see him settle in.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, who has driven just 16 runs the last two months, matched
25 percent of that on one swing in the seventh off reliever Matt
Karchner, who inherited a bases-loaded mess from Felix Heredia. The
grand slam was just the third in LDS history, but represented
Klesko's ninth postseason homer, another unforeseen development
after he slumped to 16 home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   That it came in Game 1 against the same Cubs that vexed them
this summer made for an interesting message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they're all important,'' said Klesko, ``but in the same
sense, yeah, it was. It is a five-game series and they did play
good ball against this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. October starts today.

 &HT;    Chicago question: Cubs fired up or tired out?
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That Monday night euphoria in Chicago has momentarily subsided.
Cubs in! Cubs in! In the postseason, where the question now is,
who'll weather this NL Division Series?
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and a Cubbies club high on adrenaline, low on sleep
and likely arm-weary? Or the team of the '90s, this deepest and
most versatile Braves assemblage, losers of five straight to the
Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   ``They won (Monday) night,'' Tom Glavine said of the Cubs, who
got an 11th-hour reprieve Sunday, then a 5-3 wild-card playoff win
over San Francisco Monday that sends Chicago to Game 1 today at
Turner Field. ``I'm sure they're all fired up. I'm sure they're
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fire and fatigue are factors come the postseason. ``For us
in '93,'' said Glavine, ``after we caught the Giants (on the last
day of the season to end an epic pennant race), we were all worn
out.'' As evidenced in the NLCS, which Philadelphia won in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chipper Jones knows, ``I think emotion can take you a long
way, and they have emotion on their side now. They're so sky-high
right now and happy to be in the playoffs, they're looking to take
advantage of any mistakes we make.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Chicago did during the season. After the Braves took three
of four here in mid-May, the Cubs swept a three-game series four
days later in Wrigley Field. The Cubs took two games here July
20-21, Kerry Wood beating Greg Maddux 3-0 in that finale. ``Chicago
caught us a couple of games when we were not playing our best
baseball,'' said Jones. ``We faced Kerry Wood three times; he got
the best of us all three outings (one win, two no-decisions in
three Cub victories). Other than him, the season series was pretty
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Try 3-all. But Wood hasn't started since Aug. 31 due to arm
problems, although he threw 2 2/3 scoreless innings Monday in an
Arizona Fall League game, allowing three hits and averaging 95 mph
on his fastball. Rumors persist that Wood could start Game 3
Saturday at Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, ``We need to play the way we've been playing,'' said
Bobby Cox, whose Braves won their last seven games, 14 of 16. ``I
tried to explain that (in a Tuesday team meeting). There's no, `Hit
'em high, hit 'em low.' You go out and play your best game.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat's meow
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga's choice for NL MVP? His good friend Sammy
Sosa. ``I think he has to be the MVP,'' said Galarraga. ``There's a
lot of pressure. He helps the team. There's the (home run) race
with (Mark) McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for them
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who'll start Game 3, was glad for his good friend and
ex-Cubs teammate Mark Grace, as well as his good friend and
ex-Braves teammate Jeff Blauser, that Chicago beat San Francisco.
``It was good to see Gracie (the lone relic from the Cubs' last
playoff team in 1989),'' said Maddux, who also played on that team.
``And Blaus. He knows what it's like to win, but he got a different
taste of winning, like here in '91.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, the Game 2 starter and one of two Braves left from that
1991 turnaround team, was also happy for Blauser. To a point. ``The
postseason's a different story,'' he said. ``I don't want Jeff
Blauser to do well anymore. I'm sure he feels the same way as us.
It doesn't change the way I feel about him. He's a friend of mine.
But I want to win.

<P>
   No question about it.
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Joe Brinkman blew the call at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's cameras caught Indians catcher Sandy Alomar tagging the
outstretched left arm of Red Sox third baseman John Valentin before
he reached home plate in the explosive first inning of Wednesday's
American League Division Series game.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a time for instant replay, Wednesday was it.
Never mind all the questionable ball and strike calls made by
Brinkman.
</P>
<P>
   This was a clear out. ``The film doesn't lie,'' said Kevin
Kennedy, the former Red Sox manager and ESPN analyst for this game.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was all over Brinkman from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman called Indians starter Dwight Gooden's first three
pitches balls. Kennedy said two of them were at the hitter's knees
and over the plate. The replays were not conclusive, but the
pitches appeared to be strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Indians manager Mike Hargrove thought the pitches
were strikes and confronted Brinkman, who almost immediately threw
him out of the game. ``Oh my God, he was tossed after three
pitches,'' ESPN play-by-play announcer Chris Berman thundered.
</P>
<P>
   Berman is loath to criticize umpires. He probably figures that
it doesn't matter, that umpires are extremely unlikely to reverse a
call, no matter how much in error they are.
</P>
<P>
   He is right, of course, but ESPN also blew an opportunity to
show viewers just how bad the plate calls were throughout the game.
Technology exists to allow networks to use computer-generated
graphics to demonstrate the strike zone, the path of a pitch, and
the umpire's call.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN could have let the viewer decide if the calls were right or
wrong. Not that it would have made a difference. But it definitely
would have informed viewers about Brinkman's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brinkman's strike zone is a little high today,'' Kennedy said.
The film didn't lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be able to pitch at the knees,'' Kennedy said.
``Hargrove was right. The pitches were strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman disagreed. When Hargrove ran onto the field, Brinkman
reportedly told him that Gooden had to throw his pitches higher.
ESPN cameras caught Gooden telling Hargrove to calm down, that he
would be all right. They didn't show Brinkman admonishing Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc needs to find the plate,'' Berman said, pointing out that
11 of Gooden's first 15 pitches were balls. He found the plate by
striking out Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden appeared fine until he gave up a monster double to Nomar
Garciaparra, which led to the play where Valentin was called safe
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a seething Gooden was thrown out after screaming at
Brinkman. Gooden also had to be physically restrained from further
confronting Brinkman. ESPN had the explosion covered but probably
made the right call by not keeping its cameras trained on an
enraged Gooden, who was shouting obscenities in full view.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Game 2 was the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umps are in the picture more than they care to be,''
Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Brinkman left his position to tell Gooden he
should get his pitches higher.
</P>
<P>
   It ended when ESPN analyst Peter Gammons said on ``Baseball
Tonight'' that the umpire lost control of the game. Gammons
referred to the major league rule book, specifically Section 905,
which states that umpires must exhibit self-control.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ There are no surprises awaiting the Galaxy as
it begins its quest for the Major League Soccer title. Galaxy
players and coaches know what they're going to see from the Dallas
Burn, and they know the Burn know they know.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds a tad convoluted, it isn't. Simply put, the Burn
have come to Pasadena to play defense _ tight, space-clogging,
opportunity-killing defense _ and see if it might steal a victory
in tonight's Western Conference semifinal series opener at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It worked last year, when Dallas wrestled the Galaxy to a
scoreless draw in the Rose Bowl opener, winning a shootout behind
master 'keeper Mark Dodd, then finished a first-round sweep with a
3-0 romp at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them to come out here and do the same thing they did
last year,'' midfielder Danny Pea says. ``They're going to wait for
us to come at them and wait for whatever opportunity we may give
them on a counterattack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you that Dallas will sit back and look for a
couple counters and hope we make a mistake,'' says Dan Calichman,
who's eligible to play _ but won't _ after being activated off
injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that have succeeded against L.A. this season have
employed similar tactics, plugging the spaces the Galaxy needs to
operate the dynamics of its attack and taking advantage of L.A.'s
tendency to push forward in search of goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Galaxy does well when teams want to play with us,''
Calichman says. ``It's the teams that sit back whose defense is
very sound we have trouble with. We've got to get an early goal
because if we get an early goal, teams have to come at us, and if
they come at us, that's exactly what we want because it opens up
space. When we don't get the early goal, then we've got to be
patient and wait for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has enough men capable of putting the ball in the net
_ Cobi Jones scored 19 goals in the regular season, Welton had 17,
Mauricio Cienfuegos 13, Martin Machon and Carlos Hermosillo six
apiece _ but it has only done so once in its last three games and
was shut out six times this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn has been erratic, in large part because of injuries,
but has played its best soccer the past month, with Dodd,
post-World Cup addition Chad Deering and Salvadoran Jorge Rodriguez
firming up the defense. There's no mystery how it is approaching
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' said Dallas coach Dave Dir, ``I think
everybody knows the way to play L.A. I don't think there are any
secrets there....
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever L.A. loses a game, they talk about the style of the
other team, but there's no team that sits back deeper and plays to
counter more than L.A. Teams that have beaten them have played the
same way they do. You can't let Cobi and those players behind you.
You have to be patient with the ball, keep possession, and make
them work harder defensively than they're used to.''

AILING STRAWBERRY TO UNDERGO TESTING
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry left the team
yesterday to prepare for tests to diagnose an illness some fear
might be cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you take tests, obviously cancer is the one
thing you fear,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``You've got to
hope it's something they can handle real quick. You keep your
fingers crossed and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has been bothered by abdominal pain. He underwent a
CAT scan yesterday to attempt to find the cause, but the results
were inconclusive so further tests are scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes well, he could join us in Texas in time for
Game 3,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, tied for third on the team with 24 home runs despite
being a part-time player, started experiencing pain and cramps in
his lower abdomen about two months ago. The pain was at its worst
when he woke up and lessened as the day went on, so he ignored it.
It didn't prevent him from playing, and he didn't want to go on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been bothering him for a while, but he really
never let anybody in on it,'' Torre said. ``The only indication I
had was his performance on the field, and he didn't seem to be
moving around as well as he had before. But all of a sudden he'd
hit a home run and you'd put that stuff in the back of your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a recent conversation with good friend Eric Davis, the
Baltimore Orioles' outfielder who battled colon cancer last summer,
Strawberry decided to undergo blood tests on Monday and the CAT
scan yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss him, and we're going to be concerned about
him until we find out everything's OK,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry arrived at Yankee Stadium about 4 1/2 hours before
game time yesterday to tell Torre about the tests and to talk to
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to stay and have a talk with the players, because he
understands what can happen when something physical happens to a
player,'' Torre said. ``We have a job to do, and I'm sure that's
what Darryl went around saying to everybody.''

BOEING TO PAY $10 MILLION FINE IN SEA LAUNCH CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Though it remains the subject of a criminal
investigation, the Boeing Co. agreed Wednesday to pay a $10 million
civil penalty so it can resume work with Russian and Ukranian
rocket companies on a commercial space venture, Sea Launch.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million payment is worth one-fifth the price of an
orbital launch once Sea Launch gets going. It will include a $7.5
million civil penalty, reported to be the largest ever under the
Arms Export Control Act. The remaining $2.5 million is to set up a
computer system in Long Beach, Calif., to allow Defense and State
department officials to monitor the work of Boeing managers and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department stopped Boeing's work on Sea Launch on July
27, three years into its collaboration with the Russians and
Ukranians.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional source earlier said Boeing had broken the terms
of its export license by discussing technical information without a
State Department representative present. A State Department
official on Wednesday declined to describe the violations, but said
Boeing had violated the license 207 times. The official added that
none of the violations damaged national security or harmed U.S.
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the federal government is continuing a criminal
investigation, which Crain's ``Washington Outlook'' newsletter says
includes a grand jury in Seattle. Boeing has agreed not to
challenge criminal prosecution on the constitutional grounds of
double jeopardy as part of its civil penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Launch affair pits U.S. export-control laws against a
novel business plan to combine the rocket technology of Russians
and Ukranians with the project-management skills of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The first two stages of the rocket are the Zenit, supplied by
Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash, the Ukranian group that built the big Soviet
SS-18 nuclear-tipped missile. The third stage is built by Moscow's
RSC-Energia, which launched the first Sputnik in 1957 and lately
has been building hardware for the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of Sea Launch is to create a cheap way to launch
satellites by using the spin of the Earth at the equator. Boeing
has 40 percent of the venture, with smaller shares for the two
Russian partners and for Kvaerner Maritime A.S. of Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   As of July, Boeing had 18 orders for launches, 13 from Hughes
Space &AMP; Communications International Inc. and five from Loral Space
&AMP; Communications Ltd. Analysts estimate each launch will bring in
about $50 million, currently about one-tenth of one percent of
Boeing Co. annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that is likely to make them a lot of
money,'' Paul Nisbet, a defense analyst with JSA Research Inc.,
told Bloomberg News. ``When everything is going well they maybe
have 15 launches a year.'' But it is the sort of venture that could
set the company on the road to bigger things in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dolan, spokesman for Boeing Space communications at Seal
Beach, Calif., said work will quickly get back up to speed. Russian
and Ukranian engineers that had been sent home will return to
California. The oil platform will arrive at Long Beach soon, and
testing will begin at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan said the first launch is scheduled for the first three
months of 1999, and that Boeing is discussing the possibility of
orbiting a dummy satellite on the first launch. Reuters recently
reported from Moscow that Energiya had postponed the launch from
January to March and that the satellite would be a dummy because
Hughes Electronics Corp. needed more time to get its satellite
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Crain's ``Washington Outlook'' reported that insurance companies
had lost $226 million on Boeing's failed Delta launch Aug. 26, and
want Sea Launch tested with a dummy satellite before they
underwrite any risky ventures.

9-30 -- Catherine Jones and her 7-month-old son, Killian, often log
training miles together on her shorter runs. On Saturday, Jones,
35, will compete in the 20th edition of the Ironman race in Hawaii.
The event includes a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and
a 26.2-mile run. The biggest thing about the marathon is, it's
hot,'' she says. ``The pavement is black tar - it's hot.'' (Tom

ASTROS CONTINUE POSTSEASON SLUMP

<P>
   HOUSTON _ If the Killer B's continue to produce like Killer
Fleas, the Houston Astros are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Extending a disturbing postseason trend, the Astros' big-boppin'
trio of Derek Bell, Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell again shot blanks
Tuesday in Houston's 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 of
their National League Division Series. In four playoff games over
two seasons, the Killer B's are an atrocious 2-of-47 with 15
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got here with those guys producing hits, power and runs,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``They've got to come through
for us or we won't win this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite carrying the Astros to consecutive NL Central
championships and a franchise-record 102 victories this season, the
team's stars have been miserable in the postseason. Performing like
the worst Texas trio since the Mavericks' failed Three J's,
Houston's threesome suffered an offensive Brown-out against the
Padres, going 0-of-10 with seven strikeouts against masterful Kevin
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with their nightmarish performance in last year's 3-0
loss to the Atlanta Braves, Bell is 0-for-17, Bagwell 1-for-16 and
Biggio 1-for-14 in the playoffs. The Astros, in turn, are 0-4 by a
combined score of 21-6 without ever holding a lead against Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were in over our heads against Atlanta,'' said
Bagwell, who had 34 homers and 111 runs batted in in the regular
season. ``And Kevin was awesome, too good for us in Game 1. But
that doesn't mean it's a psychological thing with us. We're better
than we were last year and we know it. One game against a hot
pitcher doesn't make it time to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does make Game 2 at 3 p.m. today in The Astrodome
crucial. The best-of-five series shifts to San Diego's Qualcomm
Stadium over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we hoped we could win; this year we know we can,''
said Biggio, who became only the second player this century along
with Hall of Famer Tris Speaker in 1912 to record 50 doubles and 50
steals. ``It's different. We're not all of the sudden going to
forget how to hit. It's not going to happen. We've been too good
for too long to just give up because of one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite setting franchise offensive records and being deemed the
NL team to beat by many, the Astros were totally handcuffed by
Brown's dipping sinker and four-seam rising fastball. Every Astros
player in the game struck out at least once, and they got only two
runners to third base and only four balls out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who hit .314 with 22 homers and 108 RBI in the regular
season, struck out swinging with two outs and two on in Houston's
best scoring chance against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those guys' character and right now they're pulling
their hair out,'' said former Astro-turned-Padre Ken Caminiti.
``They're blaming themselves because they have to carry that team.
We all know what great players they are. I just hope we don't wake
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The alarm needs to go off for the Killer B's, or the city that
helped launch men to the moon still won't be able to send a team to
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less than getting to the \RWorld\S Series will be a
disappointment for us,'' Bagwell said. ``We need to come through,
and we have confidence that we will.''
Killer Fleas? The Astros Killer B's _ Derek Bell, Craig Biggio and
Jeff Bagwell _ have been dreadful in four playoff games the past
two years. A look at each player's hitting horrors: Year H-AB SO

U.S. CHARGES BIN LADEN SUSPECT IN LARGER PLOT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have charged an associate of
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected in the embassy bombings
in Africa, with taking part in a conspiracy to attack U.S. military
sites abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was filed without announcement Tuesday against
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who has been described as a senior deputy to
bin Laden. He was arrested last month in Munich, Germany, after he
had traveled there from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Manhattan have said they will seek Salim's
extradition from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
declined to comment Wednesday night on the conspiracy charge, which
appears to bolster the government case that bin Laden and his
associates committed acts of terrorism other than the embassy
bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in August.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 people died and hundreds were injured in the
almost simultaneous bombings at the two African embassies.
</P>
<P>
   In their amended complaint, prosecutors added the count of
conspiring to attack U.S. military sites and a charge of conspiring
to transport explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Salim had been charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy
to use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The new charge does not specify whether a military site was
attacked; it does allege that the conspiracy began between 1992 and
the present.
</P>
<P>
   But papers filed when Salim was first charged suggest that the
new charge may be referring to statements from bin Laden to his top
aides that encouraged attacks on U.S forces in Saudi Arabia,
Somalia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   In other filings the government has said it is investigating bin
Laden's role in attacks on U.S. forces in Somalia in 1993 and early
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those incidents the new charge could suggest that
investigators have developed new leads in two other unsolved
attacks on U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995 in Riyadh, seven people were killed in a
bombing at an American-run military building. In June 1996, 19
American airmen were killed in the bombing of Khobar Towers
apartment complex in Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is said to have been charged in an indictment this
year. The indictment, not released publicly, accuses him of acts of
terror that predate the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges may also be an attempt by prosecutors to
solidify the extradition case against Salim in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors went before a magistrate last week in Manhattan
to unseal the original charges against Salim, they said the German
authorities wanted a copy of the charges ``to permit them to begin
the extradition process.''

McCOWN BACK IN STARTING GATE AT A&AMP;M 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy McCown has been there and done that, and he doesn't want
to go there and do it again the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Tagged by Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum to make the second start
of his collegiate career this week in the Aggies' Big 12 opener at
Kansas, McCown has only to recall the sight of Lubbock in his
rear-view mirror to bring Saturday's task into calm, clear focus.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the South Plains last October that McCown was given
his first chance to replace Branndon Stewart as the Aggies'
starting quarterback. The net result in two quarters as a starter
was, to be kind, less than everyone had hoped _ 2-of-8 passing for
7 yards, three sacks that resulted in minus-24 yards, and a fumble
that led to Texas Tech's lone touchdown. Stewart relieved him at
the half. Tech won, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   Memories are not made of this. Resolution, however, may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into it this year, I'm a lot more relaxed. The
difference is like night and day,'' said McCown, a third-season
backup who won his second chance with another clutch relief
performance in a 28-9 victory against North Texas last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put too much pressure on myself in the Tech game last year,
and by doing that I didn't have any fun. Since then, I've decided
that given another shot I would be just as focused, but more
relaxed _ just as if I was playing football in my backyard in
Jacksonville with my brothers and my buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're having fun, you play your best.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks coach Ray Dorr says he believes McCown has given
every indication he's ready for this step and will respond to this
challenge better than he did an autumn ago. But Dorr cautions
against forming iron-clad projections about the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy has had a year to grow,'' Dorr said. ``\RAgainst Tech\S,
he tried to play outside of Randy. Right now, he's playing within
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's be realistic, up-front, and not try to paint a rosy
picture that everything is wonderful. Life isn't always wonderful,
it's tough. And Randy still has to go in and play well as a
starter. He's come off the bench and been extremely effective in
every one of the games he's played at A&AMP;M. But he still has to jump
over that hurdle of being a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown harbors no particular NFL aspirations. His current plans
are to take an agricultural economics degree, go back to East Texas
and open a commercial plant farm. He regards College Station as a
city. He has taken up golf to compensate for a lack of opportunity
to pursue his favorite pastimes _ hunting, fishing and exploring
woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   But McCown loves to play football, and his enthusiasm is
infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy is really fired up in the huddle,'' noted receiver Chris
Cole, who caught two of his three touchdown passes against UNT from
McCown. ``He's a great quarterback, a motivator. Branndon is a good
leader, but Randy is more vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown is also more the scrambler, more the athlete. He finished
eighth overall among team members in off-season strength and
conditioning competition.
</P>
<P>
   Dorr says he has no trepidation about making a change just as
the Aggies open conference play, a week before entertaining
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won three games, but our productivity wasn't as good as
it's been,'' Dorr said. ``The quarterback's job in football is to
move the team down the field and get into the end zone _ we did not
feel that was being done. You \Rmake a change\S the day one
\Rquarterback\S isn't performing right.''
</P>
<P>
   An evolving offensive line has contributed to A&AMP;M's
less-than-impressive offensive production. But Stewart has taken
the switch in stride, as he did last season when he responded to a
similar situation by playing the best football of his college
career in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was the starter for the first \Rfour\S games,
the competition between the two of us is always there,'' Stewart
said. ``We always know that one of us has as good a chance to play
as the other. It's no different now.''

SPARKS FLY AT SOLHEIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the antics of Dottie Pepper and Annika Sorenstam and
the mouth of Laura Davies, future versions of the Solheim Cup could
well have a Ryder Cup edge to them. That is to say the combatants
in these biennial matches will go at each other with a little more
fervor that is usually displayed when they compete during the
regular LPGA season.
</P>
<P>
   And this could end up being good for women's professional golf.
This year's motto of the LPGA Tour is, ``Hey, we can play this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes they can. Trouble is, for most of the year they do so in the
relative obscurity of cable television and the briefs or summaries
of newspaper sports sections. Consider the recently completed
Solheim Cup, which the U.S. won 16-12 after three days of sparkling
play at the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The matches got network exposure but no major newspaper
coverage. So lots of golf fans missed out on some fascinating
gamesmanship and, in the end, sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   It all started on Saturday with Pepper, an intense competitor
with a fiery disposition. Think Raymond Floyd staring down a
twisting 45-footer and then Tiger Woods fist-pumping after the putt
drops. That's Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th green during a Saturday match, Pepper's partner,
Julie Inkster, rolled a long putt to gimme range. The Europeans
conceded the putt and before they could attempt their own chip shot
to halve the hole and get a much-needed half point, Pepper went
into her cheerleader routine, egging on the crowd to a rousing
round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the European squad took exception, most notably
Sorenstam and Davies. Sorenstam had brought a pop-up punching bag
with her to Murifield. So after the Saturday competition she and
her teammates took turns clobbering the bag, which they nicknamed
Dottie.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam would later say it was just a good way to unwind.
Davies would say Pepper should learn some manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what happened on the 18th green and I've been excited in
Solheim Cups,'' she said. ``But when you pick your ball up when
it's been conceded and you excite the crowd when your opponent
still has to play a very, very difficult chip shot, and we're
desperately trying to get a half point out of the match, that's
when I took exception to it. That's when Annika and I started
beating up that dummy thing in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just unprofessional, unnecessary and it spurred us
on. So it was a big mistake on top of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies also said that her team was full of good losers, meaning
that they lost with class. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   If Pepper, who finished the competition with a 4-0 record and
was the only undefeated player, was miffed, she did not let on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear about that until after it was finished,'' she
said of the punching-bag incident. ``I'll tell you what I told
them. I take it as a compliment, period; if that's what it takes,
then I'll be glad to be their punching bag.''
</P>
<P>
   And she maintained that not once did she cross the line between
gamesmanship and sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, though. If the competition is expanded to
include an international team rather than a European team, as some
have suggested, Davies will find something else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up with answering that one,'' she said of questions
about an expanded team. ``I won't play on an international team
ever. I don't think anyone would be interested in playing the rest
of the world against America. It's an insult to every single one of
us on the team and every time they question us, it's another
insult.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no doubt that while the Europeans lost with class,
American Meg Mallon also won with class. The U.S. had already
clinched the cup and Mallon came to the 18th hole with a one-stroke
lead on her opponent, Sweden's Sophie Gustafson.
</P>
<P>
   After their tee shots, as they walked to the green, Mallon
conceded the hole to Gustafson, meaning that they would halve the
match and at the end of the day there would be no losers or
winners.

JURY FINDS FOR BOEING IN DISCRIMINATION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A black security investigator whose accusations of
race bias against The Boeing Co. helped focus national attention on
the aerospace giant, failed to prove his claims, a federal court
jury said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Jesse Jones said the company discriminated against
him when it denied him several deserved promotions, and then
retaliated after he complained. A jury of eight men and four women
disagreed Wednesday, finding that he hadn't proved any of the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company was ``gratified''
by the jury's decision and reiterated its central position in the
case, that Jones has been ``treated fairly and compensated well''
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' attorney, John Sheridan, said he was surprised by the
jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt we proved our case,'' Sheridan said. ``We showed
the insensitivity of Boeing higher-level executives'' to issues of
equal employment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is still enmeshed in questions about racism. It is facing
dozens of complaints, a lawsuit by its employees, and drew a visit
from civil-rights champion Jesse Jackson in early September to
discuss the issue with chairman Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   Conte stressed Boeing's commitment to being an ``inclusive''
company with a diverse and representative workforce, as well as its
no-tolerance policy toward discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Jones claimed he was passed over four times for promotions in
Boeing's security department, and each time the job he sought went
instead to one of several former FBI agents who worked in the
department.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally filed a complaint, he said, his co-workers'
attitudes toward him grew negative, his job evaluations suffered,
his boss tried to get him fired and higher-ups ignored his pleas
for help.
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledged that ``distinct cliques'' in the
security department pitted former FBI agents against non-agents.
All of Jones' experience prior to joining Boeing had been in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But it concluded that the department's problems weren't
race-related, and addressed them by moving people out _ including
Jones, who was made director of disaster preparedness, a job he
didn't want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it has been fixed, and without regard to race,''
Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of incidents Jones felt were discriminatory were not
discussed at the trial because the statute of limitations had
expired. Asked why he hadn't filed his case earlier, in time for
them to be considered, Jones said, ``I'm not a lawyer ... I didn't
know about the statute of limitations. The company just kept
saying, `Have patience, we're working on it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the jury allowed to consider certain other information
potentially damaging to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   One item was a report prepared by Wichita attorney Gloria
Flentje, whom Boeing had asked to evaluate Jones' allegations and
whether he had a strong legal case. The report was to be
confidential, but a surreptitious copy was sent to Jones, who gave
it to his attorney, Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing asked the judge in the case to remove Sheridan for using
a ``purloined document'' as a ``road map'' to sue Boeing; the judge
let Sheridan remain but ordered all copies returned to Boeing and
required all who had read it not to reveal its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Also ruled off-limits was courtroom testimony by Viola Keith,
Boeing's former director of equal opportunity, who said company
lawyers had tried to slant her testimony in Jones' case.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepared her to testify, she said she felt ``they would
prefer that I not be forthcoming with the truth'' and told her such
things as, ``You don't have to say this,'' and ``You could say
this,'' and ``Maybe you could take a trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's attorneys vehemently denied her allegations, calling
them ``nonsense,'' a ``flat-out lie'' and ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge was visibly angry about the developments, but said
they would essentially require a new trial and ruled that Keith's
testimony was not admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said there are ``several issues worthy of appeal'' but
he and Jones had made no decision on what course to pursue. Jones
was not in court when the jury returned with the verdict at about
3:30 p.m. Wednesday.

   BC-OBIT-BRADLEY-NYT (moved on Tuesday, September 29)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of former Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles sent by
the New York Times News Service on Tuesday, September 29, referred
incorrectly in some copies to the landmark he attained with his
election in 1973. While Los Angeles had a significantly smaller
percentage of black voters than other big cities with black mayors,
Mr. Bradley was not the first black mayor of a largely white major
city; a majority of Cleveland's population was white when Carl B.
Stokes was elected mayor in 1967.

RESILIENT BURN BEGINS PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First came the injuries. Then the losing. Then the bickering.
Then the trading.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Dallas Burn players questioned their coach's
tactics and general manager's judgment. The Burn brain trust
questioned the team's intensity and fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that could happen to derail the Burn's Major League
Soccer playoff hopes did in 1998. Somehow, Dallas avoided implosion
and now hopes for a run to the MLS Cup as a bottom-seeded team.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Galaxy (24-8) will play host to Dallas (15-17)
at 9 tonight in Game 1 of the best-of-three Western Conference
semifinals at the Rose Bowl. Game 2 is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday
at the Cotton Bowl. Game 3, if necessary, is scheduled for 9:30
p.m. Wednesday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, No. 4 seed Colorado raised the bar for lower-rung
playoff teams. The Rapids, seeded third in the West this season,
advanced to the MLS Cup but fell, 2-1, to two-time champion D.C.
United.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas swept a hot Galaxy club in two semifinal games last year,
a trick Dallas players know won't be easy to turn this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we all hoped and expected early in the season to
be in this position,'' Burn goalkeeper Mark Dodd said. ``We didn't
know how difficult we'd make it on ourselves to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd shut out Kansas City, 1-0, with 12 saves in the
next-to-last game of the regular season to clinch the last MLS West
playoff spot. It was a fitting performance, given how Dodd's season
began.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's '97 All-Star goalkeeper missed the first six games of
the season with a broken hand and took nearly a full season to
rediscover his game.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd's absence was the tip of the iceberg. Eventually, 10 Burn
starters missed a combined 82 games due to injuries. Three players
_ forward Gerell Elliott and midfielders Mark Santel and Alain
Sutter _ are done for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing, the stuff we've battled through,'' Burn
coach Dave Dir said. ``I feel good to have been through a lot more
adversity than other playoff teams. Really, we may be better
prepared for this postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas also battled through a stretch of nine losses in 12 games
that looked to end any playoff hopes. Some Burn veterans then
questioned whether Dir should remain as coach or if general manager
Billy Hicks could pull the trigger if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hicks went to work acquiring more talent. U.S. national
team defender Chad Deering moved in at sweeper with 15 games left,
and struggling forward Damian was traded to New England for center
midfielder Oscar Pareja.
</P>
<P>
   The latter addition has given star midfielder Jason Kreis
(team-high 26 points) the freedom to roam from his defensive
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were searching for answers when Alain got hurt,'' Kreis
said. ``Oscar has fit into those shoes and meant higher production
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to injuries and finger-pointing, the heat did its
part in slowing down the Burn. Dallas trained and played through
the hottest Metroplex summer since 1980. From May 31 to Sept. 2,
gametime temperatures averaged 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to use the heat to our advantage, like
the altitude or cold in Denver,'' Dodd said. ``I'm not sure it was
ever an advantage for us. When it gets this hot, it just wears you
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dir called the harsh summer an ``equalizing factor'' in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's 106, it just takes away both teams' energy,'' he said.
``Looking back, I'm not sure we could have dealt with it any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with success was another matter. What few big victories
the Burn had were followed by momentum-killing losses. The trend is
evident in the Burn's three-year record of 48-48, which Dodd calls
deceptive with shootouts figured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obvious room for improvement,'' Dodd said. ``We're not
where we're supposed to be. You'd be hard-pressed to say anybody's
had their best year. But now we find ourselves in the playoffs, and
this is the same group of guys who know we have potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe facing a big winner like LA will give us the motivation
to finally shine and play to our maximum.''

   (NYT1) PRINCETON, Mass. -- Sept. 30, 1998 -- WOM-TRIATHLON-BOS,
9-30 -- Catherine Jones and her 7-month-old son, Killian, often log
training miles together on her shorter runs. On Saturday, Jones,
35, will compete in the 20th edition of the Ironman race in Hawaii.
The event includes a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and
a 26.2-mile run. The biggest thing about the marathon is, it's
hot,'' she says. ``The pavement is black tar - it's hot.'' (Tom

LAND TRUSTS GROWING FASTEST IN ROCKIES AND SOUTHWEST, STUDY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGREEN, Colo. _ Land trusts, once restricted to genteel
corners of New England, are now growing the fastest in the Rockies
and the Southwest, according to a national survey of this land
conservation movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, as ranchers and urbanites grafted the land
trust movement onto the rural West, the number of local land trusts
jumped by 160 percent in the five-state Rockies division, 147
percent in the four-state Southwest division, and 108 percent in
the six-state West division. While New England still has the
largest number, 417, growth there was only 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drive past shopping malls and subdivisions, they fight
the traffic jams, and they are joining together as never before to
protect land for the future,'' said Jean Hocker, president of the
Land Trust Alliance, a nonprofit group that represents about
two-thirds of the nation's 1,200 local land trusts. The Alliance
conducted the national survey, which is to be released in
Washington on Thursday. Local land trusts, one of the nation's most
popular conservation movements, claim to have 1 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide in the last decade, these private conservation groups
permanently protected from development 2.7 million new acres, or an
area nearly the size of Connecticut. This represented a 135 percent
growth over the 1988 level.
</P>
<P>
   Land owned by land trusts nearly tripled, hitting 828,000 acres.
But the fastest growing segment was land protected by conservation
easements, which increased nearly fivefold, to 1,385,000 acres.
Here, landowners donate or sell to a land trust development rights
in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the overwhelming majority of new acres coming under
land trust protection is not owned by trusts, but protected by
easements. Montana, with 258,416 acres, now has the largest acreage
under conservation easement of any state.
</P>
<P>
   These private measures are part of a trend in which counties and
states have supplanted the federal government as leaders in
open-space conservation. Florida, for example, announced last week
that it has bought 1 million acres since 1990 as part of its
Preservation 2000 program. Florida is spending about $300 million a
year to buy land for conservation. In contrast, the National Park
Service is spending about $50 million a year nationwide for new
property, down from $300 million a year in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For land trusts, the boom can be seen most clearly in Colorado,
home to 29 of the 52 local land trusts in the Rockies. In five
years, the acreage protected by Colorado's trusts has nearly
tripled, to 130,000, said Katharine Roser, executive director of
the Colorado Coalition of Land Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado is one of the nation's fastest-growing states, and
there is a direct correlation between growth and growth of land
trusts,'' Ms. Roser said Wednesday. ``The pressure is on. People
are seeing our farmlands being gobbled up, our scenic views being
gobbled up. People see that land trusts are a way to do something
about it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pressure can be seen in Evergreen, a mountain suburb west of
Denver where fast-food restaurants and chain stores line a new
highway into an area renowned for its meadows and pine forests.
Since 1980, the population of Evergreen has doubled, to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development pressures are incredible,'' Kathlene Sutton,
executive director of the Mountain Area Land Trust, said Wednesday
from the group's new office here. Moving from battle to battle, the
trust first organized a $3.4 million campaign to save 408 acres of
elk-grazing land from a planned subdivision. Now it is negotiating
conservation easements with five landowners, totaling 2,600 acres,
and is negotiating to buy 6,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Evergreen voters are expected to back a ``Save Open
Space'' initiative that would allow Jefferson County to issue up to
$160 million in bonds to accelerate the buying of land for open
space.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the state also fosters local land trusts. Over the
last five years, Great Outdoors Colorado, a state entity financed
by casino taxes, has given $1.3 million to 14 local land trusts for
organization and planning.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that Colorado's neighbors are far slower to
develop land trusts. In contrast to Colorado's 29 local land
trusts, there are two in Wyoming, two in Kansas, four in Utah and
seven in New Mexico.

YANKEES NEWCOMER STRIKES EARLY BLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back when he was clubbing home runs in the minor
leagues but seemingly no one in the New York Yankees' front office
was paying attention, Shane Spencer dreamed of playing for another
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minor leagues, I thought if I was with another team I
might have a shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he got his shot with the Yankees this year and became a
late-blooming phenom. Spencer, a 26-year-old outfielder, batted
.421 with a team-leading eight homers and 21 runs batted in in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it worked out it seems like this year I was ready, and
I'm glad I stayed with the Yankees so I can say I made it with the
best organization ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The afterthought for most of his career earned his first
postseason start yesterday, playing left field in Game 2 of the
American League Division Series against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm just enjoying myself and having the time of my
life,'' he said. ``I couldn't have imagined making the postseason
roster, but I got a chance to play and opened some eyes, and here I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   The good times continued as Spencer hit a homer run off Rangers
starter Rick Helling in the second inning, staking the Yankees to a
1-0 lead and earning a curtain call from adoring New York fans.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was on the bench for Game 1 because Yankees manager Joe
Torre opted for the better defense of Chad Curtis. With Joe Girardi
replacing Jorge Posada behind the plate for Game 2, Torre needed
something else out of his left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having Posada in the lineup, you lose a little bit of a
bat there,'' Torre said. ``I was thinking more offensively in
putting Shane out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer certainly provided offense down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He bounced up and down between New York and Triple-A Columbus
for most of the season before coming up for good Aug. 31. The
right-handed hitter played mostly against left-handers until a
doubleheader at Cleveland on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   He went 3-for-4 with two solo homers in the first game, and
Torre decided to leave him in for the second game to see what he
could do against a right-hander. He went 2-for-3, earning more
playing time down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer hit three grand slams in the final 10 days of the
season, and had six homers and 15 RBI in the final week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong kid,'' Torre said. ``He's hit fastballs, he's
hit pitches other than fastballs, he's hit them to right field,
left field. He was in a pretty good groove there, and hopefully
there's still something left from that.''
</P>
<P>
   His first at-bat against Helling indicated that there was.

WHITE HOUSE TO INCREASE EFFORTS TO HELP FIGHT SOFTWARE PIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will announce Thursday a stepped-up
program intended to help combat software piracy worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which was applauded by industry executives
Wednesday, has two main elements. First, the White House will issue
an executive order that directs all federal agencies to insure that
the government and its contractors do not buy or use pirated
software. And the White House is also directing the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshevsky, to press foreign governments
to embark on similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making sure its own house is in order, this puts the United
States government in a stronger position to make the anti-piracy
message overseas,'' said Brad Smith, general counsel for
international affairs at Microsoft Corp., the largest software
company.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's software industry is thriving, having grown at
seven times the rate of the economy overall during the 1990s. But
software piracy is a growing concern for the industry, especially
as foreign nations close the gap with the United States in computer
use.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 27 percent of the software used in the United
States has been illegally copied, violating copyright laws,
estimates the Business Software Alliance, a trade group. In
countries like China and Russia, however, the piracy rates are
estimated at more than 90 percent. Even in nations like Taiwan and
Spain, the piracy rates are roughly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government announcement will show that the software industry
is raising its voice in Washington and it is being heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal from our perspective and having the White
House weigh in certainly strengthens the message the industry has
been making for some time,'' said Eric Schmidt, chairman of Novell
Inc., a networking software company in San Jose.

HEDGE FUND'S CREDITORS NAME INVESTMENT SUPERVISORY GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story, previously eliminated from NYT News Service
budget, is now restored.) 
(th) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six leading members of the bank consortium that
rescued the speculative hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management
from collapse last week have named a full-time committee to
supervise the fund's huge investment portfolio _ and promised to
keep trading information secret from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The six bankers, representing the consortium that has taken a 90
percent equity stake in Long-Term Capital, will have ultimate
control over the fund's investment strategy, capital structure,
credit and risk management and personnel, the consortium said late
Wednesday. They will work together with Long-Term Capital's
founding partner, John Meriwether, who remains as day-to-day
manager and part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York brokered the rescue of
Long-Term Capital, in which consortium members injected $3.6
billion in fresh capital into the troubled fund. The firms have
pledged to keep their investments in Long-Term Capital for up to
three years, seeking to trim its riskiest positions and,
eventually, to realize a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street banks and brokerage houses involved in the
bailout agreed to erect a so-called Chinese wall between the
operations of Long-Term Capital and their own trading desks. That
is because inside knowledge of the hedge fund's trading strategy _
in many markets Meriwether used bank loans to take dominant
positions _ could be used by consortium members to make
``front-run'' trades in advance of Long-Term Capital's moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has instructed members of the oversight committee
not to discuss the activities of Long-Term Capital with anyone at
their member firms,'' the consortium said in the statement. ``They
have also been instructed to base decisions on the best interests
of Long-Term Capital taken as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the banks have taken any other measures to
safeguard the independence of Long-Term Capital. But the six banks
on the oversight committee have each assigned one expert to work
full-time at Long-Term Capital's offices in Greenwich, Conn. The
banks relieved those six of ``substantially all'' their duties at
their parent firm.
</P>
<P>
   The six people chosen to supervise Long-Term Capital are: David
Rogers of Goldman, Sachs, Conrad Voldstad of Merrill Lynch, John
Fullerton of J.P. Morgan, Brian Leach of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, Richard Stuckey of Travelers Group and Michael Allen of
UBS.
</P>
<P>
   News of the oversight structure came as Long-Term Capital got
some relief from creditors. Some 20 banks that own a piece of a
$483 million credit line to the fund, led by Chase Manhattan Corp.,
agreed not to force Long-Term Capital into default over its failure
to pay margin calls on the loan, said bankers connected with the
bailout. The group also extended the terms of the loan by six
months, to May 1999. &QL;

SURVEY SHOWS BIG GROWTH IN FUNDS' POPULARITY IN '90S 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By REED ABELSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new report on hedge funds, the private investment funds aimed
at wealthy individuals and institutions, shows that they have
soared in popularity this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Cerulli Associates, a Boston consulting and
research firm, also highlights the growing interest in these funds
by institutional investors and offers some insight into the
characteristics of these highly secretive funds. The report is
expected to be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   While hard and fast numbers are impossible to come by, Cerulli
estimates that total assets under the hedge funds' management,
referred to as investors' capital, have increased roughly sixfold
since 1990 to some $300 billion at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not reflect borrowing by the funds, which
significantly increases the amount they can invest and the impact
that they have on markets. About half of the money invested is from
foreign investors, using off-shore funds. The number of funds has
more than doubled to roughly 4,500.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent debacle involving Long-Term Capital
Management, Cerulli believes investors will continue to clamor to
put their money in hedge funds and estimates that assets will
continue to climb by at least 15 percent annually over the next 5
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the industry is very alive and positioned for
growth,'' said Jeff Benjamin, a consultant with Cerulli who was the
lead author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Once the domain of wealthy investors, hedge funds are now
attracting pension funds, endowments, foundations and investment
managers who invest in a group of hedge funds. These institutions,
which accounted for only 5 percent of the hedge funds' assets five
years ago, now account for about 80 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of such big institutions should help push hedge
funds, which frequently refuse to let their investors know exactly
what they are doing, to disclose more about their strategies and
what they own.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of a data base of about 1,100 funds, Cerulli also
offers a glimpse into the makeup of these funds. While George Soros
and Julian H. Robertson Jr. get the lion's share of attention, most
of the funds are much smaller entities. About a quarter of them
have assets of less than $10 million, and only about 5 percent have
assets of more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They operate like little entrepreneurs, in one- to two-person
offices,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   While Cerulli did not examine the strategies of these funds in
any detail, the report does show that about 81 percent of the funds
use borrowings to leverage their returns.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin estimates that the majority of funds do not use the
level of leverage that Long-Term Capital employed, which is said to
be as high as 100 to 1, but typically keep their borrowings to less
than five times their assets. &QL;

TOASTY SLEEPING BAG IS MUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A word about sleeping bags: warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, catching 40 winks is all but impossible in the High
Sierra, where evening temperatures in the fall dip into the teens.
</P>
<P>
   You can be wearing every stitch of clothing you packed and still
wake up shivering hourly if your bag isn't rated to keep out the
cold. Imagine trekking out of the backcountry more tired than when
you went in.
</P>
<P>
   Ensure that won't happen by doing your homework beforehand.
Research the overnight lows and shoulder in a bag with enough fill
to ward off the chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to bring the right bag for the conditions, just like
you need the right tool for the job,'' said Rob Henderson, store
manager of Northridge's REI, an outdoor equipment retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Being caught without the right bag can have dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people who get into trouble in the high country, if
they are going to die of anything it's usually going to be of
exposure,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to stay warm and dry. Depending on the weather, the
top piece of equipment is a toss-up between a sleeping bag and a
tent. You can certainly stay warm by having the right bag and dry
by finding shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   But selecting the proper sleeping bag can be a confounding
process. Most are rated, or gauged for warmth, at three
temperatures in Fahrenheit _ +20, 0 and -20. Theoretically, a bag
rated +20 will keeps its occupant comfortable when the thermometer
reads 20 degrees. All bets are off if the mercury drops any farther
below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Henderson said the comfort level of that same +20 bag isn't
so cut and dried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people the +20 is more like a laboratory rating; it
was assessed in a controlled environment,'' he said. ``There are a
lot of variables in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people it will keep them warm at 20 degrees provided
a) you're dry, b) you're on an insulating sleeping pad and c)
you're not exposed to wind and frost.''
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, it may be best to hedge your bets by using
a 0-rated bag at higher altitudes. Then again, this isn't typically
the period when Californians do most of their outdoors recreating,
and buying a 0 bag may be a mistake for someone on a limited budget
since it likely will be too hot for summer backpacking. Sweat can
be worse than shivers. Having a 0 and a +20 bag to choose from is
ideal for just such a situation, but how fat is your wallet?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough time of year to recommend a bag because we are
in (a seasonal) transition,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   To help with decisions, here are the choices of backpacking
bags:
</P>
<P>
   __ +20: Most popular choice for the region, considered a
three-season bag (or more precisely 2{ seasons) for California _
spring, summer and early fall; $110-$200.
</P>
<P>
   __ 0: A four-season bag ... but not really, because it's not
designed for winter mountaineering and is too warm to use here in
summer and a lot of spring and fall; $160-$275.
</P>
<P>
   __ -20: Winter-mountaineering or expedition bag geared for
extended snow camping and extreme conditions at altitude; $200 to
more than $400.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Investigators were trying Wednesday to
get the lone survivor of a mass shooting in Kosovo out of Serbia to
testify about the killings at a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, about 35 years old, was among 14 ethnic Albanian
men who were ordered to lie face-down against a fence and were
systematically shot by one or more Serbs, said Western diplomats
who interviewed the man on Tuesday. His identity was kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The witness was shot in his left arm and leg and badly wounded,
but managed to survive by pretending to be dead, diplomats said the
man told them.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators from the International War Crimes Tribunal,
based in the Hague, Netherlands, were in Kosovo Wednesday to look
into the matter, one of two executions of ethnic Albanians that
witnesses said Serbian forces carried out in central Kosovo on
Saturday. The 13 men were killed in the village of Golubovac, while
18 members of an extended family were killed about four miles away
near Gornji Obrinje.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities Wednesday denied that their forces were
involved in the killing of the 18 women, children and elderly
people of the Deliaj clan near Gornji Obrinje. But the Serbian
authorities did not address the question of culpability for the 13
deaths in Golubovac that the survivor said he had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   The killings took place in an area where Serbian forces had been
shelling and burning villages in a campaign of intimidation against
ethnic Albanian civilians. Kosovo, once an autonomous province, is
fighting for independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Bozidar Filic, the Serbian police spokesman in Pristina,
the capital of Kosovo, said Wednesday that it was not possible that
Serbian police had shot the civilians in Gornji Obrinje. Police
units involved in ``breaking up terrorist bands'' in the area were
under the direct command of their superior officers who submitted
regular reports about their activities, he said. The officers, he
said, did not report any incidents involving the killing of women,
children or the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army did not issue any statements Wednesday,
although witnesses implicated them in the deaths of the Deliaj
family.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the official Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, which
usually reflects the position of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, said the reports of the killings of the Deliaj clan were
made by ``foreign media'' anxious to advance the calls for NATO
intervention in the conflict between the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have called on Milosevic in the last week to end
his tank and artillery operations against the separatist guerrillas
and attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians and their property or face
possible military action.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent move to comply with the NATO demands, the Serbian
government said on Monday that the offensive had ended and all was
quiet in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Two long convoys of Serbian police and Yugoslav troops were seen
by Western diplomatic monitors on the roads Wednesday, indicating
the offensive might be over. One was heading north to Pristina, the
other was heading out of Pristina farther north.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats and monitors remained unconvinced. It was
``too early to say'' whether the convoys on the move were merely
intended to make it ``look as though the troops were going back to
barracks,'' one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor told diplomats that 14 men between the ages of 18
and 35 from different villages in the area had been selected for a
firing line from a larger group of men. They were told to lie face
down on the ground against the fence of a house, the survivor said.
After shots were fired by what the survivor described as at least
one Serbian policeman but possibly more, one of the Albanian men
cried out that he was still alive. The man was immediately shot
dead, the survivor recounted.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were said to have been returned to their villages and
buried before diplomats arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the survivor, Western officials here said that the
killing of the 13 Albanians provided the best case for prosecution
at the war crimes tribunal, which has established jurisdiction over
the Kosovo conflict. Another witness, Adem Hoxhaj, said he saw the
shooting from nearby.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the most vivid description so far of the shooting
of the Deliaj clan came from a member of the family who said he saw
Serbian forces approach but did not see the actual slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the diplomats said the survivor was ``an important
witness'' and ``we are very concerned about getting him to the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to get the survivor to the Hague is developing
into a test case of how the tribunal can exercise jurisdiction in
Serbia, which is now the dominant part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government has refused to recognize the authority of
the tribunal and granted visas for only two investigators from the
Hague. One of the investigators was scheduled to talk to the
survivor Wednesday, a Western official said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, who are police detectives on loan to the
tribunal, have no power of extradition or mandate to decide how to
get the survivor who remains seriously wounded and needs medical
treatment, to the Hague. The investigators were discussing with the
Red Cross and Western diplomats how to proceed, the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, lashed out at the foreign
press Wednesday for some reports of the civilian killings that
mentioned the possibility that they were a reprisal for the
reported deaths of Serbian police officers killed recently when
their vehicle hit a land mine in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policemen are mentioned now, but only in the context of
speculation that Albanian civilians were killed in retaliation,''
Tanjug said. The news agency said seven police officers were killed
in the incident while other reports said five died. Mines in that
area, a former stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, are
believed to have been planted by the separatist fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Western monitors assessing the military situation in Kosovo said
there was significantly less shelling Wednesday. But shells were
fired at four villages east of Suva Reka Wednesday morning, an area
that had been sealed by the Serbs until Wednesday, monitors said.
Columns of smoke from burning buildings were easy to see a few
miles away Wednesday, and people who had fled their homes said
there were Serbian police around their village.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Vranici, men and women were returning to their homes
after an ordeal with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, they heard warning shots that an attack on
the village was under way, so they fled up the mountain in a
caravan of vehicles. On Monday morning, Serbian police invited them
to come back, saying they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   But when they agreed to return, the villagers said, police took
about 250 men, loaded them onto buses and took them away. The women
were bused away separately, they said. Many of the women were
returned to the village on Monday and others Wednesday. Late
Wednesday afternoon many of the men were returned as well. They
said about 50 of their number were still in Serbian custody.
</P>
<P>
   On their return Wednesday afternoon, the villagers found the
bodies of two ethnic Albanian men on the ground at the mosque of
Vranici. One of them, Hafir Elshani, had been shot in the chest and
his nose had been cut off. The other man, Milam Bugari, had been
shot at close range behind the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers found that many of the convoy of 250 or so cars
and tractors they had abandoned on Sunday had been set on fire or
vandalized and their belongings had been strewn on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Because Milosevic has been criticized by the West for allowing
about 50,000 Albanian refugees to live outdoors, the operation by
Serb police in Vranici seemed designed to create chaos and fear but
insure that those forced to flee their homes would not end up in
the forest.

BANKERS TRUST HAS EXPOSURE TO FUNDS BUT SEES NO LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid continuing concerns about the troubled world of
high-octane investment vehicles known as hedge funds, Bankers Trust
Corp. disclosed Wednesday that it had about $1 billion in exposure
to such funds.
</P>
<P>
   To allay fears that the bank may face serious losses from its
hedge fund plays, Bankers Trust said that about 99 percent of such
exposure was collateralized with cash or Treasury bills _ in other
words, that the bank was almost fully protected from any financial
problems at hedge funds with which it has an investment or trading
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's announcement was prompted by unfounded
speculation that the bank was facing big losses from positions
taken with Everest Capital, a Hamilton, Bermuda, hedge fund.
Bankers Trust has no relationship with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust is the second big bank in as many days to disclose
its hedge fund exposure, a move prompted by the forced bailout last
week of Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chase Manhattan Corp. said it had $3.2 billion in
hedge fund exposure, with about 72 percent of that amount backed by
cash and Treasury bills. Citicorp, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and other
large commercial and investment banks have yet to detail their
hedge fund exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said concern about banks' exposure to hedge funds,
largely unregulated investment pools for the wealthy that often
borrow large amounts of money to place complex financial bets, has
been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, analysts said, is that the potential damage
banks face from withering businesses like syndicated lending,
initial public offerings and securities underwriting may be far
more severe than downturns linked to hedge funds. The huge,
potentially destabilizing losses incurred at Long-Term Capital,
these analysts said, were an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think looking at hedge fund exposure is the wrong place to
look,'' said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   All bank stocks have been battered lately, but Bankers Trust has
fallen more sharply than most over the last year. It closed
Wednesday at $59, down about 3 percent for the day, and well below
its 52-week high of $136.4375, reached in April.
</P>
<P>
   While all investment and commercial banks are facing bleak
prospects because of weak markets and global economic turmoil,
Bankers Trust is more vulnerable than most because of its smaller
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Bankers Trust has been caught in a very
volatile market and they're not in a great position to deal with
it,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony. ``They
may have to scale back some of their capital markets activities.''

NBA SCHEDULES NEW TALKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the reality of canceling regular-season games a
month away, National Basketball Association players and owners have
decided to go back to the bargaining table for the first time in
nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed earlier this week to meet here next
Thursday. But league officials have said that the date was not soon
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bowled over to hear that we can't meet for almost nine
days while Rome is burning,'' Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik was
quoted as saying in The Philadelphia Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Granik was referring to a Monday meeting he attended with
Commissioner David Stern, Patrick Ewing, the players association
president, and Billy Hunter, the players association's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask him who lit the match,'' Hunter said
Wednesday. ``It was the first mutually agreeable date for both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of no progress except for an arbitration hearing,
the gamesmanship and propaganda on both sides appear ready to flow
freely. Before Granik's comments, Ewing earlier this week
criticized a proposal by the owners that was sent to the players
last week, calling it nothing more than the same offer delivered in
late May that did not address the players' main concern, the
ability to make as much money as possible during free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The league is weighing canceling more preseason games next week
after indefinitely postponing training camp and canceling the first
week of exhibition games. Both parties have admitted that the
chance of the season's starting by the scheduled opening date of
Nov. 3 is slim.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the stalled negotiations is the impending
outcome of the hearing. Sometime before Oct. 18, the arbitrator
John Feerick, the Fordham Law School dean, will rule whether $800
million in guaranteed contracts will be paid to players during the
leaguewide lockout, which is now 3 months old.
</P>
<P>
   League officials have accused the players of delaying bargaining
to wait for Feerick's ruling, which would give more leverage to the
players if they won.

JETS PREPARE FOR REVITALIZED DOLPHINS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The statistics and films tell a story of a
Miami Dolphins team that has renounced its dependence on the pass,
thriving as it has opted to run the ball instead of relying on the
arm of Dan Marino. Aaron Glenn has seen those statistics and
studied the films, and he is not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team knows, when you think of the Miami Dolphins, you
think of Dan Marino,'' Glenn said. ``His arm is the security
blanket you fall back on. If worse comes to worse, they're going to
go back to `Marino, you do what you do,' because he's had some
success against us. Hopefully, we can try to slow him down.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the Jets would view the Dolphins'
performance in their 3-0 start with skepticism. Marino has beaten
them seven straight times, throwing at least three touchdown passes
in four of the last six meetings. He has thrown for more yardage
and touchdown passes against the Jets than any other team, the 67
touchdown passes representing the highest total by any quarterback
against one opponent in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   But in their perfect start, the Dolphins have utilized a reborn
rushing attack led by Karim Abdul-Jabbar, who has already topped
100 yards twice behind an improved offensive line, and a stingy
defense which has surrendered only 22 points in 3 games. After
relying on Marino for almost every down of his 15-year career, the
Dolphins rank last in the AFC in offense and second to last in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't thrown because he hasn't been behind,'' Jets coach
Bill Parcells said. ``We know what he's capable of. His arm is
good. When he's 50, he'll be able to throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of style. Jimmy Johnson has brought in his own
style and I think it's a good judgment on his part. But I think
it's to Dan's advantage to play this way. It's easier for a
quarterback to be efficient when he has balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive ranking doesn't mean that much,'' Marino said.
``If you look at our games, we were ahead in all three in the
second half. We didn't have to throw it. So we didn't. We're not
concerned. We'll be effective whenever we want to be. When we have
thrown it, we've been able to move the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed with that assessment, stressing that it has been
an easy sell to the 37-year-old Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's got all the records,'' Johnson said. ``He doesn't need
records. Paramount in his mind is to win. I think it's only natural
that every player, if he throws the ball, wants to throw it. But
Dan wants to win the game, wants to get back to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three games, Marino has thrown the ball 24, 26 and
22 times, throwing three touchdown passes without an interception.
And the Jets' defensive line does not have a sack yet this year.
Those are numbers that Marino has savored before facing the Jets
before, but he insists that if he leaves the Meadowlands with
similar numbers but another victory, he'll be happy.

STRAWBERRY LEAVES TEAM TO HAVE TESTS ON COLON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry, the Yankees' designated hitter,
left the team Wednesday afternoon for further testing related to
pain in his lower abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said earlier in the week that he had been feeling
pains for about two months, but did not alert the Yankees'
physicians until the last few days, after his concern grew.
Strawberry had a CAT scan Wednesday, and Yankees Manager Joe Torre
said that based on what was found, further testing would be done;
Strawberry will have a colonoscopy Thursday and should know the
results of that test Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told a teammate that doctors believe he is suffering
from an infection, but want to rule out anything more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 35, met with Torre on Wednesday to tell him he would
not be available to play in Game 2 of the American League division
series on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry could rejoin the team in Texas Thursday, for Game 3,
although there is a chance, Torre acknowledged, that Strawberry,
who hit 24 homers this season, would not be able to play for the
remainder of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a secondary issue to Torre. ``We just want him to
be healthy,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was concerned, Torre said. ``He's tense,'' Torre
said. ``Especially because he's been feeling bad for five or six
weeks. You'd like to believe something is going to go away, but
when it doesn't, it affects everything else about you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strawberry's playing time had been reduced since Chili Davis
rejoined the team in mid-August, and Torre said he sensed something
was bothering Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was,'' Torre said. ``I didn't know if
his leg was bothering him, or what it was. Evidently, this has been
on his mind for a long time, and he was hoping it would go away by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I say, we're not really concerned about the baseball end of
it _ we'll make do. The more important thing is to solve and
resolve everything that can be attended to.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry spoke with several teammates Wednesday, including
Davis. ``The good thing is it's not supposed to be real bad,''
Davis said. ``Apparently, the doctor said it was smart of him to
come in. If it was anything really, really wrong, there would've
been a severe amount of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   What Strawberry has felt is discomfort. ``We don't want to think
it's anything that bad,'' Davis said. ``He's more than a teammate,
he's a good friend and I'm concerned about him.''

THE SLOW DANCE OF BAIL REVIEW FOR A GOTTI 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Each day a half-dozen men, some in nylon
track suits, others in pressed jeans, all in glaring white
sneakers, lounge on the shadeless steps of the U.S. District Court
here. They don't play cards. They don't read newspapers. They wait.
</P>
<P>
   Their role, it seems, is to welcome the dozens of people who are
offering their homes as collateral for the $10 million bail set for
John A. Gotti, also known as Junior.
</P>
<P>
   When the pledges arrive, in rented limousines or beat-up cars,
these self-styled courthouse ambassadors, whom defense lawyers
identify only as ``friends of young John,'' snap to attention. They
grab for car doors, offer vigorous handshakes and usher people up
the steps, extending the kind of hushed greetings that are heard
more often at hospital bedsides or funeral homes than in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   The friendly scene outside the courthouse, however, is a far cry
from what has been going on inside for nearly two weeks. There,
both sides are locked in an excruciatingly slow bail review that
the prosecution maintains is necessary but that some legal experts
think is intended to keep Gotti exactly where the government wants
him: behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   After all, defense lawyers have said, while prosecutors may have
described Gotti as the acting boss of the Gambino crime family, he
is not charged with anything as serious as murder, and murder
suspects are released on bail every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutors are doing everything they can to avoid having
to give him bail,'' said Murray Richman, a criminal lawyer who
represented Leonard Minuto Jr., who was indicted with Gotti in
January and pleaded guilty to gambling in March in exchange for an
18- to 24-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to intimidate those people who come forward to
help him,'' said Richman, who added that he had been involved in
similar bail negotiations. ``They say we're going to make you open
all your books. If we find any hint of wrongdoing, we will explore
the possibility of your involvement with the Gambino family, and if
we find any, we will prosecute you.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, of course, sees the proceedings much
differently. A spokesman for the U.S attorney's office said the
government was not trying to scuttle the bail process by
interviewing the property owners in detail about their finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all acting diligently and in good faith in accordance
with Judge Parker's order,'' said the spokesman, Herbert Hadad,
referring to the federal judge in charge of the trial, Barrington
Parker. Gerald Shargel and Bruce Cutler, Gotti's lead lawyers, both
declined to comment directly on the bail process.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution and the defense will meet again on Thursday over
Gotti's bail, as they have regularly since January, when he was
indicted on a variety of extortion, loan sharking, gambling and
racketeering charges. The government contends that Gotti has taken
over the family business from his imprisoned father, John J. Gotti,
who recently underwent surgery for throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Thursday's hearing are some properties the defense
has offered as collateral that the government, people knowledgeable
about the discussion say, wants to see rejected. They include the
biggest parcel, the $4 million mansion owned by Gotti's sister,
Victoria, and her husband, Carmine Agnello.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University
School of Law and an expert on legal ethics, said the government
was acting properly. He said prosecutors must investigate to ensure
that the property was being offered freely and that the money to
buy it was obtained legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's valid position is that the proceeds of crime
should not be used for bail,'' Gillers said, adding that asking
homeowners to provide financial records was not a burden.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti had initially been denied bail for months, with the court
accepting the prosecution's arguments that, as the reputed acting
head of the Gambino crime family, he was a threat to the community.
Two weeks ago, his lawyers proposed a set of restrictions on his
release that convinced the judge that Gotti could be given bail.
</P>
<P>
   If he is released, he would be placed under house arrest and
electronic monitoring and his telephone conversations would be
recorded by the government. He would not be allowed to visit his
lawyers' offices, a guard would be posted outside his door 24 hours
a day, and visiting friends would have to meet in only one room of
the house, where conversations would be monitored by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The bail proceedings are just another chapter in a case that
could have taken a page out of ``The Godfather'': hushed meetings
in social clubs, a son said to be taking over the family business.
And now an ailing father.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene outside the courthouse, conspicuous in this
Westchester suburb, has been more like the comedy ``Married to the
Mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest, as if foreseeing his fate, the younger Gotti
alluded to his ``friends'' and their future predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surrounded by 12 guys, and one is more incompetent than
the other,'' he said in a telephone conversation taped by the
government and transcribed in legal papers. ``What are you guys
going to do when I go to jail? Who's going to feed you? Who's going
to feed your families?''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, they have apparently answered his
question.

THE ANGST OF `ANTZ'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Rich Irwin) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One way to distinguish DreamWorks' new
computer-animated insect movie, ``Antz,'' from Disney's upcoming
``A Bug's Life'' comes during an early scene where a worker ant
reclines on his psychiatrist's couch and complains about being the
middle child in a family of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get much attention, you know,'' the ant, aptly named
Z, grumbles. Later he adds, ``All I really want to do is get in
touch with my inner maggot.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it's Woody Allen, in all his neurotic glory, who
is providing the voice of Z tells you all you need to know about
the spirit of this subversive animated offering. Kids will dig the
eye-popping visuals, but ``Antz'' has a decidedly adult sensibility
with its themes of class struggle, modern romance and
post-traumatic stress syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at its heart, the movie pits Z's socialist leanings
against the fascist leadership of the ant colony. As a comedy,
``Antz'' leans closer to Karl Marx than Groucho.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise then, that when we meet ``Antz''
co-directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, Darnell introduces
himself by saying, ``I'm the communist. Tim's the one bent on world
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the opening line. These guys are brimming with
off-the-wall jokes, probably because they've finally finished their
movie and have a chance to relax. ``Antz'' is the culmination of
years of hard work by Johnson, Darnell and hundreds of other people
at Pacific Data Images (PDI), the Palo Alto-based production
company that has partnered with DreamWorks to create
computer-animated fare. Whereas Pixar (makers of the 1995 smash
``Toy Story'') took four years to make ``A Bug's Life,'' PDI
delivered ``Antz'' in two years and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a little push at the end to have it ready
by October,'' says PDI president and founder Carl Rosendahl.
``There were a lot of unknowns when we started because this was our
first movie. But we were able to deliver it ahead of schedule, and
I think they were pretty happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. The early finish allowed DreamWorks to
release ``Antz'' nearly eight weeks ahead of ``A Bug's Life,''
giving the studio a potentially potent one-two punch with its other
anticipated animated film, the biblical epic ``Prince of Egypt,''
due out Dec. 18. The advanced release also helps ``Antz'' avoid
bumping heads with potential mammoth hits like the ``Babe'' sequel,
``Babe: Pig in the City,'' and the ``Rugrats'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (DreamWorks) had no choice,'' says a studio distribution
executive. ``If they came out after `Bug's,' they would have been
dead in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. But beating Disney out of the gate has bigger
ramifications for the studio than just the bottom line. DreamWorks
executive Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney four years ago when
chairman Michael Eisner wouldn't make him president. Katzenberg was
one of the primary forces behind Disney's resurgence in animation,
and some at the Mouse House privately say that Katzenberg took the
idea for ``Antz'' with him to DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the issue is a pitch meeting on Aug. 25, 1994, with
Pixar's director John Lasseter. Katzenberg was still on the Disney
lot but wasn't at the meeting. However, Disney sources say he was
told of the pitch. Katzenberg denies this. A year later, DreamWorks
executive Nina Jacobson came to Katzenberg and proposed the insect
movie. It was green-lighted quickly and rushed into development.
</P>
<P>
   Such synchronicity isn't a new development in Hollywood. In the
past couple of years, rival studios have given us two volcano
movies, two end-of-the-world asteroid films, two Steve Prefontaine
movies. Before that, competing Wyatt Earp and Robin Hood projects
dueled to the wire. In a pipeline full of remakes and movies based
on TV series, originality often proves to be the exception, rather
than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Darnell, it turns out, had been toying with their
own animated bugs movie, titled ``Lights Out,'' when they learned
of Jacobson's idea. It was a natural marriage then for PDI (known
mostly for its effects work and for turning Homer Simpson into a
3-D character in the 1995 Halloween episode of ``The Simpsons) and
DreamWorks to join forces and meet the beetles, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   As for allegations that Katzenberg and PDI made off with Pixar's
concept, Darnell laughs and says, ``It would have been ridiculous
for us to have attacked an idea just because somebody else was
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Johnson: ``Look at it this way. You had our concept,
`Lights Out,' which we were pitching to studios back in 1991. Since
then, we've had `Joe's Apartment,' `James and the Giant Peach' and
`Starship Troopers.' There's just something about insects that
lends itself to computer animation. It's a medium that likes
hairless, naked creatures because they're easier to realistically
depict.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, ``Antz'' pushes the level of such animation to an
even higher level with jaw-dropping crowd scenes that humorously
depict life inside an ant colony. There are more than 500 of these
kinds of shots, ranging in size from a handful of ants to more than
60,000. What makes the work remarkable is that every ant in the
crowd is doing something interesting, moving at a different angle
or in a unique fashion _ marching, fighting, dancing _ so that
anywhere you look on the screen, you can enjoy the view.
</P>
<P>
   PDI ratcheted up the computers' ability to provide characters'
facial expressions, too, going beyond the typical happy-sad-angry
palette to give animators some 300 different options for their
invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like a blessing and a curse mixed together,''
Johnson says. ``We had 300 controls. There was no emotion or hint
of thought or feeling that we couldn't pull off. If you gave
someone with a marionette that many options, they'd probably go
insane. But in the end, I think it provides some of the best
moments of our movie, where the audience can really get into the
head and soul of the characters and imagine that they're human
beings instead of animated ants.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with being an animated ant.
Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Danny
Glover didn't think so; neither did Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney,
Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin and Christopher Walken. Katzenberg was
the primary force in attracting the all-star cast and has worked
similar magic for ``Prince of Egypt.'' (Michelle Pfeiffer, Val
Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes are among the participants in that movie.)
</P>
<P>
   `` `Antz' was written with Woody in mind,'' Darnell says.
``Jeffrey kind of buttered him up and got him interested. Once he
signed on, the movie was very attractive to other talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Johnson: ``Z is the kind of ant who looks around and says,
`This is not for me.' He's uncomfortable with everything in the
overly regimented world of the colony and, of course, Woody Allen
does uncomfortable really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, Allen will be plenty comfortable with the finished
product. ``Antz'' is his funniest movie in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recorded him in a studio off Broadway,'' says Darnell,
``and I remember thinking of all the other people paying 80 bucks a
pop for a theater ticket and here we were with the best show in
town.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when the workers control the means of
production. Beautiful, isn't it?

BOSSES IN A BOX

 CRAWFORD SPURNS `OUTLAW'

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has George Steinbrenner III mellowed? A look at the
guests in the Boss' box at Yankee Stadium for the first game of the
American League playoffs on Tuesday suggested that he has learned
to forgive and maybe even forget.
</P>
<P>
   There with Steinbrenner was John McMullen, owner of the New
Jersey Devils. He is also a former owner of the Houston Astros and
a former limited partner in the Yankees who was not afraid to let
his frustration show. In 1979, he declared, ``There's nothing more
limited than a limited partner in the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's current limited partners remembered that line on
Tuesday, for the Boss had them moved to another box to make room
for McMullen and Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp.; Allen
Neuharth, former chairman of Gannett Co.; the actor Kevin Costner;
Wellington Mara, owner of the New York Giants, and Phil Rizzuto, a
star shortstop for the Yankees in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   As if Yankee officials did not have enough on their minds
already, the Yankees' general manager, Brian Cashman, was quoted as
saying that President Clinton should step down because of the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should resign,'' Cashman told Bloomberg News. ``I don't
think it's right for people to sit around lying to people. I don't
like people who go around messing around with interns. It's just
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman did not return a call seeking additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Sanitation Chief Reviews Options
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, John Doherty is not va-va-vooming off to
California on a motorcycle, as some workers in the Sanitation
Department had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, who spent his last day as commissioner Wednesday
officiating at a ceremony for 142 new sanitation workers and 73
uniformed managers, ``probably will'' buy a motorcycle, he said. He
recently took a three-day course and got his license, he said. It
was a refresher course, for Doherty had a motorcycle when he was
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, who spent 38 years in the Sanitation Department, said
he had not started job hunting and did not know whether he wanted
something in waste management.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a lot of people think,'' he said, ``but there are
lots of other things out there.'' His successor has not been named.
</P>
<P>
   No Pose
</P>
<P>
   More on motorcycles: Cindy Crawford will not be posing for
Outlaw Biker magazine any time soon. Its editor, Casey Exton,
bought a freelance photographer's shot of her, fully clothed, on a
motorcycle. Then Exton wondered whether Miss Crawford, who is
pictured without clothes in the September issue of Playboy, would
pose for Outlaw Biker without clothes but with motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. ``A spokesperson for Cindy Crawford told me that
she doesn't want to do a layout for Outlaw Biker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Please
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geraldine Ferraro has been given a part in Cole
Porter's ``Jubilee'' at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 10. Four lines, no
singing.
</P>
<P>
   But what she wants to do is play the piano. Why? Her mother
always wanted to be able to say she had a daughter who played at
Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro took piano lessons from age 7 until she graduated from
high school. ``I was pretty good,'' she said. ``I played
Beethoven's `Pathetique' and Gershwin. Then I went to college and
did not play. Now I sit with my grandson on my lap and play `Old
MacDonald Had a Farm' and the songs he sings.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not seeking to play in the show, a benefit for the Gay
Men's Health Crisis. A quick moment at the keyboard before or after
a rehearsal would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tap one of the keys,'' she said. ``That's sufficient.''

THE MOUSE: OLDER THAN YOU THINK, AND STILL GROWING

<TEXT>
<P>
   While many computer users think that the mouse was born when
Apple introduced the Macintosh computer in 1984, the mouse is
actually two decades older than that.
</P>
<P>
   What came to be called the mouse was developed in 1964 by
Douglas Engelbart, a professor working at the Stanford Research
Institute in Menlo Park, Calif. It was invented as a way to make it
easier to move the cursor around the screen of early computers, and
it proved to be a more efficient pointing device than the arrow
keys of a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   One person in the laboratory thought that the unit looked
something like a mouse, and the name stuck _ which still surprises
Engelbart more than 34 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The first mouse was a mechanical unit shaped like a small brick
with one button on top and two wheels underneath for detecting
vertical and horizontal motion. It was somewhat awkward to
maneuver, but when the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration tested the mouse in 1966 against several other
devices, like a light pen and a knee switch, the mouse was found to
be the superior technology (although NASA scientists worried that a
mouse might float away from the work surface in the weightless
environment of space).
</P>
<P>
   Flashing forward to the next decade, we arrive at Xerox's Palo
Alto Research Center. Here we find Engelbart's mouse being combined
with the first graphical user interface in a small computer. The
Alto, introduced in 1973, one of the first personal computers on
the market for general use, inspired both the Macintosh and Windows
operating systems. Xerox sold only a few Altos and ultimately
withdrew them from the market.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the wheels of the mouse had been replaced by a
single ball, like that in the modern mouse, and the unit had three
buttons. It was called a pointing device as well as a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse proved useful for many purposes. When reasonably
priced computer systems became available for businesses of all
sizes to do computer-aided design, the mouse proved to be an ideal
device for drawing and drafting. These systems enabled the user to
make designs and changes rapidly and efficiently. Air traffic
control systems (as well as the military) embraced the mouse and
its upside-down sibling, the trackball, which was developed in the
1950s as part of display and tracking systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bars and arcades found another use for the technology: video
games. With the advent of home computers, the mouse slowly started
to make itself at home on the desk. Users found it a convenient way
to move the cursor around the screen. Sales of mice went up, and
prices started to go down. Mouse Systems patented an
optical-electronic sensor system that eliminated the mechanical
sensors in the mouse and made them more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   When Apple made a big splash with the Macintosh in 1984, the Mac
operating system brought the mouse to everyone's attention. Other
operating systems with graphical user interfaces (like Commodore's
Amiga, Digital Research's GEM, IBM's Topview, Microsoft's Windows
1.0 and Visicorp's Vision), some even preceding the Mac, generated
a lot of interest, at least in the press, and all of them used
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the mouse has continued to change. Mouse System's PC
Mouse, introduced in 1986, uses lights bouncing off a reflective
mouse pad to detect motion and has no moving parts. Other
manufacturers, like Logitech, have come out with wireless mice, and
some vendors have tried different shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the mouse and the trackball continue to propagate and
evolve, well, like mice. In addition to the different shapes, there
has been a trend toward adding more functions and greater
reliability. Microsoft's Intellimouse wheel, for example, can be
used for additional scrolling control or as a third button for
commands, and Logitech's Trackman Marble, with optical sensors, is
less susceptible to grease and lint.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a mouse works with either the PC or Macintosh
platforms, but with the advent of the Universal Serial Bus on both
types of machines, mice that will work on both machines, but with
separate drivers, cannot be far away.
</P>
<P>
   And more mice will probably go wireless. Several manufacturers
are promising mice that use infrared signals (like a television
remote control) or radio-frequency signals (like a garage-door
opener). There is even the promise of cheaper mice that can move in
three dimensions for games.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse does require some attention. Most mice and trackballs
are based on the principle of ball rotation. With a mouse, the ball
picks up dust from the desktop and transfers the dirt to the
internal mechanism. That can make the cursor appear to jump or
skip. Trackballs suffer from the same problem _ peanut butter and
jelly on a hand can get into the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively painless and cheap to prevent or cure such
problems. Trackball users should wash their hands frequently and
keep things like cookie crumbs away. To keep a mouse clean, use a
clean mouse pad. There are different thicknesses and surface types;
all work well, but don't get one with a loose fabric finish because
lint will get into the mechanism. Buy a mouse cleaning kit from
your local computer store (less than $6) and clean the mouse every
other month _ or more often if the mouse is used a lot or used
under dirty conditions. And keep your work surface clean.

A McBRIDESMAID NO LONGER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shocked and amazed, UCLA safety Tod McBride
couldn't respond. It was two days after the Bruins' lackluster
performance against Houston, and defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti
needed a playmaker for his beleaguered secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tod, how'd you like to be my starting strong safety against
Miami?'' Aliotti said.
</P>
<P>
   McBride was stunned silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say anything, but I knew my prayers had been
answered,'' he said. ``This has all been about persevering. I just
told myself one day it would pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-year senior from Walnut, McBride spent his first two
seasons as a reserve receiver. In spring '97, he underwent surgery
to repair tears in both patella tendons. He returned six months
later and switched to defensive back, having lost the speed
necessary to play receiver.
</P>
<P>
   He began training camp '98 as one of three players competing for
Shaun Williams' vacant spot at free safety. A few weeks later he
became the backup strong safety _ a position ideal suited for his
hard-hitting style.
</P>
<P>
   In UCLA's post-Houston reorganization, All-American Larry Atkins
slid from strong safety to free safety, and McBride got the call.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great view. But the window won't stay open forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a nice talk with McBride and (reserve cornerback) Eric
Whitfield,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``I told them they've been
given an opportunity and they need to take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ How they stand: No unit save the defensive line has undergone
more change than the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Against Washington State, McBride and Atkins will start at the
safety spots, with Jason Stephens (free) and DuVal Hicks (strong)
playing in relief. Ryan Roques and Jason Bell will start at
cornerback, with Marqes Anderson and Whitfield in reserve.
Whitfield will play the nickel (fifth) defensive back in passing
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied, but we're getting better,'' Aliotti said.
``These changes won't be forever.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Review of the week: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris
is a film buff who wants to direct when his playing career ends. He
has agreed to review movies for the Daily News. This week: ``Urban
Legend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new horror film `Urban Legend' provided me with an
experience unlike anything I've had before: It marked the first
time I was actually embarrassed to be in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, this film makes Ed Wood's `Plan Nine From Outer
Space' look like `Citizen Kane.' Most of the problems derive from
Silvio Horta's ridiculous screenplay, and the performances are so
one-dimensional you find yourself relieved each time a character is
killed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're itching to see a scary movie, rent Alfred
Hitchcock's `Psycho,' turn out the lights, and watch it alone.
It'll do something `Urban Legend' couldn't. It'll scare you.'' Half
a pancake (out of four).

HARD TO ASSESS CARE IN JAILS, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW and DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As investigations expand into possible problems with
medical care in city jails, including several deaths, top New York
City health officials have acknowledged that they have had trouble
monitoring the jail system's shift to managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The health officials said that they were scrambling to set up a
better system for supervising medical treatment on Rikers Island,
and that they were demanding more medical services from the
contractor, St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, to keep it from
earning excessive profits on the three-year, $342 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials insist that the overall quality of care for
inmates remains high. But both the Manhattan district attorney's
office and the New York City Board of Correction are investigating
whether a deterioration in medical care contributed to the deaths
of several inmates this year. And some critics, including current
and former jail doctors, have contended that pressures to cut costs
have seriously eroded the level of service provided.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints began after the city shifted in January to the
managed care approach, which is now sweeping through the nation's
jail and prison systems much as it is in the world of private
health insurance. But city health officials acknowledge that the
transition to this money-saving system has been difficult, and that
regulators have not yet taken all the steps that were promised to
insure that cuts in costs did not compromise care.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the contract calls for the city's Health and
Hospitals Corp. to evaluate St. Barnabas quarterly on more than 30
quality measures. But regulators have not completed any of the
evaluations _ or assessed any penalties _ because of problems in
collecting and analyzing the data, Joseph R. Erazo, the
corporation's executive director for correctional health services,
said in interviews this week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Erazo said his office was improving those monitoring
systems and expanding independent reviews of patient complaints and
other standards of care. And in response to concerns that St.
Barnabas stands to reap large earnings, Erazo said the city was
requiring the hospital to reinvest some of that money by adding
more services and installing expensive medical equipment at Rikers.
He said the city expected to limit St. Barnabas' earnings to a rate
of 10 to 14 percent, or about $11 million to $16 million a year, on
the annual contract payments of $114 million.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the difficulties so far, Erazo said: ``You've got
to be a little bit reasonable. The transition phase is going to
cause great problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We're now in a phase where we're going to be
doing harder and harder reviews and harder and harder monitoring.''
He added, ``We're not going to be enriching any organization on
this contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials said that annual profit rates of 6
percent to 10 percent were the norm for companies providing managed
care in jails. And critics say the city should have been tougher in
monitoring St. Barnabas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to take the problems seriously and do the kind
of oversight we probably should have done in the beginning,'' said
David R. Jones, a former board member of the Health and Hospitals
Corp. who raised questions about the jail contract when the board
approved it late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very strongly that while prisoners are considered by
some the least among us, society has an obligation to provide
decent medical care,'' he added. ``We can't go back to the Middle
Ages, where people are allowed to literally rot in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Barnabas submitted the lowest bid of five institutions
considered for the jail contract. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration has cited the contract as a model for saving money
in public health operations, and it has hired St. Barnabas to
manage city-owned Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new contract, instead of paying each time an inmate is
taken to the hospital, the city provides an annual lump sum for
each inmate's care.
</P>
<P>
   The city's aim was to lower the number of times that inmates
were taken to city hospitals and encourage St. Barnabas to offer
more emergency and specialist care on Rikers Island itself.
</P>
<P>
   But since St. Barnabas took over, the number of trips by inmates
to city hospitals has dropped by 57 percent. Some city officials
and doctors contend that delays in going to hospitals could
endanger inmates and may have played a role in several deaths. St.
Barnabas, like other managed care operators that receive lump-sum
payments, can increase earnings by limiting service and keeping
costs as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In urging his board to approve the contract last year, Dr. Luis
R. Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corp., brushed
aside some of Jones' concerns about enforcement, saying, ``We will
be paying close attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erazo and other officials said this week that though the
creation of more than 30 measures for checking quality was an
important step, regulators occasionally ran into delays in getting
basic data from St. Barnabas and were still setting up systems to
verify the data.

   Most of the gauges are simple statistical checks, like whether
inmates with HIV received drug therapies. But some also involve
medical staffing levels and inmates' access to dentists and medical
specialists _ all issues on which St. Barnabas has been criticized.
The regulators can fine St. Barnabas up to $5,000 for each quarter
that it fails to meet one of the standards.
</P>
<P>
   But Erazo said that regulators did not have enough information
to do a formal evaluation in this year's first quarter, and that
his office was just getting close to completing one for the second
quarter, which ended June 30. As a result, he said, no penalties
have been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said that as managed care had spread into
jails and prisons in more than two dozen states, questions about
the quality of care and monitoring had been common. Profit levels
have also been controversial, especially in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally when you switch from a fee-for-service
environment to a managed-care environment you would get a savings
of 25 to 30 percent after the first year,'' said Leon M. Clements,
chief administrative officer of Correctional Managed Care, a
division of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston,
which also bid on the New York jail contracts.
</P>
<P>
   He and other executives said a frequent source of tension was
what share of that would go to the contractor as profit.
</P>
<P>
   Erazo confirmed that in the first six months of this year, St.
Barnabas spent about $7 million less on care in the jails than it
received from the hospitals corporation, a figure reported
Wednesday in The New York Observer. The Observer said that was
equivalent to a 14 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   But Erazo also said that St. Barnabas had already paid for extra
services that were not in the contract, including a $500,000 CAT
scan diagnostic device at Rikers and a $650,000 therapeutic drug
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be doing much more of that,'' he said. He added that
for all of 1998, St. Barnabas' income was likely to ``come in at a
level that's more conservative'' than earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that some of the scrutiny was prompted by
the recent death of one inmate from liver failure shortly after he
was given a drug that can strain the liver. Officials said earlier
this week that the Manhattan district attorney was examining that
death and three others as well as allegations that the medical
records of a handful of inmates were improperly altered.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokesman did not respond to a request for comment
Wednesday. But St. Barnabas officials have defended the quality of
their care.

D'AMATO MAKES ANOTHER SWING FOR VOTES AS `POTHOLE SENATOR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACEDON, N.Y. _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato continued his campaign to
win the hearts and votes of upstate New Yorkers on Wednesday,
visiting a string of storm-ravaged farms from Syracuse to Lake Erie
and pledging to play the role of the ``pothole senator'' by winning
federal disaster aid for the region.
</P>
<P>
   In his second swing across northern New York state in two weeks,
D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term, munched apples,
inspected wind-shorn trees and hail-pitted apples, wore an oversize
``Apple Country'' cap and touted his Senate votes to help farmers
on issues like maintaining dairy price supports.
</P>
<P>
   At fruit farms near Syracuse, Rochester and Niagara Falls,
D'Amato said he would try to add money to an agriculture
appropriations bill, which is expected to reach the Senate next
week, to help farmers hurt by a series of freak hail and wind
storms that swept through western and central New York this summer.
Farm groups have estimated that the storms caused $40 million in
damage, mainly to fruit growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a battle for our people, for the little guy,'' D'Amato
said at a stop at G and S Orchards in rural Macedon, 17 miles
southeast of Rochester. ``You know, they call me the pothole
senator. They do. They make fun. But let me tell you, the potholes
are real people.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as he sought to use the one-day trip to burnish his
record on agriculture in a solidly Republican region, D'Amato also
tried to take some swipes at his Democratic challenger, Rep.
Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, by complaining about people who think
that ``upstate New York is Westchester.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never pitted the interest of one region against the other
or denied support from one to help the other or looked at one with
indifference or disdain,'' D'Amato told reporters following the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Though D'Amato, who comes from Long Island, claimed that he was
not referring to Schumer in making those remarks, his recent stump
speeches and commercials have hammered at Schumer as a ``New York
City liberal'' who is oblivious to the needs of upstate residents
and believes that ``the West begins across the Hudson River.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who was observing the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur,
was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In focusing again on northern New York on Wednesday, D'Amato and
his advisers provided further evidence that they believe his
fortunes in a tight race will hinge on driving up voter turnout in
Republican-rich communities like Macedon, as well as on denting the
reputation of Schumer, who despite his own free-spending campaign
still seems to be an enigma to most voters here.
</P>
<P>
   Some local politicians said Wednesday that there may be good
reason for D'Amato to be concerned about upstate turnout in
November because voter discontent is running relatively low and
because the race for governor, typically a voter draw, is not
attracting much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows he's going to have a real tough time
downstate and feels in a close election that upstate can win it for
him,'' said Frank Guelli, a Democratic supervisor in Walworth, who
is supporting D'Amato. ``Unfortunately, there's not much of a
governor's race and that could affect turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also hints Wednesday that D'Amato's attacks on
Schumer may be wearing thin among some upstate residents. During
D'Amato's Macedon appearance, local reporters peppered the senator
with sharp questions about the negative tone of the campaign and
the potentially divisive nature of his upstate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Placed on the defensive at one point by a series of questions,
D'Amato testily challenged one television reporter to take a
critical look at Schumer, who has accused D'Amato of lying and of
being ``sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not engaged in any personal attacks,'' D'Amato said.
``But you won't run any of this. You'll slice it and dice it the
way you want it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the farmers who came out to meet D'Amato at G and S
Orchards said they thought his strategy was just right. ``There's a
mentality around here, and I have it as well, that New York City
ought to form its own country,'' said Brandon Furber, 36, a
third-generation farmer in Huron.

SLOW START DOESN'T WORRY HEBERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Even though the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are 1-5
in the exhibition season and have allowed 26 goals in their past
four games, goalie Guy Hebert insists it's not time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time to continue to be positive,'' he said. ``Everybody
is still excited. We didn't expect to come in and win every game.
I've played for a long time and I've never seen a team go 9-0 or
10-0 (in the exhibition season) and go on to win the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert says it's going to take time for the team to learn new
coach Craig Hartsburg's defensive system, which features at least
one defenseman remaining in front of the net at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are used to playing man-to-man, and in this system you
have to be very patient,'' he said. ``I think it will be effective,
but you're not going to learn it and perfect it in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert says the system is something completely new to him but
that he likes the idea that Hartsburg is very committed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited Craig is going to work with one system and keep
working on it,'' he said. ``(That he's) not going to change from
night to night and get guys more confused.''
</P>
<P>
   __ New view: Hartsburg wasn't thrilled after the Ducks gave up
four third-period goals in Monday's 5-3 loss to the Kings, but he
seemed to soften his stance on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of good things happened,'' he said. ``I'm not happy we
lost, but we are trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no lack of effort. Eventually, we will be a
good team. It could be days or a couple of weeks, but we will get
there. Maybe to some people it doesn't look like (we are
improving), but we see things.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the bubble: Pavel Trnka, a 22-year-old defenseman who
played well toward the end of last season, is not guaranteed a spot
on the team for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fighting for a position.... he needs to show us more,''
said Hartsburg, who added that Trnka missing a portion of camp
because of a contract dispute ``didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Another chance: Goalie Patrick Lalime, who has struggled in
his past two outings (12 goals allowed), will play one of the games
against Nashville _ either in Cincinnati on Friday or Milwaukee on
Saturday. Hebert will play the other game.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council on Wednesday scheduled an
emergency meeting for Thursday to condemn the massacres of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo that witnesses attributed to Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be no impunity for such an act of ethnic hatred,''
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said at a news conference
in Blackpool, England, where he was attending a conference of his
Labor Party. ``This was not an act of war. This was plain, cold
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which takes over the rotating presidency of the
Security Council on Thursday, called for the urgent special
session, which the United States backed.
</P>
<P>
   The Council, which last week demanded an immediate end to
attacks on civilians by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, is
expected to condemn President Slobodan Milosevic's forces in even
stronger terms than it did then, although the Council, with no
troops at its disposal, remains divided on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, however, completed planning Tuesday for possible air
strikes, Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson, said
Wednesday. He told reporters that the organization was proposing
sharply targeted military strikes on Serbian forces, not random
bombing, which would endanger civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO officials say military action could begin as soon as
next week, after Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports to the
Security Council on Yugoslav compliance with its demands. It is far
from clear that this link is essential, since the United States has
already stated that NATO has the authority now to strike the
Yugoslav forces attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But any ultimate action would depend on support from the Clinton
administration. A spokesman for the State Department, James Foley,
said Wednesday, ``Military action is a live and real prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain whether the administration, preoccupied by
the Lewinsky scandal and facing November elections, will determine
to strike at the Serbs. And even if it does, Milosevic appears so
defiant of world opinion that he might be willing to withstand an
air strike in order to crush the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, top foreign policy officials, including Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and
the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, plan to visit Capitol
Hill to brief senators on events in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Security Council resolution was passed under a
provision of the U.N. charter that makes it enforceable by military
means. But there is dissent on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France are very reluctant to condone the use of force
against Yugoslavia at this stage, and would argue that further
Security Council action is needed before it can be seen to be
condoning NATO action. In the Security Council, China could not
even be persuaded last week to join the warning to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations Wednesday, diplomats and officials reacted
with shock not only to the horrific killings of civilians _ women,
children and elderly men shot through the head, mutilated or burned
to death in their homes _ but also to the audacity that Milosevic
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have watched the Yugoslav leader flout world opinion
before through years of fighting in the Balkans, but not as boldly
as he has in recent weeks, as he continues his ruthless suppression
of the ethnic Albanians, a majority in the province where an ethnic
Albanian rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has been battling
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That rebellion, Annan said Wednesday, ``can never justify the
pattern of terror, including the burning of houses, looting,
killing of livestock and wanton killing that have been reported in
these last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such actions are totally unacceptable to the international
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was described as ``outraged'' by the descriptions of the
massacres published Wednesday since he had met only on Tuesday with
Yugoslavia's foreign minister and delivered a sharp message to him
after hearing reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports are particularly shocking to the secretary-general
in light of denials received from the foreign minister that such
actions were taking place,'' said Fred Eckhard, the
secretary-general's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that the massacres in
Kosovo underline the urgent need for human rights monitors in the
area. Last week, the Security Council made that one of its demands.
The European Union and other organizations have volunteered to
monitor Kosovo, but have been rebuffed by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Cook, the foreign secretary, said he had been in
touch with the War Crimes Tribunal for the Balkans in The Hague,
Netherlands, and had asked its prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada,
to investigate the massacres in recent days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cook also called a meeting in London on Friday of senior
officials from nations that call themselves the contact group on
the former Yugoslavia _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia and
the United States _ to discuss how to settle the problem
peacefully. In Washington, Albright spoke with her British
counterpart by telephone several times Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, did not rule out the
use of force under the existing Security Council resolution. On a
visit to Azerbaijan, Solana said NATO's reaction would be
determined by ``what happens on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of Milosevic should be judged by his deeds, not
by his words,'' he said. ``Too many words have not been complied
with by Milosevic.''

TV COMMERCIALS OFFER TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING ALL OVER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GREG FARRELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advertising may be at its best when it breaks conventional
rules, but at least one rule is sacred: Once a particular style of
television commercial becomes popular, it will quickly be overused
and then discarded. Good examples are the disappearance of the
shaky, hand-held camera technique of the late 1980s and the reduced
emphasis on computer-generated special effects, most popular in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The latest commercial form to catch fire, the ``mockumentary,''
may be on its way out, too, according to some creative directors.
</P>
<P>
   The mockumentary commercial is a spoof done in the style of a
documentary film. The best-known mockumentary campaign of recent
years is Wieden &AMP; Kennedy's work for ``Sports Center'' on ESPN, the
cable sports network owned by the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late 1995, each commercial in the campaign has
taken viewers behind the scenes, as it were, of the nightly
``Sports Center'' report. The spots range from the bizarre (Keith
Olbermann, a former anchor, ripping the guitar from the hands of a
meek folk singer and smashing it) to the sublime (the heavyweight
boxing champion Evander Holyfield running ESPN's day-care center,
feeding his charges a diet of raw eggs and telling them, ``Don't
forget your gloves'' as he hands each departing youngster a pair of
boxing gloves).
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN commercials use either people from the show or sports
stars and throw them into absurd situations. The campaign has
become such a cultural hit that star athletes ask to appear in the
commercials _ and ESPN does not pay them for doing the spots.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's popularity has naturally spawned imitators. Last
year, the agency behind one of the longest-running campaigns of the
decade turned to the mockumentary format to keep its work fresh.
</P>
<P>
   For the Energizer brand of batteries sold by the Ralston Purina
Co., TBWA Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group, introduced a
commercial that followed a group of ``bunny spotters'' as they
tried to find EB, the elusive pink bunny. The campaign also
detailed the fortunes of a high school track team that had adopted
the bunny as its mascot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of the mockumentary is to say, `This isn't a
commercial, this is real,''' said Chuck Bennett, creative director
at TBWA Chiat/Day in Playa del Rey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, it was a highly appropriate technique and
style,'' he added. ``It had a fresh, disarming quality. Now that
there's so many of them, it's a known execution and you go, `It's a
commercial.'''
</P>
<P>
   The mockumentary style has blossomed at Nike Inc. over the last
two years. The athletic-footwear giant sponsored one commercial
that showed a ``speed recovery'' meeting for athletes who run too
fast and another promoting golf etiquette on Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Another Nike campaign, for skateboarding, showed what would
happen if participants in other sports were treated the way
skateboarders often are. The deadpan scenes depicted runners and
tennis players being heckled, harassed or even arrested. Finally,
there's a campaign starring the ``fun police,'' National Basketball
Association players who arrest young players for never passing the
ball and chase referees who don't make the right calls.
</P>
<P>
   The skateboarding campaign, from Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners
in San Francisco, part of Omnicom, won the Grand Prix in June at
the International Advertising Festival in Cannes, France. But not
all judges of award shows applaud the popularity of the
mockumentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the lookout for something fresh,'' says Mike Shine, a
partner and creative director at Butler, Shine &AMP; Stern in
Sausalito, Calif., who was a judge of the One Show awards
competition in April, sponsored by the One Club for Art and Copy.
``I wanted to be inspired. And then I saw three mockumentaries in a
row from three different clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Shine blamed the success of the ESPN campaign for the flood of
mockumentaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens when something wins big and defines a new type of
execution,'' he said. ``Everybody has figured the formula out so
perfectly that you can't figure out whose brand it is until the
logo appears. If we're that sick of it, it won't be long before
consumers are sick of it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another judge at the One Show, Bill Heater, chairman of Heater
Advertising in Boston, estimated that six of 10 commercials he saw
there were mockumentaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lacks originality,'' he said, pointing to ``This Is Spinal
Tap,'' a 1984 mock documentary about a rock band on tour that has
become a cult favorite, and ``Waiting for Guffman,'' a 1997 film in
the same style, as sources of the imitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative people see those films and they're funny and
quirky,'' Heater said, ``and it becomes an advertising idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiple awards for commercials in the same style, said Arthur
Bijur, president at Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners, a unit of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi PLC in New York, usually prefigures ``the beginning of the
demise of that style.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Wieden &AMP; Kennedy work for ESPN made the mockumentary
format popular, Goodby, Silverstein has been an advocate of the
genre for years. Just as ``Spinal Tap'' was being released in 1984,
the agency, then known as Goodby, Berlin &AMP; Silverstein, produced a
small but memorable commercial for an annual film festival in Mill
Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intentionally stupid,'' says Jeff Goodby, co-creative
director. ``We wanted to know what would happen if a French film
crew came to cover it and everyone was incredibly knowledgeable
about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, local residents talk like film experts. The
butcher, for example, discussed the art of editing while cutting
meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're within 15 minutes of the demise of this,'' said
Alan Marcus, executive vice president and creative director at
Arnold Communications, a unit of Snyder Communications in Boston.
He recently completed three spots for Ocean Spray in mockumentary
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the permanent nature of advertising,'' he added. ``If you
do something or see something that's interesting, we love it so
much that we eventually kill it. We are so quick to jump on things,
and we're quick to move on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Judy Fearing, senior vice president for marketing at
ESPN in New York, said she was in no hurry to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is ``ecstatic'' about its campaign, Ms. Fearing said,
adding: ``What is important to ESPN is that we think of advertising
ideas that show that we appreciate and understand the sports scene.
As long as our executions deliver on that promise, and are unique
and fresh, we'll continue.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mockumentary is history for at least one agency. After
returning from judging the One Show, Shine of Butler, Shine forbade
any of the creative staff at his agency to use the format anymore.

YANKEES DEFEAT RANGERS, 3-1, TO TAKE 2 GAME LEAD IN DIVISIONAL
PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Joe Torre announced that Andy Pettitte would
start the second game of the American League Division Series, he
spoke confidently of Pettitte's pedigree as a big-game pitcher, of
how he was sure Pettitte would respond to the challenge, in spite
of a late-season slump.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's handling of Pettitte on Wednesday night revealed his
true fears. Whenever Texas hitters reached base in Game 2, the
phone rang in the Yankee bullpen and relievers scrambled to warm
up, preparing for the urgent call for help.
</P>
<P>
   But that call never came. Pettitte allowed just one run in seven
innings, striking out eight and walking none, and the Yankees beat
Texas, 3-1, before 57,360 at Yankee Stadium. Thus, the Yankees have
taken a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series that will resume Friday
night in Texas, where David Cone will try to finish the sweep,
against the Rangers' Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Shane Spencer, a late insertion into Wednesday
night's lineup, hammered a home run and Scott Brosius hit a two-run
shot for the Yankee offense. The bottom third of the Yankees'
lineup has accounted for all five runs in the first two games and
the Rangers, who led the league in hitting, have just 10 hits in
those game.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte often talks to himself on the mound, his catcher Joe
Girardi has said, issuing self-criticisms understood only by
Pettitte himself. On Wednesday night, however, Pettitte seemed only
to be communicating with Girardi's glove; see the glove, hit the
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Before each pitch, Pettitte stood at the top of the mound,
staring at the ground, a moment of mental preparation before
staring in for Girardi's sign. Girardi would signal, and like a
robot, Pettitte would draw his hands in front of him, completely
focused on Girardi's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Then he would throw: sinkers, cutters, curveballs. Pettitte had
a superb curveball, which he threw with great effort, his hand
cocking and then, as he released the pitch with an explosive turn
of his wrist, his whole body seemed to twist.
</P>
<P>
   The first three Texas batters grounded out, Pettitte needing
only eight pitches in the first inning, his confidence growing. The
Rangers went down in order in the second inning, the third, and on.
He retired the first 12 batters before allowing Texas' first hit.
</P>
<P>
   During 32 starts in the regular season, Pettitte never retired
more than 11 batters consecutively. He threw only 44 pitches in the
first four innings on Wednesday night, in direct contrast to the
efficiency of the Rangers' starter, Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Muhummad Ali invented the boxing style known as the Rope-A-Dope.
Lay back, take your opponent's best shots, let him tire himself out
_ and then pounce. The Yankee hitters have been playing rope-a-dope
against opposing starters all season, patiently taking pitches,
waiting out walks, reaching to foul off two-strike fastballs and
breaking balls. Then they pounce.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees performed rope-a-dope to perfection on Wednesday
night against Helling as they quickly wore down the Texas
right-hander. Helling averaged 16.2 pitches an inning during the
regular season, and yet in the first three innings on Wednesday
night, Helling needed 72 pitches; after four innings, he had thrown
91, an average of nearly 23 per inning.
</P>
<P>
   Helling kept trying to pump fastballs over the outside corner
and then spin curveballs low in the strike zone, and the Yankees
kept fouling them off _ 24 foul balls in the first three innings.
Derek Jeter struck out leading off the third inning, but only after
forcing Helling to throw 12 pitches in the at-bat and, incredibly,
after fouling off eight pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The pace was dangerous for the Rangers. Before the series, Texas
Manager Johnny Oates suggested that his starting pitchers had to
last deep into games for the Rangers to win. What he didn't say
directly was that the Rangers possess poor middle relief, and a
seven- or eight-inning outing by the Texas starter was tantamount.
But because Helling threw so many pitches early, the Rangers'
bullpen began working in the fourth inning; twice pitching the
Texas pitching coach Dick Bosman visited the mound seemingly to buy
time for Helling to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, threatening to outlast his alloted 15 minutes of fame,
put the Yankees on the scoreboard in the second inning, smashing a
thigh-high fastball over the left-center field wall, beyond the
399-foot sign. It was Spencer's eighth home run in 28 at-bats,
dating to the last days of the regular season. Spencer returned to
the dugout grinning broadly, but the fans would not let him sit
until he acknowledged their cheers once more. Spencer emerged with
a practiced and exulted wave.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fourth inning, Spencer skipped a hard
grounder through the middle. Brosius then launched Helling's 79th
pitch of the game beyond the fence in right field, a two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   After Brosius' home run, Girardi followed with a single,
continuing the rampage of the lower third of the Yankees' order.
That part was responsible for both runs in Game 1, and the Yankees'
first three runs in Game 2, going 6-for-6 in the first four innings
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, shutout in Game 1, scored their first run of the
series in the fifth inning. Juan Gonzalez pulled a grounder down
the third base line for a double, tagged up and moved to third on a
fly ball and scored on Ivan Rodriguez's line single.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza quickly began warming up in the Yankees' bullpen,
a strong indication that in spite of Torre's confident public
backing of Pettitte, he was prepared to pull Pettitte immediately,
rather than permit the left-hander margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte finished off the fifth by retiring Todd Zeile and
Mike Simms, and struck out three in the sixth inning.

   NEW YORK _ The shiny, cavernous spaces of Grand Central Terminal
on Wednesday resembled nothing so much as one of those dazzlingly
choreographed numbers in a '40s musical with a cast of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of hard-hatted workers hammered and painted and
measured and cleaned. An electric flatbed truck rolled by, its horn
honking rhythmically. Tour guides shouted to make themselves heard
over the whine of drills and saws. And all around, commuters,
playing the dual roles of audience and extras, wandered through,
gawking up at the twinkling stars in the jade green sky of the main
concourse ceiling, taking in the intoxicating smell of railing
polish and eventually tearing themselves away to board a train.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal's formal rededication ceremony _ featuring a speech
by the governor, a laser-light show and the premiere of a new work
for wind orchestra and train whistle _ would not take place until
Thursday morning. The ceremony will highlight features like the
restored ceiling, balconies full of restaurants, opened-up vistas,
new underground passages and walkways, and a monumental new east
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   But as the workers scrambled to complete the main phase of a
two-year, $200 million renovation of one of the world's grandest
public spaces, Wednesday was the real show, an impression
reinforced by the photographer in the hard-hat watching Jerry
Barbier lay down his disk grinder after slicing up a big piece of
the wall on the south side of the main hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry, you going to use that tool again?'' the photographer,
documenting the job for one of the construction contractors, asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, you want another shot?'' Barbier said before he duly
sliced into the stone again.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the opposite corner of the main concourse, tourists
posed for photos in front of the enormous brown cast-iron eagle
that had temporarily touched down in front of the entrance to Track
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just wonderful,'' said Betty Herrin, who was up from
South Carolina visiting relatives in Westchester. ``I've been
coming up here three or four times a year since 1991 and I never
thought it would look anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rella, a track worker for Metro-North railroad, stood
transfixed before the eagle, which will eventually adorn the Grand
Central Market on the Lexington Avenue side. ``I think it's
awesome,'' he said. ``It's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Boylan, a deputy executive director of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro-North's parent agency
and the owner of the terminal, swept by with several other
busy-looking men in suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wild tomorrow,'' he said. ``Don't quote me on
that. I mean, it's going to be wildly wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   For some workers, the mammoth renovation has been life-changing.
Barbara Stork, a commercial sculptor and self-described
``finishing-toucher,'' reckons she has become the world's leading
expert on the repair of Caenstone, a corrugated limestone
look-alike made of plaster, marble dust and fiberglass. Caenstone
comes in a thousand delicate shades of beige, tan and eggshell, is
as fragile as it is beautiful, and Grand Central is rife with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably done 7 or 8,000 patches,'' she said from atop a
scaffold. ``It's wonderful to have an opportunity to work this long
on something and really master it.''
</P>
<P>
   For other habitues of the station, though, the remodeling has
simply been one long disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward to when they open this all back up so
we can buy food,'' Matt Treasure, an engineer on Metro-North's
Harlem River Line, said as he gestured around the lower level,
where the Eclair Bakery, the Fannie Farmer chocolate shop and a
Dunkin' Donuts used to be and where a new food court is still
several months away. ``Two years now we haven't been able to buy a
sandwich in this place.''

AMBITIOUS VOICE OF A PUGNACIOUS WEEKLY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first glance, Russ Smith does not look as if he
belongs in the Chelsea offices of The New York Press, the
pugnacious, profane weekly newspaper that turned 10 years old this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The beige offices are ``very Lou Grant,'' Smith says, but they
have unmistakable Lou Reed overtones: the sound of a pounding
guitar drifts from somewhere, piles of books and papers litter the
floors, and young editors meet in well-worn concert T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, the newspaper's majority owner and its editor in
chief, wears a pinstriped Paul Stuart suit and shiny gold cuff
links. He could easily be a father who has come up from Wall Street
to take his bohemian daughter to lunch at a place she can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   But then Smith puts his feet up, lights a Merit and launches
into a lazy, obscenity-laced diatribe against the evils of the
establishment. He rails against excessive taxes, government
regulations and powerful media companies that are obsessed with
celebrity culture.
</P>
<P>
   He reminisces about when he was a ``20-year-old drug-taking
hippie,'' says he still supports the legalization of marijuana, and
describes proudly how the police showed up at the newspaper's last
raucous party. Then he talks glowingly about former President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith is an improbable set of walking contradictions, he is
the perfect embodiment of his free newspaper. Founded with the sole
objective of knocking The Village Voice off its alternative
pedestal, The New York Press has long sought to attract readers
mainly by infuriating them with its eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   Its columnists include Alexander Cockburn, a former Village
Voice writer with a pronounced Marxist viewpoint, and Christopher
Caldwell of The Weekly Standard, the conservative Washington
magazine. Its sex columnist recounts her bedroom encounters in
vivid, sometimes excruciating detail on one page while the next
page features a column on obscure historical facts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having plowed $3.7 million of his own money into the
paper, Smith also contributes a dyspeptic column called Mugger, in
which he has excoriated everyone from President Clinton to Tina
Brown to waiters at expensive restaurants near the Tribeca loft he
shares with his wife and two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our readers to turn to one column and say, `I just hate
this guy, and I'm never going to read him again,' and then turn to
another one and say, `Man, I love this!''' Smith says. ``I want
that kind of passion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a kind of passion he believes The Voice no longer
inspires. Growing up in Huntington, N.Y., the youngest of five sons
of a carwash owner, Smith fell in love with journalism reading The
Voice in the late 1960s, and he says he modeled his first weekly
newspapers, in Baltimore and Washington, after it. (He sold those
papers in 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   But now, he says, The Voice has become ossified, full of
``stuck-in-the-70s, left-wing stuff'' and pompous writing. ``What
about the 20-year-old who just wants to hear about the Smashing
Pumpkins' new album,'' he asked, ``and doesn't want a
four-paragraph discourse on Baudelaire or Thomas Carlyle?''
</P>
<P>
   (Donald H. Forst, the editor of The Voice, declined Wednesday to
debate Smith point by point, saying only: ``The man does foam at
the mouth.'')
</P>
<P>
   Smith deftly dodged every question about revenues, profits and
salaries, but he said his paper became profitable two years ago and
was slowly gaining ground on The Voice, which switched to free
distribution in Manhattan only in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, The Press expanded from tabloid size to include a
full-size front section that is wrapped around the tabloid. When it
started in 1988, Smith said, it had five full-time employees and
published 24 pages a week. It now employs 55 people, 10 of them on
the editorial side and the rest in sales and management, and its
most recent issue was 120 pages. Every Tuesday, it distributes
110,000 copies, a little less than half of The Voice's circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Its rivalry with The Voice provides a glimpse into what remains
of the great city newspaper wars of yesteryear. Far from trying to
scoop The Voice on news, The Press has avoided conventional
reporting, Smith said. Its boldest competitive move so far came
about six weeks ago, when Smith dispatched an editor and a cartoon
artist to sneak into a picnic for The Voice's staff and write about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath The Press' masthead, the paper bills itself modestly as
``New York's Free Weekly Newspaper,'' facts that are all true but
that make no grand promises about what is inside. And despite
Smith's criticisms of The Voice as moribund, he does not enumerate
any high journalistic goals for The Press, except that it remain
interesting and its opinions honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being free is very liberating,'' he said. ``We know why people
pick up our paper. It's for the listings. It's for the classifieds.
It's for the adult ads. It's for the astrology column. And for some
people, it's for the actual stories. Because of that, as
journalists, we can print anything we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not presumptuous enough to think that I can force The
Voice out of business,'' he said. ``I just want to be the No. 1
paper, and in many ways right now, I guess, we are still the No. 2
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and then added defiantly, ``Of course, in many ways I
think we're the No. 1 paper.''

DODGERS RESHUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone truly likes Glenn Hoffmann and his coaching staff. But he
wasn't going to put the future of the team in the hands of six guys
he met just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So with his attention still focused on getting Montreal manager
Felipe Alou, Malone announced the reassignment of Hoffman and his
coaches Wednesday, giving Hoffman a spot on the major-league staff
and the rest a place in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance the coaching staff of Joe Amalfitano, Mike
Scioscia, Mickey Hatcher, Charlie Hough and John Shelby could
remain in some form with the Dodgers in Los Angeles. But Malone
wants the new manager to play a critical role in forming the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the organization needed to make a change, create a
new direction,'' Malone said. ``I just needed my guy, to get a guy
who is a proven manager who I trust will be on the same page with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he hopes to have a new manager in place by the
annual organization meetings, which will be held Oct. 28-Nov. 1 at
the Dodgers spring-training base in Vero Beach, Fla. Actually, he
would like it well before then, but several candidates remain under
contract with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have contacted the Expos about Alou, who worked in
Montreal when Malone was general manager (1993-94). Alou, 63, has a
year left on his Expos contract, worth $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal president Claude Brochu said Monday he would not stand
in Alou's way of taking the Dodgers job, but so far has not granted
Malone permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos are expected to learn next Wednesday whether citizens
of Quebec will agree to fund a new stadium. If the measure fails,
which is likely, the club probably will be sold and leave Canada.
But since Alou is the most popular Expos figure since Gary Carter
in the early 1980s, Montreal does not want him to walk away just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have interest in Felipe because he is a friend and an
excellent baseball mind,'' Malone said. ``We have not gotten
permission to talk so everything is hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou would be a popular choice among the reassigned coaches. In
Montreal, Alou only has ties to first-base coach Luis Pujols.
Third-base coach Pete Mackanin and pitching coach Bobby Cuellar
were brought in by Expos general manager Jim Beattie. Mackanin has
indicated he would like to be considered for the manager's spot if
Alou leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he also is considering former New York Mets,
Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate is Kevin Kennedy, the Taft High product who
lives in Tarzana. Kennedy previously managed in Texas and Boston
and was a minor-league manager in the Dodgers organization for many
years. He worked in the Montreal farm system under Malone and is
now a baseball analyst for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who lives with his wife and five children in Anaheim
Hills, left Wednesday for a two-week family vacation and was
unavailable for comment. He was 47-41 after taking over for
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Because positions will not be assigned until a new manager is in
place, Hoffman's actual spot on the new staff is uncertain. At
Triple-A Albuquerque, where he was manager before taking over June
22 from fired Bill Russell, Hoffman also was the third-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   Amalfitano has been the Dodgers third-base coach the past 16
years and Malone and Alou are fans.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, Hoffman's bench coach, was the longtime Dodgers
catcher who also played with Texas and San Diego at the end of his
career. He was a candidate last year for the manager's job with the
expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Hough and Hatcher were promoted from Class-A San Bernardino a
week after Hoffman was named manager.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hough was offered the pitching coach's job but
declined because of personal differences with Russell, his longtime
teammate. In June, he replaced Goose Gregson and got high marks
from most of the pitchers. Hoffman said players responded to
Hough's low-key approach and respected his 25 years as a
major-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby, the center fielder on the Dodgers' 1988 World Series
championship team, made an unexpected rise to the major-league
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two seasons, Shelby was demoted as manager at
Double-A San Antonio and manager for Class-A Savannah, Ga. The
Dodgers eliminated the Savannah club and sent Shelby to coach at
Class-A Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Dodgers' September minor-league callups said
Shelby was the best manager in the organization. He also was the
only African-American coach in the Dodgers farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't fired anyone,'' Malone said. ``Most organizations
would have fired the coaching staff. There is a lot of talent there
and I still want to use it.''

   With civic ceremonies and a new musical, yet another old movie
palace spared from dusty death by wrecker's ball begins a new life
Friday in Cleveland. There, the 77-year-old Allen Theater, restored
at a cost of $15 million, will become the last of four contiguous
vaudeville and movie theaters to be renewed in the historic
Playhouse Square Center. The completion of the 2,500-seat Allen
makes the 9,500-seat complex the largest performing arts center in
the United States except for Lincoln Center, and the world's
largest finished theater restoration project, Playhouse Square
Center says.
</P>
<P>
   The Allen, intended primarily for touring Broadway musicals, is
expected to draw 300,000 patrons and inject $30 million a year into
the local economy. A weekend-long celebration begins with a
ribbon-cutting and marquee-unveiling by Mayor Michael White and
other dignitaries. On Tuesday the curtain goes up on the national
premiere of the touring biographical musical ``Jolson.''

ON BASEBALL: PETTITTE'S FATHER TURNS DEAF EAR TO THE CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Pettitte punched the clock at 6 p.m. to work a
12-hour shift at Lubrizol Chemical Plant in Deer Park, Texas,
Wednesday night, about two hours before his son, Andy, threw his
first pitch to Mark McLemore. The elder Pettitte did not request
the night off to travel to the Bronx, he did not have access to a
radio, and there is no television at the plant. That is the way the
father wanted it. No baseball. No problems.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, this sounded bizarre. How could a father not want to
see his son pitch the second game of the American League division
series? How could he miss being inside Yankee Stadium with the son
who first flipped a baseball to him 18 years ago? How could he
concentrate on mixing additives for motor oil when his son was on
baseball's grandest stage?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pettitte insisted that it was easy to ignore. Any father
would understand, he contended. The thrill of watching his
26-year-old son pitch for the Yankees is bathed in bitterness. He
bristles over every negative word about Andy, so he stopped placing
himself where he could see the criticism. Tom went to the plant and
his wife, Joann, went to church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun listening to people beat up on your kid,'' Tom
Pettitte said. ``I have always been more critical of Andy than any
New York fan or New York media, but he's my kid. I can do that. To
hear other people ripping your kid hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a trying and perplexing season for Pettitte, who
went 16-11 with a 4.24 ERA and was considered disappointing. That
bothers his father. Still, Pettitte made $3.75 million this season,
and part of the responsibility of a major leaguer is to handle the
criticism. But listening to a father lament how painful it is to
watch a game that should be enjoyable made me think about
Pettitte's situation again. Was too much expected of him because he
won more games than any other American Leaguer in 1996 and 1997?
Maybe. But Pettitte set a lofty standard. Now he is judged by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he's making $100 million a year, it still
hurts,'' his father said. ``When you go to the playground and
someone knocks your kid over, you don't like it. It's always going
to hurt. Ask any parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Tom Pettitte being too dramatic and too sensitive? Probably.
Andy Pettitte has been criticized this season, but some of it has
been deserved and he is not a pariah. But a father hears things
differently, and a father knows more than any fan or reporter. The
folks who litter the radio talk shows with anger look at ERA. Tom
Pettitte remembers ICU and Andy's son, Jared, who struggled after
he was born last May 28. Try pitching through that, is what Tom
Pettitte wanted to scream.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a nurse is running to the ICU with your grandson because
he can't breathe and he's blue from his neck up and your son is
crying and running behind them and you're running behind him, well,
a lot of things happened with Andy,'' Tom Pettitte said. ``I'm not
making excuses. It's been frustrating because we haven't been able
to figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tom Pettitte does not watch the games live, he tapes
them and studies them. He has spoken to his son and to Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankee pitching coach, about what might have gone
awry as Andy, a left-hander, went 3-5 with a 6.14 ERA in August and
September. They dismissed the notion of tipping off pitches,
although Tom said he knows when Andy uncorks one specific pitch.
They acknowledged that Andy, who has been plunked with three batted
balls, sometimes flinches on the mound and that can hurt his
pitches. They discounted the theory that his pitches had lost
velocity. But they admitted that Andy longs to be perfect. It
seemed as if he did not know how to react when he was imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's satisfied unless he pitches a perfect
game,'' Yankee Manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pettitte has witnessed that intensity since Andy was 5 years
old and wept for hours after losing a peewee football game. Tom
indicated that Andy put extra pressure on himself this season
because he had received his first major contract and because there
was uncertainty about David Cone's surgically repaired right
shoulder. Perhaps Pettitte, thinking he had to be an ace, tried to
be better than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's one of my flaws, but it's the way I've pitched my
whole career,'' Andy Pettitte said. ``It's something I deal with
and try not to get down on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tom's co-workers badgered him for not being at the stadium
Wednesday night, he occasionally called family members for an
update. That was as close as he planned to get to his son's game
and, actually, as close as he expected to get to the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we make it to the World Series, I don't think I'm
going,'' Tom Pettitte said. ``I just don't want to be around it. I
don't want to go through it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The father should purchase earplugs and change his mind. Any
father will tell him how precious these moments are.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drawing notice in Greenwich Village's Washington
Square Park is no easy feat, but as Timothy Levitch ambled through
it Monday afternoon, eyes turned, brows furrowed and one or two
jaws summarily dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was his outfit, distinguished by burgundy velvet
pants that billowed like a skirt, and a gargantuan,
rhinestone-spangled hat that looked like a souvenir from Alice's
sojourn in Wonderland. More likely it was his oration, the
effervescent likes of which are seldom heard on either side of the
looking glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigeons!'' Levitch exulted, as if the winged scavengers on the
path before him were uncommon finds. ``Pigeons are what many New
Yorkers become in the next incarnation. They are trying to teach us
something. I don't know what.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing a dog run, he fondly pronounced it a ``community of
saliva'' inhabited by ``emissaries of drool.'' Levitch was treating
a reporter to his personal take on the wondrous island of
Manhattan, cradle to so many eccentrics like him. But his
exuberantly articulated vision was more than just another oddball
perspective; it was the warped window through which thousands of
visitors over the last seven years have first glimpsed New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch, 28, may well be the most unorthodox, unusual tour guide
the city has ever spawned, a distinction confirmed by the upcoming
release of a feature-length documentary that focuses exclusively on
him and principally on his long stint as an employee atop
double-decker buses.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, ``The Cruise,'' is scheduled to open on Oct. 23 at
the Angelika Film Center in the Village. For a documentary to get a
commercial theatrical release is atypical _ an immediate badge of
success _ but ``The Cruise'' has also attracted sizable audiences
and garnered extremely positive reviews at the screenings and film
festivals where it has been shown in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   And it has already begun to turn Levitch into something of a
demi-celebrity and cult figure _ for the next 15 minutes, at least
_ with friends in the movie industry, a literary agent and a
budding business in privately arranged walking tours. He quit the
double-decker scene a year ago but still takes small groups around
Manhattan on foot.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they can find him. He has not had a permanent
residence since 1992, relying instead on the hospitality of friends
to support a mode of living he refers to as ``couch surfing.'' It
prompts him to evaluate new acquaintances in idiosyncratic ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a great couch,'' he said approvingly of the actress
Natasha Lyonne, the 19-year-old star of the recently released movie
``Slums of Beverly Hills.'' She saw ``The Cruise'' at an advance
screening and befriended Levitch.
</P>
<P>
   For one busload of tittering tourists in the movie, he warbles
an unsteady version of the pop standard ``But Not for Me'' as a
build-up to pointing out where the song's composer, George
Gershwin, once lived.
</P>
<P>
   And he frequently grows philosophical, as when he surveys the
pricey boutiques lining Madison Avenue and tells another group of
tourists, ``This is ludicrousness and this cannot last.'' Then,
without missing a beat, he adds, ``The new Ann Taylor store is on
the right.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is done in a nasal voice somewhat like that of the
exercise guru Richard Simmons and with an eclectic, tattered
wardrobe that's more thrift-store accident than grunge chic. As for
grooming, well, it's hard to keep up when, every once in a while,
you bed down on a bench in front of Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The one time that Levitch's supervisor at Gray Line tours
reprimanded him, it was for his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his hairbrush had made contact with his hair, it had to be
by metaphysics,'' the supervisor, Lee Gelber, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Gelber said that Levitch drew many more raves than
complaints from customers, who often heard about Levitch from other
tourists and made a point of getting on a bus with him. Gelber said
that drivers would also ask for Levitch, because it usually meant
bigger tips.
</P>
<P>
   But not from everyone. Levitch recalled a man from Oklahoma who
insisted that Levitch had spoken a gibberish unrelated to English
and demanded his money back. ``There was an infinity of
reactions,'' Levitch said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Levitch grew up in a middle-class Jewish family of five in
Riverdale, the Bronx, and attended Horace Mann, a respected private
school. He said his fanciful, flamboyant musings emerged in
adolescence as a response to his status as ``a wallflower in the
darkened corners of the cafeteria, acne-infested.'' His
subsequently manic demeanor earned him a nickname, Speed, which he
still goes by.
</P>
<P>
   While his older brother headed to Yale University and a State
Department job, Levitch sought a more bohemian milieu as a
dramatic-writing major at New York University, from which he
graduated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, he perused the Michelin guide to New York, aced the
exam to get a license as a tour guide and went to work for Big
Apple tours.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch moved in 1994 to Gray Line for a pay raise to $9 an hour
from $7. Around the same time, Bennett Miller, an aspiring
filmmaker whose younger brother had gone to Horace Mann with
Levitch, caught up with Levitch at a party. The idea for a
documentary was born.
</P>
<P>
   And Levitch found yet another occasional sleepover host. ``If
you invite him to stay at your place,'' Miller cautioned, ``you'll
probably notice a missing shirt or belt the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitch seems to have perfected the rare art of voluntary
homelessness, his attempt to remain unencumbered by rent or other
domestic responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves some items of clothing at a variety of friends'
apartments and carries others, along with toiletries and
spiral-ring journals, in a small suitcase with wheels that he often
stows for the day with bellhops at any of a variety of hotels that
simply assume he is staying there.
</P>
<P>
   But Levitch is not without troubles. As ``The Cruise'' vaguely
signals, he was arrested in 1996 and spent several days in jail.
Levitch would not discuss the incident, saying he was abiding by
the wishes of the movie's makers, but criminal records show that he
was charged with assault for violently shoving a female friend who
did not share his interest in a romantic relationship. Levitch
pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree harassment and
was sentenced to 10 days of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Gelber said the incident had nothing to do with Levitch's
departure from Gray Line, which, he said, was Levitch's own
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch said the repetition inherent in the job was driving him
crazy. In the movie, he also makes clear that he didn't like being
asked to adhere to a dress code.
</P>
<P>
   But his career as a guide survived. Over the last year, as ``The
Cruise'' was screened for private audiences, Levitch began to build
a business of walking tours for small groups that sought his
services.
</P>
<P>
   He is also working with an agent on a proposal for a special
guidebook about New York, and he has been promised 5 percent of any
net profits from ``The Cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My entertainment lawyer said that 5 percent of the net of a
documentary is like having 5 percent of an illusion,'' Levitch
said. ``Then he reminded me that he has 10 percent of my
illusion.''

CATHERINE, ALSO GREAT AS A COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Master Drawings From the Hermitage and Pushkin
Museums,'' at the Pierpont Morgan Library, could not fail to be a
remarkable exhibition. The collections now in the Hermitage in St.
Petersburg, Russia, were initiated by Catherine the Great in ways,
and on a scale, that could not be paralleled today. They were
powered by greed and impatience on the one hand and by dexterous
networking on the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was not in Catherine's nature to buy drawings in ones and
twos. She wanted a great museum, the way Peter the Great had wanted
a great capital city. The deadline, in both cases, was tomorrow,
and both of them succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine began buying for her museum in 1764. By 1769 she had
bought two of the greatest collections of drawings in Western
Europe. One of them belonged to Count Cobenzl, then living in
Brussels, who was minister plenipotentiary to Empress Maria Theresa
of Austria and a leading figure in the administration of what was
then the Austrian Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   With this single stroke, Catherine the Great acquired more than
4,000 master drawings by Western European artists. Sheets from the
Cobenzl collection in the present show include examples of Poussin,
Rubens, van Dyck, Primaticcio, Hans Holbein the Elder, Jacob
Jordaens, Hendrick Goltzius, Guercino and Greuze. Every one of them
is a touchstone of quality. In the Poussin ``Baptism'' _ a sketch
for the painting of that name that is a part of Poussin's ``Seven
Sacraments'' _ rigor and awe work as equal partners.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine went on to buy 1,020 drawings from the collection of
Count Heinrich Bruehl, who was at the time a minister at the court
of Saxony in Dresden. Virtually on her own doorstep she also
acquired the drawings _ almost 2,000 _ that had been collected by
Count Butskoy, the president of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts
in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That Butskoy bought with teaching in mind is made clear by the
presence in the Morgan Library of the ``Allegory of the 12 Years'
Truce,'' by Hendrick de Clerck. The truce in question ended a
grueling civil war between Flanders and the Netherlands and ushered
in a period in which the great port of Antwerp reopened, normal
trading resumed and the economy flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the Imperial Academy could learn a whole alphabet of
celebration from this drawing. The rulers of Flanders come floating
down from heaven with olive branches in hand. To the left, 10 young
women, each armed with sword and shield, personify the Catholic
provinces of Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   To the right, seven other young women, each in full combat rig,
personify the Protestant provinces of the Netherlands. In the
distance, a flotilla of warships reminds us that, not long before
the picture was drawn, the Dutch navy had blockaded Antwerp.
Jubilation reigns, and in the foreground Belgium itself is
personified as a seated figure who raises her eyes as if to say,
``Thank Heaven that's over!'' Is all this warfare in fancy dress?
Yes, but history lessons do not come prettier than this one.
</P>
<P>
   The show also includes three drawings by Greuze that came from
the Butskoy collection. One of them _ of a young woman sitting at
ease in a chair _ is the very image of well-being touched in with
throwaway panache.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful beginning, therefore. We can imagine Catherine the
Great's meaty arms as she reached for her favorite drawings while
leaving hundreds of others unopened in their crates.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of a major museum, Moscow for a long time lagged
behind St. Petersburg. It never had either the virtually unlimited
money or the single-minded, centralized focus that powered the
Hermitage. The first museum of art in Moscow did not possess any
drawings until 1873. The Pushkin Museum did not get its present
name until 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Examples That Hold Their Own
</P>
<P>
   But there had been true collectors in Moscow _ noblemen,
merchants, lawyers, professional soldiers, perfumers and a
discerning printer _ who bought very good drawings that finally
ended up in the Pushkin Museum. It is represented at the Morgan
Library by examples of the work of Carpaccio, Rubens, Guido Reni,
Parmigianino and Caspar David Friedrich that amply hold their own
with the loans from the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   It was thanks to the Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky that the
future Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and his German-born wife had
visited Friedrich in his studio in Dresden in 1820. The magical
unflinching strangeness of Friedrich's vision is wonderfully borne
out in his ``Coffin on a Grave,'' from the Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
   After the October Revolution in 1917, it took quite some time
for the priorities of the Moscow museum world to sort themselves
out. This was a sensitive matter, in that it had been in Moscow,
and not in St. Petersburg, that the finest Western European art of
the late 19th and early 20th centuries was collected.
</P>
<P>
   Much credit for that went, then as now, to the Moscow collectors
Sergei Shchukin and Mikhail Morozov. In his dealings with Henri
Matisse between 1908 and 1913, Shchukin had shown a daring and a
prescience unrivaled by other collectors. Morozov, though less
audacious, had a sensitivity all his own. (He cut a wide swath,
moreover. It was he who bought the monumental Daumier drawing
``Camille Desmoulins in the Palais Royal.'' This brings a glorious
physicality to the moment on July 12, 1789, when Desmoulins caled
the citizens of Paris to arms _ a call that would result in the
storming of the Bastille.)
</P>
<P>
   As to what would be done about the works of Cezanne, van Gogh,
Gauguin, the Douanier Rousseau, Matisse, Picasso and Bonnard and
others in Moscow after the Revolution of 1917, opinion was divided.
To the Soviet hard-liners, and to some of the soft-liners as well,
they presented a dangerous encumbrance. Which side were they on,
after all?
</P>
<P>
   As to where they should go, hesitation was yearlong. To put them
in major metropolitan museums would give them a standing that might
sap the visitors' moral fiber and undermine the official cult of
socialist realism. Stalin was said at one time to favor the widest
possible dispersal, the better to limit their possible effect.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From One Museum to Two Others
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they were gathered together in Moscow in the State
Museum of Modern Western Art, in which they enjoyed a conditional
liberty. But in 1948 that museum was done away with, and its
contents were divided between the Hermitage and the Pushkin Museum.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the present show, which runs through Jan. 10,
is not a parade of old-master drawings that quietly peters out. On
the contrary, it ends by turning an important corner in the history
of art. There is, for instance, the watercolor sketch of four
bathers by a river that Matisse sent to Shchukin in March 1909.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse had hoped that the sketch would persuade Shchukin to
commission a third large panel to go with the two _ ``Dance'' and
``Music'' _ that he had already acquired for the staircase in his
house in Moscow. Shchukin said ``no'' to that, but Matisse
nonetheless went ahead with the full-scale ``Bathers by a River.''
Worked and reworked, the huge canvas was finally completed in the
fall of 1916 and is now in the Art Institute of Chicago. Lent by
the Pushkin, and never before seen in the United States, the tender
and lyrical initial sketch is an important document in the career
of Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   The show ends with another Pushkin loan _ the celebrated
``Trans-Siberian Express,'' in which a Swiss-born French poet,
Blaise Cendrars, collaborated with a Russian-born painter, Sonia
Delaunay, in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a journey by train from Moscow to Harbin, the poem
comes in free-form fragments of varying length. Delaunay decided to
merge the text with images devised by herself. ``Simultaneous
contrast'' was her name for the result, which was folded lengthwise
and crosswise and published in book form.
</P>
<P>
   As the book, when opened, is 6{ feet long, it is never easy to
display. But it takes the Morgan's visitors out of the world of the
formally framed drawing and drags them, feet first, into the 20th
century.

BOWEN'S THOUGHTS ARE WITH WIFE, BABY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC offensive lineman Ken Bowen returned to
practice Wednesday after missing Tuesday's session to be with his
infant daughter, who is hospitalized in Oakland after being born
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen also missed Tuesday's practice to clear up some
health-insurance problems but said his daughter, Katherine, is
doing fine even though she weighs just 1 pound, 12 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expected a lot of problems, but there haven't been,''
Bowen said. ``She's eating and aware of her situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough part for Bowen has been concentrating on football,
with his wife and baby up north.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. It's always on my mind,'' he said. ``But I've
gotten a lot of support from my teammates and coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Day off for Soward?: USC coach Paul Hackett said wide
receiver R. Jay Soward might sit out today's practice to rest his
sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little nicked,'' Hackett said. ``I'm a little
concerned. He didn't have his usual tempo today.''
</P>
<P>
   __ It's not jitters: Although quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst has
experienced food poisoning and flu-like symptoms before two games,
Hackett said he doesn't think the sophomore is being affected by
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't strike me as the kind of personality where I would
worry about that,'' Hackett said. ``He's a pretty calm guy. I think
it's just a bad-luck deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Carson Palmer played nearly half of the Florida State
game, Hackett said he has evenly split snaps between the
quarterbacks this week. Practice had been divided 60-40, with Van
Raaphorst getting more snaps.
</P>
<P>
   __ Papadakis will start: With Chad Morton (strained back)
missing his second day of practice, Petros Papadakis will start at
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Morton is expected to return to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cusano's back: Linebacker Mark Cusano pronounced himself
fully recovered from his ankle injury, although he will probably
have to wait another week to start.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano went 59 plays against Florida State, or about five more
plays than starter Zeke Moreno. He had four tackles; Moreno had
two.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Grant Pearsall has also been told he will wait
another week before starting.
</P>
<P>
   Another injured Trojan, quarterback Jason Thomas, has begun
riding a bicycle and working out in a swimming pool as he recovers
from ankle surgery.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rare score: USC beat Arizona State 21-14 in the College
Baseball World Series championship, but don't expect a similar
score Saturday. In 987 games, USC has had just one game end 21-14,
when the Trojans defeated No. 1-ranked Cal in 1951.

TCU GETS TWO FOOTBALL COMMITMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas_ The TCU football program has received two
oral commitments for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   DeSoto quarterback Casey Printers committed late last night and
Dallas Bishop Lynch offensive lineman Matt Orlovsky made his
intentions known over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Printers, a 6-foot-4, 195-pounder, was considering Syracuse and
Notre Dame before deciding to remain close to home with the Horned
Frogs. The District 8-5A most valuable player last season after
completing 139 of 289 passes for 2,033 yards and 15 touchdowns,
Printers is an athletic quarterback with a strong arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``TCU is a program on the rise and I wanted to be a part of
that,'' said Printers, who has completed 53 of 90 passes this
season 707 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. ``Their
coaching staff is very good and very organized. You can tell they
are moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the offensive system is tailor-made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlovsky, a 6-foot-5, 290-pound offensive lineman from the 5A
TAPPS program, said he was convinced after watching Saturday
night's 35-34 upset of then No. 23-ranked Air Force. Orlovsky had
been considering Rice, Duke, SMU and Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game sold me because I saw the enthusiasm Coach
\RDennis\S Franchione brought to his team,'' said Orlovsky, an
all-district and second-team all-state performer a year ago. ``You
can tell he's a sincere guy who really cares about his players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs also received an oral commitment from 6-6, 280-pound
Waco Robinson offensive lineman John Glud in August. Oral
commitments are non-binding.

EDITORIAL: THE INSATIABLE PENTAGON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top military commanders and Senate Republicans
engaged in a surreal argument this week over whether the Pentagon
has enough money to keep American forces and weapons ready for
combat. The senators complained that the generals had soft-pedaled
an erosion in readiness, while the commanders maintained that
Congress had diverted money to marginal military programs that
benefited the home districts of Republican leaders. Lost in the
noise was any recognition that an annual Pentagon budget of $271
billion should be more than sufficient to keep American forces in
fighting trim, provided it is spent in rational ways.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union it is
dispiriting to find the Pentagon asserting that it needs ever
larger budgets to insure that American forces can quickly and
effectively deal with potential threats like Iraq and peacekeeping
assignments like the one in Bosnia. The reason is that despite
substantial reductions in forces and all manner of strategic
reviews, the Pentagon has never figured out how to allocate money
where it is really needed or to reduce waste and duplication,
especially in the development and production of expensive new
weapons systems. The hyperbolic expectation that the United States
should be able to fight two regional wars simultaneously is used to
justify an Army of nearly half a million active-duty troops and a
Navy with 12 aircraft carriers, only one less than the Cold War
fleet had in service.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the services shielding pet projects, the cost of
advanced weapons rising and Congress unwilling to close obsolete
bases, it is little wonder that there may not be enough money left
to keep military salaries competitive or to retain an adequate
number of combat pilots. Instead of asking for more money, a
request that a politically weakened White House is afraid to
reject, the Pentagon should make some hard decisions about how to
use the billions it already has. The Army can do with fewer new
tanks, the Air Force can live without dozens of additional
warplanes and the Navy faces no threat that requires production of
new submarines. The notion of adding an extra $20 billion a year to
the budget to recruit and retain troops and to replace equipment,
among other things, is insulting to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders compound the problem when they insist that
scarce dollars go to defense contractors in their districts. Newt
Gingrich, for example, has championed the production of C-130
transport planes that are manufactured by Lockheed in his Georgia
district. In the past three years the Pentagon spent $1 billion for
20 of the planes, even though the Air Force did not ask for them.
No citizen wishes to deny the Pentagon the money it needs to defend
the country, but Americans have not issued the military a blank
check.

STARTING SPENCER WAS A RISK WORTH TAKING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The slightly risky decision for Joe Torre before the
division series was whether to start Shane Spencer in left field.
Placing a 26-year-old rookie in the lineup could have put both
Spencer and Torre in jeopardy if a ball was mishandled in left
field. Still, despite what Chad Curtis accomplished in helping the
Yankees win Game 1 against the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night, it
would have been the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Torre got it right and started Spencer in left in
Game 2. The fans were pleased because their newest folk hero
managed to get three at-bats, three chances to continue his
imitation of Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said that one reason he chose Spencer over Tim Raines in
left field Tuesday night was that he did not want the 39-year-old
Raines to aggravate an already sore left knee. Sure. It was a
polite gesture toward Raines, but Torre obviously wanted Spencer in
the pivotal game for his power. There was no need to camouflage it,
no need to disguise the reason for making a smart decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in a pretty good groove,'' Torre said. ``Hopefully,
there's something left.''
</P>
<P>
   There was. The wisdom of starting Spencer became evident when he
pounded Rick Helling's 2-2 fastball into the Yankee bullpen in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   If a fan had his eyes closed when Spencer swung, he would have
been thinking homer. The ball clashing with the bat had that
crushing, explosive sound. It was loud and long and it was,
amazingly, typical of Spencer's September to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's ninth homer of the month put the Yankees ahead, 1-0,
and was the first time in the game that their patience and
persistence against Helling paid off on the scoreboard. The Yanks
made the 20-game winner toil by taking pitches and fouling off
pitches until they saw ones they liked. The fastball Spencer saw
was chest-high and sliced through the middle of the plate, akin to
putting the ball on a batting tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just enjoying myself and having the time of my
life,'' Spencer said before the game. ``I got a chance to play and
opened some eyes and here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk, however slight it was, no longer exists. It is time
for Torre to stop being diplomatic and to start Spencer in left for
the remainder of the series and even for the rest of the
post-season. It is impossible to leave a player who has 8 home runs
in his last 30 at-bats in the dugout. If Spencer's hitting were an
aberration, opposing pitchers would have figured him out by now.
They have not, so Torre should jump on Spencer's broad back and
ride him. Spencer is very patient at the plate and is not lunging
at the breaking pitches that pitches dangle down and away. This is
not a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he carries himself,'' Torre has said. ``He has
a presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer started another rally in the fourth inning, when he
slapped an 0-1 pitch to center for a one-out single. Scott Brosius
followed the home run kid by slapping a two-run shot to right field
to give Andy Pettitte a 3-0 lead. With Spencer hitting seventh and
Brosius hitting eighth, the Yankees are even more formidable than
usual. In fact, the bottom third of New York's order, which
included Joe Girardi batting ninth, was 6 for 6 off Helling in the
first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason for not starting Spencer would be defense, and
he showed that he is not a statue in the outfield. When Juan
Gonzalez ripped a ball off the left-field stands, Spencer scooted
over to play the carom and fired a one-bounce bullet to second. If
Chuck Knoblauch had caught the ball cleanly, Gonzalez would have
been out. Instead, Knoblauch bobbled it in his glove and Gonzalez's
right foot jarred it loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has pretty much done everything you like to see from a
young player,'' Torre said. ``He's not a graceful outfielder, but
he's aggressive and he does the job very well both in left and in
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When Spencer was recalled from Class AAA Columbus around 11 p.m.
on Aug. 31, he became eligible to be on the post-season roster with
an hour to spare. Spencer, who did not even understand the
implications of the roster move until reporters explained it to
him, figured then that he should call home to let his family know
he might be on the Yankees in October. There was no need to phone
anyone Tuesday night. Spencer should be here and in the starting
lineup to stay.

COMMENTARY: THREE BUSY WEEKS OF SHOPPING AND PRAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONSEY, N.Y. _ For many Jews, the High Holy Days mean two trips
to temple, one each for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, and then the
welcome suspension of alternate-side parking rules for other holy
days they do not celebrate and can hardly pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   But in this enclave of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews in Rockland
County, this is a time of great vitality, both spiritually and
commercially, that continues through Sukkot and Simhat Torah. For
more than three weeks, from the first to the 23rd day of Tishri on
the Hebrew calendar, or Oct. 13, stores and synagogues are full to
bursting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running on adrenaline,'' said Tuvia Rotberg, shirt hanging
from his trousers and yarmulke askew as he helped customers at
Tuvia's, which bills itself as the One Stop Shop for All Your
Judaica Needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone needs something new for the New Year,'' said Esther
Blau, owner of Esti's World of Fashion, who scours hundreds of
collections looking for the few ensembles suited for the religious
woman, who is forbidden to show legs, arms or cleavage. ``This time
of year, it's a fashion show.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds line up at Mrs. Frank's bakery for round loaves of hallah
warm from the oven. Then it's on to the silversmith for a new honey
dish, or perhaps an esrog box to hold the gnarly citron that is
part of the Sukkot ritual. All these stores are dimly lighted and
stacked to the ceiling with merchandise, like a memory of the Lower
East Side in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Buses make regular passage between Monsey and the Orthodox and
Hasidic sections of the Bronx and Brooklyn in New York City. In
those urban centers, the sights and sounds of ancient religion are
part of the weave of life. But here, in the land of raised ranch
houses and sport utility vehicles, these unassimilated habits are
exotic, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   The Sukkot citrons, or esrogen, are imported from Israel and
cradled in skeins of raw flax. At Tuvia's, men in long black coats,
high hats and side curls line up to inspect the fruit, which sell
for about $45. The most prized are unblemished, with a slight
indentation around the middle. Still, the price brought a gasp from
a Central American laborer. ``For a lemon?'' he blurted.
</P>
<P>
   Other supplies for the harvest festival, like panels for
building the sukkot or outdoor eating huts, are sold at seasonal
stands that spring up like pumpkin patches. A billboard points
customers to the ``Esrogen Center, Next to Bubba's Bagels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Christmas season,'' said Rotberg, who sells tinsel
to decorate the sukkot, which are roofed with branches and open to
the stars. ``There is great warmth and everybody gets into it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Esti's World of Fashion, some wealthy women buy entire new
wardrobes for a holiday trip to Israel. The selections are all
demure. Sometimes that forces Mrs. Blau, the owner, to find extra
fabric and make a dickey to fill a neckline that only the Orthodox
would consider plunging.
</P>
<P>
   Even among these ultra-observant Jews, there are distinct
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Hasidim turn out in the days before Yom Kippur to buy a
live chicken and swing it around their heads like a lariat. The
ritual, known as shlogn kapores, is a vicarious atonement,
accompanied by a prayer that says, ``This chicken shall meet death,
but I shall find a long life of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monsey this week, Hasidim gathered in a parking lot to buy a
chicken for $10 off a truck, swing the shrieking bird by its wings
and then watch as it was slaughtered for donation to the poor. The
stench was suffocating and the air a blizzard of chicken feathers.
</P>
<P>
   On every corner, so it seems, a large house is being torn down
to build one even larger, roomy enough for a family with 12 or more
children. The little ones ride in double or triple strollers that
clog intersections and doorways. There are dozens of new Hasidic
shuls and yeshivas, some of which bar children who live in homes
with television sets.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of one Hasidic neighborhood, gates are lowered at
sunset on Friday to keep the uninitiated from driving through on
the Sabbath. Yiddish is the primary language. Even in the heat of
summer, men and women dress in dark colors and fabrics heavy as
drapery.
</P>
<P>
   But secular life intrudes. There is a technology store called
Kosher Komputer. Delicatessens stock Mayim Chaim beverages, in the
same rainbow of flavors as Snapple. Tuvia's sells Orthodox rap
music.
</P>
<P>
   Even a tiny minority gets into the act. The sign at the Monsey
Christian Reformed Church offers the traditional blessing
``L'Shannah Tovah Tikatevu,'' or ``May You Be Inscribed for a Good
Year.''

BROSIUS PRODUCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Yankees acquired third baseman Scott Brosius
from the Oakland Athletics for Kenny Rogers before the season, they
didn't know what kind of player they were getting.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit a career-high .304 for the Athletics in 1996, then
slumped to .203 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``You
look at '96 and '97, and those were two different years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius rebounded in a big way, batting .300 this year as the
Yankees' primary No. 9 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to find out he's a good bat-control guy,'' Torre said.
``When you get that kind of production out of the bottom of your
lineup, it's pretty incredible. It keeps from having a soft spot in
the lineup.'' Yankees impress Melvin Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said it's no fluke the Yankees won an American League-record
114 games in the regular season and beat his team in the first game
of the playoffs Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that impresses me the most is they have a lineup
that very seldom swings at bad pitches,'' he said. ``They make you
work to get them out. There are no easy outs. You can't go out
there and get two guys out and think you can relax for a third of
an inning. You have to stay focused for the entire 27 outs. Any
pitcher that faces the Yankees lineup, you're not only physically
tired at the end, if you're going to be beat them, you're going to
be mentally tired, too.'' Going to the Wells Yankees starter David
Wells threw 135 pitches, a high figure, in pitching eight shutout
innings in Game 1. However, Torre said Wells should have no
problems coming back Sunday if the series goes to five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we have done over the last 21/2 weeks or so is
we have cut back on pitch counts for everybody,'' Torre said. ``We
hope that we saved something. We sort of planned for this. I think
he'll be fine.'' Catching platoon Joe Girardi replaced Jorge Posada
as the Yankees' catcher for Andy Pettitte's start last night.
Girardi catches Pettitte and David Cone, the scheduled Game 3
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Posada will catch the rest of the series if it goes beyond three
games. He's the catcher for Game 4 starter Orlando Hernandez and
Wells. Briefly How confident are the Yankees in advancing a couple
of rounds in the playoffs? Their pitchers are taking batting
practice, a skill that won't be needed until the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trotted out a couple of old favorites for the
pregame festivities. Robert Merrill sang the national anthem, and
Hall of Fame shortstop Phil Rizzuto threw out the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Game 1 crowd of 57,362 was the second largest at Yankee
Stadium since it was remodeled 23 years ago. The biggest was 57,398
for Game 1 of the 1997 Division Series against the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout in Game 1 was the first for the Yankees in the
postseason since Game 5 of the 1996 World Series in Atlanta by
Pettitte and the first at Yankee Stadium since the Los Angeles
Dodgers' Tommy John did it in Game 2 of the 1981 World Series.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS USE THEIR HOME ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 114 victories don't count anymore, but they did
one thing for the New York Yankees _ they guaranteed that the extra
game in the league playoffs, if needed, would take place in front
of the most demonstrative fans in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In typical New York self-involvement, the fans like to believe
how important they are. They like to think they cause outfielders
to stumble and umpires' arms to jerk into a called-strike
punch-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fans in right field are crazy,'' said Shane Spencer, the
instant idol, who whacked yet another home run in the Yankees' 3-1
victory over the Texas Rangers in Game 2 on Wednesday night.
``Thank God I'm doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was starting against a right-hander, Rick Helling, a
task that Darryl Strawberry might have had except that Strawberry
is undergoing tests for worrisome intestinal problems. The Yanks
are concerned about Straw. (``Sure, cancer always comes to mind,''
admitted Joe Torre, the manager.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime there are the fans, and there is Spencer. He
also singled and scored a run, after taking a curtain call against
his own modest instincts, to please the crowd, which has been
treating him like a reincarnation of Mickey Mantle. If they demand
a curtain call, you'd better pop out of the dugout, arms waving.
You want to keep these people happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get two strikes, you hear them cheering, you want to
please them,'' said David Wells, who won the first game Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Ballplayers perform in front of huge crowds, at home and on the
road, and tend to be blase about it during the season, but they
seemed legitimately affected by the rumbling visceral power in the
stands Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, the third baseman, who hit a two-run homer on
Wednesday night, played for the world champion Minnesota Twins in
1991, in the Metrodome, a dismal fabric bubble that holds the noise
quite well. He said, ``The dome is loud, but you just don't see
fans in other places standing up with two strikes on every
batter.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius called the Yankee Stadium fans ``the best in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the most knowledgeable,'' he said. ``They understand
things like moving the runners over. They're not just looking for
the home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius said that before he sent his home run soaring toward
what is left of the hard-core Bleacher Creatures in right field.
The fanatics have been scattered by ticket-sale policies, but in
this town it is hard to tell the zealots from the enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee fans seem to have cleaned up their act a bit after
the ugliness of throwing batteries and other lethal objects from
the right-field stands in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Yankees played all season for the right to play in
front of these fans in the extra game in the first two rounds of
the league playoffs. The three other major sports in North America
_ football, hockey and basketball _ all give a home-field advantage
in every round to the teams with the best records, an incentive to
play hard all season.
</P>
<P>
   However, in baseball, the extra home game used to rotate among
divisions. When baseball expanded its playoffs to include a
wild-card team in 1995, it became apparent that a team could have
the best record in its league, play two home games and then go on
the road for three games and never be heard of again. There was no
reward for a year of good work.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the team with the best record has the extra home game
in the division and league championship series. And by the luck of
the draw, the American League has the extra home game in the World
Series this year.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a team will have to survive this short series, which
frightens Torre, who said: ``You play 162 games, and now you're
faced with 5. I'd rather have seven. Seven gives you a better shot.
But I don't know how you can do it without cutting down on the
regular season. But if you do, nobody will catch McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they faced three games in Yankee Stadium, the Rangers
tried to think positively. Helling had said: ``It's fun for me.
This is the most storied franchise in sports. This is the same
field that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio played on.
During the regular season it's one thing. You hear them when you
warm up; you can't help it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be the loudest crowd I'll ever hear. You know
the crowd will be into it even when the score is 0-0. I know the
crowd is going to be going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Going crazy is a normal condition for the fans in the Stadium.
The Yankees earned the extra home game in this short series, and
now they are guaranteed another game in this manic den where their
strength is replenished.

RISKING EVERYTHING ON ONE BIG GAMBLER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more we learn about the collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund run by John Meriwether, the more bizarre
it becomes. Here were financial wizards _ self-proclaimed and
accepted as such by virtually everyone _ who did not play by the
normal rules of investing. When their reckless strategies
collapsed, the Federal Reserve had to step in to arrange a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   There has been griping that a big investor was not allowed to
fail, as lesser investors would have been. But that misses several
points. First, the investors in the Long-Term Capital fund are not
likely to recover much of their money, because the banks and
brokerage firms that rescued the fund by injecting $3.5 billion got
a 90 percent stake in the fund in return. In that regard, this is
more like a bankrupt company being taken over by its creditors.
Second, while the Fed organized the rescue _ and no doubt applied
subtle pressure on banks to kick in money _ there are no public
funds involved.
</P>
<P>
   No, the important issues raised by this debacle do not stem from
the rescue of the fund. They relate to how this fund _ and the
financial world _ got to the point where a rescue was needed. They
highlight the need for regulatory changes to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed stepped in because it appeared that absent a bailout
there was a possibility of disaster _ not just for the hedge fund
in question, but for financial markets and many other players. Some
regulators, speaking privately, are convinced that had the fund
been forced to liquidate its huge positions, some large banks might
have failed, victims both of bad loans and of plunging prices for
securities that they owned. These regulators feared a financial
Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   All from one hedge fund, with invested capital of less than $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The reported figure of $1.25 trillion for the fund's investments
is misleading, because it counts many complicated derivative
positions at the so-called ``nominal value,'' which is far greater
than the maximum possible loss. But even discounting those numbers,
it appears that the fund had borrowed more than $50 for every
dollar of equity capital.
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone be so leveraged? First, there are no government
rules limiting loans to buy bonds, which were most of the
investments made by Long-Term Capital. Second, many of the
investments were supposedly hedged, a fact that made the lenders to
the fund feel more secure. That is, the fund had identified two
investments that ought to rise or fall together. But due to market
dislocations, one had gotten expensive compared with the other. So
it bet that the prices would come back together. Normally they
probably would have, and perhaps they will in the future. But they
did not do so before the fund ran out of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Did the lenders understand how leveraged this fund was? That is
a question Congress should ask when it begins hearings Thursday. If
the lenders knew, how were such loans justified as prudent? If not,
were the banks misled or just careless?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the banks simply did not believe there was much
risk investing with Meriwether and his colleagues. Consider the
case of UBS, the big Swiss bank. It not only invested directly in
the fund, but it entered into a separate transaction with several
of the fund's managers that enabled the managers to invest in their
own fund without putting up all the money that would have been
needed. The managers would get the profits if _ as everyone
expected _ the fund did well. But if the fund collapsed, the bank
would be left holding the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider Merrill Lynch, which also lent money to Long-Term
Capital and was a leading player in organizing the rescue, putting
up $350 million. The firm itself had been an equity investor in the
fund, and about 123 of its senior executives had put a total of $20
million of their own money in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives are not good or bad, in themselves. But they make it
possible to shift risks in ways not possible before, and with great
leverage. If this hedge fund could amass positions large enough to
threaten the financial markets, then so could others, not to
mention many large corporations. It is conceivable that a big
company in trouble might choose to take huge risks deliberately,
figuring that such a gamble was its only chance to regain financial
health before its plight became known. That is, in fact, what the
British media baron Robert Maxwell did a few years ago, before his
death led to the revelation of widespread fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is now in a position to assess whether someone is
piling up huge exposures. No regulators get such reports, and no
banks or brokerage firms know for sure what their competitors are
doing. Congress should consider letting some regulators _ perhaps
the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission _ collect such
information on a confidential basis so as to reduce the possibility
that something like this will happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has previously pooh-poohed the
idea of possible systemic risk from a rogue speculator. But in this
case, he decided not to risk what might happen. That was wise, and
it would be hazardous to go back to the old assumption that market
discipline will somehow sort everything out.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the risk may be reduced simply because the banks have
learned a lesson, and are getting more cautious with their credit
for hedge funds. But bull-market hubris will not vanish forever
even if the 1990s bull market in financial assets does turn out to
be over.

JACK HASKELL, 79, SINGER AND TV ANNOUNCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J., Conn.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Haskell, a familiar face to television viewers for some 30
years, first as the easygoing sidekick of Dave Garroway and then as
a regular stand-in on Jack Paar's and Johnny Carson's shows, died
on Saturday at the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell put himself through college by working at radio stations
in Chicago while attending Northwestern University, after which he
served as a naval pilot in the Pacific during World War II. He was
an early member of the ``Garroway at Large'' show when it was based
in Chicago and came to New York to join Garroway on the original
NBC ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked with Jack Paar, substituting for the announcer
Hugh Downs on occasion, and was a guest and replacement for Ed
McMahon on ``Tonight'' when Johnny Carson was host. His television
credits also included ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ``The Mike Douglas
Show,'' ``The Bell Telephone Hour,'' ``The Garry Moore Show'' and
NBC's ``Monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell, who was born in Akron, Ohio, and grew up in Cleveland,
was also a singer. He performed with bands in the Chicago area
during his college years, and after graduation he sang with Doris
Day and the Les Brown Orchestra. He also performed in summer stock,
singing in musicals like ``The Pajama Game,'' ``Brigadoon'' and
``Say, Darling,'' and in supper clubs like the Cotillion Room of
the Pierre Hotel in New York. He appeared on Broadway in 1962 in
``Mr. President,'' an Irving Berlin musical that starred Nanette
Fabray.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Helen, and a son, Thomas, both of
Darien, Conn., and a granddaughter.

EDITORIAL: A PRIMARY POLITICAL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Now that Gov. Pete Wilson of California has signed a bill moving
his state's presidential primary to March 7, the process of
electing a president in the year 2000 will probably include a
primary season that is too hasty and a general election campaign
that is too long.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the nation's political leaders move to intervene, the
next presidential nominees will almost certainly be decided in the
late winter, in a flurry of West and East Coast primaries that
follow close on the heels of New Hampshire. That will be followed
by an eight-month campaign for president, while the voters wallow
in boredom and buyer's remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 primary schedule also includes New England, New York
and possibly other West Coast states, since California wants to
create a Western regional primary to compete with the new Yankee
Day primaries in the East. A big bicoastal primary tilts the odds
strongly in favor of familiar names with lots of money for
television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, that means Vice President Al Gore. Many
of Gore's fellow party members believe that the Democratic National
Committee's hands-off attitude toward the primary schedule is
intended to help the vice president pre-empt the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme compression of the nominating process is a bad idea at
any time and especially so for the Democrats in 2000. The party
must decide if it wants a nominee with strong ties to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic voters and party leaders need a process that will
allow time for alternative candidates to emerge. If Gore wins the
nomination, he will benefit from a process that does not make
Democratic voters feel they were stuck with the only package on the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans learned the importance of a choice among viable
candidates in 1996. Many Republicans who regarded Bob Dole as a
weak candidate for the general election also knew he was virtually
unbeatable in a rapid-fire set of geographically dispersed
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing primary voters to make a choice from a restricted field
and then subjecting the country to a final campaign that runs
almost as long as the school year is ridiculous. But states are
scrambling to get in the front of the line because everyone wants
his vote to be important to the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The front-loading will not stop unless some national body
imposes order. The National Association of Secretaries of State,
whose members supervise state elections, will meet this weekend in
Washington to discuss plans to head off what could be a disastrous
year 2000 election schedule. The secretaries of state have been
talking up a series of regional primaries, spread out over several
months, with regions going first on a rotating schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the association will not have the power to get the states in
line without considerable support from the national parties. So far
that help has not been forthcoming. The Republicans did attempt to
lure states into holding later primaries by awarding extra delegate
strength to those who waited. That reward was not enough, and it is
obvious that only a guarantee that all states will get a decent
chance to influence the nominating process is going to end the
present destructive trend.

   &UR; !text! &LR; The gap between each of Southern Utah's offensive
linemen is a few feet. The five of them are spread across the line
of scrimmage about 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a pair of slot backs, a fullback and a quarterback, and
it's one of the funkiest offenses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them on film and I was like, `Boy, I'm going to get
sacks. I'll be blasting gaps. I'm going to go all the way,''' Cal
State Northridge nose guard Sean Beard said. ``Coach is like, `No,
that's what we don't want to do.' Then you look at film and see
other teams run on them. It's weird because it's like you're
playing against a kickoff team. Everybody's spread out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tricky. Plays can be executed like that, though I didn't
think it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, there's been a lot more teaching going on
during practice this week as the Matadors (2-1) try to slow the
nation's fourth-rated running game (317.4 yards per game). The
teams meet Saturday (3:05 p.m.) at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their running game is good, but their passing game is
garbage,'' Beard said. ``The quarterback (Matt Cannon) has a lot of
guts. Our main focus is to try and blast him and try to take him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional football wisdom gets thrown out this week as
aggressiveness on defense takes a step back in favor of assignments
to each gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stop the fullback, no question about it,'' CSUN
coach Ron Ponciano said. ``You have to secure the line of
scrimmage. They have the ability to break a lot of tackles; spin,
run through arm tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Redshirts and eligibility: &UR; !off! &LR;  Ponciano and injured
linebacker Cos Abercrombie, who broke his jaw against Northern
Arizona, met before practice and the two decided the sophomore will
redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to lose a lot of muscle mass, and I don't want to
aggravate the shoulder he worked so hard to rehabilitate,''
Ponciano said. ``Plus, just the idea of reinjuring that jaw, I
don't want to even put him in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Abercrombie is going to redshirt, it opened another spot
on its 85-man roster for practices, which was immediately filled by
defensive end Carlos Medrigal. Ponciano said Medrigal probably
won't play against Southern Utah but could dress for next week's
Big Sky showdown with Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ponciano said offensive lineman Taffe Aina, who is
academically ineligible, was granted a redshirt season this year
and will return next year.

   !arrow!Hall of Fame night: &UR; !off! &LR;  Former CSUN quarterback
Sherdrick Bonner will be one of three people inducted into the
school's Athletic Hall of Fame on Friday at The Odyssey Restaurant
in Granada Hills. Bonner, who began his career with CSUN in 1987,
is fifth on the school's passing-yardage list (3,533) and third in
completions (319). He'll be inducted along with former athletic
director Robert J. Hiegert and former cross country All-American
Darcy Arreola. Information: (818) 677-3215. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;
