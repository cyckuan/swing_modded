<HEADLINE> Hardaway Finally Feels Appreciated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway and Jason Kidd. All-around  
brilliance matched with never-ending energy and guile. It could be 
one of the most dynamic backcourts ever in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the question persists: Will this be the all-pro Penny of his  
early years, or the injury-plagued, complaining, some would say 
disruptive, Penny of his last two seasons in Orlando? 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway insists he's relishing a fresh start in Phoenix with a  
Suns organization that he appreciates and appreciates him. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Kidd rebuilt his image in Phoenix after a rough start  
in Dallas, why can't Hardaway do the same? 
</P>
<P>
	``A new outlook, new scenery is always good for a professional  
athlete when he comes from a bad situation,'' Kidd said. ``I think 
the best of a person comes out, because they're out to prove that 
they can play, and they have the opportunity to shine. It's a 
once-in-a-lifetime second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway burst into the NBA as one of its brightest young stars.  
By his second season, he had teamed with Shaquille O'Neal to take 
the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals. Hardaway was first-team 
all-NBA in 1995 and '96. With his ``Little Penny'' Nike ads, he was 
a media darling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then everything began to unravel. Shaq left for Los Angeles and  
Hardaway was sidelined for 23 games in 1996-97 and 63 games in 
1997-98 following a knee injury and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final season in Orlando, Hardaway averaged a career-low  
15.8 points and was severely criticized as the Philadelphia 76ers 
swept the Magic in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of engineering the mutiny that led to the firing  
of his first coach, Brian Hill, and helping to hasten the 
retirement of his next coach, Chuck Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway said he had unbearable pressure and no support from the  
Magic, coaches included. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put pressure on me to be `the' guy, and when I didn't  
perform, they killed me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway responded to critics with nasty remarks of his own.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the coaching staff to defend me. I didn't have  
the organization to defend me, and that's weird being `the guy' 
down in Orlando,'' he said. ``I had to defend myself, so I ended up 
saying some crazy things and making myself look bad, and that's 
where everything went downhill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were almost desperate for an infusion of talent after a  
mediocre 1999 season. So they pulled off a trade that brought 
Hardaway to Phoenix along with his new seven-year, $86 million 
contract -- and considerable baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, under the ownership of Jerry Colangelo, have a  
reputation of being good to their players. Hardaway said he noticed 
the difference right away in a meeting with team president Bryan 
Colangelo, coach Danny Ainge and other members of the team's 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about things here that I never talked about  
before with the coach or organization in Orlando, so I'm feeling 
good about everything that's gone on here,'' Hardaway said. ``Just 
as far as they're in my corner, that they're backing me, they're 
never going to embarrass me in the paper. They're never going to 
point the finger at me. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're never going to put so much pressure on me like I'm the  
only guy on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ainge praises Hardaway's all-around talent -- outside shooting,  
inside scoring, passing and defense -- but said no one should expect 
him to mesh perfectly with Kidd right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are special players, but it's going to take some  
time,'' Ainge said. ``I think you're going to see a lot of great 
games out of them, and some games that aren't what people are 
expecting maybe initially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway believes he would have been one of the league's best  
players again no matter where he wound up, but ``to play in the 
backcourt with a guy like Jason makes it so much easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a guy who plays hard at the defensive end,  
has very good hands, pushes the ball up the floor extremely fast 
and finds all the guys he needs to find,'' Hardaway said. ``He has 
a lot of wind, can run all day and do a lot of great things. He'll 
get to balls that you don't even think he can get to. It makes it 
so much easier for me because I feed off of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Kidd at 6-feet-4, and Hardaway 6-7, the backcourt creates a  
matchup nightmare. Teams will no longer be able to switch their 
off-guard to defend Kidd, and the smaller point guards will have a 
tough time guarding him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway will be able to defend the bigger shooting guards,  
allowing the Suns to avoid the mismatches that sometimes occurred 
last season with Rex Chapman as the off-guard. Hardaway also has 
experience as a playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two ball-handlers,'' Kidd said. ``We've got two guys  
who know how to pass the ball. Points aren't everything to our 
games. We're very unselfish. We rely on our teammates to make us 
look good. It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of touches. A lot 
of guys are going to get a lot of wide-open shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the trade, Kidd brashly predicted that he and  
Hardaway would become the best backcourt in NBA history. Kidd isn't 
backing off, but he knows they have to prove it on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not say it if you truly believe it?'' he said. ``First,  
we've got to win a championship to be considered the best. If you 
look at Michael and Magic and Larry Bird and those teams, they've 
got the rings. That's why they're considered the best in the 
world.''

<HEADLINE> A History of Plastic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This is a story about billiard balls, false teeth and a triumph  
of failed research. In short, it's about how plastics came to be. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, it's about chemistry.  
</P>
<P>
	What makes plastic plastic is the molecules -- made from atoms of  
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other stuff. The molecules are 
immense, often resembling chains, sometimes with side-chains or 
ring structures sticking out like legs on a centipede. These side 
structures can prevent the main chains from packing close together 
in an orderly way. That makes plastic flexible and often 
transparent. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes certain plastics hard is letting the molecule chains  
snarl together like a pile of spaghetti -- very stiff spaghetti. If 
these strands slip when heated, the plastic can be remolded. But if 
they won't budge, the plastic keeps its original shape. 
</P>
<P>
	We think of plastic -- its name from the Greek plastikos, meaning  
shapeable -- as the ultimate synthetic material, a landmark in the 
striving to outdo nature. But the earliest manmade plastics owe a 
lot to nature, specifically cellulose, the main stuff of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1862, British chemist Alexander Parkes announced he had  
modified a cellulose-based mixture called collodian that doctors 
used to cover cuts. The new stuff, Parkesine, could be warmed and 
then molded into shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkes' company went broke, but American inventor John Wesley  
Hyatt struck gold through his own tinkering with collodian. Going 
after a $10,000 prize offered for a substitute for ivory to use in 
billiard balls, he created celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
	It quickly became a material for combs, shirt collars, movie  
film and more. Still, it had some big problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, people who used celluloid plates to hold their  
false teeth found that when they drank hot tea, the plates warped. 
The good news was that the stuff wouldn't blow up, as the New York 
Times felt compelled to assure its readers in an 1875 editorial 
titled, ``Explosive Teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But celluloid presented a very real hazard. Early movie film  
could burst into flames in projectors. It was succeeded by ``safety 
film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until this century did inventors began to make plastics  
completely from synthetic materials. The first, announced in 1909, 
was Bakelite. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakelite was an accident, the result of a failed quest. Its  
inventor, American chemist Leo Baekeland, was trying to find a 
substitute for shellac. The sticky, amber-colored stuff he got by 
mixing phenol and formaldehyde didn't work for that. But he came to 
realize it was great plastic: It was cheaper than celluloid and 
could be quickly molded into hard shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, as Baekeland's company proclaimed, ``The Material of a  
Thousand Uses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It found its way into radios, light sockets, jewelry,  
telephones, washing machines, fishing reels, guns. Bakelite ``set 
the mold for the modern plastic industry,'' says the American 
Chemical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	More plastics followed in the early 20th century, like  
Cellophane, the invention of a Swiss textile engineer, Jacques 
Brandenberger, who wanted to keep wine spills from spoiling 
tablecloths. The 1930s brought nylon, Teflon, the clingy wrap 
material Saran and polyethylene, widely used in things like milk 
jugs and grocery bags. By 1940, Henry Ford could swing an ax 
against a prototype plastic car to show how tough it was. 
</P>
<P>
	As for that ancestral stuff, celluloid -- you can still use it.  
Every time you whack a pingpong ball.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Baby Whale Euthanized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- A marine rescue group killed a stranded  
baby whale Saturday because its mother could not be found and the 
animal was unable to live on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation  
did an aerial search of the waters off Westhampton Beach, but could 
not find any other sperm whales, it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured whale ``was an extremely young animal totally  
dependent on its parent for nourishment as well as education in 
survival skills,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because no marine mammal facilities were able to take the whale,  
it was euthanized and died at 2 p.m., according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The whale was discovered Friday morning on eastern Long Island,  
in Westhampton Beach near Rogers Beach. Rescuers moved it to a tank 
at Atlantis Marine World in Riverhead before destroying it.

<HEADLINE> Howard Stern and His Wife Separate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Howard Stern, who bragged of his marital  
fidelity while entertaining scores of strippers and porn stars on 
his radio show, has split with his wife of 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and wife Alison, whose romance was the basis of his film  
``Private Parts,'' are parting as friends, said Dan Klores, a 
spokesman for the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following mediation, both Alison and Howard, who care for each  
other very much, have amicably separated,'' Klores said Friday. 
``They have come to an agreement and settled all of their 
concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement made no mention of a divorce. The couple has three  
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, 45, often complained to his 10 million daily listeners  
about his lack of sex life at home. It wasn't unusual for Alison to 
call in to the raunchy show and rebut his complaints, although she 
hasn't appeared on the air in several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Stern's preoccupation with sex, he repeatedly insisted  
on his syndicated show that he was faithful to his wife.

<HEADLINE> Models' Eggs Receive $42,000 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A fashion photographer, hoping to cash  
in on would-be parents' wishes for a beautiful baby, is offering 
the eggs of eight models in an on-line auction set to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility groups have expressed disgust at the offer, saying  
it turns human life into a commodity. But photographer Ron Harris 
says his offer is a reflection of American society, where beauty 
can be purchased by the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, www.ronsangels.com, has pictures of eight models  
offering their eggs for sale. The bids start at $15,000 and can go 
as high as $150,000. Harris said the Web site had already received 
a serious bid of $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The models receive the full amount offered; bidders must pay  
Harris' organization an additional 20 percent service fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unethical and it's distasteful,'' Sean Tipton, spokesman  
for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility specialists are increasingly concerned about putting  
a price tag on human eggs. This spring, for example, a couple 
advertised that they would pay $50,000 for eggs donated from an 
athletic student from a top college. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law forbids the purchase and sale of human organs, but  
trafficking in sperm and eggs is legal, infertility experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is a Malibu, Calif., photographer whose work includes  
fashion photos, television directing for Playboy and exercise 
videos. He said he uses professional judgment to decide which 
potential donors are beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I did all my life,'' he said. ``That's my  
expertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site boasts that the models are ``beautiful and  
healthy'' and subject to rigorous health examinations. In a letter 
on the site, Harris describes the egg auction as ``Darwin's Natural 
Selection at its very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says society's obsession with appearance has made us stronger  
and healthier, and he pitches the egg auction as a chance for 
parents to give their children an advantage in society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every organism is evolving to its most perfect state,'' Harris  
writes. ``Finding traits that 'repair' your genetic flaws is what 
we are all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The models could not be reached for comment Saturday, but on the  
Web site, each gives reasons for selling her eggs, ranging from 
``to not be dependent on a man,'' to ``I want to help others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Etcoff, the Cambridge-based author of ``Survival of the  
Prettiest: The Science of Beauty,'' says it's natural to consider 
how your mate's attractiveness will be reflected in your children. 
But she said such direct marketing of beauty is a false promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way that we inherit features is sort of a genetic roll of  
the dice,'' Etcoff said. ``This really is buying beauty for our 
offspring. Clearly, these offspring might not be beautiful at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who has three children from four marriages, said its  
natural for parents to want attractive children. He said that each 
time his wife was pregnant he hoped for a cute baby. On the third 
try, he said, he got one. 
</P>
<P>
	``My third child is beautiful,'' he said, adding that he didn't  
favor that child over the others. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the egg auction, Harris said an auction of male  
models' sperm is being planned, with bids from $10,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg donation has been largely an act of altruism until now,  
Tipton said. Donors typically are paid $2,500 to $5,000 for their 
time and inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's leading Internet auction site, eBay, has banned the  
sale of eggs, sperm and human organs on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as a society seem to have come to the conclusion that it's  
not appropriate to traffic in body parts,'' Tipton said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Willing To Discuss bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- In a surprise announcement,  
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army said Saturday it would be willing 
to talk with the United States, saying the agenda was open-ended 
and could include suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government says bin Laden masterminded the twin  
bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year and wants 
him deported to the United States to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to solve all the issues with America, including  
that of Osama bin Laden,'' the Taliban's Information Minister Amir 
Khan Muttaqi said in a statement. He did not elaborate or promise 
to hand over bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban had refused to hand over bin Laden, saying they have  
no extradition treaty with the United States and Washington has not 
proven bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttaqi said the Taliban wanted good relations with the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said: ``We've been  
in discussion with the Taliban over Bin Laden for over a year 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, Michael  
Sheehan, met with the Taliban's representative in New York, Abdul 
Hakeem Mujahid, last Monday to discuss bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had discussions with him before that did not result  
with them stopping to harbor bin Laden,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asia,  
will meet with Mujahid at the State Department on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dialogue can only be viewed as positive if it leads to the  
actual handover of bin Laden,'' Foley said of the Taliban's latest 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has imposed economic sanctions on the Taliban,  
who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan. The United Nations is 
threatening limited sanctions against the Taliban if they do not 
hand over bin Laden by Nov. 14, a deadline the Taliban has already 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our policy to have good relations with all the countries  
of the world, especially with the United States,'' said Muttaqi. 
``We want to solve the issue of bin Laden with America, but that 
has to be in line with our Islamic law and the Afghan culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban say they have tried bin Laden in an Islamic court  
and have found him innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	They also say bin Laden is not allowed to use Afghan soil for  
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready for talks to remove all the concerns of the  
United States,'' Muttaqi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and mostly Pashtun, the country's  
majority ethnic group. They are fighting northern-based opposition 
for complete control of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Throwing First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- His pitch is usually to make peace, but on  
Tuesday U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will be pitching the 
first ball in the World Series game between the Atlanta Braves and 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, who played soccer during his youth in Ghana and now plays  
tennis, has been practicing to get the pitch right, U.N. spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general was asked a few months ago by major league  
officials to throw out the first pitch, but the offer was firmed up 
last week when the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox in the American 
League championship game, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series begins Saturday in Atlanta and Tuesday's  
contest will be the first home game at Yankees Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the secretary-general rooting for either team?  
</P>
<P>
	Eckhard said no -- he's going to be strictly neutral.

<HEADLINE> Angels General Manager Hunt Stalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Bill Stoneman was so close to being named  
general manager of the Anaheim Angels he reportedly began calls to 
assemble a staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, talks with the Angels reportedly broke off.  
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman, a former Angels pitcher who has been an executive with  
the Montreal Expos since 1983, had been thought to be the leading 
candidate for the job. But negotiations apparently broke down 
Friday, and he is not expected to be hired, area newspapers 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels vice president Tim Mead declined comment on candidates to  
replace Bill Bavasi, who resigned as general manager Sept. 30. The 
Angels had hoped to have a successor named before the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've stated previously, the process continues, and there's  
not a definitive time frame,'' Mead said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman's fall was left unexplained by the club Friday night,  
though several baseball officials believed talks broke down because 
of financial differences, the Los Angeles Times reported. Bavasi 
was among baseball's lowest paid at his position. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Yankees GM Bob Watson reportedly will meet with  
Angels officials for a third interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman, vice president of baseball operations in Montreal,  
said after returning to Canada: ``All I can say is that I'm with 
the Expos right now.''

<HEADLINE>  Jarrett's Finishes Has Him Confused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett has this problem at North  
Carolina Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems like all he can do is finish second.  
</P>
<P>
	Six times in the last seven races on the 1.017-mile oval,  
Jarrett has been the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confusing situation for the second-generation NASCAR  
star, who is on the verge of winning his first Winston Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll continue the streak that we've had,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, thinking about that, he shook his head and added,  
``Actually, I don't want to continue that streak. But, if we have 
to take second, I will. We'd like to get into victory lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he keeps coming in second on a track where he has yet  
to win, Jarrett scratched his head and said, ``It's just that 
somebody always seems to be faster at the end of this race than 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's led the most laps and looked ready to win. And there also  
have been times when his Ford wasn't the second-best car at The 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case eight months ago, and it made no difference.  
</P>
<P>
	``We finished second somehow,'' Jarrett said. ``We just managed  
to do things right at the end and got into second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost to a lot of good race cars and drivers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett goes into Sunday's Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 with  
a 246-point lead over Bobby Labonte and a 319-point edge Mark 
Martin -- the only drivers with any realistic chance to catch him in 
the final four races of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	All Jarrett needs to do is finish 13th or better in each race to  
clinch the championship, no matter what Labonte and Martin do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still plan on being aggressive Sunday,'' Jarrett said. ``We  
know the best way for us not to lose any points is to win the race, 
and that's what we've come to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won the spring race here, will start from the pole,  
with Jarrett third and Labonte fifth in the 43-car lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire wear probably will determine the winner of Sunday's 393-lap  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if your car feels good on new tires, you just can't go as  
hard as you would like,'' Jarrett said. ``You just aren't going to 
have anything left at the end of that run. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I think the last 40 laps of a run are the most  
important. That's when you can make up the most time. What we do is 
work a lot with shock and spring combinations here to try to allow 
ourselves to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin noted that the asphalt pavement is just about worn out.  
</P>
<P>
	``What the pavement does to the tires makes them get real slick  
in the race, and that's not always my forte,'' Martin said. ``The 
only way I know how to go fast is to give it gas, and when I do 
that, my tires spin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darlington is the same kind of track, and we've had real good  
luck and a good record and Darlington and here. But I'd have to say 
one thing about the race track that's hard for me is the fact that 
it just eats the tires alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who leads the series with seven victories this  
season, also figures to be a factor on a track where he has won 
three of the last five races -- including this event last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	With new crew chief Brian Whitesell, Gordon has won two of the  
last three races and has moved to fourth in the standings -- 
although he trails third-place Martin by 115 points and is just 
nine ahead of sensational rookie Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to focus on winning races and seeing how far up  
in the points we can get before this year is out,'' said Gordon a 
three-time Winston Cup champ. ``We're going through what we're 
going to need in the offseason and 2000 to get ready for the new 
Monte Carlo and be back in action as a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to win races. We'd love to have 10, but we'd have to  
win three of the last four races to do that.''

<HEADLINE>  Jarrett's Finishes Has Him Confused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett has this problem at North  
Carolina Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems like all he can do is finish second.  
</P>
<P>
	Six times in the last seven races on the 1.017-mile oval,  
Jarrett has been the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confusing situation for the second-generation NASCAR  
star, who is on the verge of winning his first Winston Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll continue the streak that we've had,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, thinking about that, he shook his head and added,  
``Actually, I don't want to continue that streak. But, if we have 
to take second, I will. We'd like to get into victory lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he keeps coming in second on a track where he has yet  
to win, Jarrett scratched his head and said, ``It's just that 
somebody always seems to be faster at the end of this race than 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's led the most laps and looked ready to win. And there also  
have been times when his Ford wasn't the second-best car at The 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case eight months ago, and it made no difference.  
</P>
<P>
	``We finished second somehow,'' Jarrett said. ``We just managed  
to do things right at the end and got into second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost to a lot of good race cars and drivers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett goes into Sunday's Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 with  
a 246-point lead over Bobby Labonte and a 319-point edge Mark 
Martin -- the only drivers with any realistic chance to catch him in 
the final four races of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	All Jarrett needs to do is finish 13th or better in each race to  
clinch the championship, no matter what Labonte and Martin do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still plan on being aggressive Sunday,'' Jarrett said. ``We  
know the best way for us not to lose any points is to win the race, 
and that's what we've come to do.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bradley Tiring of 'Elbows' From Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley drew on the  
competitive fire of his basketball career as he warned Saturday 
that after restraining himself from responding directly to Vice 
President Al Gore's attacks, ``you can take the elbows only so many 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that meant he was ready to attack Gore, the former New  
Jersey senator said, ``I'm saying what I just said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on his first campaign  
tour of upstate New York, Bradley stressed that he wanted to keep 
the campaign positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to have someone to vote for as opposed to voting  
against someone and I think they yearn to have an election day with 
two candidates they esteem rather than one that they can still 
barely tolerate,'' said Bradley, who played for the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has been criticized by Gore for leaving the Senate in  
1997 as Democrats struggled against the Republican majority in 
Congress. And in an AP interview Friday, Gore branded Bradley a 
``left-of-center insurgent'' and said his plan for universal health 
insurance was a ``throwback to an earlier generation'' before 
Democratic lawmakers accepted the discipline of balanced budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who has refrained from direct counterattacks, said  
Saturday: ``I'm also a competitor and been in enough games and 
competition to know you can take the elbows only so many times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's New York surrogates resumed the criticism Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore was the only candidate that stood with us and fought  
back'' against GOP policies that would have hurt New Yorkers, said 
the state's comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Gore supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he found such attacks ``laughable,'' adding he  
sought to abide by the ideal set forth by Thomas Jefferson of a 
citizen-politician who would serve in government, depart for a time 
and then return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I served 18 years in the United States Senate representing the  
people of New Jersey and the country. I worked hard every day. I 
did my best,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has become a key battleground for Bradley and Gore.  
Recent polls have shown that Gore's once substantial lead over 
Bradley in New York has vanished and Bradley running stronger in 
the state against the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is backed by most of the state's top elected Democrats,  
with the exception of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who supports. 
New York, along with California and a host of other states, will 
hold its presidential primary March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think March 7 ... has to be the day that I take off,''  
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Bradley said he believes ``it'll be a campaign that  
will continue through the spring'' and that there is an outside 
chance the nomination might not be settled until the party's 
convention in August.

<HEADLINE> Strange To Captain Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- As a player or television golf  
analyst, Curtis Strange will be involved in the final three events 
on the PGA Tour -- a good time to starting scouting players for the 
Ryder Cup team he will take to The Belfry in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange, a two-time U.S. Open champion and member of five Ryder  
Cup teams, was selected as the next captain of a U.S. team that 
will try to retain the cup under what figures to be contentious 
conditions, a source familiar with the appointment said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA of America spokesman Julius Mason would not comment on the  
next captain, but said an announcement would be made at 10 a.m. EDT 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange declined comment at the National Car Rental Classic at  
Disney World, where he shot a 3-under 69 Friday morning to make the 
cut, then covered the afternoon rounds in his role as an analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is what I've said before, and that is it would  
be a tremendous honor,'' he said. ``I haven't heard anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a source, speaking on condition that he not be identified,  
told the AP that Strange's selection would be announced Monday 
morning at the PGA's headquarters in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Strange has been considered the leading  
candidate to succeed Ben Crenshaw since the day after the Americans 
staged the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history last month to 
defeat Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotional, tenacity,'' Tiger Woods said Friday night when  
asked what Strange would bring as a Ryder Cup captain. ``It'll be 
neat to have him over there in that environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange has won 17 times on the PGA Tour and became the first  
player since Ben Hogan to win the U.S. Open in consecutive years at 
Oak Hill in 1989. He won the Open the previous year at The Country 
Club, and was among the candidates to be captain for this year's 
Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA instead picked Crenshaw, whose team overcame a 10-6  
deficit on the final day with a dramatic singles charge that 
included such raw emotion and celebration that Europe complained 
bitterly about the Americans' lack of sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	What began with just about every American pumping his fist  
culminated with a wild charge across the 17th green when Justin 
Leonard holed a 45-foot putt that ultimately clinched the cup, 
although Jose Maria Olazabal still had a 25-foot birdie putt to 
keep the match alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery was especially notorious, hurling vicious insults at  
Colin Montgomerie and reportedly spitting on the wife of European 
captain Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange will be faced with leading a U.S. team to victory in  
Europe for the first time since 1993 at The Belfry -- and with 
handling a potentially volatile atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next two captains, whoever they are, with the PGA on both  
sides of the Atlantic, need to go out of their way to diffuse this 
situation,'' Strange said three weeks ago during the Buick 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit, the way they were treated by our galleries at  
Boston was uncalled for,'' he said. ``Nobody deserves that. There's 
an etiquette not only with the players, but with galleries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of his five Ryder Cup appearances was on a winner -- in  
1983 at the PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens -- and his 
overall record in the matches was 6-12-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Crenshaw was known as ``Gentle Ben,'' Strange was one of  
the most fiery players in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he's perceived over there, but I know he's  
tough enough to handle whatever happens,'' Davis Love III said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange won every year but two in the 1980s, culminating with  
his consecutive Open titles to close out the decade. He hasn't won 
since, and began working for ABC Sports in 1997. He continues to 
play at least 15 events on the PGA Tour each year along with his 
television work and remains close to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would be a great captain,'' Love said earlier this  
month. ``He was great at Oak Hill (as a captain's pick). He was 
like a leader. He knew things to do to pump you up, and what to do 
to keep you loose.''

<HEADLINE> Abortion Providers Apprehensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- It's the season of apprehension for  
abortion providers. During four of the last five autumns, at least 
one has been the target of a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullets have shattered sliding glass doors and windows in homes  
in western New York and Canada and struck doctors as they watched 
television, heated soup, tended to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	All the attacks, including last year's Oct. 23 killing of Dr.  
Barnett Slepian, occurred in the weeks prior to Nov. 11 -- Veterans 
Day in the United States and Remembrance Day in Canada. No one was 
shot in the fall of 1996, but two people were wounded the following 
autumn. Slepian was the first of the five victims to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors are well aware of this upcoming date,'' said Winnipeg  
Police Inspector Keith McCaskill, a spokesman for a 
Canadian-American task force that's been investigating the 
shootings since late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinics and clinic workers are reluctant to discuss specific  
security measures, but some are obvious: locked doors, surveillance 
cameras, security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been told to be more on alert this time of year, but  
we've been more on alert ever since the assassination,'' said 
Marilyn Buckham, executive director at Buffalo GYN Womenservices. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Morris Wortman, a Rochester obstetrician-gynecologist whose  
practice includes abortions, considered security from the start 
when planning his new office that opened in August. He estimated 
built-in security measures added $70,000 to the price of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that we designed into this building is an  
environment which didn't have the appearance of a bunker, but still 
afforded us the protection of a bunker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's airy and light and there's windows all over the place, so  
it really doesn't look like it's a place that's hunkering down to 
withstand a bomb blast,'' Wortman said. ``Yet it can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, a bullet from a high-powered rifle pierced Slepian's  
heart. The father of four bled to death in his wife's arms on the 
floor of their kitchen in suburban Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	James Kopp, an anti-abortion advocate with a long arrest record  
and the nickname ``Atomic Dog,'' is charged with Slepian's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	A fugitive, Kopp is also under investigation in the other fall  
shootings: Dr. Jack Fainman in 1997, shot as he watched television 
in Winnipeg, Canada; an unidentified doctor wounded in Perinton, 
N.Y., two weeks earlier; Dr. Hugh Short, shot in 1995 near 
Hamilton, Ontario; Dr. Garson Romalis, shot in 1994 with a 
high-powered rifle while sitting in his kitchen in Vancouver, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Pins on a map at the FBI office in Buffalo show where Kopp  
traveled before Slepian's death: China, Canada, Mexico, South 
America, Africa, Poland, Italy, England, India, a dozen American 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI knows where Kopp was born, a half dozen places where he  
lived, the more than two dozen places where he was arrested for 
protesting abortion, 28 different names he used. Agents know he 
worked as a caterer and in construction, did some electrical work. 
They even know that he walks with a slight limp, attends Mass 
regularly and doesn't always bathe. 
</P>
<P>
	But they don't know where he is now.  
</P>
<P>
	Offers of rewards total $1 million and he is ranked among the  
FBI's most wanted fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer he stays at large, the more likely common sense  
dictates that he's receiving some sort of help from other people,'' 
said Special Agent Paul Moskal of the FBI in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people responsible -- and it wasn't just one person -- are  
cowards,'' said Buckham, whose clinic is where Slepian worked. 
``True cowards and they have to hide. People know where he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's frightening to Wortman is the thought that, even if  
Slepian's killer does not strike again, there may be others willing 
to take up his cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who provide abortions are aware of the fact that  
if someone really wants to get to us, there's very little that we 
can do to stop it if someone's really dedicated to that cause,'' he 
said. ``So you don't sit around and think about it all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Unabomber Plea Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ever since he pleaded guilty to save his  
life, Theodore Kaczynski has insisted he wants to go to trial for 
the Unabomber killings and present his own defense -- even if it 
means facing a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals moved him one  
step closer to his goal, agreeing to hear his request -- filed from 
federal prison in Colorado -- to withdraw his guilty plea and face 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it would consider whether Kaczynski's guilty plea  
was voluntary; whether he was properly denied the right to 
represent himself; and whether a defendant, in a death penalty 
trial, has a right to prevent his court-appointed lawyer from 
presenting evidence of mental impairment as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The court found that he had made a substantial showing that his  
constitutional rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, a Harvard-trained mathematician who became a forest  
recluse, pleaded guilty in January 1998 to mail bombings that 
killed three people and injured 23. Two of the killings were in 
Sacramento and the third was in New Jersey. Kaczynski's statements 
have connected the attacks to his campaign against technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department agreed to the plea and life sentence  
after a psychiatric examination, arranged by Kaczynski's lawyers 
over his objections, concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic but 
competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski had wanted to present a defense based on his views  
about technology and the environment. But his attempts to represent 
himself or bring in a lawyer who would argue his chosen defense 
were rejected by U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell of Sacramento, 
who said the requests were made too late and would delay the case 
unduly. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell later refused to let Kaczynski set his guilty plea aside  
and found that his arguments were not serious enough to justify an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The order ``took an enormous amount of courage,'' said Michael  
Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who helped Kaczynski with his 
legal filing.

<HEADLINE> Gore Brands Bradley 'Insurgent' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, hoping to conjure  
voter distrust of free-spending liberals, brands rival Bill Bradley 
a ``left-of-center insurgent'' and his plan for universal health 
insurance a ``throwback to an earlier generation'' before 
Democratic lawmakers accepted the discipline of balanced budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore called Russia's  
Boris Yeltsin an ``on-again, off-again'' president even while 
voicing confidence that a stable Russia will carry on despite 
corruption and crime troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeltsin's episodic approach to the presidency has not helped  
their ability to get on top of all these problems,'' Gore said, 
adding that Yeltsin still is due credit for his role in Russia's 
emergence from communism. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, struggling through an unexpectedly tight  
Democratic nomination race with Bradley, met with AP editors and 
reporters Friday in the White House's Roosevelt Room, across the 
hall from the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a lucky-charm knock on the wood table as he committed  
himself to weekly, general election debates with the Republican 
nominee -- ``If I have the privilege of being the Democratic 
nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly feeling the squeeze of Bradley's competitive bankroll  
and rise in polls, Gore offered his harshest assessment yet of the 
former New Jersey senator's $65 billion plan to eliminate Medicaid 
and give poor people government subsidies to buy into the Federal 
Employee Health Benefits Program or purchase private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who has said he would tap the budget surplus to pay for  
the plan, would instead have to raise taxes or go ``deeply into 
deficits,'' Gore contended. The vice president wants to reserve the 
surplus for shoring up Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``His health care plan is a throwback to an earlier generation  
of policy analysis,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party has gained a lot of credit with voters  
over the last seven years for accepting fiscal responsibility. ... 
That means paying attention to what happens to the budget surplus 
and not squandering it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore defended the criticism implied in his new ``I stayed and  
fought'' slogan -- that Bradley is a quitter for leaving the Senate 
in 1997 and abandoning the battles with Congress' Republican 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the difference between Bradley and other Democrat  
senators who left that year, including four whose endorsements Gore 
now trumpets, is that unlike Bradley, the others ``are not running 
for president and they're not saying that they're left-of-center 
insurgents that represent the true sprit of the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning in New York on Saturday, said ``common  
sense and willing to think long term'' best described his philosphy 
on issues such as health care, poverty, and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that about 44.3 million people lacked health insurance in  
1998, about a million more than the year before, Bradley said, 
``You can either nibble around the edges of that problem or you can 
confront it and put the cost out there and very clearly state what 
it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for responding to Gore's barbs, the former professional  
basketball player said: ``I'm also a competitor and been in enough 
games and competition to know you can take the elbows only so many 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, Gore  
unspooled a point-by-point indictment of the Texas governor's 
record on everything from Social Security to nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	At once charming and prickly, Gore said he got stuck with the  
``stiff and wooden rap'' because of his habit as vice president of 
pausing before every utterance to make ``an internal vet'' of what 
he was about to say and whether it would contradict administration 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboy boots spiced his bureaucratic blue suit and a blip of bad  
grammar -- ``to get shed of that,'' he said at one point -- was 
explained away with a folksy ``that's the way it's said in 
Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been to his home state once since opening his Nashville  
headquarters. His press, research, fund raising, legal and 
accounting operations plan to remain for some time on Washington's 
K Street, the city's lobbying and legal corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore delighted in the move, bragging that one woman  
brought 12 homebaked pies by his Nashville offices last week. 
``That never happened on K Street,'' he chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
	Other points from the hourlong conversation:  
</P>
<P>
	--He rejected Bradley's call for automatic, annual increases in  
the minimum wage, indexed to the median wage. ``The president and 
the Congress should regularly increase the minimum wage with an eye 
to the circumstances that prevail at the time.'' Both Gore and 
Bradley favor a $1 increase in the current $5.15 wage. 
</P>
<P>
	--President Clinton is welcome on the Gore campaign trail.  
``He'll help in the future. I don't know how. We haven't talked 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Having served 16 years in the House and Senate, Gore said he  
knows Congress and is well-positioned to make ``a fresh start'' 
after Clinton's acrimonious relations with the Republican 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	--The vice president, who last week pledged, if elected,  
permanently to ban new drilling for oil and gas along the 
California and Florida coasts, implied dissent on Clinton's mere 
extension of a drilling moratorium last year. ``I don't talk about 
my private arguments,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	--He refused to take a position on eliminating Justice Department  
oversight of the Teamsters. The matter, being pressed by the 
powerful labor union at the same time Gore is courting its 
endorsement, should be decided ``on the legal merits not on the 
basis of what I think or what the president thinks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demand Prisoners Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Dozens of Palestinians threw rocks and gasoline  
bombs at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank town of Bethlehem on 
Saturday, demanding that Israel release Palestinian prisoners, the 
Israeli army said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers retaliated with tear gas, but no one was reported  
injured, according to the army spokesman's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Israel released 151 Arab security prisoners  
-- most of them Palestinians -- in accordance with the latest peace 
agreement. But hundreds of Palestinians still sit in Israeli jails 
for anti-Israeli activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions have been high recently at the checkpoint between  
Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem and Jerusalem over Israel's plans 
to alter the crossing procedures for Palestinians entering Israel. 
The Palestinians say the new methods discriminate against them.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Thorpe Could Miss Six Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat forward Otis Thorpe may miss the next  
six weeks after fracturing his right thumb Friday night in an 
exhibition game against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Thorpe, an offseason acquisition from  
Washington, could miss 20 regular season games, the team announced 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just someone chopping at the ball,'' Thorpe said. ``It  
was on the first possession of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe will have the thumb reexamined when the Heat return to  
Miami after Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe, in his 16th NBA season, has averaged 15 points and  
nearly nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 11.3 points and 6.8 rebounds in 49 games last season  
with the Wizards.

<HEADLINE> Warrick Back on Field To Help FSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Peter Warrick didn't put on the dazzling  
Death Valley show he did two years ago. His return Saturday night 
did, however, reunite No. 1 Florida State and helped the Seminoles 
beat Clemson 17-14 for coach Bobby Bowden's 300th victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, held out of the last two games because of legal  
troubles, caught 11 passes for 121 yards. He didn't sneak away for 
the crushing touchdowns, however, as he did in 1997. In that game, 
Warrick had a 90-yard punt return touchdown -- the first here since 
Deion Sanders in 1988 -- and caught eight passes for 249 yards and 
two TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the week, Warrick was expected to watch from the  
sideline in street clothes. But a judge accepted his plea Friday 
for misdemeanor petty theft in connection with a department store 
scam last month. Florida State officials cleared him to play and 
Bowden eagerly welcomed him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was booed loudly by Clemson's record crowd of 86,200  
when he stepped on the field for pre-game warmups. His teammates 
high-fived him and slapped his shoulder pads. Tailback Travis Minor 
hit Warrick's helmet and the two bounced on the field together. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden worked him with the first team and had him out for the  
Seminoles' first play. 
</P>
<P>
	And Warrick made an impact. His first three catches went for  
first downs. He got a pass interference penalty on Clemson defender 
Dextra Polite on one short throw. Then Warrick's apparen push-off 
on Polite that was not called led Clemson coach Tommy Bowden to 
scream at officials, who threw a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct 
and a Florida State first down. 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles quarterback Chris Weinke went to his favorite target,  
Warrick, on the first half's final play, but his ball in the end 
zone was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State athletic director Dave Hart said Friday that  
Warrick had been punished for his transgression and faced harsher 
scrutiny simply because he was a star player. ``It's time to move 
past it,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently that wasn't what Clemson fans had in mind. A sign  
outside the stadium said ``Nearest Dillard's 1 mile, Peter Warrick 
Special, 100 percent discount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tiger mascots came out dressed in black-and-white striped  
uniforms. The crowd chanted ``Jailbird, jailbird,'' after Warrick's 
push off. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Terry Bowden -- ABC Sports' analyst, Bobby's son and brother  
of Clemson coach Tommy Bowden -- referred to Warrick's situation 
during a Fellowship of Christian Athletes' breakfast Saturday 
morning when he suggested his father could buy a department store 
with his new five-year, $1.5 million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was guaranteed a top-draft slot and millions of NFL  
dollars if he left Florida State after his junior season last year. 
But he chose to come back for a run at the Heisman Trophy and 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	While Warrick's mistakes may have cost him the Heisman, his  
teammates overcame theirs to keep their national title dreams 
intact.

	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Unfair is the way Dale Jarrett  
characterized the $5,000 fine levied against his crew chief, Todd 
Parrott, for an unguarded moment during last Sunday's Winston 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrott, who was miked, along with Jarrett and the team's  
spotter, for the television broadcast on ESPN, forgot during a 
heated moment and uttered a profanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, the Winston Cup points leader, said the team had been  
told by ESPN that there would be a one-second delay, just in case 
of such slips. He also said the $5,000 penalty was too stiff for 
such a slip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to do something that would enhance the sport,''  
Jarrett said. ``We were told one thing by the people that were 
showing the race that day on TV and that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate for Todd because, I'll assure you, that  
wasn't the only profanity that was said that day along pit road. 
Todd's taken a lot of heat for it and it's not a good thing that 
that language is used, but I don't think there's anybody around 
here that hasn't at some point tried to keep that to a minimum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett said the profane outburst was heard only on television  
and not on the team's radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that the fine to Parrott was the same as was  
assessed against Tony Stewart for an incident last month in 
Martinsville in which the rookie threw the heat shields from his 
shoes at the car driven by Kenny Irwin and then reached into the 
moving car as if to take a swing at Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you fine him the same amount of money that you fined a  
guy for trying to crawl into one of the race cars and throwing 
stuff at that car?'' Jarrett asked. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND ROUND: Kenny Wallace was the fast qualifier Saturday in  
the second round of time trials for the Pop Secret Microwave 
Popcorn 400 at North Carolina Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace was unable to get his Square D Chevrolet started during  
Friday's qualifying session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The starter locked into the flywheel yesterday,'' he said.  
``It was just welded in there and wouldn't let the flywheel turn. 
I'm just glad it wasn't something internal in the motor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He came back Saturday to turn a lap at 156.161 mph, which would  
have been good enough for eighth in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think that would be a real depressing situation for  
us since we had a shot at the pole yesterday,'' Wallace said. ``But 
we look at this as an opportunity to persevere and overcome and 
build a little bit of character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger brother of longtime NASCAR star Rusty Wallace will  
start 26th in the 43-car lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Lepage took the 27th spot Saturday at 155.557, while  
Derrike Cope was 29th at 155.195. All the rest of the qualifiers 
from 25th to 36th stood on their Friday laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Added to the rear of the field as provisionals, based on  
car-owner points, were last Sunday's winner, Dale Earnhardt, his 
teammate Mike Skinner, Steve Park, Jimmy Spencer, Chad Little, 
Stacy Compton and Mike Bliss. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to make the field were Dave Marcis, Rich Bickle, Hut  
Stricklin and Ed Berrier. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPARK PLUGS: Pontiac has been the most successful manufacturer  
in Rockingham since 1988, with 10 victories in 23 Winston Cup 
races. Rusty Wallace, who leads active drivers with five victories 
here, got four of them in Pontiacs. ... Defending race winner Jeff 
Gordon, who will start fourth on Sunday, has now qualified ninth or 
better 10 consecutive times in Rockingham. Eight of those have been 
top-fives. ... John Andretti, who will start 18th, has failed to 
post a top-10 finish in 12 Rockingham races. ... Seventeen of the 
last 22, including five of the last six, Rockingham races have been 
won from a top-10 starting position.

<HEADLINE> McKiernan Looking for Marathon Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- There's nothing fancy about what Catherina  
McKiernan does. 
</P>
<P>
	She runs. A lot.  
</P>
<P>
	And she wins. A lot.  
</P>
<P>
	McKiernan, the top-ranked female distance runner in the world  
last year, has won all three marathons she's run so far and is a 
favorite to win her fourth, Sunday's LaSalle Banks Chicago 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am enjoying the success,'' she said. ``But I didn't really  
think about it, to be honest. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, 
that's fine, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the top distance runners now, McKiernan got her  
start as a child, racing around the family farm and running back 
and forth whenever she wanted to go somewhere. But while many of 
the top runners now are Kenyan, McKiernan is from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit alike,'' she said. ``When we had to go somewhere, I  
wasn't put into a car and brought there. We had to run or cycle or 
walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKiernan, 29, was already winning local races when a family  
friend introduced her to Joe Doonan, Ireland's track coach at the 
1992 Olympics. She ran shorter distances at first -- she finished 
seventh in the 10-kilometer race at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 -- 
but soon decided she was meant to race further. 
</P>
<P>
	She entered her first marathon, the Berlin Marathon, in 1997,  
and won it in 2:23:44, a women's world debut record. She ran the 
London and Amsterdam marathons the next year, winning Amsterdam 
with a personal best of 2:22:23, then the eighth-fastest time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning London, she beat Joyce Chepchumba, Chicago's  
defending champion and McKiernan's biggest competition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's field, 1997 champion Khalid Khannouchi is favored,  
as are world-record holder Ronaldo da Costa, defending Chicago 
champion Ondoro Osoro and South Africa's Hendrik Ramaala. 
</P>
<P>
	The top Americans are Todd Williams, and Libbie Hickman and  
Kristy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	McKiernan was supposed to run London again this year, but she  
withdrew after injuring her Achilles' tendon. Instead, she's run 
six road races, winning two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 103 races in her career, she's won 42 of them (41  
percent). She also has 21 second-place finishes and eight 
third-places. 
</P>
<P>
	Though McKiernan has run other races in the United States, this  
will be her first marathon here. 
</P>
<P>
	``No answer,'' she said with a smile when asked why she chose  
Chicago. ``I believe this is a very fast and flat course. It's my 
fourth marathon, but first in America, so that's a little bit 
exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be plenty of people cheering her on. McKiernan, a  
star in Ireland, has been told there will be dozens of Irish and 
Irish-Americans lining the route. Some bars plan to play Irish 
music, and McKiernan said she expects to see plenty of Irish flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully my supporters can all have a few Guinnesses after  
the race in celebration,'' she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	If this marathon is anything like her last three, count on it.

<HEADLINE>  USOC Votes on Drug Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Proponents of an independent  
drug-testing agency for American Olympic athletes want baseball, 
NBA and NHL players to submit to random tests long before the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Those pro athletes currently escape scrutiny until 120 days  
before the games since their sports do not ban or test for most of 
the performance-enhancing drugs, such as androstenedione, barred by 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only would the pros be subject to earlier tests without  
warning, but the names of those who flunk the tests would be made 
public by their sport's international federations. In the pro 
sports, violators' names are kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the players unions will have issues with all of  
this,'' said Frank Marshall, the Hollywood producer serving as a 
public sector member of the U.S. Olympic Committee and heading up a 
task force recommending a powerful and independent drug agency. 
``My opinion is if you want to go to the Olympics, you have to go 
along with the testing program. We can't have exceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall would have the athletes submit to the Olympic testing  
as soon as they are named to the Olympic athlete pool, which could 
be six months or more before the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to quell criticism of its drug-testing program, the USOC  
is expected to approve the independent agency to control everything 
from test samples to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would take domestic drug testing entirely out of  
the USOC's hands and remove the USOC and its governing bodies from 
the hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC board of directors, meeting today and Sunday, will vote  
on whether to approve funding of up to $24 million for four years 
for the new agency, double the amount the USOC now spends on drug 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, one of the byproducts of this would be to take us  
out of the glare of the kind of criticism that we get, particularly 
from European countries, that we do our own drug testing, therefore 
we're the fox guarding the henhouse,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``This group would have a board of directors and employees 
that would be chosen by itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which would still use IOC-accredited labs in  
Indianapolis and Los Angeles, would be responsible for the 
collection of test samples, handling, processing, transportation, 
lab results, notification, sanctions and the appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have scandals around the games like those we've  
experienced (in Salt Lake City), but those involve 
administrators,'' USOC executive director Dick Schultz said after 
Friday's executive committee meeting. ``But if we ever got to the 
point where the world thought every athlete that participated in 
the games was doping, the games would go away in a hurry. This will 
provide more credibility overall and a higher comfort level to all 
athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the new agency is approved, a bid process will be held to  
select the company that would run the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, producer of ``The Sixth Sense,'' and the Indiana Jones  
trilogy, said ``the USOC will have a voice but not control'' of the 
group despite the plan to have it approve of some members of the 
agency's board. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, the agency is totally independent,''  
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall called the agency and drug-testing guidelines ``a work  
in progress,'' particularly in regard to the testing of pro 
athletes who participate in the Olympics. Baseball, the NBA, and 
the NHL have different drug-testing rules and don't ban the same 
drugs as the Olympics. Andro and other testosterone boosters, for 
example, are banned in the Olympics but not in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items on the USOC board's agenda this weekend are the  
selection of the U.S. bid city for the 2007 Pan American Games -- 
either the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina or San Antonio -- 
and a report on restructuring the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by McKinsey and Co., which has been making a  
management review of the USOC for nearly six months, will recommend 
structural changes. Among those will be a redefinition of the 
duties of the president and executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations will require a change in the USOC  
constitution, which could not take place before the next board 
meeting in February.

<HEADLINE> Man Questioned in Rep.'s Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK LAWN, Ill. (AP) -- Police have taken one of two men sought  
for questioning into custody in the killing of the son of U.S. Rep. 
Bobby Rush, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to identify the man, who was not considered  
a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Huey Rich, 29, was pronounced dead at 12:59 p.m. Friday,  
according to Cindi Jaranowski, a spokeswoman at Christ Hospital and 
Medical Center in the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Rich was talking with some friends Monday night  
outside his South Side Chicago home when they were approached by 
two gunmen pretending to be police officers. One of them shot Rich 
in the groin and thigh and then fled in a car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said they do not believe the shooting was random.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Friday, Rush said he and his family  
``are filled with overwhelming grief.''

administrators,'' USOC executive director Dick Schultz said after 
Friday's executive committee meeting. ``But if we ever got to the 
point where the world thought every athlete that participated in 
the games was doping, the games would go away in a hurry. This will 
provide more credibility overall and a higher comfort level to all 
athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the new agency is approved, a bid process will be held to  
select the company that would run the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, producer of ``The Sixth Sense,'' and the Indiana Jones  
trilogy, said ``the USOC will have a voice but not control'' of the 
group despite the plan to have it approve of some members of the 
agency's board. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, the agency is totally independent,''  
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall called the agency and drug-testing guidelines ``a work  
in progress,'' particularly in regard to the testing of pro 
athletes who participate in the Olympics. Baseball, the NBA, and 
the NHL have different drug-testing rules and don't ban the same 
drugs as the Olympics. Andro and other testosterone boosters, for 
example, are banned in the Olympics but not in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items on the USOC board's agenda this weekend are the  
selection of the U.S. bid city for the 2007 Pan American Games -- 
either the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina or San Antonio -- 
and a report on restructuring the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by McKinsey and Co., which has been making a  
management review of the USOC for nearly six months, will recommend 
structural changes. Among those will be a redefinition of the 
duties of the president and executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations will require a change in the USOC  
constitution, which could not take place before the next board 
meeting in February.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Fire stayed alive in the MLS Western  
Conference semifinals with a 4-0 victory over the Dallas Burn on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago evened the best-of-3 series with the deciding game to be  
played Wednesday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire, the defending MLS Cup champions, dominated the play  
early, and it paid off when Peter Nowak opened the scoring in the 
18th minute. Diego Gutierrez sent a pass to Nowak, who was alone in 
the box, dribbled ahead to his left and sent a shot past Dallas 
goalie Matt Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burn had a six-game winning streak entering the match but  
was 0-9 this season when conceding the first goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire put the game away with two goals in the last 10 minutes  
of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Kosecki's shot in the 36th minute found the left side of  
the net when it deflected off the leg of Dallas defender Richard 
Farrer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ante Razov gave Chicago a 3-0 lead in the 43rd minute. With his  
back to the goal just outside the box on the right, he turned and 
fired a shot that curved into the left side of the net. Jesse 
Marsch and goalie Zach Thornton earned assists on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dodd replaced Jordan in goal for Dallas at halftime, but it  
didn't slow down the Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Halftime substitute Dema Kovalenko gave his team a 4-0 lead in  
the 46th minute when he knocked Kosecki's pass down to his left 
foot in front of Dodd, just to the left of the net, and converted 
the point-blank shot. Nowak also earned an assist on the play.

<HEADLINE> FIA Decision Spurs Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The controversial decision to reinstate Ferrari's  
1-2 finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix assures Formula One a 
thrilling finish next weekend in Japan -- and more charges of 
bending the rules for commercial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the FIA's International Court of Appeal on  
Saturday brought cries of foul play from rival McLaren -- which had 
been celebrating a second straight championship Mika Hakkinen -- and 
raised questions about F1's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling from the five-member panel of lawyers means Ferrari's  
Eddie Irvine has a four-point lead on Hakkinen entering the Oct. 
31. season finale in the Japanese Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraris driven by Irvine and Michael Schumacher finished 1-2  
last Sunday in Malaysia, but were disqualified because their 
aerodynamic deflectors didn't comply with FIA regulations. Hakkinen 
was moved up from third and given the race win and season title. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari is the biggest-spending but longest-suffering of the top  
teams in F1. On the verge of its first drivers' championship in 20 
years, the Italian team convinced the court the deflectors were 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To punish someone you need two things,'' said Ferrari's chief  
legal officer Jean-Pierre Martel. ``A clear set of rules and 
acknowledgment that the rules have been broken. We proved that 
neither of those were shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren managing director Ron Dennis was sharply critical,  
suggesting that ``commercial'' pressure had influenced the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the push now for our sport has inevitably become  
quite commercial,'' he said. ``Everybody wants to have an exciting 
race in Japan. But I think the price we pay for that one race is 
too great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of commercial pressure from Bernie Ecclestone surfaced  
after the Formula One owner called Ferrari's disqualification 
``nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before announcing the decision, FIA President Max Mosley  
sought to downplay Ecclestone's influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Bernie has a big influence on the financial aspects of  
F1, he has only a small influence in making the rules and 
absolutely no role in enforcing them,'' Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley explained the court's decision by saying that Ferrari had  
raised valid criticisms of ``the methods of measurement and clarity 
of regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley, who said the stewards' decision was justified because of  
the information and measuring equipment made available to them, 
revealed that Ferrari had proved its case by the narrowest of 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ferrari was just within the tolerance permitted,'' he  
explained. ``It was a millimeter or less on each dimension. They 
were absolutely on the limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the stewards had reached one conclusion and a panel of  
lawyers six days later had reached another, he said ``engineers 
will know a specification, but lawyers will show inconsistencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not in the least worried by the reaction of other teams  
because the Court of Appeal is independent and that has been 
demonstrated by the fact that they criticized the FIA,'' Mosley 
said. ``The British will say that the decision was made because of 
Ferrari, but Italians say justice has been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari was delighted with the outcome -- only the fourth  
successful appeal in the last 16 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were given back what we had deserved on the track ... now  
we want to win for Ferrari both the drivers and the manufacturers 
titles in Suzuka,'' Irvine said in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, speaking from an undisclosed location in Asia,  
accepted the reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The events of the last week are now behind us and I am -- as  
always -- focusing on the next race,'' the Finnish driver said. ``I 
am looking forward to the Japanese Grand Prix and I will do my best 
to win the race and the world championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McLaren vowed to continue its fight to win the title,  
Dennis said it was ridiculous to say the measuring equipment used 
in Malaysia wasn't up to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	``A piece of equipment that costs many millions of dollars ...  
which has been used in the past and probably in the future ... 
suddenly has been brought into question,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis added that the aerodynamic deflector almost certainly  
could have helped performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's slightly hypocritical to say there was no  
performance influence because that is a very aerodynamically 
critical area on the car,'' he said. ``Hence, the reason why those 
components were covered up every time the car stopped.''

<HEADLINE> Iron Curtain Still Unforgotten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- Ten years ago, as the Soviet bloc was  
disintegrating and the Iron Curtain was about to recede into	
history, Associated Press Correspondent Marcus Eliason and	
Photographer Diether Endlicher traveled along Europe's infamous	
divide. As the 10th anniversary of the epic event approaches, they	
have retraced their journey.	
</P>
<P>
	ALONG THE FORMER IRON CURTAIN (AP) -- In a row of cages where  
border guards used to keep their attack dogs, Germans can now 
kennel their pets when they go on holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	An abandoned watchtower houses a ham radio club. Outside drab  
socialist-style apartment blocks, relics of life in a vanished 
country called East Germany, the arches of McDonalds glow in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small town on the edge of what used to be called the Iron  
Curtain, the offices of the defunct collective farm system house a 
bank (``WE OPEN NEW HORIZONS''). Standing on what was once 
communism's front line in its struggle with the West, I stick a New 
York-issued card in the ATM. Out pops a 100-deutsche mark bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming back after 10 years to retrace a journey I had made in  
the dying days of the Iron Curtain, I can only marvel at how 
thoroughly the monstrous scar has been erased, as though by some 
cosmic cosmetician. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads that ended in blank walls now flow seamlessly between  
villages. Border patrol roads have become cycle paths. Minefields 
have gone back to sprouting corn and rye. The steel mesh wire from 
which the Iron Curtain was woven has become garden fences, firewood 
holders, souvenirs. Where walls and watchtowers still stand, they 
have been left as monuments for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, the borders of Hungary and the former  
Czechoslovakia, once prison fences for entire nations, now lie open 
to visa-free traffic. Poles that held up the fence between Austria 
and Hungary have become climbing frames for grapevines. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is momentous; look at the map: At the northern end of  
the Iron Curtain two countries have become one (Germany); in the 
middle, one country (Czechoslovakia) has broken in two; and at the 
southern end, a new country, Slovenia, has emerged from the 
wreckage of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is also agonizing.  
</P>
<P>
	After the euphoria over the collapse of the Iron Curtain had  
died down and East Germany's impoverishment was exposed to the raw 
winds of capitalism, Angelika Gunsenheimer was not a very happy 
ex-East German. Her job as a librarian vanished when the regional 
library was scrapped for lack of funds. The farm tools factory 
where her husband worked was going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	The last straw was her discovery, at a country fair, that the  
mobile library which she used to send from village to village had 
been turned into a public toilet. 
</P>
<P>
	What has become of us? She remembers asking friends, loudly and  
publicly. Where was ``the solidarity of the old times'' that 
sustained them through the privations of communist life? People 
used to appreciate literature; they would get together to read 
Gogol, Hemingway, Hugo. But ``nowadays the only time we meet is at 
Tupperware sales.'' The ignoble fate of the library showed, she 
said, that ``Culture is down the toilet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There things might have ended -- with one more embittered East  
German family living on handouts from the new West German masters 
in the less than perfect world that supplanted the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Gunsenheimers got into vacuum cleaners.  
</P>
<P>
	Traveling door to door for a German appliances firm, the couple  
have become champion salespeople with trophies from the company to 
prove it, peddling the same material comforts that so affronted 
Mrs. Gunsenheimer years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A cellphone strapped to her belt, hefting a vacuum cleaner into  
the trunk of her shiny green VW Golf, Mrs. Gunsenheimer is a 
pantsuited career woman, much changed from the shy librarian I 
first met 10 years ago on the day her patch of the Iron Curtain in 
the village of Lindenau was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	As a story of lives crushed and rebuilt, the Gunsenheimers  
exemplify the rebuilding of lives that is going on along the line 
where concrete and barbed wire, mines and machine guns disfigured 
Europe for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Baltic to the Adriatic, in the late Sir Winston  
Churchill's 1946 definition, the Iron Curtain ran for 1,660 miles, 
nowhere so starkly as through Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 900 people who tried to escape were killed by mines,  
drowning or gunfire. East German guards were trained never to wave 
or speak to people on the other side. Nowhere was the trite old 
Cold War phrase more vividly applicable: ``Freedom ends here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, on Nov. 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall opened. Within days,  
the rest of Germany's dividing line began disappearing, so quickly 
that photographer Diether Endlicher and I often found ourselves 
chasing the fence as workers rolled it up and trucked it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``You missed them!'' Villagers would triumphantly inform us.  
``Try 10 kilometers down the road.'' And wherever the dike 
collapsed, rivers of cheering, weeping Germans burst through. 
</P>
<P>
	In the south, Hungary had begun dismantling its border fence  
with Austria the previous summer, loosening the thread that would 
unravel the whole Iron Curtain. Soon after the Berlin Wall came 
down, Czechoslovakia tore down its fences. And by December 1989, 
Europe's man-made continental divide was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the barbed wire is being taken away,'' a 75-year-old  
Austrian named Johan Pavtits said to me 10 years ago, ``and the 
world is whole again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite. The lingering divisions resurface in words  
heard in almost every conversation: ``Ossis'' (easterners) and 
``Wessis'' (westerners), separated by ``a border in the mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wessis complain that their taxes are squandered on Ossis who,  
conditioned by communism, are lazy and won't take charge of their 
lives. The former communists, reborn as the Party of Democratic 
Socialism, have scored heavily in recent regional elections. To the 
Wessis, that looks like ingratitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ossis feel that the Wessis shoved them into the capitalist  
jungle and now look down on them for being poor. They hear Wessis 
make fun of their accents, their work habits, their way of life. 
Western money spent to raise Eastern living standards makes Ossis 
feel like freeloaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am repeatedly told that I don't deserve the pension I am  
getting,'' said Sigrid Baumgardt, a retired schoolteacher and 
ex-East German who was sunbathing on the nude beach where the Iron 
Curtain once burst out of the Baltic. 
</P>
<P>
	From Schoenberg, the small town where she taught, Mrs. Baumgardt  
and her husband could see the churchtowers of Luebeck, beyond the 
wall. After reunification, they moved there. Now, she says, she 
often finds herself explaining Ossis and Wessis to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	To the Ossis who find the Wessis arrogant and overbearing, she  
explains that Wessis ``say what they think. They have more 
self-confidence.'' To Wessis, she explains that Ossis feel ignored 
or misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernst Wackernagel, a former West German border policeman who  
guided us around the Luebeck area 10 years ago and again last 
month, sounds exasperated that people are so fixated on what they 
DON'T have. He remembers the first time he visited the village just 
across the border from Travemuende -- the potholes, the chickens in 
the yards, the sagging roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now the road is wonderfully repaved,'' he says. ``The  
roofs are tiled, the walls are painted, the sidewalks paved, and 
still they mumble and grumble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government says more than $4 billion has been spent to  
subsidize the renovation of more than 4 million homes in the former 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In Poetenitz, a little town across the border from Luebeck  
dominated by a derelict collective farm headquarters, we drive past 
attractive new cottages. ``Stake your claim to a piece of unspoiled 
world,'' says a realtor's billboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is one way of closing the gap. Another is to stress shared  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Stop! Border Ahead!'' signs have been replaced by  
provincial border markers bearing ancient coats-of-arms -- Luebeck's 
eagle, for instance, alongside neighboring Mecklenburg's crowned 
ox. 
</P>
<P>
	Museums that have sprung up along the old border don't dwell  
just on the fence; they exhibit old plows and documents tracing the 
local history back to the 12th century. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent history still entails unfinished business.  
</P>
<P>
	In Schlagsdorf, Wilfried Krause, the Lutheran pastor, showed us  
the 180-page file the East German secret police kept on him. It 
listed the code names of the 17 people -- 17 in a town of 2,000 -- 
who had him under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The snooping was obsessive. With an impish grin, Krause read out  
selected examples: Son refused to vote in an election ... Wife shy, 
limits herself to one glass of wine at festive occasions ... Pastor 
rang church bells for world peace in 1985. ``The ringing was only 
heard in a very narrow radius as it was the smaller bell that was 
used,'' the informant, ``Hans Ritter,'' diligently reported. 
</P>
<P>
	How do you live among neighbors who once spied on you? It was a  
question that was clearly troubling the pastor. He had applied to 
the government to be told whom they were, but now, he said, he was 
beginning to wish he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Zicherie, farther south, had once shared a school and a fire  
engine with its sister hamlet of Boeckwitz. Then the Iron Curtain 
separated them. 
</P>
<P>
	For 33 years, Adolf Matthies could not visit his father's grave  
a mile over the border. A former mayor of Zicherie, he is 83 now, 
sipping wine in his living room and showing off voluminous 
scrapbooks and diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the two villages had knitted themselves together  
again, he paused, then carefully said: ``The atmosphere is a little 
poisoned.'' The usual Ossi-Wessi prejudices are compounded by 
contentious land claims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On both sides there are people who say we need to put the  
border back. That's dumb,'' he said. ``The antagonisms will fade 
away, and when the last political bigshot in the east, and the last 
blabbermouth in the west, are dead, then this country will really 
grow together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthies pointed to an inscription in his visitors' book written  
by an East German official with whom he conspired at the height of 
the Cold War to solve a drainage problem that was troubling both 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
	The inscription said: ``Despite barbed wire and mines, we  
remained human beings and we became friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heike Schultze hasn't made any Ossi friends. A hotelkeeper in  
Hitzacker, on the Elbe River, she has seen business decline now 
that travelers can carry on eastward across a fine new bridge down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not reliable people. They say bad things about the  
West but they take our money,'' she grumbled. ``We've thrown away 
billions on the East, and for what?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Rueterberg, across the river, Gabi Hamer  
described a very different experience. She moved to Rueterberg with 
her husband and son from the West a year ago. Standing in the 
garden of the family's new wooden cottage, she spoke of going to 
the village festival and being swept up in the rejoicing. ``They 
were so warm, so hearty. It was the most fun I ever had. It could 
never happen on the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This fondness for a simpler, less cynical way of life is a  
recurrent theme among many Wessis. They sense in Ossis an 
innocence, an ability to make do with little, that reminds them of 
their own lean years after they lost the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hamer's remarks took me back to an afternoon I spent at a  
farm near the border in the 1980s. Channel-flipping the TV, I saw 
cartoons and ads for toys on the West German network, while the 
East German kiddie program showed how to make an air-powered model 
boat out of an egg carton, a balloon and a straw. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't remember the cartoons, but I can still make that boat.  
</P>
<P>
	After five days exploring a vanished border, it's a mild shock  
to come upon a real one. Even before the Iron Curtain came down, 
the Czechoslovakian frontier was relatively open to foreigners. But 
the real surprise, for someone coming back a decade later, is to be 
waved into the Czech Republic with only a perfunctory passport 
check. No visa is needed, no obligatory changing of hard currency. 
This half of the former Czechoslovakia (it separated from Slovakia 
in 1993) has made so much progress toward democracy and a market 
economy that it is a candidate for membership in the new, 
border-free European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Heiner Aichinger, a German border police officer, said he  
had seen command of the Czech border force change three times since 
the communists were ousted, and each change was an improvement. 
Today, he said, ``They have the same idea as us of how a police 
force in a democratic society should act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, the German border police spent much of their time  
helping refugees from the communist regime to safety. Now they try 
to keep out illegal immigrants, mainly from impoverished former 
communist countries, coming in search of jobs and better living 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iron Curtain, it is now said, has become the Golden Curtain.  
</P>
<P>
	At a border police station in Rehau, 11 Romanian gypsies were  
being fingerprinted. Heat sensors monitored by German border police 
had detected them in a Renault van at a disused border crossing at 
4:55 a.m. The driver, his accomplice and the oldest man in the 
group would stand trial and could be jailed for up to two years, 
police said. The others would be flown back to Romania the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the border from Germany, In the Czech city of Asch,  
graceful old buildings look in need of some paint, and the 
prostitutes standing forlorn on street corners do little to enhance 
its stature. But here too there are signs of renewal: buildings in 
scaffolding, new gas stations, billboards everywhere advertising 
``mobilni telefony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the south lies Bratislava, capital of Slovakia. Ten years  
ago, I came upon a city that had just witnessed the death of 
communism and was covered in graffiti celebrating its freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bratislava's high-rise apartment blocks, built to classic  
communist standards of ugly uniformity, still cast their forbidding 
gaze across the border into Austria. The drug-infested buildings 
have been blitzed with a new, unintelligible kind of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are beginning to look up, however. After replacing an  
authoritarian prime minister with a more committed democrat, 
Mikulas Dzurinda, Slovakia is back in the running to join the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In this corner of Central Europe, it is not hard to understand  
the continent's urge to unite. Here Its fractured borders and 
ethnic shadings become more striking -- the empty countryside in the 
Czech Republic from which hundreds of thousands of Germans were 
expelled after World War II; the Austrian border stones marked 
1922, a reminder of World War I and the breakup of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire; the Croatian settlements in Austria, 
signaling that the troubled Balkans lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	So what had changed since we last met? I asked Heinz Ritter, a  
historian who showed us around Lutzmannsburg 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I lock my car in the garage,'' he laughed, referring to  
the illegal immigrants who occasionally pass through and steal a 
car to speed their journey. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, far more had changed. Ten years ago, Ritter had taken  
me to the border to gaze at the Hungarian village of Szira through 
barbed wire. Now the fence was gone and Ritter and I could have 
easily strolled the 300 yards to Szira to visit his friends, the 
Kobors. Instead, we drove 10 miles to Szira via a border 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	How had life changed for the Kobors? ``The region has developed,  
the infrastructure is better. Movement is free, you can go wherever 
you want, if you can afford it,'' said Laszlo Kobor, 67. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bad old days, his wife Gizi had to join the communist  
party to keep her job as a schoolteacher and wasn't allowed to go 
to church. In May, their granddaughter, Zsofi, had her first 
communion. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for an appropriate place to end the journey, I walked  
deep into the cornfields where the last wrinkles of the Alps 
flatten out into the Hungarian plains, and the Austrian, Hungarian 
and Slovakian borders meet in a circle of border markers and stone 
sculptures created by artists of the three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a sky piled high with clouds, a tractor puttering  
contentedly in the distance and not a fence in sight, I tried to 
collect my thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, the Iron Curtain had seemed indestructible, immutable. It  
would have been ridiculous to imagine I would one day stand at this 
junction of the Great Wall of Europe, exchanging pleasantries with 
two amiable Slovakian border guards. 
</P>
<P>
	My mind wandered to other walls that had seemed so permanent.  
Ten years ago, could I have imagined that Nelson Mandela would soon 
go free and become president of South Africa? Or that Yitzhak Rabin 
and Yasser Arafat would shake hands? 
</P>
<P>
	I thought again, as I had 10 years ago, of the German poet  
Friedrich Georg Junger, and ``Ultima Ratio,'' his poem about the 
collapse of the Third Reich. As a reminder that all things must 
pass, it seemed just as applicable to the Iron Curtain: 
</P>
<P>
	``Like vapor, the titanic scheme  
</P>
<P>
	Is dissipated.  
</P>
<P>
	Everything grows rusty now  
</P>
<P>
	That they created.''

<HEADLINE> Some Advice for Sports Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Those poor citizens of Boston who insist on rooting for the Red  
Sox ought to be used to aggravation by now. But when they saw 
another disappointment taking shape, they responded by littering 
Fenway Park with debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that was a great idea, wasn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	The Sox are losing, so let me heave this water bottle on the  
field. That'll fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of running out and buying books by kindred souls like  
longtime Red Sox devotees Stephen King or Doris Kearns Goodwin, 
they chose to behave like louts. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe what they need is an appointment with a shrink. Here, at  
no charge, is what Dr. Leonard Zaichkowsky, a sports psychologist 
at Boston University, thinks about their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy,'' he said. ``We have seen this phenomenon  
elsewhere in South America and Europe. I spent some time in 
Australia and it was the same for Aussie football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Boston fans, Zaichkowsky offered this explanation.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was the frustration of losing to the Yankees, the Evil  
Empire,'' he said. ``That's really terrible. The Curse of the 
Bambino is there. There is a century of history impacting the fans, 
who learn it from their parents and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you have the other evil people, the umpires, ganging up  
on them, too. It's fueled by a few too many Budweisers and it 
becomes social contagion, like the wave, with everybody hooting and 
hollering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Wann of Murray State University has done extensive  
studies on fan behavior. He thinks the Yankees connection was 
central to the unpleasantness in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the disposition theory,'' he said. ``Fans like two  
kinds of games, one where their team wins and one where their rival 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing if your best friend runs off with your fiancee,  
but if your worst enemy runs off with your fiancee, that's as bad 
as it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So there were the Yankees, running off with their 34th American  
League pennant, all of them since 1921, three years after the Red 
Sox last won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gimme a water bottle.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a psychological connection for fans,'' Wann said.  
``The team is an extension of who they are. If you identify as a 
Red Sox fan, to some extent you learn to live with frustration. But 
if you feel you're getting gypped by the umps, it's not just the 
Red Sox, it's you being gypped. As a fan, there's nothing you can 
do. The players come back the next day. The fan? What can he do? 
It's almost a control issue. There's nothing they can do. That lack 
of control can be problematic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our research shows highly identified fans are better off  
psychologically. They are less depressed and less lonely. It's 
beneficial. Camaraderie with others is a buffer for negativity in 
their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's not like the Red Sox invented frustration. Check out  
the Brooklyn Dodgers of the '40s and '50s, who absorbed their share 
of punishment from a previous generation of Yankees. Their fans 
skunked off into the night, mumbling, ``Wait till next year,'' 
instead of heaving stuff on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our society has changed,'' Zaichkowsky said. ``Television  
socializes us with bizarre behavior. Rationality overrides emotions 
at home. At games, emotions overpower the intellectual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might explain why a couple of years ago a Wrigley Field  
fan, outraged when Randy Myers gave up a home run, hopped out of 
the stands to confront the pitcher. The fact that Myers dabbled in 
martial arts made this a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
	And this season, a fan at Milwaukee's County Stadium decided to  
go after Houston's Bill Spiers, who was doing nothing more 
offensive than playing right field for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans generally stayed in the stands before, although there have  
been some departures from that rule. There was the case in Ebbets 
Field, for example, when a Dodgers fan went after umpire George 
Magerkurth, pummeling him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a dandy brawl and it would be nice to report that it was  
triggered strictly by the fan's passion for his team. 
Unfortunately, that was not the case. It turned out the guy was 
creating a diversion while his pickpocket partner worked the 
stands.

<HEADLINE> Co. Gives Same-Sex Partners Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. has joined the growing number of  
major corporations that extends health-care benefits to the 
same-sex domestic partners of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the need to maintain a quality work force and the  
benefits of diversity, Boeing announced late Friday plans to offer 
the benefits next year to the domestic partners of salaried 
nonunion employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced to company managers by e-mail, was  
praised by gay rights advocates. But it was criticized by union 
leaders for leaving out their members and unmarried heterosexual 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Annetta Small, director of the West Coast office of Kerusso  
Ministries, which seeks to persuade gays and lesbians to become 
heterosexual through Christianity, also was critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are giving benefits to a behavior that I believe is wrong  
and that I believe is immoral,'' she said. ``I don't believe that 
we should extend these benefits to people who are not married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not say how many employees would be  
affected. Roughly half of Boeing's 202,000 employees worldwide are 
salaried and nonunion. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Forbes Magazine survey indicated unmarried partners are  
covered by health benefits in 10 percent of the businesses with at 
least 200 employees. Companies that provide same-sex partner 
benefits include Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., IBM, 
Walt Disney Co., Honeywell and Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, United Airlines agreed to extend some benefits to  
domestic partners, just hours after an appeals court refused to 
grant the company an exemption to a San Francisco ordinance 
mandating certain benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two weeks of United's decision, American Airlines and US  
Airways also adopted the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's decision was long overdue, said Charles Fay, chairman  
of Hands-Off Washington in Snohomish County, and Dennis Rybicki, a 
spokesman for the Snohomish County Elections Committee, which ranks 
political candidates on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should send a signal to other employers, large and small,  
that it's good business to recognize the value of all families,'' 
Fay said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Society of Professional  
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, Charles Bofferding, said his 
union would like the benefits, but the move seemed to be designed 
to sabotage his group's contract negotiations, which begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	SPEEA is the second-largest union at Boeing, representing 23,000  
scientists, engineers and technical workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bofferding said by leaving out union members, Boeing may be  
trying to get the union to give up other potential bargaining 
demands in exchange for obtaining health-care benefits for same-sex 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the benefits will not be  
offered to unmarried heterosexual partners because they can get 
married, an option not legally available to same-sex partners.

<HEADLINE> Cone, Millwood To Pitch Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood and David Cone have very different  
memories of the last time the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees 
met in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cone pitched the momentum shifting Game 3 against Atlanta  
in 1996, Millwood was struggling to stay awake in an Australian 
casino watching the games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they will oppose each other in Game 2 of this year's  
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably the most exciting time of my baseball  
career up until now,'' said Millwood, who was pitching in the 
Australian winter league in 1996. ``I was able to make the All-Star 
team this year and that was a lot of fun. But that comes second 
fiddle to something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Series starts are nothing new for Cone, who made his first  
in 1992 for Toronto against Atlanta and will make his fifth Sunday. 
Three of his previous four have come against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always know they're going to be tight games,'' Cone said.  
``Because of Atlanta's pitching, the margin for error is very 
minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone's start against Atlanta in Game 3 in 1996 might have been  
his most memorable. The Braves won the first two games, outscoring 
New York 16-1 at Yankee Stadium, and headed home confident they 
would repeat as World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Cone held Atlanta to one run and four hits over six  
innings and the Yankees won 5-2. New York went on to win the next 
three games and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game turned the Series around and gave us credibility  
again,'' Cone said. ``At that point, down 2-0, the Braves were 
talking about their place in history and people were saying it was 
a complete mismatch. That got us back in the Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood was originally scheduled to start Game 3 on Tuesday in  
New York. But after Tom Glavine was scratched from his Game 1 start 
because of the flu, manager Bobby Cox moved Millwood to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem he had was selling two of his tickets to  
another player thinking he wasn't pitching,'' Cox said. ``Because 
of his family members, he had to get the two tickets back. That's 
the only problem he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood got his tickets back, but now he's looking for more.  
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone's got any, let me know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old right-hander has been Atlanta's most consistent  
starter this season on a staff filled with Cy Young Award winners. 
Millwood went 18-7 with a 2.68 ERA and led the majors with a .202 
batting average against. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood has been even better in his first postseason. He is 2-0  
with one save and a 2.38 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unfazed by the change and even thinks it might benefit  
him to pitch at home instead of at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really matter to me where I pitch, but if I had to  
pick, I'd much rather pitch at home,'' Millwood said. ``I think our 
field being a little bigger down the line frees you up to be able 
to do a little bit more with their lefties.''

<HEADLINE> World Series Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Although New York Yankees infielder Luis Sojo  
will miss the first two games of the World Series in Atlanta 
because of his father's death, manager Joe Torre chose to keep the 
utility player on the roster instead of outfielder Shane Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing against Spencer,'' Torre said Saturday before  
Game 1. ``I just think keeping a second infielder is more 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other backup utility infielder is rookie Clay Bellinger.  
</P>
<P>
	Sojo's father died in a New Jersey hospital on Thursday after  
being rushed there during the first game of the American League 
Championship Series against Boston last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``His father had emergency surgery and everything seemed to be  
going well,'' Torre said. ``I understand, they were basically just 
changing rooms in the hospital and he passed away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said he spoke with Sojo earlier Saturday before the  
infielder left for his native Venezuela with his mother to help 
with funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Sojo plans to be back Tuesday for Game 3 in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	Sojo played in two postseason games, being used primarily as a  
late-inning defensive replacement for second baseman Chuck 
Knoblauch. During the regular season he hit .252 with two home runs 
and 16 RBIs in 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAYLOR MEETING:* Atlanta hitting coach Don Baylor, who managed  
the Colorado Rockies until he was fired after last season, may meet 
with Cleveland general manager John Hart about the Indians 
managerial opening. Hart is looking to interview both Baylor and 
Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who has interviewed with the Anaheim Angels, Chicago  
Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers, turned down Hart's original suggestion 
to meet Friday. He did say he may get together with Hart on Sunday, 
but preferred to wait until the World Series was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Sunday, if I can do it,'' said Baylor, who said he would  
seriously consider the Indians. ``I didn't make any promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart has already interviewed Indians hitting coach Charlie  
Manuel, who is considered the frontrunner, fired Cubs manager Jim 
Riggleman and former Toronto manager Cito Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YOGI MEETS:* Former New York Yankees great and Hall of Famer  
Yogi Berra spoke with Atlanta manager Bobby Cox for about 20 
minutes in the Braves dugout prior to the game. While they were 
talking, Game 1 starter Greg Maddux strolled by and was introduced 
to Berra, shaking hands with the former catcher. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG SLEEP:* Asked whether baseball should start postseason  
games a little earlier due to their length, Atlanta Braves manager 
Bobby Cox agreed that changes may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very true our games are ending extremely late,'' he said,  
adding the 8 p.m. starts are all right with the players but ``the 
fans, the young kids, obviously are going to fall asleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I myself fell asleep when Boston was rallying in the eighth  
inning in Boston against the Yankees,'' he said of Game 5 of the 
ALCS, the clinching 6-1 victory by New York, which lasted 4 hours 
and 9 minutes and wasn't over until 12:27 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up, they were wrapping up the ball game, and it's hard  
to stay up,'' said Cox, adding he understood the other side, too. 
``The television rights to it, they pay a lot of money to broadcast 
these, and, you know, huge sums of that money goes to players' 
salaries, so it's kind of a Catch-22 there.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LINEUP CHANGE:* New York Yankees manager Joe Torre made only  
one change in his starting lineup when it was announced that 
scheduled Atlanta starter Tom Glavine, a left-hander, had the flu 
and would be replaced by right-hander Greg Maddux in Saturday 
night's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just left field. That's the only change. Ricky Ledee  
instead of Chad Curtis,'' Torre said. ``I understand those things 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WORLD SERIES DEBUT:* Kevin Millwood, who will start Game 2 for  
the Braves, was asked his thoughts on pitching in his first World 
Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's a headache, signing balls and all that stuff.  
But, it's exciting,'' said the 24-year-old who won 18 games during 
the regular season and pitched a one-hitter in the NL division 
series against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to a couple of the guys and they said to approach it  
like it's just another ball game and try not to get too worked up 
about it. That's what I'm going to do,'' Millwood said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCARED CHAMP:* Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, an  
Atlanta resident and avid Braves fan, was on the field before the 
game, discussing his baseball career as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played baseball as a kid -- right field. I wasn't too good a  
hitter. I had a good glove and had a good arm, but I was afraid of 
the ball,'' said the man who twice beat Mike Tyson, including an 
11th-round knockout in their first fight. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ETC:* The Yankees have an 8-game winning streak in the World  
Series, winning the final four games against the Braves in 1996 to 
win the series 4-2 and sweeping the San Diego Padres last season. 
... The Braves and Yankees are the two winningest teams in the 
1990s during the regular season. Atlanta has a 925-629 record. New 
York is 851-704. The Braves have won eight consecutive NL division 
titles, the Yankees have made five straight postseason appearances. 
This is Atlanta's fifth World Series in the 90s', winning once -- in 
1995. This is the Yankees third World Series appearance, winning in 
1996 and 1998. ... The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by 
former Braves left-hander Warren Spahn. ... The Yankees have the 
highest payroll in baseball, $86,426,992. The Braves are seventh at 
$62,652,500.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Outlines Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stopping just short of an official  
announcement, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday she looked 
forward to winning the Senate seat held by Democrat Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored to be in this race, looking to succeed someone  
whom I admire, Senator Moynihan, and to continue much of the work 
that he has done,'' she said at a birthday fund-raiser attended by 
about 300 people, including the president and several celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to this campaign,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has created an exploratory committee that allows  
her to raise and spend money as she considers a bid next year to 
succeed Moynihan. While indicating recently that she is leaning so 
far toward running that ``if I leaned over any further I would fall 
over,'' the first lady does not expect to announce her plans until 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Her campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, cautioned against  
interpreting her remarks at the fund-raiser as an announcement 
speech. But, he added, ``I don't think there's any doubt in 
anyone's mind that she's very serious about this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton on Saturday also referred indirectly to her likely  
Republican Senate rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. ``We 
will have a very clear choice in the race for the Senate from New 
York and I welcome that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has not officially entered the race, but is raising  
money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised his wife and said it was time New York  
``which has been on the cutting edge of so many other 
developments'' elected a female senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want you to know about Hillary is from the first minute  
I met her she was thinking about the things that are important to 
the country,'' Clinton said. The two embraced warmly after he 
introduced her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said a GOP plan for across-the-board cuts in  
federal spending to help balance the budget was a ``most gross 
neglect of our nation's priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said it would cut, among other things, funding for the  
Middle East peace process -- an issue of great importance to New 
York's large Jewish population. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters contributed between $500 and $2,000 apiece for the  
chance to munch on muffins and drink coffee and mimosas at a hotel 
blocks from the White House. They blew noisemakers and sang ``Happy 
Birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on hand Saturday were actress Marisa Tomei, the top  
Senate Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and blues musician 
B.B. King. Musicians Gloria Estefan and John Fogarty and the pop 
group `N Sync stopped by on their way to a charity concert at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton turns 52 on Tuesday, a day after a celebrity  
fund-raiser in New York City that is expected to raise at least $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has tried to step out from her husband's shadow  
during her early campaigning, and there seemed to be a symbolic 
indication of that Saturday: few images of the president were among 
the photos of Mrs. Clinton's life seen by guests as they arrived; 
one of the couple featured a smiling Mrs. Clinton in the foreground 
while her husband appeared slightly out of focus behind her.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shock jock Howard Stern and his wife of more  
than two decades are separating. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said the split between Stern and wife Alison is not  
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following mediation, both Alison and Howard, who care for each  
other very much, have amicably separated,'' said Dan Klores, the 
couple's spokesman. ``They have come to an agreement and settled 
all of their concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were married in 1978 and have three daughters.  
</P>
<P>
	Stern would often include intimate details about the couple's  
married life in his on-air banter, even talking about his wife's 
miscarriage.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows McCain Gaining on Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Boosted by a new poll suggesting he was  
catching up to fellow Republican George W. Bush in New Hampshire, 
John McCain campaigned through the state Saturday promoting the 
central doctrine of his run for the White House: campaign finance 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	During a political event at Dartmouth College, McCain even  
turned a question about abortion to the theme of campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Winifred Anthony Stearns of Hanover told McCain she supported a  
woman's right to choose. ``It's my hardest reconciliation with the 
Republican Party,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is abortion,'' McCain said, repeating the subject of  
her question to audience members who couldn't hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is choice,'' she corrected.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was ``a pro-life person because my belief is that  
life begins at conception.'' But the debate needs to go beyond 
that, he said. ``It is long past time that pro-life and pro-choice 
people sat down and agreed on goals we can agree on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional adversaries can agree on the need for adoption  
and foster care and get beyond the debate over abortion, which he 
said interest groups want to keep alive because it helps them raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns, who described herself as a Republican, was not entirely  
satisfied with the answer but said, ``I think it was as good a 
response as I could have expected from a Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she left the event committed to McCain. ``I was alive in  
World War II,'' she said. ``I admire his high principles and his 
high ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Registered Republicans in New Hampshire still favor Bush, the  
governor of Texas, 39 percent to 27 percent over McCain, a U.S. 
senator from Arizona, according to a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's an improvement for McCain over a similar poll in  
August that had Bush in the lead 45 percent to 10 percent. The 
other Republican presidential candidates are in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, what we are doing is working, which is a few brief  
remarks and then questions,'' McCain said Saturday in Hanover. 
``It's paying off, and straight talk works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted for the Concord Monitor by polling firm  
Research 2000 Wednesday and Thursday, after Elizabeth Dole dropped 
out of the race. The pollsters questioned 602 registered voters by 
telephone, and the poll had a margin of error of four percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Steve Forbes was favored by 9 percent, and Patrick  
Buchanan by 5 percent. Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch each 
was favored by 1 percent. Seventeen percent of the Republicans 
questioned said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, 40 percent of Democrats said they  
favored former Sen. Bill Bradley, against 37 percent who said they 
favored Vice President Al Gore, a statistical tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, 23 percent said they still hadn't decided on a  
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In potential general election match-ups, Bush beat Gore 50  
percent to 40 percent, but against Bradley, the outcome is a 
virtual tie, Bush 45 percent, Bradley 44 percent.

<HEADLINE> Houston's Barkley To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley has threatened several times in  
recent years to retire. This time, the 36-year-old forward insists, 
he means it. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley said Friday he will announce his retirement, effective  
at season's end, at halftime of the Houston Rockets' exhibition 
game with the Detroit Pistons on Sunday at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Birmingham is less than a half-hour's drive from his hometown of  
Leeds, Ala., so his family will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just time,'' said Barkley, who has been upgraded to  
questionable for Sunday's game after missing the last four 
preseason games with tendinitis in his right elbow. ``It's time. 
That's it. I'm not going to answer any more questions about it. 
It's just time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'm going to do (after he retires). I might  
just take some time off. But I'm making it official Sunday. I'm 
announcing it there (in Birmingham) because that's my hometown, and 
I'll have a lot of family and friends there. This is my last year, 
period. I don't care how well I'm playing -- this is it. I want to 
get it over with, and that's it. I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, starting his 16th NBA season, has long been one of the  
league's top draws, especially internationally. He was on the 
original Dream Team, playing with Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and 
Magic Johnson on the juggernaut that won the gold medal at the 1992 
Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Barkley, then with the Phoenix Suns, teamed with  
current Rockets teammate Hakeem Olajuwon on the U.S. team that won 
a gold medal in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Charles has decided that this is his last season, then we  
should all relish one more chance to be entertained by one of the 
most spectacular players in NBA history,'' NBA deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik told the Houston Chronicle. ``Charles is certainly a 
one-of-a-kind personality, but first and foremost, he is a truly 
great talent on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets owner Leslie Alexander agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's one of the greatest who ever played the game,''  
Alexander said. ``He is a great player, but he also made the game 
fun. People love to be around Charles, and an attitude like that is 
rare in any sport. His routine will be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley averaged less than 10 rebounds only once, when he  
averaged 8.6 as a rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984-85. 
Entering this season, Barkley has scored 23,468 points (13th on the 
career list) and pulled down 12,337 rebounds, once leading the 
league (14.6 in 1986-87) and hauling in a career-high 33 in his 
first game as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the NBA's second leading rebounder last season with 12.3  
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who said he is not surprised by the decision, is  
happy to have Barkley play his last game as a member of the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely,'' Alexander said. ``It's nice to have a great one  
retire in your uniform. And he's one of the greatest of all.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Tackles Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- It's one thing for 150 nations to agree to  
significant cuts in greenhouse emissions by 2012 -- and quite 
another to figure out how to measure progress. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. climate change conference in Bonn opening Monday  
continues the painstaking process of defining reductions in 
greenhouse gases specified in a 1997 protocol approved in Kyoto, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	That means tackling such nitty-gritty issues as how to measure  
emissions from everything from factories to your average barnyard 
cow. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Netherlands, they know how many cows they have to  
within 100, and they have done calculations and they know Dutch 
cows emit X amount of methane each year,'' said Michael Williams, 
spokesman for the Climate Change secretariat in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The trick then is standardizing the calculations so they are  
somehow valid for the other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``How is India going to do this? They have different cows, which  
eat different things. They probably don't even know how many cows 
they have,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such questions may seem esoteric. But reaching agreement on the  
ground rules for emissions reduction is essential for ratification 
of the Kyoto protocol by major developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is spade work for the convention,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bonn conference is the fifth in a series of major meetings  
on climate control that began in Rio in 1992, when nations 
committed generally to reducing emissions of six greenhouse gases. 
Binding targets for individual developed nations were set in Kyoto 
two years ago, when nations agreed to an overall reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent from 1990 levels during the 
period 2008-2012. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates hope to reach final agreement on the measures during  
the next meeting, tentatively set for The Hague, Netherlands in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond homing in on scientific measures, the Bonn conference  
hopes to keep the political momentum going, and will raise some hot 
political topics as well -- probably at the end of the conference 
when ministers arrive. The conference runs through Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate -- which recently flexed its muscle by blocking  
ratification of the international nuclear treaty -- has said it 
won't take up the climate convention without ``meaningful 
participation'' by key developing nations and assurances on the 
costs of implementation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a large question mark over the approval in the United  
States,'' the climate conference's executive-secretary, Michael 
Zammit Cutajar, told reporters in Bonn this week. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials, however, that ensuring broad participation  
of developing nations and addressing the costs of the treaty will 
ensure its ratification in the United States, and therefore its 
overall success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to present the best treaty we can. It is precisely  
because we are committed to the process that we are insisting on 
these elements,'' said Roger Ballentine, a White House official who 
is coordinating the administration's climate change work. 
</P>
<P>
	The role of developing nations is not on the agenda at the Bonn  
conference, but there may be symbolic progress if, as expected, 
Kazakstan and Venezuela announce voluntary emission targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another critical issue is whether limits will be set on  
emissions trading among industrialized nations, one of the three 
flexibility mechanisms agreed to in Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union wants to limit credits to 50 percent of  
overall emissions reductions to ensure that countries make 
significant improvements domestically; the United States wants no 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense from an economic or environmental  
perspective to put limits on the mechanisms,'' Ballentine said. 
``They allow you to get the greatest environmental benefit for each 
dollar by increasing efficiency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, just 14 nations -- all of them developing countries --  
have ratified the Kyoto protocol, which takes effect only after 
ratification by 55 nations, including developed countries that 
account for at least 55 percent of emissions.

<HEADLINE> Online Prowler Targets Mass. Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Officials say a 19-year-old quadriplegic from  
Missouri used an Internet chat room to make ``Columbine-like'' 
threats to hurt students and teachers at a Massachusetts middle 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said Saturday that the  
paralyzed teen -- whose name and hometown were not released -- made 
the threats using an America Online chat room frequented by dozens 
of eighth-graders from Townsend's Hawthorne Brook Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities confiscated the Missouri teen-ager's computer on  
Friday and plan to charge him with making threats and possibly 
other charges on Monday, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the teen-ager had been chatting online with the Townsend  
students since September, but midweek, the cyber-relationship 
turned terrifying. Reilly said the man told several students he was 
in their community and he threatened to hurt them, their teachers 
and their school. 
</P>
<P>
	The threats -- which included a list of teachers and students to  
be targeted -- was an act of ``cyberterrorism'' that left the school 
shaken. It may have been a hoax, but ``the fear that was expressed 
by students, parents and teachers in this community was very 
real,'' Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said the students had thought the Missouri teen-ager was  
a peer and included him in their conversations, revealing 
information about their town, their school and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	When the man allegedly directed some students to child  
pornography Web sites a few days ago, some of the children told 
their parents, who then called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend Superintendent of Schools James McCormick said someone  
from the community also received a suspicious phone call that made 
references to the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo., where two students shot and killed 12 students, a 
teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb-sniffing dogs searched the middle school on Thursday, and  
students' bags and backpacks were checked, but nothing suspicious 
was found and school was declared safe, McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, authorities converged on the suspect's home, where he  
lives with his parents, and confiscated his computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said the teen-ager -- paralyzed from the neck down by a  
high school car crash -- admitted communicating with the 
Massachusetts students.

<HEADLINE> Hunter Has Crucial Errors for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Hunter had filled the role all season,  
coming in for the Atlanta Braves in the eighth and ninth innings as 
a defensive upgrade at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine how he felt Saturday night, making two errors in the  
eighth inning to help transform a 1-0 lead into a 4-1 loss to the 
New York Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to come in for defense and make errors,''  
Hunter said. ``That makes you look stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who had just entered the game for Ryan Klesko, made the  
first miscue on a sacrifice bunt by Chuck Knoblauch with two 
runners on and no outs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfectly placed under the circumstances -- the Braves were  
trying to make a play on the lead runner -- the ball rolled between 
Hunter and pitcher Greg Maddux. The first baseman made a nice play 
to track it down, but he couldn't handle the ball on a night when 
the wind-chill factor was around freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball slipped out of my hand a little bit,'' Hunter said.  
``It was a tough bunt, a tough play. But you have to make those 
kind of plays, especially in a game like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the bases now loaded, Derek Jeter singled to left on a 1-2  
pitch, tying the game at 1 and leaving the bases loaded. John 
Rocker came out of the bullpen for the Braves, only to give up a 
two-run single to Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter cut off the throw toward the plate by right-fielder Brian  
Jordan, noticed Jeter running toward third and had an easy play for 
an out. Instead, Hunter short-hopped the throw to third baseman 
Chipper Jones, an error allowing O'Neill to reach second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had him at third,'' Hunter said. ``I was just a terrible  
defensive player today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first player at his position since Frank Torre of  
the Milwaukee Braves in 1958 to make two errors in one Series 
inning, also against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, Hunter made only four errors in 114  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had four errors all year and two errors today,'' he said.  
``That's kind of hard to take.''

<HEADLINE> Falwell Meets With Gay Christians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- Religious right leader the Rev. Jerry  
Falwell was host to an unprecedented meeting with gay Christians on 
Saturday in an attempt to reduce violent acts against both groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, dozens of protesters demonstrated outside, yelling at  
gay supporters as they entered the church parking lot. The Rev. 
Fred Phelps of Topeka, Kan., whose congregation also taunted gays 
at the funeral of slain gay college student Matthew Shepard, said 
Falwell is a hypocrite for meeting with the Rev. Mel White, a gay 
minister, and his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Falwell used to teach the Bible word for word, now he's going  
off and meeting with these fags and going against everything he's 
ever taught,'' Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always says 'hate the sin, but love the sinner,' but it's  
impossible to separated the two. Does a judge send the crime or the 
criminal to jail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell, who has long believed that homosexuality is a sin,  
insists he will not change his views, but has agreed to tone down 
his anti-gay language that gay rights activists say encourage 
hatred and violence towards homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here because innocent people of various faiths, racial  
and ethnic groups, and sexual preferences have increasingly had 
their lives abruptly and violently ended by people with opposing 
views,'' Falwell told the group of 400 delegates in welcoming them 
to an anti-violence forum Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	White brought 200 gays and lesbians from 30 states to  
participate in the forum. They were joined by 200 evangelical 
Christians who support Falwell's stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in our journey towards  
reconciliation,'' said White, who held a prayer vigil Friday night 
for 20 gay men or transgendered people killed because of their 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting, the groups agreed to disagree on whether  
gays can be Christians and focus on ways to deter violence against 
gays and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell cited the September shootings at a Texas church and  
recent school shootings in which Christians were targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	White, an author and minister with the Metropolitan Community  
Churches, ghost wrote Falwell's autobiography before White admitted 
being gay.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Panel OKs Anti-Rape Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- An appeals panel ruled Friday  
that an anti-rape commercial featuring actress Charlize Theron was 
acceptable for television and should not be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Presiding Judge Mervyn King said the Advertising Standards  
Committee, which censored the ad, was wrong in saying it 
discriminated against men. 
</P>
<P>
	King said the quasi-legal committee -- which regulates the  
content of commercials -- failed to consider that advertisers often 
exaggerate to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ad, Theron cites rape statistics in response to her own  
question about what South African men are like. She then implies 
that men who don't commit rape but fail to take a stand are 
silently condoning it. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the ad were censored after a group of 27 men complained  
they were being discriminated again, and demanded that Theron's 
``little face'' be taken off the air. Theron is South African. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gilbert Marcus, a lawyer representing one of the appeal  
parties, said the ban interfered with women's rights to free 
expression in fighting an ``incidence of violence against women'' 
that is ``astonishing and shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police statistics show that about 64,000 women and girls are  
raped each year in South Africa, but officials estimate that number 
represents just 5 percent of actual rapes. The country has the 
world's highest rape rate.

<HEADLINE> Albright Denounces Chechnya Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The Russian military's attacks in Chechnya  
are ``deplorable and ominous,'' and the events of the past 36 to 48 
hours in the breakaway republic are of ``grave concern,'' Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces were consolidating their positions around Grozny,  
the Chechen capital, after an air, artillery and ground onslaught 
that left the Chechen forces with heavy losses. A missile attack 
Thursday night on a Grozny marketplace killed at least 143 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia sent troops into Chechnya at the end of September,  
following weeks of airstrikes, ostensibly to eliminate the 
militants who invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who was winding up a six-nation Africa visit, said she  
hopes to speak soon with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov about 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to make it quite clear our concern about these  
events,'' she said. The Chechnya problem ``cannot be solved by 
military means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that Russian tactics are creating displacement of the  
Chechen population from their homes. Many have been forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the White House also expressed concern about what  
spokesman Joe Lockhart called the ``terrible loss of life'' in 
Chechnya. But the administration avoided pointing a finger of blame 
for the missile attack after a Russian military spokesman said it 
was a special operation, contradicting Russian political officials 
who denied any responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said President Clinton recently sent a letter to  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressing concern about the 
escalation of violence as Russia tries to quell rebels in Chechnya 
and terrorist attacks in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Taking Coalition With Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan does not expect to leave the  
Republican Party empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	After quietly plotting strategy for weeks, the three-time  
presidential candidate plans to abandon his political roots for the 
Reform Party on Monday and take his fragile political coalition 
with him. It never quite fit the GOP, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to rally:  
</P>
<P>
	--Social conservatives by denouncing abortion and defending  
American sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	--Labor Democrats by attacking free-trade deals and defending  
workers squeezed by new economic pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	--Populists and acolytes of Reform Party founder Ross Perot by  
showing a newfound zeal for campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat is going to find an entirely different audience, where in  
the past he was left to deal with just Republican primary voters,'' 
said former Reform Party vice presidential candidate Pat Choate. 
``He can reach for the Democrats, the independents and, of course, 
the conservative Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He can go for the whole wad,'' Choate said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though he has not formally left the GOP, Buchanan already has  
inserted supporters in several state Reform Party operations. Plans 
are in place to gain ballot access state-to-state, an expensive 
procedure that will test his ability to raise money and maintain 
the loyalty of a volunteer network of longtime Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, whose GOP presidential campaign never got off the  
ground, is seeking the nomination of a fractious party with a core 
of several hundred activists and a few political novelties: 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, tycoon Donald Trump and Perot himself 
are considered potential candidates -- not to mention the handful of 
Hollywood types rumored to be mulling bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot founded the party, but Ventura reshaped it with an upset  
victory in 1998. Ventura thinks Buchanan's social views are too 
conservative, so he is urging Trump to run. Many Perot allies do 
not like Ventura and are backing Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is no stranger to a political fight.  
</P>
<P>
	He won the 1996 New Hampshire primary and put a scare into  
President Bush in the 1992 contest. Both times, his campaign 
fizzled after New Hampshire due to a lack of money and little room 
to grow beyond his social conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fear a third-party Buchanan bid would siphon  
right-wing voters from the eventual nominee, tipping the scales in 
favor of the Democratic presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some polls substantiate the fears, though others suggest  
Buchanan would draw equally from both parties. In either case, only 
one in 10 voters expressed support for Buchanan's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Buchanan's political history gives him reason to believe he  
can expand beyond his GOP base. In open primaries -- those that did 
not limit the voting to Republicans -- Buchanan padded his totals 
with Democratic votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Exit polls from 1996 showed that hard-hat Democrats helped  
Buchanan draw 40 percent of the vote against eventual nominee Bob 
Dole in Michigan, and more than 30 percent in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan returns to Michigan on Tuesday, after announcing his  
decision in Washington and holding a rally in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buchanan will pull, if he wins the nomination, from the  
blue-collar Democrats as much as from Republicans, '' said Patricia 
Benjamin, vice chairman of the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan earned 31 percent of the vote to Dole's 34 percent in  
Macomb County, Mich., where he was returning for the announcement 
tour. Longtime Democrats in the blue-collar suburbs north of 
Detroit swung to President Reagan in the 1980s and back to 
Democrats in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The county's Reagan Democrats welcomed Buchanan's skeptical take  
on trade and his tirades about the gap between high- and low-wage 
earners. A similar message from Perot did equally well: He earned 
nearly 20 percent of the county's general election vote in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of Buchanan's announcement trip is equally revealing.  
</P>
<P>
	He travels Wednesday to textile country in South Carolina, where  
Democrats and Republicans alike blame free-trade agreements for 
shuttered plants. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he plans to go to the heart of the Reform Party  
with a visit to Minnesota. He wants to show that he is not 
intimated by Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in North Dakota on Friday and Saturday to attend a  
Christian Coalition meeting, wrapping up the tour with a return to 
his roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion, trade, jobs, wages and the dangers of getting involved  
abroad are expected to be a staple of Buchanan's speeches, 
associates say. He may trim and expand to soothe his audience: less 
talk of abortion in Michigan than in North Dakota, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	He already is modifying his message for the party switch. Rarely  
one to discuss campaign finance reform, Buchanan suddenly has a 
section of his Internet site devoted to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane McKelvey, a Reform Party leader from Michigan, said she  
and several other party members met recently with Buchanan to test 
his support for the issue -- a major plank in the party platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at our platform and said, `There's nothing here I  
disagree with,''' she said. ``He said he has not pushed it before 
because he was focused on other issues.''

<HEADLINE> Duncan's Time With Spurs Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The big man with the mean jump hook, killer  
bank shot and deadly serious stare is back to try and lead the San 
Antonio Spurs to a second straight NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Tim Duncan reaches that goal, there's no guarantee  
he'll return for a shot at a third ring. After this season, Duncan 
could be done in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm keeping my options open,'' said Duncan, in the final  
season of his three-year contract. ``At the end of the year, I'll 
figure out if I'm going to be here or somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Magic and Chicago Bulls are two of the teams that  
will have enough salary cap room to make a run at the 7-foot 
All-Star, who led the Spurs to their first title in June and won 
the Most Valuable Player Award in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The man considered the best player in the league says his  
decision will be based partly on a Nov. 2 vote in Bexar County on 
construction of a new basketball arena. That vote could determine 
whether the Spurs remain in the city, and Duncan has indicated he 
wants to know where the team will play before committing to another 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Left unsaid are his other considerations.  
</P>
<P>
	It's widely known, for instance, that Duncan and Orlando coach  
Doc Rivers are friends. The chance to play for Rivers, who was a 
Spurs broadcaster last season, could be a big draw for Duncan next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's overblown,'' Rivers said. ``Guys are going to do what  
they want to do. There's nothing I can do to talk a guy into coming 
or leaving. They have a championship team and I don't see that 
changing anytime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before accepting the Orlando job in June, Rivers informally  
guided Duncan and other Spurs in workouts during the NBA lockout 
last season, when coaches weren't allowed to have contact with 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know him,'' Duncan said. ``He's a good guy. I worked out  
with him a bit during the lockout. That's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's tampering rule prohibits coaches and players from  
trying to entice players under contract to other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Spur Will Perdue, now with Chicago, was admonished by the  
league recently for comments he made about Duncan possibly joining 
the Bulls after his San Antonio contract is up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim Duncan is not married to San Antonio by any means,''  
Perdue said. ``He's made that very clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Duncan changes his mind and wants to sign a contract  
extension with the Spurs, he'll have to do it by Oct. 31, two days 
before the season begins. He could get a six-year extension for 
$70.9 million, or a seven-year deal next summer worth $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams could pay him a comparable amount, although not  
quite as much, under the league's collective bargaining rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of money,'' Duncan said. ``I figure I'll  
make good money anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs had the NBA's best record last season and lost only  
twice in the playoffs. But small forward Sean Elliott will miss the 
season following a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	With an aging center, 34-year-old David Robinson, and a starting  
backcourt featuring journeymen Avery Johnson and Mario Elie, the 
Spurs don't have a supporting cast that would ensure a dynasty even 
if Duncan stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robinson believes his frontcourt partner will stay with the  
Spurs if the team is successful this season. In Orlando or Chicago, 
Duncan would be part of a major rebuilding project. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not that worried about it, because if you keep winning,  
there's nobody in the world that would leave a situation like 
that,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich doesn't blame Duncan for waiting to  
make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where each of us lives our life is important to all of us,''  
Popovich said. ``So, if I'm in his shoes I wait until the end of 
the year when I'm a free agent and I make my decision then based on 
a lot of different factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, the No. 1 draft pick in 1997 out of Wake Forest, lived  
up to expectations in his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he was rookie of the year. Last season he finished  
third behind Karl Malone and Alonzo Mourning in most valuable 
player voting. Ballots were turned in before Duncan led the Spurs 
to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was the only player last season in the top 10 in scoring  
average (21.7 points), rebounding (11.4), blocked shots (2.52) and 
field-goal percentage (.495). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's basically become fully confident out on the floor, likes  
it out there,'' Popovich said. ``He understands the effect he has 
on the game at both ends. He's enjoying it, and wants to do that 
even more. So it's that mental approach that's helped him step up a 
notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a jam-packed summer, first with the NBA Finals, then  
playing for the U.S. team in the Olympic qualifying tournament, 
Duncan had a short offseason and little time to work on his game -- 
not that he needs to. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan hopes his two years of experience and success in the  
league will help him elevate his play even more. 
</P>
<P>
	And when might this 23-year-old reach the peak of his NBA  
career? 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully,'' he said, smiling, ``many years down the way.''  
</P>
<P>
	But the big question now is where, not when, that will be.

<HEADLINE> La. GOP Gov. Looks for Another Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana's popular Republican Gov. Mike  
Foster sought a second term Saturday, hoping to avoid a runoff 
election against any of his 11 challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's unique open primary system forces all candidates,  
regardless of party, to run at the same time. If no one wins more 
than half the vote, the top two go into a Nov. 20 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest polls gave Foster anywhere from 55 to 60 percent,  
with his nearest opponent, Rep. William Jefferson, taking 18 to 20 
percent. None of the other 10 candidates came near Jefferson's 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, elected in 1990 as the state's first black  
congressman since Reconstruction, is close to President Clinton, 
who visited Louisiana to campaign for the New Orleans Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson spent most of his campaign blaming Louisiana's public  
education woes on Foster and trying to tie the governor to former 
Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster countered with saturation television ads reminding the  
voters he was the first governor in at least 30 years to push three 
straight teacher raises through the Legislature, adding $1 billion 
to the overall education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson questioned Foster's purchase in 1995 of Duke's list of  
supporters. Foster, who called it a non-issue, paid a $20,000 
ethics violation fine for failing to disclose the purchase on his 
1995 campaign report. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 2.7 million registered voters in Louisiana, 1.6 million are  
Democrats and the rest are about evenly split between Republicans 
and independents. A majority of the Democrats tend to be 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson hoped to lure white Democrats to his side, but party  
label means little in Louisiana where voters often make decisions 
along racial lines. Blacks make up about 29 percent of the 
registered vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other candidates showing up in the polls were Phil  
Preis, a Democrat who has never held office, and state Sen. Tom 
Greene, a Christian right Republican who complains that Foster 
didn't do enough to rid the state of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster came out of nowhere in 1995 to win the seat that had been  
dominated off and on for years by populist Democrat Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster looked like anybody's friendly, middle class neighbor,  
despite his background as a wealthy planter whose grandfather 
served as governor at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	His timing was right. Louisiana voters were tired of  
professional politicians, and they were weary of former Gov. 
Edwards' problems with federal prosecutors. Edwards poured money 
into health programs that were abused by health care providers, 
while teachers went without pay raises and university buildings 
deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	In four years, Foster overhauled the health care program, spent  
$80 million on university buildings and doubled the highway paving 
program. His approval ratings soared to 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster also backed a new college tuition plan that has become  
the most popular program in state government. Any high school 
graduate with the state average ACT score and a 2.5 grade average 
in core curriculum gets free tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana race is one of three for governor this fall. The  
other two are in Kentucky and Mississippi on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paul Patton faces four challengers  
in his bid for re-election. He has a bigger financial warchest than 
any of his rivals -- Republican Peppy Martin, Reform Party candidate 
Gatewood Galbraith, and Natural Law Party nominee Nailah 
Jumoke-Yarbrough. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi, a cliffhanger is developing to replace  
Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice, who cannot run for a third term. A 
poll this week showed Republican Mike Parker, a former congressman, 
edging ahead of Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, for the first 
time in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Menchu Urges Culture Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu  
urged students to press for the right to preserve their language 
and cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu, here for three days of discussions on bilingual  
education and cultural issues, won the prize in 1992, almost a 
decade after she published, ``I Rigoberta Menchu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Friday to more than 500 students at the Tucson  
Convention Center, Menchu urged them to learn as many languages as 
possible and never to lose their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu said she believes efforts to eliminate bilingual  
education in the United States will be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this proposal is going to win,'' Menchu said,  
adding that Hispanics ``have to unite and fight for this ideal -- 
and more than an ideal it's a right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu has conceded that she used the testimony of other victims  
to construct her own story of Guatemala's civil war, but defended 
the book as a testimonial that accurately depicts the suffering of 
her people, the indigenous Quiche.

<HEADLINE> FIA Hears Ferrari F1 Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Ferrari won its appeal today against its  
disqualification from the Malaysian Grand Prix, keeping the Formula 
One championship alive at the season-ending Japanese Grand Prix on 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the FIA and its five-member International Court  
of Appeal means that Ferrari's Eddie Irvine has a four-point lead 
on Mika Hakkinen of McLaren Mercedes entering the season finale as 
the Italian auto maker tries to win its first drivers' title in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraris driven by Irvine and Michael Schumacher finished 1-2  
last Sunday in Malaysia, but were disqualified because their 
aerodynamic deflectors didn't comply with FIA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, the '98 series champion, finished third, but was  
elevated to first, which gave him enough points to win his second 
straight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, the biggest spending team the sport, mounted a  
three-point defense: the deflectors didn't offer an advantage; the 
measurement might have been incorrect or should have allowed for a 
minimum tolerance; the error was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
	The deflectors were out of FIA specifications by one centimeter  
(3/8 inch). 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, which has not won a drivers' title since Jody Scheckter  
in 1979, also argued the punishment was too severe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were given back what we had deserved on the track,'' Irvine  
said in Tokyo. ``Now we want to win Ferrari both the drivers and 
the manufacturers titles in Suzuka.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The season-ending Japanese Grand Prix is scheduled in Suzuka on  
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ruling announced by FIA president Max Mosley, Ferrari  
keeps the points it won in both the drivers' championship points 
standings and the constructors' championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley said the panel, which met Friday, said the methods of  
measurement and clarity of regulations were not adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court of appeal decided to overturn the decision of the  
stewards and therefore the result of the race stands,'' Mosley 
said. ``The drivers have the points they earned in the race and so 
does the constructor Ferrari. ... No jury would have done 
otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley did not criticize the stewards.  
</P>
<P>
	``The decision they made was justified at the time,'' he said,  
adding they did not have highly sophisticated measuring devices. 
``Ferrari was just within the tolerance permitted. It was a 
millimeter or less on each dimension. They were absolutely on the 
limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley was asked why the stewards had reached on conclusion and  
a panel of lawyers six days later had reached another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Engineers will know a specification, but lawyers will show  
inconsistencies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley also dismissed any influence on the decision from Bernie  
Ecclestone, the powerful owner of Formula One. He had called the 
disqualification ``nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While Bernie has a big influence on the financial aspects of  
FI, he has only a small influence in making the rules,'' Mosley 
said. ``Mr. Ecclestone has no role in enforcing the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Dennis, managing director of McLaren, claimed he was not  
``disappointed'' and ``not really surprised'' -- then lambasted the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really more than anything else a bad day for the sport,''  
he said. ``What has actually occurred is that through a very heavy 
scrutiny of our rules, which are extensive and very detailed, a way 
has been found ... to provide a reason for the appeal to be 
upheld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``commercial pressure'' had influenced the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Norbert Haug, the head of Mercedes racing, admitted Saturday it  
was McLaren that tipped off the stewards about Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mechanics became suspicious,'' he said. ``We accept the  
decision and we still think we can win the championship on our 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last successful appeal was in 1995, when the  
disqualification of Benetton and Williams from the Brazilian Grand 
Prix for using unauthorized carburetors was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will not please the Stewart Ford team and other  
critics of F1, who say the sport is ruled by money interests that 
often force rules to be bent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stewart team, trying to protect the upgraded second- and  
third-place finishes of Johnny Herbert and Rubens Barrichello, 
supported McLaren's argument that rules must be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	But team official Paul Stewart, who attended the session Friday,  
said it was a a ``fair hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-man panel chaired by Jose Macedo e Cunha of Portugal.  
Others were Gerhard Nurscher of Austria, Philippe Roberti de Winghe 
of Belgium, Vassilis Koussis of Greece and Jan van Rosmalen of the 
Netherlands.

	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A veteran parachutist  
plunged to her death off one of this park's most spectacular 
granite monoliths during a protest intended to show that such jumps 
can be done safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Davis, 60, was one of five jumpers who planned to leap from  
the top of 3,200-foot El Capitan in the Friday protest, organized 
in response to the June 9 death of a man who parachuted off the 
same peak, only to drown in the river below while fleeing park 
rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the fourth jumper, hit a pile of rocks at the base of El  
Capitan after her parachute failed to open. Davis fell for 20 
seconds; the first jumper took about four minutes to float down 
into Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said her husband, photographer Tom Sanders, who was  
shooting the jump, slumped onto his camera in grief after watching 
her fall around 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``If only she had used her own gear; if she had only had her own  
gear,'' he said repeatedly, according to friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was using borrowed gear because she didn't want hers to be  
confiscated by rangers waiting to arrest her on the valley floor, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The borrowed parachute and gear had a rip cord on the leg,  
unlike her usual gear where the cord was on her back, Sanders told 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the fourth jumper, the first three were beautiful. And  
then she jumped. Everybody thought it was OK, and then people said 
'Open up! Open up!' Then ... the whole place turned quiet,'' said 
Paul Sakuma, an Associated Press photographer. 
</P>
<P>
	A veteran with more than 70 jumps over the past 16 years, Davis  
claimed to be the first woman to jump from Angel Falls in 
Venezuela, the highest waterfall in the world. She also worked 
closely with her husband, who has done skydiving sequences for 
James Bond movies. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme sport of jumping from fixed objects like cliffs or  
buildings is so dangerous that the National Park Service has banned 
such stunts. Nationwide, an estimated 21 people have died during 
so-called BASE jumps -- the acronym for buildings, antennae, spans 
and earth -- in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	BASE jumping was legal in the park for a trial period in 1980,  
but restrictions on when people could jump and the number of jumps 
per day were routinely violated, so the activity was banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the sixth death since 1980 due to BASE jumping in the  
park, and we've had numerous injuries. It's a poor track record,'' 
park spokesman Scott Gediman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, rangers have arrested anyone caught jumping off El  
Capitan and other cliffs, seized their equipment and put them in 
the local jail. Fines run as high as $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have tried to find middle ground on the issue after  
rangers who staked out a landing area tried to capture Frank 
Gambalie III in June. Gambalie, 28, tried to flee, and drowned in 
the runoff-swollen Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, Gambalie's mother joined about 150 people, including the  
five jumpers' families and friends, in what was supposed to be a 
carefully staged demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The parachutists, accompanied by rangers at the top of the peak,  
agreed to land in a designated area, be arrested and forfeit their 
equipment, then pursue their opposition to the ban in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was one of my heroes,'' said Chris Conkright, a  
photographer who worked with Davis' husband. ``She died doing what 
she loved to do.''

	Two Russia Planes Said Shot Down  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechen fighters said they shot down two  
Russian warplanes in separate incidents Saturday, while government 
forces bombed and fired rockets on rebel positions in the breakaway 
republic. The clashes came amid growing foreign criticism of the 
Russian offensive. Russian officials defended the Chechnya 
operation as a war against terrorism. The Chechen Health Ministry 
said that 163 people had been killed and 380 injured by Russian air 
and artillery bombardment on Friday and Saturday, the Interfax news 
agency reported. The toll could not be independently confirmed. On 
Saturday, Chechen fighters dug trenches in Grozny, the capital. 
Commanders have said they expected an assault by Russian troops 
that were massed less than eight miles from the city.

	Clinton Presses on Social Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Republicans on  
Saturday to improve upon their pledges that they would avoid using 
Social Security surpluses to pay for other budget needs. ``I think 
we can do better,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address, 
adding that he will submit legislation this week that would enact 
part of a Social Security rescue plan he outlined early this year. 
The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits 
any government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay 
off the national debt. Republicans previously have rejected the 
proposal -- first mentioned in the president's State of the Union 
Address -- and proclaimed any further discussion of it dead for the 
year.

	Palestinians Clash With Israeli Police  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Dozens of Palestinians threw rocks and gasoline  
bombs at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank town of Bethlehem on 
Saturday, demanding that Israel release Palestinian prisoners, the 
Israeli army said. The soldiers retaliated with tear gas, but no 
one was reported injured, according to the army spokesman's office. 
Earlier this month, Israel released 151 Arab security prisoners -- 
most of them Palestinians -- in accordance with the latest peace 
agreement. But hundreds of Palestinians still sit in Israeli jails 
for anti-Israeli activity.

	Mexico Rivers Dangerously High  
</P>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Authorities opened the gates  
Saturday to a dam filled beyond capacity, acknowledging that rivers 
already dangerously high from weeks of heavy flooding would rise 
even further. The National Water Commission began releasing water 
from the Penitas dam in the state of Chiapas early Saturday 
morning, a move that officials said would increase river levels by 
.8 inches to 1.2 inches per hour. The effects of the water release 
were not expected to be felt downstream in Tabasco state until 
Saturday night, and authorities said the water release would be 
gradual enough to avoid major damage to homes and property in 
Villahermosa, Tabasco's state capital.

	SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Fighting between government soldiers and  
separatist militants in India's northern Kashmir state left at 
least 14 combatants dead, the military said Saturday. Soldiers 
fought a gun battle with rebels hiding in a cluster of houses in 
Ganderbal, 35 kilometers northeast of the state capital of 
Srinagar, and killed seven militants Saturday, the military said in 
a statement. Residents said several houses were damaged in the 
fighting.

	Falwell Hosts Summit With Gay Minister

	LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- Participants at a reconciliation forum  
between gays and evangelical Christians agree that today's 
unprecedented meeting has been productive. The Reverend Jerry 
Falwell hosted the Virginia gathering of about 200 gays and 
lesbians and 200 evangelical Christians. Falwell insists he will 
always consider homosexuality a sin, but has agreed to tone down 
his anti-gay remarks that gay rights activists say encourage hatred 
and violence towards homosexuals. The Reverend Fred Phelps, an 
outspoken anti-gay minister from Topeka, Kansas, led a group of 
protesters who taunted the forum's participants.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Yankees suddenly broke loose for  
four runs in the eighth inning against Greg Maddux and John Rocker 
and, behind Orlando Hernandez, beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 Saturday 
night in Game 1 of the World Series. The Braves managed just one 
hit in seven innings against Hernandez, and only one more against 
three Yankees relievers. Shut down on three measly singles for 
seven innings, the Yankees took advantage of defensive replacement 
Brian Hunter's two errors at first base to rally for their ninth 
straight World Series victory.

<HEADLINE> La. GOP Gov. Holding Strong Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster held a strong lead  
early in Saturday's primary race, boosting the Republican's chances 
of winning his second term without a runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's unique open primary system forces all candidates,  
regardless of party, to run at the same time. If no one wins more 
than half the votes, the top two candidates go into a Nov. 20 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	With 33 percent of precincts reporting, Foster had 260,772  
votes, or 65 percent, to top-running challenger Rep. William 
Jefferson's 104,332 votes, or 26 percent. The early totals did not 
include Jefferson's home precincts in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other 10 gubernatorial candidates in the primary had  
more than 4 percent of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, elected in 1990 as the state's first black  
congressman since Reconstruction, spent much of the campaign 
blaming Foster for Louisiana's public education woes and trying to 
tie the governor to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned Foster's 1995 purchase of Duke's list of  
supporters, over which Foster was ordered to pay a $20,000 ethics 
violation fine for failing to disclose on a campaign report. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster called the flap over the list a ``non-issue.''  
</P>
<P>
	He countered the attacks with saturation television ads  
reminding voters that he was the first governor in at least 30 
years to push three straight teacher raises through the 
Legislature, adding $1 billion to the overall education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good about it and I'm ready to get back to work,''  
Foster said Saturday night from his election party. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 2.7 million registered voters in Louisiana, 1.6 million are  
Democrats. The rest are about evenly split between Republicans and 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, a New Orleans Democrat who had had the vocal support  
of President Clinton, hoped to lure white Democrats to his side. 
But party label means little in Louisiana where voters often make 
decisions along racial lines. Blacks make up about 29 percent of 
the registered vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, a wealthy planter whose grandfather served as governor,  
came out of nowhere in 1995 to win the seat that had been dominated 
off and on for years by populist Democrat Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana voters had grown weary of Edwards' troubles with  
federal prosecutors. Edwards had poured money into health programs 
that were abused by health care providers, while teachers went 
without pay raises and university buildings deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	In four years, Foster overhauled the health care program, spent  
$80 million on university buildings and doubled the highway paving 
program. His approval ratings soared to 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster also backed a plan to offer free college tuition to  
Louisiana high school graduates with at least a 2.5 grade point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other candidates in the primary field who showed in  
pre-election polls were Phil Preis, a Democrat who has never held 
office, and state Sen. Tom Greene, a Christian right Republican who 
complained Foster didn't do enough to rid the state of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana's is one of three gubernatorial races this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paul Patton faces four challengers  
in his bid for re-election. And in Mississippi, a cliffhanger is 
developing to replace Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice, who cannot run 
for a third term. Both elections are Nov. 2.

<HEADLINE> Rose Named to All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Pete Rose, invited to his first official baseball  
function in 10 years, will miss Sunday's news conference with the 
living members of the All-Century team in order to make an 
appearance at a New Jersey casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's career hits leader, elected to the team Saturday,  
informed baseball officials that he will spend the afternoon at 
Bally's in Atlantic City, for a function with members of the 
3,000-hit club. 
</P>
<P>
	He will arrive in Atlanta after the news conference, then  
participate in on-field ceremonies at Turner Field before Game 2 of 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is among 18 living members of the 30-man team, voted in by  
fans as the ninth and final outfielder. He had 629,742 votes, with 
Roberto Clemente 10th with 582,937, followed by Stan Musial 
(571,279), fellow banned player Shoeless Joe Jackson (326,415) and 
Reggie Jackson (296,039). Musial was among five players added by a 
special panel to the 25 elected by fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stan Musial belonged on that team because of what he has  
accomplished in his life,'' said New York Yankees manager Joe 
Torre, who played for St. Louis after Musial retired from the 
Cardinals. ``I didn't think it was fair to put Pete in that 
category. I think Pete's in a category by himself. He could play 
any one of the positions and qualify. ... Nobody played harder to 
win than Pete Rose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose accepted a lifetime ban from baseball in 1989 following an  
investigation of his gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig didn't invite Rose to the  
All-Star game in July, when the living members among the 100 on the 
ballot were honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attendance at any function like that was forbidden,'' Selig  
said then. 
</P>
<P>
	He reversed course a month later and said Rose would be allowed  
to come to the Series if elected. He repeated Saturday that he 
didn't think Rose's inclusion will diminish the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only hope is it will be as good as the ceremonies from the  
All-Star game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it detracts from it at all,'' Braves manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``I know that's going to be a big deal. That's 
fine. I've always liked Pete Rose. I feel bad under the 
circumstances which he stands today. But the rules are the rules. 
If he's allowed to come here, that's great. And I will be the first 
to shake his hand.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Throwing First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- His pitch is usually to make peace, but on  
Tuesday U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will be pitching the 
first ball in the World Series game between the Atlanta Braves and 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, who played soccer during his youth in Ghana and now plays  
tennis, has been practicing to get the pitch right, U.N. spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general was asked a few months ago by major league  
officials to throw out the first pitch, but the offer was firmed up 
last week when the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox in the American 
League championship game, Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series begins Saturday in Atlanta and Tuesday's  
contest will be the first home game at Yankees Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the secretary-general rooting for either team?  
</P>
<P>
	Eckhard said no -- he's going to be strictly neutral.

<HEADLINE> Human Error Causes Nuclear Mishaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of nearly two dozen accidents  
involving uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions since 1953 suggests 
than human error is a common thread, according to an Energy 
Department draft report. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in  
New Mexico was being updated to incorporate findings from the 
nuclear accident at a Japanese fuel processing plant last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Alamos scientists examined 21 so-called criticality  
accidents, mostly in Russia and the United States between 1953 and 
1997, and found they had a number of things in common -- from human 
involvement to the fact that significant radiation exposure 
invariably was confined to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and perhaps foremost, the human element was present in  
all of the accidents,'' the draft report said. In most of the cases 
some fault also could be traced to poor supervision and inadequate 
regulatory oversight, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Three U.S. nuclear experts, including the head of the Los Alamos  
review team, said Friday that the criticality accident at the 
Japanese plant appeared to follow a similar pattern, with human 
error, poor training and lax supervision involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The three workers who caused Japan's worst nuclear accident on  
Sept. 30 were described by the U.S. review team as blue-collar 
employees with little scientific background or understanding of the 
potential dangers they faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people were unaware of the hazard,'' said Thomas  
McLaughlin, a specialist on nuclear chain reaction accidents who 
led the Los Alamos study and was one of the three U.S. experts sent 
to Japan to evaluate the latest accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The three officials discussed their findings in Japan at a  
meeting with reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the information gained in  
Japan will be invaluable as the Energy Department begins a 
comprehensive review of its nuclear facilities, especially 
regarding safety procedures and training. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Japanese workers were severely injured by radiation  
exposure. At least 66 other people, mostly employees at the 
Tokaimura plant, were exposed to significant radiation from the 
uncontrolled chain reaction accident. Thousands of people were 
forced indoors or evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction was not brought under control for 17 hours, but the  
U.S. officials said radiation levels away from the plant building 
remained extremely small -- significantly lower than originally 
feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank McCoy, deputy manager of the Savannah River nuclear  
facility in South Carolina and head of the Energy Department team, 
said the Japanese workers used equipment not designed for what they 
were trying to do and were inadequately trained to handle nuclear 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin said the Japanese accident was not unlike some of the  
21 incidents -- 13 in Russia, seven in the United States and one in 
Britain -- studied by the Los Alamos team. Most occurred in the late 
1950s and early 1960s, with the latest in Russia in 1997 and the 
most recent in the United States in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that 20 of the 21 accidents, as well as  
the one in Japan, occurred when the fissionable material was in 
liquid form. Many of the accidents involved human error and none 
was attributed solely to equipment failure. Many occurred ``during 
nonroutine operations,'' but none resulted in ``measurable 
radiation consequences ... beyond the facility to either people or 
the environment,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force list did not include a criticality incident at a  
private nuclear fuel processing plant in Rhode Island in 1964, in 
which a worker was killed, nor two such accidents at Los Alamos in 
the 1940s that involved experimental attempts to achieve 
criticality. 
</P>
<P>
	While none of the accidents resulted in any significant off-site  
radiation, seven workers were killed in the 21 accidents and others 
were exposed to large amounts of radiation. The three workers in 
Japan were hospitalized and are reported to be improving.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income Gets Gov't Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite low corn and soybean prices, a typical  
Iowa farmer stands to clear $48,000 this year, thanks to good 
weather and the federal farm program. Now $16,000 more is coming 
from Washington. In Texas, where a 1,700-acre cotton farm can 
expect to earn about $180,000, the government is going to make it 
an even $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On many farms, the aid is expected to boost income by 25 percent  
to 30 percent or more even as producers are bringing in bumper 
crops, according to an analysis by Texas A&AMP;M University's 
Agricultural and Food Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash comes from the $8.7 billion package of emergency farm  
assistance that President Clinton signed into law on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa alone will get an estimated $610 million, or $25 for every  
acre of farm land in the state. That would increase the state's net 
farm income this year to $2.6 billion, $400 million over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``From an economic standpoint the year is looking pretty  
positive and certainly brighter if the president signed that 
bill,'' said Ron McCartney, speaking over the din of his combine as 
he harvested his northeast Iowa farm last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistance package will benefit virtually every grain and  
cotton farm in the country, large or small, regardless of their 
financial situation or how good their crops were; the bigger the 
farm, the bigger the check. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing government programs, which guarantee minimum prices for  
crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton, ensure that with 
good crops most farmers can make enough money to cover their 
operating costs, economists say. But many farmers, especially those 
who borrowed heavily for land and equipment, say they would have 
trouble staying in business without this latest government aid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the extra money, a 950-acre corn and soybean farm in Iowa  
will have net income, not including long-term debt and depreciation 
costs, of about $64,000, according to the Texas A&AMP;M analysis. A 
2,200-acre Iowa farm would get an extra $38,000, boosting its net 
income for the year to $146,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of the aid varies widely according to crop and region  
of the country, but it is a significant amount of money for nearly 
any operation: 
</P>
<P>
	--A 425-acre rice operation in California would get $53,000, more  
than double what the farm would otherwise make this year. Rice 
farmers have been hit particularly hard by a slump in export 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	--A typical farm in eastern North Dakota that grows wheat, barley  
and sunflowers would get $18,000, adding 31 percent to the 
operation's expected income. 
</P>
<P>
	--In South Carolina, a 1,500-acre corn and soybean operation can  
expect to get a check for $30,000, increasing its net income by 35 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the aid package, about $6 billion, was  
designed to compensate farmers for the depressed commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that, $5.5 billion is going to growers as a doubling of the  
annual ``market transition'' payments they ordinarily would get 
under the 1996 farm law. The new total payment for the year is 
capped at $160,000 per farm; landowners can receive some of the 
money so long as they share in the expenses of the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $475 million in the aid package is earmarked for  
farmers who grow soybeans, sunflowers and other oilseed crops that 
were omitted from the market transition payments. 
</P>
<P>
	There is an additional $1.4 billion in the aid package for  
producers, primarily on the East Coast, who lost crops to drought 
and flooding this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the way the bailout was put together say that too  
much of the money is going to large farms and landowners in a 
handful of states. 
</P>
<P>
	Six states -- Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, Kansas and  
Minnesota -- will get at least $2.8 billion among them. Some farmers 
fear that better-off producers will use the extra cash to expand 
their operations and drive up land values and rents in the process. 
At the very least, economists agree, the payments will prevent land 
rents from falling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like everybody is getting'' the money, regardless of  
need, said Don Peterson, a specialist in farm management at South 
Dakota State University. ``It's going to allow those that had good 
yields ... to gobble up those that had bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has expressed similar concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``The current farm programs tend to reinforce larger  
operations,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ``The fact 
that you've got an emergency proposal that builds on the existing 
structure I think will provide some impetus for some additional 
consolidation.''

	Farm organizations resisted efforts by Glickman to change the  
way the aid would be delivered, saying that only would slow the 
payments. Farmers say that operations of all sizes need and deserve 
the help until commodity prices rebound. With grain surpluses 
worldwide, prices are expected to remain low at least through next 
year unless there are large-scale crop failures.

any means,'' said McCartney.

<HEADLINE> Frescoes Slow Vatican Garage Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Buried frescoes from the Roman Empire have been  
found in the path of a planned Vatican parking garage -- the latest 
remnants of Rome's past to slow construction for the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities confirmed Friday that they had found a second room  
of a villa dating back to the 1st century, its walls covered in 
frescoes of birds and fanciful winged creatures with human faces. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the first room in August stopped construction  
for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The new find heightened concern that the parking garage won't be  
completed in time for the more than 20 million pilgrims expected to 
visit Rome next year to celebrate Christianity's third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Preservationists, for their part, worried the frescoes would be  
sacrificed in the rush to get the garage done for tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian department of the UNESCO cultural agency, which  
wrote to Rome's mayor and Italy's Culture Ministry about the 
frescos, said the find must be safeguarded. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on the fate of the parking garage and the frescoes is  
expected later this month. While the garage is for the Vatican 
state, the site is on Italian territory.

<HEADLINE> Glavine To Miss Game 1 With Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Tom Glavine, ill with a flu bug that has gone  
through his family, was replaced by Greg Maddux as the Atlanta 
Braves' starter against the New York Yankees on Saturday night in 
Game 1 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really sick, dehydrated,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said  
before the game. ``He's got some fluids in him, I guess. He won't 
be here at all tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, who last pitched in Game 3 of the NL Championship  
Series on Oct. 15, would have been pitching on seven days' rest, 
while Maddux, who started Game 5 last Sunday, faced the Yankees on 
five days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine called Braves third-base coach Ned Yost on Friday night  
to tell him he was too sick to pitch and asked for the manager's 
telephone number at his farm house. He then spoke with Cox around 
11:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `I have to get a hold of Maddux,''' Cox said. ``He  
said, `I've called him and he's ready to go.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yost was concerned when Glavine called, saying the pitcher  
sounded awful. Yost was relieved when he found out it was the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if it was a car wreck. I didn't know if it was  
falling down the stairs,'' Yost said. ``When someone calls you at 
11 o'clock at night needing Bobby's telephone number, you know 
something's not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux seemed at ease before the game, working out in the  
outfield. He walked into the Braves dugout about two hours before 
the game and Cox introduced him to Hall of Famer Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood, originally slated to start Game 3 Tuesday at  
Yankee Stadium, replaced Maddux as Sunday night's starter against 
David Cone in Game 2. Millwood was about to sell his Game 2 tickets 
but got them back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I need to buy a few more,'' he said. ``So if anybody's  
got any, let me know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine has never been on the disabled list and has made 33 or  
more starts in four consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tommy,'' Cox said, ``has pitched at times with a bad arm  
through his career, shoulder, elbow, two broken ribs, two bad 
knees, a bad ankle, an infected toe and he's never missed a start 
that I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said Glavine probably would start Game 3 against Andy  
Pettitte, and John Smoltz would go in Game 4 against Roger Clemens. 
If Glavine still feels weak, he could flip flop with Smoltz and 
start the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine's wife had the flu starting last weekend in New York,  
and the bug was passed on to his kids and parents before he caught 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely nothing you can do to prevent it, except  
keep Tommy home for a day or two and hope nobody else gets it,'' 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Glavine's illness would have caused panic on most other  
teams, the Braves have four starters who would be aces if they 
pitched for other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who faced New York's Orlando Hernandez, entered with a  
2-2 World Series record, splitting decisions against Cleveland in 
1995 and the Yankees in 1996, including a loss in New York's Game 6 
clincher. He pitched a two-hit shutout to beat the Indians in the 
'95 opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not throw yesterday, except in the outfield, a little  
catch,'' Cox said. ``He threw a lot the day before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux started against the Yankees in a regular-season  
interleague game July 16 at New York and was chased after 3 1-3 
innings, allowing five runs and nine hits. The Braves rallied to 
win 10-7 on Andruw Jones' three-run homer off Mariano Rivera with 
two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Maddux's quickest unscheduled exit since June 17, 1996,  
when he gave up seven runs and 11 hits in 3 1-3 innings at 
Colorado's Coors Field. He pitched two shutout innings at Montreal 
on Sept. 28, 1996, then left as the Braves set up their rotation 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last regular-season start this year, he lasted three-plus  
innings against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	While he is 221-126 in his career during the regular season,  
including a 19-9 record this year, he began the night just 10-9 in 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because it's the World Series doesn't mean people aren't  
allowed to get sick,'' said Yankees manager Joe Torre, who learned 
of the switch about 5 hours before game time. ``I hadn't really 
made a lineup out anyway to that point.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host School Music Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A concert with a purpose brought stars of  
rock, soul, blues and country music to a giant tent on the White 
House lawn Saturday to support the cause of bringing music back to 
cash-starved schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was a testimonial to the power of music to transform  
young lives and President Clinton, remembering his own music 
teachers, said, ``I don't think I would have become president if it 
hadn't been for school music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the president said: ``I learned that music was more  
than scales and keys or how to make sure I was always in tune. 
Music taught me how to mix practice and patience with creativity. 
Music taught me how to be both an individual performer and a good 
member of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the lesson for everyone, he said, is that ``we are stronger  
when we are playing in harmony based on our common humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said those gathered under the  
tent included educators, children's music advocates, some of the 
nation's best performing artists ``and people like me who never 
learned to carry a tune but who appreciate people who do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, she said, is to ``to put music back in our schools and  
back in our children's education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more than two-hour concert, a reprise of popular hits as the  
20th century ends, was performed by a roster of the stars of 
American music. 
</P>
<P>
	They included: Eric Clapton, Lenny Kravitz, Sheryl Crow, B.B.  
King, Garth Brooks, Gloria Estefan, John Fogerty, Al Green, and 
John Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars who did the introducing involved another roster of  
stars: Gwyneth Paltrow, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Keri Russell, 
Angela Bassett, Sarah Jessica Parker, Calista Flockhart and Robert 
de Niro. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Save the Music'' concert was sponsored by the VH1 cable  
music channel and the National Endowment for the Arts to spark 
interest in raising money to buy instruments and sponsor music 
education in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors said that only a quarter of the nation's eight  
graders are able to take part in instrumental music programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady paid tribute to the teachers who ``are bringing  
the power of music into our children's lives'' and the young people 
``who are playing their hearts out in schools across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing music, she said, changes lives, by sparking the  
creativity of young people, teaching discipline and persistence, 
and serving as an anchor keeping kids in school and out of gangs 
and destructive activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the Save the Music initiative credited music  
instruction with building ``brain power'' and an enhanced ability 
to master basic math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
	At concert's end, Clinton thanked the musicians and offered his  
respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect them so much I left my saxophone up at the White  
House,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Leader Urges AIDS Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's prime minister launched  
Asia's largest AIDS conference Saturday with a call for a top-level 
summit and a demand that pharmaceutical companies lower the cost of 
AIDS drugs for poorer countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``AIDS has never posed a bigger threat to development than it  
does now,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in his opening 
speech at the four-day conference. ``And unless something is done 
it will pose an even bigger threat in the years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 experts, activists and AIDS patients attending the  
fifth International Congress on AIDS in Asia hope to curb HIV's 
spread in developing nations, where about 95 percent of people 
infected with the virus that causes AIDS live. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7 million people in the Asia-Pacific region are living  
with AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. At least half of new 
cases worldwide are in South and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir said the disease can only be controlled if Asian  
countries cooperate by stanching the flow of illegal migrant 
workers and the trafficking of women and children, and demanding 
cheaper drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Profit is taking precedent over people's lives,'' Mahathir  
said. ``But this high cost need not be so if developing countries 
can get together and challenge the pharmaceutical companies to 
reduce the prices or to allow developing countries the right to 
produce cheaper drugs to save the lives of their people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir, a physician, called on ``the governments of the rich''  
to assist pharmaceutical companies by bearing the cost of research 
so prices can be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the conference will focus on religious and cultural  
taboos that have stood in the way of AIDS prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Islam has no clear guidelines on using condoms, however,  
encouraging the use of condoms outside marriage is often looked 
upon as promoting promiscuity, and some religious communities brush 
off AIDS as punishment for an immoral act. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir criticized religious authorities for shirking  
responsibility over the increasing number of infected people. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long, many religious officials have hidden behind a  
veil of denial, condemning those who have been infected while doing 
little to prevent others from suffering the same fate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Community Still Hurting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A security videotape of the first moments of the  
Columbine massacre is broadcast nationwide. A student is arrested 
for making fresh threats. A surviving student's mother commits 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after a dozen students and a teacher were killed in  
the shooting attack, aftershocks continue to assail the Columbine 
community, and many wonder if it will ever end. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest emotional assault occurred Friday when the mother of  
one of the most gravely injured students walked into an Englewood 
pawn shop, asked to see a gun, loaded it when the clerk's back was 
turned and killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was all over and it started all over again,''  
said Angie Amaro, whose 15-year-old daughter, Crystal, attends 
Columbine. ``This is another victim of Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tragedy like the Columbine attack can cause feelings of  
helplessness and fresh waves of grief to take hold about six months 
later, psychologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another layer of tragedy for the people of  
Columbine to have to deal with,'' said John Eachon, vice president 
of Access and Extended Services, whose counselors have worked with 
students in the wake of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors are telling parents and students ``they need to  
connect with friends, family and the faith community,'' Eachon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was around lunchtime April 20 when students Eric Harris, 18,  
and Dylan Klebold, 17, scattered gunfire and bombs at the suburban 
high school, killing 13 and injuring about 26 before they committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst school shooting in U.S. history drew together  
grief-stricken Littleton-area residents. They comforted each other 
and volunteered to help the victims' families. The students 
returned to classes in August after a stirring, rowdy ``take back 
the school'' rally. 
</P>
<P>
	In the passing months, however, the stark reality of the  
massacre has surfaced again and again. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, CBS-TV was criticized by some residents and  
Columbine families after it broadcast a brief segment of the 
security camera videotape that showed the opening moments of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old student was arrested last week for allegedly  
threatening ``to finish the job'' begun by the student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	And Friday, Carla June Hochhalter committed suicide.  
</P>
<P>
	It should have been a better time for the family. Her daughter,  
17-year-old Anne Marie, had recently moved her legs for the first 
time since the attack. The family was preparing to move into a new 
home that was equipped for Miss Hochhalter's wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Michalik, whose son Richard Castaldo also was injured  
last spring, said she thought the family had finally turned a 
corner emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all depressed and devastated ... she was no different  
from us,'' Mrs. Michalik said. ``I thought she was better, 
especially when Anne Marie moved her legs for the first time last 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Michalik admitted she, too, has struggled with emotions  
because of her child's injuries. ``There was I time where I thought 
I had nothing to live for. I know what she went through,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Cohn, whose 15-year-old son, Aaron, survived the library  
attack, said, ``I just can't take it. That's my feeling. I can't 
believe someone killed themselves over those idiots. Her daughter 
pulled through a lot. It's been terrible for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn and his son have been to counseling, but the sessions have  
been of little help to Aaron. ``Until he opens up, there's nothing 
we can do,'' Steve Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stress is eroding his sense of safety, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I drive by the school and I'm looking behind every tree. I  
feel like a cop. I want to prevent it before it happens again,'' he 
said.

<P>
	Nebraska was seeking revenge against Texas. Instead, the  
Cornhuskers walked away with another stunning loss to the 
Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Applewhite threw for two second-half touchdowns as No. 18  
Texas rallied to beat No. 3 Nebraska for the third straight time, 
24-20 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns are 3-0 against the Cornhuskers since the Big 12  
started in 1996, including last year's 20-16 victory that ended 
Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak. Texas (6-2, 3-1) also is 
the only team to beat Nebraska (6-1, 3-1) three times in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska took a 20-17 lead on quarterback Eric Crouch's 9-yard  
TD run with 7:52 left, but Applewhite drove Texas 60 yards on four 
plays on the Longhorns' next possession for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting Ryan Nunez with a 39-yard pass to the Nebraska 21,  
Applewhite found tight end Mike Jones in the flat. Jones broke 
three tackles, including one at the goal line, for the 17-yard 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite was 9-of-21 for 47 yards in the first half as  
Nebraska built a 13-3 lead. He was 8-of-9 in the second half for 
166 yards, including a 13-yard strike to Kwame Cavil in the third 
quarter that gave Texas its first lead at 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Alexander rushed for 136 yards on 21 carries for Nebraska.  
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was No. 2 Penn State 31, No. 16 Purdue  
25; No. 5 Tennessee 21, No. 10 Alabama 7; No. 7 Kansas State 44, 
Oklahoma State 21; Illinois 35, No. 9 Michigan 29; No. 17 Wisconsin 
40, No. 11 Michigan State 10; No. 14 Georgia 49, Kentucky 34; No. 
15 Marshall 59, Buffalo 3; No. 20 East Carolina 52, Tulane 7; No. 
21 Southern Mississippi 28, Cincinnati 20; No. 22 Ohio State 20, 
No. 24 Minnesota 17; and No. 23 Miami 31, Boston College 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In late games, it was No. 1 Florida State at Clemson, LSU at No.  
12 Mississippi State, No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M at Oklahoma, and No. 19 BYU 
at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 2 Penn St. 31, No. 16 Purdue 25    	
</P>
<P>
	At West Lafayette, Ind., Penn State converted three turnovers  
into 21 points and survived a 379-yard passing effort by Drew 
Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) forced Brees into four incomplete  
passes in the final minute after he had moved the Boilermakers 
(5-3, 2-3) 58 yards to a first down at the 12 with 31 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 315th for Penn State's Joe Paterno, moving  
him past Amos Alonzo Stagg into third place among major college 
coaches and within eight of Bear Bryant's record total. 
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 5 Tennessee 21, No. 10 Alabama 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Tee Martin ran for two touchdowns and passed for another as the  
Volunteers won in their first game in Tuscaloosa in 69 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers (5-1, 3-1 SEC) beat the Crimson Tide (5-2, 4-1)  
for the fifth straight time. The game was a defensive struggle 
until Martin led Tennessee on a game-breaking, fourth-quarter 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 7 Kansas St. 44, Oklahoma St. 21    	
</P>
<P>
	At Stillwater, Okla., Jonathon Beasley threw for 311 yards as  
Kansas State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) rallied to beat Oklahoma State (3-3, 
1-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State, inspired by the return of injured quarterback  
Tony Lindsay, built a 21-0 lead over the first 17 minutes. But the 
Cowboys crumbled under the steady pressure of a Kansas State 
defense that allowed only 60 yards in the second half and made four 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Illinois 35, No. 9 Michigan 29    	
</P>
<P>
	At Ann Arbor, Mich., Kurt Kittner threw four TD passes and  
Illinois (4-3, 1-3 Big Ten) overcame a 20-point deficit to beat 
Michigan (5-2, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 27-7 midway through the third quarter, Illinois rallied  
to take a 28-27 lead on Kittner's 59-yard TD pass to Rocky Harvey 
with 2:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
               *No. 17 Wisconsin 40, No. 11 Michigan St. 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Madison, Wis., Ron Dayne rushed for 214 yards and two  
touchdowns as Wisconsin (6-2, 4-1 Big Ten) shredded the nation's 
best run defense and made Barry Alvarez the winningest coach in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (6-2, 3-2) allowed a total of 279 rushing yards  
in its first seven games. The Badgers racked up 301, including 
touchdowns runs of 51 and 15 yards by Dayne, who had just one of 
his 34 carries in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne passed Charles White for third place on the major college  
career rushing list, and moved within 483 yards of Ricky Williams' 
record with three games left. Alvarez, who coached from the press 
box to rest a sore knee, passed Phil King on Wisconsin's career 
victory list.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After days of legal maneuvering about their  
rights to rally, Ku Klux Klan members stood silently inside a pen 
fashioned from police barricades on Saturday and literally faced 
the jeers of thousands of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City succeeded in unmasking the Klan when a federal  
appeals court ruled Friday that the city could refuse to permit the 
event if participants insisted on wearing their traditional masks. 
The Klan contingent wore their traditional pointed hats, minus the 
usual face cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported seven arrests, all counter-demonstrators, on a  
variety of charges -- including one man who allegedly assaulted a 
Klansman just prior to the rally by 16 Klan members at outside a 
courthouse in lower Manhattan. He and two other men posed as Klan 
members to infiltrate the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death to the Klan!'' shouted one of the trio as police led  
them off. The other two men were charged with disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	James Sheeley of the New York and New Jersey KKK suffered a  
scrape on his cheek when three men jumped the real Klan members as 
they walked into the pen. 
</P>
<P>
	Denied a city permit to use a sound system, the Klan stood  
silently inside the pen, surrounded by police officers in riot 
helmets. The Klan members -- including two women -- were joined by 
two skinheads, one sporting a ``White Power'' patch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get our message out,'' complained Jeffrey Berry, the  
national Imperial Wizard of the American Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan. ``We are silenced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Klan had predicted that up to 80 of its members would  
turn out, barely more than a dozen appeared. Berry said it was the 
ban on masks, not the protesters, that kept attendance down. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of anti-Klan protesters, estimated at about 6,000,  
jeered and shouted angrily at the Klan as they walked out. There 
were about 2,000 onlookers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fired up! No more talk! Klan crawl back under your  
rock!'' they chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Three police officers were injured trying to control the angry  
anti-Klan crowd, said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those demonstrating against the Klan were several people  
who had argued for their right to rally -- including Rep. Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y., and civil rights lawyer Ron Kuby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We protect the right of free speech even if it is stupid and  
hate speech,'' said Nadler. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally ended after 75 minutes, with the Klan members flashing  
a Nazi salute to the crowd and shouting, ``White pride!'' Police 
escorted the Klan inside the courthouse as the demonstrators 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Klan rally in New York City since 1990, when  
Klansmen protested the removal of a picture of Jesus Christ from a 
Queens public school, said Laurie Wood of the watchdog group 
Klanwatch. The city has only 35 to 40 KKK members, according to

could not gather if they wore hoods that covered their faces. On 
Friday, a federal appeals court upheld the city's position.

<P>
	The Klan appealed Saturday to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg to keep their masks, but Ginsburg turned down the request.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Taking Coalition With Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan does not expect to leave the  
Republican Party empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	After quietly plotting strategy for weeks, the three-time  
presidential candidate plans to abandon his political roots for the 
Reform Party on Monday and take his fragile political coalition 
with him. It never quite fit the GOP, anyway 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to rally:  
</P>
<P>
	--Social conservatives by denouncing abortion and defending  
American sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	--Labor Democrats by attacking free-trade deals and defending  
workers squeezed by new economic pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	--Populists and acolytes of Reform Party founder Ross Perot by  
showing a newfound zeal for campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat is going to find an entirely different audience, where in  
the past he was left to deal with just Republican primary voters,'' 
said former Reform Party vice presidential candidate Pat Choate. 
``He can reach for the Democrats, the independents and, of course, 
the conservative Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He can go for the whole wad,'' Choate said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though he has not formally left the GOP, Buchanan already has  
inserted supporters in several state Reform Party operations. Plans 
are in place to gain ballot access state-to-state, an expensive 
procedure that will test his ability to raise money and maintain 
the loyalty of a volunteer network of longtime Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, whose GOP presidential campaign never got off the  
ground, is seeking the nomination of a fractious party made up of 
several hundred disenchanted voters and a few political novelties: 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, tycoon Donald Trump and Perot himself 
are considered potential candidates -- not to mention the handful of 
Hollywood types rumored to be mulling bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot founded the party, but Ventura reshaped it with an upset  
victory in 1998. Ventura thinks Buchanan's social views are too 
conservative, so he is urging Trump to run. Many Perot allies do 
not like Ventura and are backing Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is no stranger to a political fight.  
</P>
<P>
	He won the 1996 New Hampshire primary and put a scare into  
President Bush in the 1992 contest. Both times, his campaign 
fizzled after New Hampshire due to a lack of money and little room 
to grow beyond his social conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fear a third-party Buchanan bid would siphon  
right-wing voters from the eventual nominee, tipping the scales in 
favor of the Democratic presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some polls substantiate the fears, though others suggest  
Buchanan would draw equally from both parties. In either case, only 
one in 10 voters expressed support for Buchanan's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Buchanan's political history gives him reason to believe he  
can expand beyond his GOP base. In open primaries -- those that did 
not limit the voting to Republicans -- Buchanan padded his totals 
with Democratic votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Exit polls from 1996 showed that hard-hat Democrats helped  
Buchanan draw 40 percent of the vote against eventual nominee Bob 
Dole in Michigan, and more than 30 percent in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan returns to Michigan on Tuesday, after announcing his  
decision in Washington and holding a rally in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buchanan will pull, if he wins the nomination, from the  
blue-collar Democrats as much as from Republicans, '' said Patricia 
Benjamin, vice chairman of the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan earned 31 percent of the vote to Dole's 34 percent in  
Macomb County, Mich., where he was returning for the announcement 
tour. Longtime Democrats in the blue-collar suburbs north of 
Detroit swung to President Reagan in the 1980s and back to 
Democrats in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The county's Reagan Democrats welcomed Buchanan's skeptical take  
on trade and his tirades about the gap between high- and low-wage 
earners. A similar message from Perot did equally well: He earned 
nearly 20 percent of the county's general election vote in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of Buchanan's announcement trip is equally revealing.  
</P>
<P>
	He travels Wednesday to textile country in South Carolina, where  
Democrats and Republicans alike blame free-trade agreements for 
shuttered plants. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he plans to go to the heart of the Reform Party  
with a visit to Minnesota. He wants to show that he is not 
intimated by Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in North Dakota on Friday and Saturday to attend a  
Christian Coalition meeting, wrapping up the tour with a return to 
his roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion, trade, jobs, wages and the dangers of getting involved  
abroad are expected to be a staple of Buchanan's speeches, 
associates say. He may trim and expand to soothe his audience: less 
talk of abortion in Michigan than in North Dakota, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	He already is modifying his message for the party switch. Rarely  
one to discuss campaign finance reform, Buchanan suddenly has a 
section of his Internet site devoted to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane McKelvey, a Reform Party leader from Michigan, said she  
and several other party members met recently with Buchanan to test 
his support for the issue -- a major plank in the party platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at our platform and said, `There's nothing here I  
disagree with,''' she said. ``He said he has not pushed it before 
because he was focused on other issues.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Italian Premier Wins Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALERMO, Sicily (AP) -- Former Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti  
won acquittal today on a charge of consorting with the Mafia, 
ending the four-year trial of a man whose political career has 
lasted as long as the republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreotti, Italy's seven-time premier and now a  
senator-for-life, was accused of doing favors for Sicily's Mafia in 
exchange for votes. A three-judge panel in the Sicilian capital, 
Palermo, declared him innocent after 10 days of deliberations. 
Italian television carried the verdict live in what they called the 
trial of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreotti, 80, could have faced up to 15 years in prison if  
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The most riveting accusation was that Andreotti exchanged a  
``kiss of honor'' with Sicily's boss of bosses, Salvatore ``Toto'' 
Riina, in a secret meeting in the 1980s. But Andreotti contended he 
was framed by mobsters who wanted revenge for his government's 
crackdowns on organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the so-called proof from the turncoats was not  
enough for a conviction,'' defense lawyer Franco Coppi said after 
the verdict. ``Obviously, if they had believed in the kiss ... the 
outcome would have been different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreotti stayed in Rome today, keeping to his daily routine of  
going to his senatorial office in the morning. ``I'm happy to 
arrive alive at this day,'' he told reporters clustered outside his 
home at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Andreotti's defense was that the charge against him was  
too unthinkable to be true. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict ``must tell the whole world that Italy was not  
governed for 50 years by a man who consorted with the Mafia and 
whose hands drip with blood,'' Coppi said in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors' case depended mainly on testimony from Mafia  
turncoats -- chiefly Baldassare Di Maggio, whose information helped 
authorities capture Riina in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of prosecutors' efforts in the closing days of the trial  
were devoted to defending their star witness' credibility, shaken 
when Di Maggio admitted this month to killing a man while under 
state protection. Di Maggio, who received a $300,000 ``bonus'' 
under the witness-protection program, has since been stripped of 
his benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreotti has insisted the state lured informants with promises  
of money and immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have waited in vain for the prosecution -- unable to come up  
with a shred of evidence -- to acknowledge the groundlessness of the 
accusations,'' Andreotti told the three-judge panel just before it 
began deliberating Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court thought him capable of such a meeting, Andreotti  
told the judges, it should not just convict him but lock him up in 
a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors formally notified him in March 1993 that he was  
under investigation. Italian media at the time called the 
accusation the most serious in the republic's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreotti is one of the few members of parliament to serve  
without interruption since creation of the modern Italian state 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a court in Perugia acquitted Andreotti of the 1979  
murder of an Italian journalist. That trial also was largely based 
on turncoat testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican expressed satisfaction over rejection of the murder  
charge against Andreotti, whose now-defunct Christian Democrat 
party was closely allied with the church during its long time in 
power.

Friday, a federal appeals court upheld the city's position. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan appealed Saturday to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg to keep their masks, but Ginsburg turned down the request.

<HEADLINE> Co. Gives Same-Sex Partners Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. has joined the growing number of  
major corporations that extends health-care benefits to the 
same-sex domestic partners of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the need to maintain a quality work force and the  
benefits of diversity, Boeing announced late Friday plans to offer 
the benefits next year to the domestic partners of salaried 
nonunion employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced to company managers by e-mail, was  
praised by gay rights advocates. But it was criticized by union 
leaders for leaving out their members and unmarried heterosexual 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Annetta Small, director of the West Coast office of Kerusso  
Ministries, which seeks to persuade gays and lesbians to become 
heterosexual through Christianity, also was critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are giving benefits to a behavior that I believe is wrong  
and that I believe is immoral,'' she said. ``I don't believe that 
we should extend these benefits to people who are not married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not say how many employees would be  
affected. Roughly half of Boeing's 202,000 employees worldwide are 
salaried and nonunion. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Forbes Magazine survey indicated unmarried partners are  
covered by health benefits in 10 percent of the businesses with at 
least 200 employees. Companies that provide same-sex partner 
benefits include Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., IBM, 
Walt Disney Co., Honeywell and Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, United Airlines agreed to extend some benefits to  
domestic partners, just hours after an appeals court refused to 
grant the company an exemption to a San Francisco ordinance 
mandating certain benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two weeks of United's decision, American Airlines and US  
Airways also adopted the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's decision was long overdue, said Charles Fay, chairman  
of Hands-Off Washington in Snohomish County, and Dennis Rybicki, a 
spokesman for the Snohomish County Elections Committee, which ranks 
political candidates on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should send a signal to other employers, large and small,  
that it's good business to recognize the value of all families,'' 
Fay said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Society of Professional  
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, Charles Bofferding, said his 
union would like the benefits, but the move seemed to be designed 
to sabotage his group's contract negotiations, which begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	SPEEA is the second-largest union at Boeing, representing 23,000  
scientists, engineers and technical workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bofferding said by leaving out union members, Boeing may be  
trying to get the union to give up other potential bargaining 
demands in exchange for obtaining health-care benefits for same-sex 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Conte said the benefits will not be offered to unmarried  
heterosexual partners because they can get married, an option not 
legally available to same-sex partners.

<HEADLINE>  French Woman Wins Cycling Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- France's Felicia Ballanger, the most dominant  
woman in track cycling history, swept the time trials Saturday to 
capture her 10th world championship gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old won in 34.477, one day after claiming the  
sprint. She is unbeaten in both events at the worlds since first 
winning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Another French rider, Laurent Gane, gave France its sixth gold  
medal with a victory in the men's sprint. He upset two-time Olympic 
champion Jens Fiedler, helped by the German's rules infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gane was awarded the first heat in the best of three event when  
Fiedler blocked his path to the inside of the track. He then 
eliminated the German in the second heat. 
</P>
<P>
	France now has tied its six golds in 12 events at last year's  
world held in Bordeaux heading in Sunday's final day. Germany has 
claimed two. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Bruno Risi also became the first rider who wasn't  
French or German to win a title when he captured the points race. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Risi won his fourth world title in the event by  
passing three riders on the last curve of the final sprint. The 10 
points awarded pushed his total to 25 points.

<HEADLINE> Bullish Economist Awaits Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The U.S. economy continues to defy what most economists  
previously believed to be well-established laws. This has prompted 
optimists among us to declare that the soul of the economy has 
escaped the earthly constraints of past business cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	I doubt that this is the case.  
</P>
<P>
	There is certainly some evidence to support the claim that we  
have entered a new era: declining and then stable inflation since 
1990, steadily increasing investment in growth-producing capital, a 
long-awaited surge in productivity, a passage from federal 
government deficits to surpluses, an impressive and continuing 
growth in jobs at a time of low unemployment and, last but not 
least, an unprecedented rise in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it is the role of the stock market that is probably least  
understood, least appreciated, and therefore, most worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	We know that as apparent wealth in the form of stocks and real  
estate increases, consumption increases. Since consumption is the 
largest component of our economy's total demand, increases in stock 
prices, and more recently real estate prices, have contributed to 
steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But since investors are reluctant to cash in their shares, the  
increased spending must come from additional borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The private savings rate has now turned negative. For the first  
time in recent history, households as a whole are spending more 
than their incomes. There is nothing inherently wrong with this -- 
if the wealth is real. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, as a society we may believe we are borrowing to  
invest in assets that will pay off handsomely in the future, 
allowing us to repay the loans and still consume more now and 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the individual investor, U.S. corporations play a  
key role in this process. Firms make decisions to invest in 
growth-producing real assets with funds we leave in the stock 
market. They also borrow some of the money, contributing to the 
need for higher future payoffs before cash in the form of dividends 
can find its way back to the stockholders and into consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the firms' investment decisions produce payoffs that  
are less than those anticipated by the stockholders? This could 
very well be the situation today. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, stockholders have demanded returns well in excess  
of those available on government bonds. A recent survey of 
individual investors indicates that they expect returns of about 15 
percent over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the current price-earnings' ratios on stocks  
indicate that investors are naively expecting firms to earn totally 
unrealistic returns on their plowed-back earnings. When it becomes 
evident that this isn't in the cards, the stock market could be in 
for a rough time. 
</P>
<P>
	The most optimistic argue that as long as investors have a long  
horizon, they no longer should demand significantly higher returns, 
and that this fact alone accounts for the high level of stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While this may be theoretically correct, anecdotal evidence  
suggests the opposite. Investing in the stock market seems to have 
become almost a fad, and it is doubtful that stockholders are 
expecting future returns as low as this argument requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the problem is the fact that firms appear to be taking  
the high level of stock prices as evidence that investors have 
lowered their requirements. Corporations are re-investing an 
all-time high percentage of their earnings in new capital assets 
(or buying back their own stock). 
</P>
<P>
	In the short-run, this has the effect of sustaining the  
appearance of being in a ``New World'' of unlimited growth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the most pessimistic argue that current stock  
market prices reflect a bubble. Investors are unconcerned with 
future corporate earnings, but they believe that prices will 
continue to rise because the market expects them to. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas fads can be sustained for longer periods, bubbles burst  
suddenly, as in the United States in 1929 and in Japan at the end 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the rising market is due to a bubble or a fad is not the  
most important point. In either case, a correction is inevitable, 
and it is the unwinding of the process now generating the apparent 
wealth that will have serious economic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	As market forces destroy the perceived wealth, consumption and  
investment will fall at the same time that the debt taken on by 
individuals and firms remains as a huge overhang. A subsequent 
recovery will eventually come, but most likely will be distant and 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, this process has been called the business cycle.  
When we consider the role the stock market has played in the recent 
prolonged period of economic expansion, there is little reason to 
believe nirvana has been achieved -- at least this time around.

<HEADLINE> Maddux To Start Game 1 for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux will start Game 1 of the World Series  
tonight for Atlanta instead of Tom Glavine, scratched because of 
flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine would have been pitching against the New York Yankees on  
seven days' rest, while Maddux is starting on five days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood, originally slated to start Game 3 Tuesday at  
Yankee Stadium, replaces Maddux as Sunday night's starter against 
David Cone in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Series between two of baseball's winningest teams in 1999 is  
a duel for the decade with two of the game's most successful 
postseason pitchers on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are seeking their third World Series title in four  
years while the Braves have won eight division titles, five 
National League pennants and one World Series since 1991. The 
winner can lay claim as the dominant team of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that's going to be one of the things that's making  
this a good World Series,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	That and some of the best pitching in baseball. Both teams come  
in with glitzy rotations that should produce tight, tense games. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux has a 2-2 World Series record, splitting decisions  
against Cleveland in 1995 and the Yankees in 1996, including a loss 
in New York's Game 6 clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	While he is 221-126 in his career during the regular season,  
including a 19-9 record this year, he is only 10-9 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees counter with Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban import who  
was 17-9 and emerged as the No. 1 pitcher on New York's staff. 
Using a high leg kick and corkscrew motion, El Duque is 4-0 in five 
career postseason starts and his 0.97 ERA is third best in history 
for starters with more than 30 innings in playoffs and World 
Series. He was MVP of the American League Championship Series when 
he had a 1.80 ERA in two starts against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is that he changes speed,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``That's what makes him so effective. You may see a 
fastball and then there will be another fastball, but maybe a few 
miles an hour quicker or slower. He uses both sides of the plate. 
He's able to throw the breaking ball from a number of different 
release points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox offered a scouting report on Hernandez that starts and  
finishes with the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can pitch out of the strike zone pretty good,'' Cox said.  
``He can come at you from all angles. He can get you off balance, 
straighten you up and still make you lunge and feel for breaking 
stuff off the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be patient for a ball you can handle. He's tough.  
He didn't start the other series because he's just an average 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre became sold on Hernandez's postseason capabilities a year  
ago when he rescued the Yankees in Game 4 of the ALCS against 
Cleveland after the Indians won two of the first three games. 
Hernandez pitched seven shutout innings, allowing only three hits, 
and the Yankees never lost another game en route to their 24th 
World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look in the eyes,'' Torre said. ``It's just something  
inside him. I guess it goes back to where he came from and how 
tough it was to get over here and have an opportunity to pitch at 
the major league level. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you do it, now you realize it's in that memory bank  
and it's in that feel, and then you do it again and now we expect 
it every time we send him out there. It's not saying he's going to 
win, but I know one thing -- he's going to empty the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves handled El Duque easily in interleague play. They  
beat him 7-2 in 1998, his first regular-season loss, and tagged him 
for four home runs in a 10-7 win this season. 
</P>
<P>
	So he'll be the one making adjustments this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be able to say as far as my technique and  
approach and what I'm going to do,'' he said through an 
interpreter. ``Obviously, it's something I should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was asked if facing the Braves was more personal,  
considering how they hit him in their previous encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congratulations to them,'' he said. ``Congratulations.''

<HEADLINE> Police Say Teen Sang About Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METAIRIE, La. (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy collected $25 for  
shooting and wounding a golfer, then told his friends about it in a 
rap song, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a parody of a song made popular by Bob Marley and Eric  
Clapton, Patrick R. Cheron sang: ``I shot the golfer, but not the 
man next to him,'' police say. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheron was arrested Friday on an attempted murder charge. Also  
arrested were Matthew D. Scalco, 17, who allegedly drove the 
getaway car, and Mark D. Levy, 17, who police say offered the $25 
dare. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheron used his father's .22-caliber handgun to shoot the  
54-year-old golfer as he prepared to hit a shot on the second hole 
at Metairie Country Club, authorities said. The bullet left a 
quarter-sized hole in the man's pelvis and remains lodged in his 
body.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Weekly Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Barry Goldwater thought he would be  
running for president against John F. Kennedy, he talked with the 
president and said that they informally agreed to travel together 
in a debate-based campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems a pipe dream in looking at some of today's negative  
campaigning,'' the late Arizona senator wrote of the idea. It 
probably was, even then. And Kennedy was assassinated a year before 
the 1964 election Goldwater lost to a Democratic landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Vice President Al Gore wants weekly debates throughout the  
2000 campaign, an idea he said came to him when he recalled the 
Goldwater-Kennedy story. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that is a pipe dream, too, since challenger Bill Bradley  
is not buying Gore's challenge to debate him every week. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president  
said that if he wins the Democratic nomination, ``I will make the 
same challenge to the Republican nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean as many as 10 debates between the nominees,  
instead of the customary three, which wouldn't leave much time for 
anything else. ``I'd rather turn campaigns into that than what they 
have become now,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore prods Bradley -- ``I really was surprised when he  
didn't accept'' -- Republican Steve Forbes has offered to restrain 
his campaign advertising against Gov. George W. Bush in an effort 
to get the GOP front-runner into a series of at least five debates. 
No go there, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and the other four Republicans trying to overtake Bush  
had an hour's debate among themselves in Durham, N.H., on Friday 
night, without breaking new campaign ground. They meet again this 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley open at a forum in Hanover, N.H., on Wednesday.  
After challenging Bradley to debate him every two weeks, Gore upped 
it to weekly. He put that to Bradley when they both addressed a Des 
Moines Democratic dinner on Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about it, Bill? If the answer is yes, stand up and wave  
your hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley just smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president began his debate demands after Bradley  
started gaining on him. Bradley has agreed to meet him seven times 
before the New Hampshire presidential primary on Feb. 1. The Gore 
campaign called that timid, saying that there have been more than 
40 invitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Not enough for Gore. ``It's an unusual opportunity to do  
something that's never been done before and that is to have a 
full-blown issues-oriented debate with a different issue each 
week,'' he said in the AP interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Leadership Council is running TV ads mocking the  
Democratic rivals as look-alikes. ``So what are we going to 
debate?'' one ad asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Republicans don't have a similar problem as they debate  
without Bush. After saying that he would wait until next year, when 
people are paying more attention, Bush agreed to appear at a 
90-minute GOP candidate forum in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2. He's 
expected to do one more, in Iowa, in December, and will be in at 
least three early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried for more by saying that if Bush would agree to an  
early series of debates, he'd skip the kind of TV attack ads he 
used against GOP rivals in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have this series of in-depth debates, in my ads I'll  
only use material from those debates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush replied that Forbes can advertise as he chooses, that  
negative tactics would backfire and that he will debate on his own 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runners can pick their spots, although not without some  
risk. Ronald Reagan skipped a Republican debate in Iowa in 1980, 
saying it would be divisive. He changed his mind about debates 
after losing the Iowa caucuses that year, and used them to 
advantage in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dukakis probably set the record for debating on his way  
to the 1988 Democratic nomination. He appeared in 21. Gore was 
among the debaters that year, but an early campaign dropout. 
</P>
<P>
	But a record of sorts for memorable tactics in a primary debate  
belongs to a minor candidate in New Hampshire in 1972. At the 
debate table with the Democratic heavyweights, Ned Coll said the 
issue was poverty. He came with a prop to dramatize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time it came his turn to talk, he dangled a rubber rat by  
the tail. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gaston Impress Indians With Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians are looking for a manager who can  
take them to the ``next level'' -- a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, then Cito Gaston is their man.  
</P>
<P>
	He has been to the next level, and he's got the jewelry to prove  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston, who led the Toronto Blue Jays to Series titles in 1992  
and '93, met with Indians general manager John Hart and assistant 
GM Mark Shapiro for more than three hours Friday to discuss 
Cleveland's managerial opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston, hired as the Blue Jays hitting coach on Oct. 12, took a  
casual-Friday approach to his interview, electing not to wear a tie 
with his sport coat and dress slacks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he made sure he put on one of his two World Series  
championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have them both on,'' he said. ``I think that would  
have been a little much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was impressed with Gaston.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was outstanding,'' Hart said. ``He came just as advertised.  
Cito is a guy who has a real presence about him, one that demands 
respect. A quiet strength. He did a real good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston is the third candidate to interview with the Indians, who  
fired Mike Hargrove last week in the wake of their collapse against 
the Boston Red Sox in the first round of the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Hart met with former Cubs manager Jim  
Riggleman and Indians hitting instructor Charlie Manuel, considered 
the frontrunner to replace Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Gaston, Hart immediately left for the World  
Series in Atlanta where he plans to meet with Braves hitting 
instructor Don Baylor and Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss 
during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really happy with our list,'' Hart told the Associated  
Press before boarding his plane. ``But that doesn't mean that it 
won't grow either. There could be some others we will eventually 
meet with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said he was especially looking forward to talking with  
Chambliss, who in 1971 was named AL Rookie of the Year with the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy I really hope blows me away is Chambliss,'' Hart said.  
``He has not managed at the major league level yet, but from what 
people have been telling me, he has all the credentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does the 55-year-old Gaston. And his two World Series rings  
as Toronto's manager give him something none of the other 
candidates can match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cito knows what it takes to win,'' Hart said. ``He has brought  
a club home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home, in Cleveland, means a World Series championship. The  
Indians haven't won it all since 1948, and Hargrove's inability to 
get his team to the ``next level'' -- as Hart put it -- cost him his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston has already proved he can take a veteran club like the  
Indians to a title. His '93 team in Toronto, which featured Rickey 
Henderson, Devon White, Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter, was similar 
to the one in Cleveland now. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been winning here for a long time,'' Gaston said.  
``They've probably had more success than we had in Toronto except 
for winning the World Series. They're right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, now with the Indians, would frequently bring up Gaston's  
name this past season -- his first in Cleveland. The All-Star second 
baseman flourished under his former manager in Toronto, and their 
strong relationship could give Gaston an edge when Hart has to make 
a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston, a grandfather who once roomed with Hank Aaron during his  
playing career, said his approach to managing is simple. If a 
player deserves a pat on the back, he'll probably get one. And if 
he needs to be lectured, well, then that's what he'll get. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to adjust to the players you have,'' he said. ``The  
biggest thing is letting guys go out and play. I don't remember the 
last time I hit a home run or struck a guy out. The bottom line is 
the players have to win for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said the Indians had not put a timetable on completing  
their managerial search, and that any finalists would be brought 
back for a second interview and meeting with team owner Dick 
Jacobs.

<HEADLINE> Actress Swank Discusses New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hilary Swank says immersing herself in her role  
as a girl pretending to be a guy in the new film ``Boys Don't Cry'' 
had her wondering where her own personality was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Swank, nearly two years after a season on ``Beverly Hills,  
90210,'' stars in the true story of Teena Brandon, a 21-year-old 
woman who was raped and murdered in 1993 near Falls City, Neb., 
after passing as a man named Brandon and seducing several of the 
town's women. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a month after shooting was complete to ``totally detox  
Brandon out of my system,'' she says in the latest Entertainment 
Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had been stifling my own mannerisms for so long. I was  
scared I was never going to be all the way Hilary again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film's release recently expanded to theaters  
nationwide. The movie has Swank being mentioned for an Oscar 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Maddux, Rocker Come Up Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Tom Glavine made the call to Greg Maddux. Then  
the call went out to John Rocker in the bullpen. They both turned 
out to be wrong numbers for the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, filling in for flu-stricken Tom Glavine, took a shutout  
into the eighth but couldn't get another out. Rocker, the quotable 
escape artist, couldn't free himself from another bases-loaded jam. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: a 4-1 victory for the New York Yankees on Saturday  
in Game 1 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stuff was all right,'' Maddux said. ``But it's not about  
pitching good. It's about winning. I pitched just good enough to 
lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time Cy Young winner, originally scheduled to work Game  
2, received a telephone call late Friday night from Glavine, who 
had been picked for the opener but came down with a bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine asked Maddux if he'd mind moving up a day in the  
rotation. Sure, replied Maddux, who had five days' rest since his 
last appearance in the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I was glad,'' he said. ``I didn't want to sit around  
waiting, doing nothing. I wanted to get out there. This is the 
World Series. Why sit around when you get in there and mix it up, 
make things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly not bothered by the sudden change of plans, Maddux  
allowed only three singles through the seventh. A 1-0 lead was 
provided by one of only two Atlanta hits on the night, a solo homer 
by Chipper Jones in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux needed only six more outs, but he couldn't get one.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was sad to see,'' outfielder Brian Jordan said. ``He  
pitched seven great innings, so you hate what happened in the 
eighth. The guy was throwing so well. Unfortunately, we made a 
couple of mistakes and things didn't work out for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, first baseman Brian Hunter, who had just come in  
the game as a defensive upgrade for Ryan Klesko, bobbled a bunt and 
made an errant throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to come in for defense and make errors,''  
Hunter said. ``That makes you look stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first player at his position to make two errors in  
one Series inning since Frank Torre of the Milwaukee Braves in 1958 
-- also against the Yankees. Hunter's miscues helped this New York 
team score four runs against Maddux and iron-armed Rocker, pitching 
in his 10th straight game of this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made mistakes,'' Jordan said. ``You can't make mistakes  
against the Yankees and expect to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux faced four batters in the eighth, leaving with the bases  
still loaded after Derek Jeter's game-tying single to left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves called for the left-handed Rocker, who had escaped a  
similar jam against Houston in the opening round of the playoffs. 
With the crowd roaring, the sound system blaring ``I Wanna Rock'' 
by the 1980s band Twisted Sister, he made his customary sprint from 
the bullpen with the memory of the Astrodome miracle still fresh in 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bases loaded and the 3-4-5 hitters coming up,'' Rocker  
said. ``The odds weren't in my favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The odds turned the last time when Walt Weiss made a game-saving  
stop on a line drive up the middle. But there was nothing the 
Atlanta shortstop could do when Paul O'Neill -- whose average 
against left-handers (.190) was the worst in the AL among 
qualifying batters -- lined a two-run single to right to put the 
Yankees ahead 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Houston, I got a ground ball that was hit at somebody,''  
Rocker said, shaking his head. ``The ground ball tonight found the 
hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker wound up striking out the side, but not before he also  
surrendered a bases-loaded walk to Jim Leyritz, the sight of whom 
must have brought back bad memories for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, in Atlanta's last Series appearance, Leyritz  
hit a critical homer against Mark Wohlers in Game 4. This time, 
Leyritz didn't do anything so dramatic, merely bouncing back from 
an 0-2 count to coax four balls from Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	Another wrong call for the Braves.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was making out pitches,'' Rocker said. ``Houston swung at  
those pitches. Tonight, they were taking them.''

<HEADLINE> Cathedral Bars Ezra Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's no place for Ezra Pound at the Cathedral  
of St. John the Divine. 
</P>
<P>
	The dean of the cathedral has overruled a decision by a group of  
poets and writers to honor Pound with a place in St. John's Poet's 
Corner because of his anti-Semitic writings and broadcasts from 
Italy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Very Rev. Harry S. Pritchett Jr. informed members of the  
Poet's Corner electing panel of his decision in a letter last week, 
The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which includes John Updike, Robert Pinsky and Donald  
Hall, had voted to honor Pound and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Pritchett 
said he had intended to accept the nominations until the 
congregation protested the plans for Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	In broadcasts from January 1941 to July 1943, Pound blamed Jews  
and other groups for global economic problems. He was indicted for 
treason in 1943, and imprisoned by American forces near Pisa in 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
	The Poet's Corner at the cathedral was founded in 1984 to  
celebrate American writers and modeled after the Poet's Corner in 
Westminster Abbey. Carved stones, measuring about 6 square feet, 
have been laid in the corner on the north side of the cathedral's 
nave to honor 33 writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those writers include Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Emily  
Dickinson, William Carlos Williams, T.S. Eliot and William 
Faulkner.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Make Offer to Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Just when it seemed Latrell Sprewell might  
be headed out the door, the New York Knicks slammed it shut. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of reportedly shopping Sprewell around the league,  
the Knicks made an offer to their controversial star before 
Saturday's exhibition game against the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The details have yet to be finalized, but Sprewell said he was  
happy the team had reached out to keep him and that it was ``more 
than likely'' he will sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was genuine, sincere, something I can live with,'' Sprewell  
said after scoring 14 points in the Knicks' 91-80 victory. ``Right 
now it's just a matter of longer or shorter. I'd like to get it 
over with in the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, had asked for the maximum  
allowable under the collective bargaining agreement -- six years and 
$78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll have all the numbers done by Monday,'' Gist  
said. ``He's anxious about the extension and hopefully will retire 
with that No. 8 jersey. They want him here as long as he wants to 
be here. The net numbers weren't as important as the longterm 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were doing all they could to repair the damage to  
that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very cordial meeting, about an hour and a half,''  
said Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts, who met with 
general manager Scott Layden and Gist in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a substantial offer, and I hope we made it clear to  
(Sprewell) we want him to remain a member of the Knicks for a long 
time,'' Checketts said at halftime. ``He's got good options. It's 
all good news. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the option to sign or to wait and see what's up next  
summer. I don't have a feel for what he'll do. It's up to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial and popular member of the Knicks actually  
could have been a goner three weeks ago in a trade for Scottie 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``His name was discussed, he was available,'' said a  
high-ranking official with the Houston Rockets, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. ``He was never formally offered, but that's 
only because we decided quickly to do the trade with Portland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts denied the Knicks had been looking to deal Sprewell.  
</P>
<P>
	``Reports are that we shopped him around,'' Checketts said.  
``That's absolutely not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade rumors involving Sprewell have been floating around all  
preseason. Lakers coach Phil Jackson talked about a possible Glen 
Rice-Sprewell trade, and it's no secret that the Knicks twice 
approached the Seattle SuperSonics to ask about Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing general managers have also heard that the Milwaukee  
Bucks and Miami Heat are coveting Sprewell. But it seems unlikely 
Checketts would approve a trade of such a fan favorite to the 
former coach he despises, Pat Riley, or the former team president 
he dumped in April, Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Sprewell received the longest suspension and what  
amounted to the largest fine in league history for attacking and 
threatening the life of Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	He drives recklessly, stayed incommunicado all summer and has a  
reputation of being a troublemaker. In the Knicks' locker room, 
he's pretty much a loner. 
</P>
<P>
	Many owners and general managers around the league remain  
philosophically opposed to acquiring such a volatile player. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know me, they haven't coached me, they don't know  
that I come to practice every day and what I do,'' Sprewell said. 
``They just know what they're read and hear from a few other 
people. As far as I'm concerned, it's their loss and not mine.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Weekly Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Barry Goldwater thought he would be  
running for president against John F. Kennedy, he talked with the 
president and said that they informally agreed to travel together 
in a debate-based campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems a pipe dream in looking at some of today's negative  
campaigning,'' the late Arizona senator wrote of the idea. It 
probably was, even then. And Kennedy was assassinated a year before 
the 1964 election Goldwater lost to a Democratic landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Vice President Al Gore wants weekly debates throughout the  
2000 campaign, an idea he said came to him when he recalled the 
Goldwater-Kennedy story. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that is a pipe dream, too, since challenger Bill Bradley  
is not buying Gore's challenge to debate him every week. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president  
said that if he wins the Democratic nomination, ``I will make the 
same challenge to the Republican nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean as many as 10 debates between the nominees,  
instead of the customary three, which wouldn't leave much time for 
anything else. ``I'd rather turn campaigns into that than what they 
have become now,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore prods Bradley -- ``I really was surprised when he  
didn't accept -- Republican Steve Forbes has offered to restrain his 
campaign advertising against Gov. George W. Bush in an effort to 
get the GOP front-runner into a series of at least five debates. No 
go there, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and the other four Republicans trying to overtake Bush  
had an hour's debate among themselves in Durham, N.H., on Friday 
night, without breaking new campaign round. They meet again this 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley open at a forum in Hanover, N.H., on Wednesday.  
After challenging Bradley to debate him every two weeks, Gore upped 
it to weekly. He put that to Bradley when they both addressed a Des 
Moines Democratic dinner on Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about it, Bill? If the answer is yes, stand up and wave  
your hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley just smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president began his debate demands after Bradley  
started gaining on him. Bradley has agreed to meet him seven times 
before the New Hampshire presidential primary on Feb. 1. The Gore 
campaign called that timid, saying that there have been more than 
40 invitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Not enough for Gore. ``It's an unusual opportunity to do  
something that's never been done before and that is to have a 
full-blown issues-oriented debate with a different issue each 
week,'' he said in the AP interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Leadership Council is running TV ads mocking the  
Democratic rivals as look-alikes. ``So what are we going to 
debate?'' one ad asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Republicans don't have a similar problem as they debate  
without Bush. After saying that he would wait until next year, when 
people are paying more attention, Bush agreed to appear at a 
90-minute GOP candidate forum in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2. He's 
expected to do one more, in Iowa, in December, and will be in at 
least three early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried for more by saying that if Bush would agree to an  
early series debates, he'd skip the kind of TV attack ads he used 
against GOP rivals in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have this series of in-depth debates, in my ads I'll  
only use material from those debates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush replied that Forbes can advertise as he chooses, that  
negative tactics would backfire and that he will debate on his own 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runners can pick their spots, although not without some  
risk. Ronald Reagan skipped a Republican debate in Iowa in 1980, 
saying it would be divisive. He changed his mind about debates 
after losing the Iowa caucuses that year, and used them to 
advantage in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dukakis probably set the record for debating on his way  
to the 1988 Democratic nomination. He appeared in 21. Gore was 
among the debaters that year, but an early campaign dropout. 
</P>
<P>
	But a record of sorts for memorable tactics in a primary debate  
belongs to a minor candidate in New Hampshire in 1972. At the 
debate table with the Democratic heavyweights, Ned Coll said the 
issue was poverty. He came with a prop to dramatize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time it came his turn to talk, he dangled a rubber rat by  
the tail. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Howard U. Nurses Approve Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a daylong strike, nurses at Howard  
University Hospital approved a three-year contract Friday that 
provides for a 7 percent base pay increase and forced overtime only 
in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got everything we wanted,'' said Mary Jones-Bryant,  
chairwoman of the District of Columbia Nurses Association. She said 
the decision to strike was ``agonizing'' but worth it in the end: 
``We showed unity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Howard, one of the nation's largest and best  
known historically black teaching hospitals, said management's goal 
was to give nurses the pay they deserve while making sure the 
institution has enough resources to invest in patient care, 
research and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident the agreement ... allows us to maintain that  
balance,'' said spokeswoman Donna Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after weeks of negotiations, a 12-hour strike  
Friday and a 1 1/2-hour vote. Union officials would not reveal the 
vote breakdown, but Jones-Bryant said the proposal was strongly 
approved. About 100 nurses, pharmacists and other union members 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year contract gives nurses a 2 percent base pay  
increase in the first year, 3 percent in the second year and 2 
percent in the third year, Jones-Bryant said. Raises for 
pharmacists were slightly higher, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most nurses who went on strike are to return to work Saturday  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nurses here are tired, they worked all night and they  
marched all day,'' Jones-Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had argued that forced overtime and inadequate  
staffing levels erode the quality of care and threaten patient 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times you're giving just the bare needs, but you can't stop  
to listen and talk to patients when they need it,'' said Joyce 
Purnell, a striking nurse normally assigned to the hospital's 
Intensive Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 137-year-old teaching hospital has invested heavily in new  
technology in recent years, but staffers at the 340-bed complex had 
not had raises in three years, union members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital personnel records indicate 57 percent of the nurses  
earn more than $60,000 base pay. They also receive time and a half 
for overtime and double time for holidays, said Brock, the hospital 
spokeswoman. ``They are among the highest paid nurses in the 
District of Columbia,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials insisted Friday that they had negotiated with  
the union in good faith since April. They also expressed regret 
that a federal mediator had failed to resolve differences with the 
union.

<HEADLINE>  Fire 4, Burn 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Fire stayed alive in the MLS Western  
Conference semifinals with a 4-0 victory over the Dallas Burn on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago evened the best-of-3 series with the deciding game to be  
played Wednesday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire, the defending MLS Cup champions, dominated the play  
early, and it paid off when Peter Nowak opened the scoring in the 
18th minute. Diego Gutierrez sent a pass to Nowak, who was alone in 
the box, dribbled ahead to his left and sent a shot past Dallas 
goalie Matt Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burn had a six-game winning streak entering the match but  
was 0-9 this season when conceding the first goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire put the game away with two goals in the last 10 minutes  
of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Kosecki's shot in the 36th minute found the left side of  
the net when it deflected off the leg of Dallas defender Richard 
Farrer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ante Razov gave Chicago a 3-0 lead in the 43rd minute. With his  
back to the goal just outside the box on the right, he turned and 
fired a shot that curved into the left side of the net. Jesse 
Marsch and goalie Zach Thornton earned assists on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dodd replaced Jordan in goal for Dallas at halftime, but it  
didn't slow down the Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Halftime substitute Dema Kovalenko gave his team a 4-0 lead in  
the 46th minute when he knocked Kosecki's pass down to his left 
foot in front of Dodd, just to the left of the net, and converted 
the point-blank shot. Nowak also earned an assist on the play.

<HEADLINE> Young Puts Off Retirement Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- As long as he's not playing and  
risking the possibility of further injury, the pressure's off Steve 
Young to make a decision on his football future. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent for the San Francisco 49ers quarterback said Friday  
that Young, sidelined indefinitely by concussion problems, still is 
gathering medical advice on whether he should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg said a final decision could be weeks or even  
months away, though Young remains hopeful that he will be able to 
resume his career at some point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve just wants to step back and get a chance to breathe,''  
Steinberg said. ``He's just a person trying to make a decision, but 
we don't have to make one right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, who sustained his fourth concussion in three years  
Sept. 27 against Arizona, has missed three games. It's uncertain 
whether he'll get medical clearance to rejoin the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh had said the club planned to address  
Young's future next week, but that has been delayed indefinitely. 
The possibility remains that Young could be placed on injured 
reserve if doctors recommend a prolonged period away from football. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, a two-time NFL MVP who led San Francisco to its last  
Super Bowl win in 1994, would be finished for the season if he were 
to go on IR. Even under that scenario, Steinberg said Young 
probably wouldn't make a decision about his playing future until 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci had a lengthy discussion with his  
quarterback Thursday during which Young reiterated his desire to 
keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He isn't thinking about retirement, I can tell you that,''  
Mariucci said. ``All he's thinking about is getting better so he 
can play again. He's consumed by it. That's what he's about every 
waking moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young already has received a long-term recommendation from his  
neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, who is not related to the agent. 
</P>
<P>
	That recommendation hasn't been revealed, but indications are it  
was negative. Leigh Steinberg would say only that Young's 
neurologist has expressed serious concern about the potential for 
long-term health risks, especially since Young has continued to 
have post-concussion symptoms nearly a month after the head blow. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Young hopes to resume his career and doesn't want to  
walk away from football based on the opinion of one doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew to Provo, Utah, on Tuesday to consult with another  
neurologist and might seek a third opinion from another doctor in 
the next week or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unlikely he'll be cleared to play football any time  
soon,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``We're continuing to gather more 
opinions and information in what is a murky medical area. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do know is this: Steve still wants to play, but he's  
said if he's risking his future health he will not play. But we're 
still in a fact-finding mode. We're going through this process in a 
measured and prudent way and that could take weeks, or months. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm not even speaking to the issue of whether Steve plays  
again. That's totally a function of what the doctors say and how 
Steve and the 49ers assess any risks. But we'll make that decision 
when the time comes, and we're not there yet.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gov. Makes Landmark Cuba Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Illinois Gov. George Ryan arrived in Havana on  
Saturday on the first visit by a U.S. governor since Fidel Castro's 
1959 revolution -- a mission Cuba welcomed as a sign of eroding 
support for the U.S. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was leading a 45-member delegation of state, business,  
religious and university leaders on a five-day visit to the 
communist island. He planned to present more than $1 million worth 
of humanitarian supplies donated by private firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was in line with a Clinton administration policy,  
unveiled earlier this year, of encouraging direct contacts between 
the United States and the Cuban people. Ryan's ambitious agenda 
reflected a desire to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting the schedule were meetings with high-ranking Cuban  
officials and Cuban dissidents; visits to medical centers, schools, 
farms, churches, museums; and a speech at the University of Havana. 
It wasn't known if Ryan would meet with President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Foreign Ministry welcomed the visit as ``a reflection of  
the growing rejection by different sectors of United States society 
towards the current hostile policy and embargo against Cuba.'' The 
Communist Party newspaper, Granma, ran a brief biography of Ryan on 
its front page Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-Castro groups in the United States denounced the trip,  
saying Ryan was lending credibility to Castro and a government 
responsible for rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when commodities prices are at record lows, some U.S.  
lawmakers have taken another look at easing the embargo, first 
adopted in 1962, or eliminating it altogether. Ryan favors ending 
it, though he has said that U.S. policy toward Cuba is not the 
focus of his trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba imports nearly $1 billion in food and medicine each year,  
Cuban officials told visiting U.S. senators in August. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the U.S. Senate was scheduled to vote on legislation  
that would require Congress' approval for the president to use food 
and medicine as part of an embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National  
Assembly, criticized U.S. measures allowing restricted sales of 
U.S. food and medicine to Cuba. He said the embargo's impact made 
it impossible to buy those goods. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official rejected the criticisms, saying that  
``the justification for a failed economic system constantly seems 
to be changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan initially had described the trip as a trade mission but  
more recently called it a ``humanitarian'' mission because of the 
trade ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, U.S. agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and medical firms sent  
representatives, including food manufacturer Archer Daniels Midland 
Corp., the John Deere Foundation, affiliated with tractor maker 
Deere and Co., and Baxter International. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizardo Sanchez, a prominent Cuban dissident, welcomed Ryan's  
visit, saying it was in ``the greater interests of the U.S. and 
Cuban peoples'' by promoting ``better relations between both 
countries.'' Sanchez heads the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and 
National Reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Despite Ruling, KKK Marches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A dozen Ku Klux Klan members stood silently --  
faces exposed -- holding a confederate flag as more than 800 
demonstrators jeered and protested the Klan's rally today in lower 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's here to say no to the KKK,'' said lawyer Ron Kuby  
of the demonstrators. ``You have people here who sometimes can't 
stand to be in the same room with each other, but they're all here 
today. We have unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City succeeded in unmasking the Klan when a federal  
appeals court ruled Friday that the city could refuse to permit the 
event if participants insisted on wearing their masks. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had agreed to allow the rally only if  
participants went without their traditional hooded white masks. A 
three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided 
with the city, saying it is enforcing a law, not discriminating 
against the group's message. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the Klan filed an emergency appeal with Supreme  
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Civil Liberties Union sued the city on behalf of  
the Church of the American Knights -- a branch of the KKK -- accusing 
the city of violating the group's First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group,  
called Friday's ruling a ``momentary setback for the First 
Amendment,'' which he said should protect even anonymous, hateful 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declared the decision a ``victory for  
decency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an organization that at its core is violent and  
appeals to violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ruling came one day after two federal judges ruled in  
favor of allowing masks to protect KKK members who claimed to have 
been attacked and their homes burned. The masks were not being used 
solely to strike fear into others but also to protect those 
speaking out, the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges cited an 1845 law that bars people from congregating  
in masks or disguises except for authorized events, such as 
masquerades. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's rulings defined only the ground rules for the rally.  
The wider First Amendment issues in the lawsuit will be argued in 
court in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	KKK officials said the group chose New York for the rally to try  
to overturn the mask law. The group has won legal victories over 
mask statutes in towns in Indiana and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Van Lierde Wins Ironman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- Luc Van Lierde of Belgium assumed the  
lead just after the start of the marathon and steadily extended it 
in claiming the 23rd Ironman Triathlon World Championship by more 
than five minutes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing in 8 hours, 17 minutes, 17 seconds, the 30-year-old  
Van Lierde, who also won the continuous 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile 
bike race and 26.2-mile marathon in 1996 and finished second last 
year, was 19th after the swim. 
</P>
<P>
	But with temperatures in the mid-70s, one of the coolest days in  
race history, Van Lierde steadily advanced under often cloudy skies 
and was sixth after the bike segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori Bowden of Canada, who gained the lead 10 miles into the  
run, won the women's division in 9:13:02. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Smyers, of Lincoln, Mass., the 1995 women's winner, was  
second in 9:20:40. Fernanda Keller of Brazil, completing the event 
for the 12th time, placed third for the fifth time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Peter Reid of Canada finished second in  
8:22:54, while Tim DeBoom of Boulder, Colo., was the leading U.S. 
finisher, placing third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel about the same as last time,'' said Van Lierde, who set  
the course record of 8:04:08 in his first Ironman three years ago. 
``But the difference is that a few years ago, no one expected and I 
didn't expect. But this year I worked very hard for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, the wife of the second-place men's finisher, was also  
never challenged after assuming the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just so much difference between first and second,''  
said Bowden, who finished sixth in 1996. ``But with all the support 
we're getting out there from the crowds, it's just really great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six miles into the run, Van Lierde had built more than a  
one-minute lead, and his margin was never in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some bad luck in past years,'' said Van Lierde, who  
draped a Belgium flag over his shoulders as he crossed the finish 
line. ``But I'm glad I came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lothar Leder of Germany, who finished third last year and was  
about one minute behind as the cycling segment concluded, was 
disqualified for drafting other cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 1,470 professional and age-group amateur athletes, 17  
entrants shy of last year's record, began the race at Kailua Pier 
under clear skies and with little wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Lierde is also training to hopefully compete next summer  
when the shorter, Olympic-distance event makes its debut in Sydney, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas Niedrig of Germany, who was third in June at Ironman  
Germany, was the top swim finisher in 48:31. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBoom, who placed 10th last year, was sixth after the swim, but  
he quickly assumed the lead on the bike segment. 
</P>
<P>
	By the halfway point in Hawi, DeBoom, the winner of Ironman New  
Zealand in March, built a two-minute lead over a chase group of 12 
and then steadily expanded his lead until the top six riders were 
closely bunched near the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the pro field, a diverse field of amateurs ages  
20 to 76 were entered, including New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson; Dick 
Hoyt and his quadriplegic son Rick, well-known for their many 
Boston Marathon finishes; and actor Real Andrews, who appears on 
the soap opera General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning man and woman earned $35,000 from a $250,000 purse  
for their overall titles and various bonuses for top individual 
segment places.

<HEADLINE> Right Whale Death A Blow to Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The slow, agonizing death of a female right whale  
entangled in fishing nets in the Atlantic Ocean was a severe 
setback for a species already hovering near extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers say the whale's death has also created a rare  
opportunity to analyze the right whale's biology and diet in hopes 
of finding clues to the why its population is dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 300 right whales still swim the Atlantic, researchers  
say. The population was thinned out decades ago by whalers who 
killed them for their thick blubber and baleen. At the turn of the 
century, as few as 50 to 100 were believed alive. 
</P>
<P>
	While the right whale population rebounded after hunting was  
outlawed in the 1930s, its birth rate continues to decline, said 
Amy Knowlton, a right whale research scientist at the New England 
Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe that the whales may be plagued by a genetic  
disorder, that pollutants may somehow be harming their reproductive 
systems, or that they may be facing a food shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent known danger to them is humans -- the whales  
migrate from the coast of Nova Scotia to north Florida along some 
of the world's busiest shipping lanes and commercial fishing 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the New England Aquarium, about 62 percent have  
been scarred by fishing gear, and more than one-third of the right 
whales killed in the past 30 years were hit by ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The female right whale found dead Wednesday off the New Jersey  
coast had been tracked for nine years since whale watchers first 
sighted it off Cape Cod, Mass. They named the 43-foot creature 
whale 2030. It was old enough to reproduce but no calves had been 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months ago, 2030 appeared again off the coast of  
Massachusetts. She was entangled in fishermen's gillnet gear that 
had cut through several feet of blubber on the whale's back almost 
to her body cavity, exposing her shoulder blade and nearly slicing 
through her right flipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``She died a long, slow, painful death,'' said Knowlton, who had  
risked her life in September to try to detangle 2030 in the Bay of 
Fundy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, about a dozen researchers from Maryland and  
Massachusetts gathered around its corpse at Cape May, N.J., where 
the Coast Guard had towed it ashore. Samples of tissues and organs 
cut from the carcass would be shipped to their labs for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew this whale would die, but hearing that it died really  
was for me an overwhelming sadness,'' said Charles Mayo, a marine 
biologist at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown. Like 
Knowlton, he spent hours trying to disentangle 2030 from the 
fishing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress is being made in understanding the whales' physiology,  
habitat and genetic makeup, Mayo said, and the information 
researches can get from analyzing 2030 will only help. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clearly an extra amount of focus coming to right  
whales,'' said Mayo, who attended a conference of about a hundred 
right whale researchers Friday. ``We're all operating under the 
hope there is a possibility for the species to recover.''

<HEADLINE> Models' Eggs Receive $42,000 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A fashion photographer, hoping to cash  
in on would-be parents' wishes for a beautiful baby, is offering 
the eggs of eight models in an on-line auction set to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility groups have expressed disgust at the offer, saying  
it turns human life into a commodity. But photographer Ron Harris 
says his offer is a reflection of American society, where beauty 
can be purchased by the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, www.ronsangels.com, has pictures of eight models  
offering their eggs for sale. The bids start at $15,000 and can go 
as high as $150,000. Harris said the Web site had already received 
a serious bid of $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The models receive the full amount offered; bidders must pay  
Harris' organization an additional 20 percent service fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unethical and it's distasteful,'' Sean Tipton, spokesman  
for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility specialists are increasingly concerned about putting  
a price tag on human eggs. This spring, for example, a couple 
advertised that they would pay $50,000 for eggs donated from an 
athletic student from a top college. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law forbids the purchase and sale of human organs, but  
trafficking in sperm and eggs is legal, infertility experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is a Malibu, Calif., photographer whose work includes  
fashion photos, television directing for Playboy and exercise 
videos. He said he uses professional judgment to decide which 
potential donors are beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I did all my life,'' he said. ``That's my  
expertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site boasts that the models are ``beautiful and  
healthy'' and subject to rigorous health examinations. In a letter 
on the site, Harris describes the egg auction as ``Darwin's Natural 
Selection at its very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says society's obsession with appearance has made us stronger  
and healthier, and he pitches the egg auction as a chance for 
parents to give their children an advantage in society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every organism is evolving to its most perfect state,'' Harris  
writes. ``Finding traits that 'repair' your genetic flaws is what 
we are all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The models could not be reached for comment Saturday, but on the  
Web site, each gives reasons for selling her eggs, ranging from 
``to not be dependent on a man,'' to ``I want to help others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Etcoff, the Cambridge-based author of ``Survival of the  
Prettiest: The Science of Beauty,'' says it's natural to consider 
how your mate's attractiveness will be reflected in your children. 
But she said such direct marketing of beauty is a false promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way that we inherit features is sort of a genetic roll of  
the dice,'' Etcoff said. ``This really is buying beauty for our 
offspring. Clearly, these offspring might not be beautiful at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who has three children from four marriages, said its  
natural for parents to want attractive children. He said that each 
time his wife was pregnant he hoped for a cute baby. On the third 
try, he said, he got one. 
</P>
<P>
	``My third child is beautiful,'' he said, adding that he didn't  
favor that child over the others. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the egg auction, Harris said an auction of male  
models' sperm is being planned, with bids from $10,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg donation has been largely an act of altruism until now,  
Tipton said. Donors typically are paid $2,500 to $5,000 for their 
time and inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's leading Internet auction site, eBay, has banned the  
sale of eggs, sperm and human organs on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as a society seem to have come to the conclusion that it's  
not appropriate to traffic in body parts,'' Tipton said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boxer Arrested for Headbutt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three-time Olympic boxing champion Teofilo  
Stevenson of Cuba was arrested Saturday for headbutting a United 
Airlines worker who tried to stop him from passing a checkpoint to 
board a flight to his home country, Miami-Dade Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Police Sgt. Steven Leibowitz said the 48-year-old  
Stevenson was charged with aggravated battery and resisting arrest 
with violence. Stevenson posted $12,500 bond and caught a later 
flight to Cuba, Leibowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured airline worker, 41-year-old Pedro DeLeon tried to  
stop Stevenson as the boxer tried to force his way past a 
checkpoint, police said. Stevenson headbutted DeLeon, chipping 
DeLeon's front tooth, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport police arrived to find United Airlines workers trying to  
restrain Stevenson. When officers stepped in, Stevenson began 
fighting them. Police were able to arrest the combative boxer 
without being injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Villoche, general manager for United Airlines in  
Miami, said DeLeon was looked at by paramedics and sent home. He 
had cut lips and a chipped tooth, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, Jamaican-born Stevenson grew up in Cuba and still  
lives there. He was a super heavyweight champion in the Olympics, 
winning the gold medal in 1972, '76 and '80. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, Stevenson became the first Olympic boxer to win three  
gold medals in the same division. He won his first gold in Munich 
in 1972 by default after Ion Alexe of Romania broke his thumb in 
the semifinal bout. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, at the age of 34, Stevenson, who always remained an  
amateur, won the world championship.

	The Vols (5-1, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) have now won five  
straight over the Crimson Tide (5-2, 4-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The game was a defensive struggle until Martin led Tennessee on  
a game-breaking, fourth-quarter drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to run as much time off the clock as possible while  
protecting a 14-7 lead, Martin marched the Vols 84 yards in 11 
plays. He broke open the game open with a 21-yard touchdown run 
that put Tennessee up 21-7 with 8:26 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee continued a season-long streak of not allowing a back  
to rush for 100 yards or score a touchdown. Alabama tailback Shaun 
Alexander had 98 yards rushing and scored his only touchdown of the 
day on a 26-yard pass from Andrew Zow. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander had 148 all-purpose yards and had his streak of six  
straight 100-yard rushing games snapped. He left the field limping 
at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama was limited in what it could do offensively, especially  
after Zow was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Zow sprained his ankle late in the second quarter and didn't  
start the second half. He finally returned for the Tide's third 
offensive series. 
</P>
<P>
	With Alabama's passing game not working, Tennessee was able to  
key on Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who ran for 49 yards and passed for 147, put Tennessee  
up 14-7 on the Vols' first possession of the second half. He needed 
just three plays to find David Martin for a 43-yard touchdown only 
3:47 into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A Tennessee penalty aided Alabama's scoring drive. The Vols were  
offside on an Alabama punt and the five yards were enough for a 
first down. The Tide capitalized when Alexander slipped through the 
line and caught Zow's pass for a 26-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin tied it with 5:14 to play in the half on a 6-yard keeper.

	Albright Denounces Chechnya Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The Russian military's attacks in Chechnya  
are ``deplorable and ominous,'' and the events of the past 36 to 48 
hours in the breakaway republic are of ``grave concern,'' Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said Saturday. Russian forces were 
consolidating their positions around Grozny, the Chechen capital, 
after an air, artillery and ground onslaught that left the Chechen 
forces with heavy losses. A missile attack Thursday night on a 
Grozny marketplace killed at least 143 people. Russia sent troops 
into Chechnya ostensibly to eliminate the militants who invaded the 
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan this summer.

	Klan Claims It Was 'Silenced' at Rally

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeffrey Berry, the national Imperial Wizard of  
the Ku Klux Klan, complained that the Klan was ``silenced'' at 
today's rally in Manhattan. ``We can't get our message out,'' said 
Berry. While the Klan had predicted that up to 80 of its members 
would turn out, only 16 appeared. A crowd of anti-Klan protesters, 
estimated at about 8,000, jeered and shouted angrily at the group, 
who stood silently inside a pen fashioned from police barricades.

	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army  
indicated Saturday it was willing to talk to the United States 
about suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. The U.S. government 
wants him deported to the United States to stand trial for the 
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year. The 
Taliban had refused to hand over bin Laden, saying Washington has 
not proven bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. In a 
statement Saturday, however, the Taliban's Information Minister 
said ``we are ready to solve all the issues with America, including 
that of Osama bin Laden.'' He did not elaborate or promise to hand 
over bin Laden.

	Poll Shows McCain Gaining on Bush  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Boosted by a new poll suggesting he was  
catching up to fellow Republican George W. Bush in New Hampshire, 
John McCain campaigned through the state today promoting the 
central doctrine of his run for the White House: campaign finance 
reform. During a political event at Dartmouth College, McCain also 
spoke about abortion. He said he was ``a pro-life person because my 
belief is that life begins at conception.'' But the debate needs to 
go beyond that, he said. ``It is long past time that pro-life and 
pro-choice people sat down and agreed on goals we can agree on.''

	Argentina Leader Dismisses Polls  
</P>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- As Argentina prepared to elect a  
new president, incumbent Carlos Menem today dismissed opinion polls 
placing the opposition candidate ahead of his Peronist Party ally. 
Menem, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third 
consecutive term in tomorrow's election, also announced he would 
run again in 2003. Most polls gave at least a 14 point advantage to 
Alliance candidate Fernando De la Rua over Peronist candidate 
Eduardo Duhalde. But the president discounted the ability of polls 
to predict the outcomes of elections.

	HAVANA (AP) -- Illinois Gov. George Ryan today paid the first  
visit to communist Cuba by a U.S. governor since Fidel Castro's 
1959 revolution, declaring he had ``come here to build bridges 
between people.'' Cuba welcomed the visit as a sign of eroding 
support in the United States for the U.S. embargo. Anti-Castro 
groups in the United States denounced the trip, saying Ryan was 
lending credibility to Castro and a government responsible for 
rights abuses.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Major Applewhite threw for two second-half  
touchdowns as No. 18 Texas rallied for a 24-20 victory today over 
No. 3 Nebraska, seriously damaging the Cornhuskers' bid for the 
national championship. Texas has won three straight over Nebraska 
since the merger of the Big Eight and Southwest conferences before 
the 1996 season. Nebraska led 20-17 after quarterback Eric Crouch's 
9-yard TD run with 7:52 left to play before Applewhite drove Texas 
60 yards on four plays for the winning score.

<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas hex continues over Nebraska.  
</P>
<P>
	Major Applewhite threw for two second-half touchdowns as No. 18  
Texas rallied for a 24-20 victory Saturday over No. 3 Nebraska, 
seriously damaging the Cornhuskers' bid for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has won three straight over Nebraska since the merger of  
the Big Eight and Southwest conferences before the 1996 season. 
Texas (6-2, 3-1 Big 12) is the only team to beat Nebraska (6-1, 
3-1) three times in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska led 20-17 after quarterback Eric Crouch's 9-yard TD run  
with 7:52 left to play before Applewhite drove Texas 60 yards on 
four plays for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting wideout Ryan Nunez with a 39-yard pass to the  
Nebraska 21, Applewhite found tight end Mike Jones in the flat. 
Jones broke three tackles, including one at the goal line, in 
completing a 17-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite was 9-of-21 for 47 yards in the first half as  
Nebraska built a 13-3 lead. He was 8-of-9 in the second half for 
166 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His 13-yard strike to Kwame Cavil in the third quarter gave  
Texas its first lead at 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Hodges Mitchell had 20 carries for 83 yards and three  
receptions for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Alexander led the Cornhuskers with 136 yards on 21 carries.  
Crouch passed for 204 yards but was held to 35 yards rushing on 17 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, which outgained Texas 429-275, dropped a game behind  
undefeated Kansas State in the race for the North Division title 
and a berth in the Big 12 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska players had talked all week about beating Texas and  
avenging last year's 20-16 loss that ended the Huskers' 47-game 
home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska appeared to take control early, scoring on three  
consecutive possessions for a 13-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Brown kicked field goals of 22 and 32 yards and running  
back Correll Buckhalter broke a tackle and a carried a Texas 
defender into the end zone on a 5-yard TD run with 45 seconds left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	With Texas forced to punt into a stiff wind, two of the  
Cornhuskers' scoring drives started at the Longhorns' 17 and 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, which drove 46 yards on its first possession to set up a  
field goal attempt that bounced off the left upright, managed just 
five first downs in the first half. After the first drive, Nebraska 
held Texas to three-and-out on the next five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas defense kept it close by forcing three Nebraska  
turnovers on fumbles, two by Crouch and one by Buckhalter at the 
Texas 1 that cost the Huskers a fourth-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas started the second half with the wind at its back. After a  
short Nebraska punt Texas started its first drive at the 
Cornhuskers 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Robertson pulled Texas within 13-10 four plays later on a  
1-yard run, his sixth touchdown this season on just 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jones' touchdown, Nebraska drove to the Texas 38 on its  
final possession but turned the ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas was able to run out the final 2:15 because the Huskers had  
already used all their timeouts.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Says She's 'In This Race' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stopping just short of an official  
announcement, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Saturday dropped her 
strongest hint yet that she will run for Senate from New York next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored to be in this race, looking to succeed someone  
whom I admire, Senator Moynihan, and to continue much of the work 
that he has done,'' she said at a birthday fund-raiser attended by 
about 300 people, including the president and several celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to this campaign,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has created an exploratory committee that allows  
her to raise and spend money as she considers a bid to succeed 
retiring Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. While indicating 
recently that she is leaning so far toward running that ``if I 
leaned over any further I would fall over,'' the first lady does 
not expect to announce her plans until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Her campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, cautioned against  
interpreting her remarks at the fund-raiser as an announcement 
speech. But, he added, ``I don't think there's any doubt in 
anyone's mind that she's very serious about this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton on Saturday also referred indirectly to her likely  
Republican Senate rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. ``We 
will have a very clear choice in the race for the Senate from New 
York and I welcome that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has not officially entered the race, but is raising  
money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised his wife and said it was time New York  
``which has been on the cutting edge of so many other 
developments'' elected a female senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want you to know about Hillary is from the first minute  
I met her she was thinking about the things that are important to 
the country,'' Clinton said. The two embraced warmly after he 
introduced her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said a GOP plan for across-the-board cuts in  
federal spending to help balance the budget was a ``most gross 
neglect of our nation's priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said it would cut, among other things, funding for the  
Middle East peace process -- an issue of great importance to New 
York's large Jewish population. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters contributed between $500 and $2,000 apiece for the  
chance to munch on muffins and drink coffee and mimosas at a hotel 
blocks from the White House. They blew noisemakers and sang ``Happy 
Birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on hand Saturday were actress Marisa Tomei, the top  
Senate Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and blues musician 
B.B. King. Musicians Gloria Estefan and John Fogarty and the pop 
group `N Sync stopped by on their way to a charity concert at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton turns 52 on Tuesday, a day after a celebrity  
fund-raiser in New York City that is expected to raise at least $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has tried to step out from her husband's shadow  
during her early campaigning, and there seemed to be a symbolic 
indication of that Saturday: few images of the president were among 
the photos of Mrs. Clinton's life seen by guests as they arrived; 
one of the couple featured a smiling Mrs. Clinton in the foreground 
while her husband appeared slightly out of focus behind her.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Make Offer to Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Just when it seemed Latrell Sprewell might  
be headed out the door, the New York Knicks slammed it shut. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of reportedly shopping Sprewell around the league,  
the Knicks made an offer to their controversial star before 
Saturday's exhibition game against the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The details have yet to be finalized, but Sprewell said he was  
happy the team had reached out to keep him and that it was ``more 
than likely'' he will sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was genuine, sincere, something I can live with,'' Sprewell  
said after scoring 14 points in the Knicks' 91-80 victory. ``Right 
now it's just a matter of longer or shorter. I'd like to get it 
over with in the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, had asked for the maximum  
allowable under the collective bargaining agreement -- six years and 
$78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll have all the numbers done by Monday,'' Gist  
said. ``He's anxious about the extension and hopefully will retire 
with that No. 8 jersey. They want him here as long as he wants to 
be here. The net numbers weren't as important as the longterm 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were doing all they could to repair the damage to  
that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very cordial meeting, about an hour and a half,''  
said Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts, who met with 
general manager Scott Layden and Gist in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a substantial offer, and I hope we made it clear to  
(Sprewell) we want him to remain a member of the Knicks for a long 
time,'' Checketts said at halftime. ``He's got good options. It's 
all good news. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the option to sign or to wait and see what's up next  
summer. I don't have a feel for what he'll do. It's up to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial and popular member of the Knicks actually  
could have been a goner three weeks ago in a trade for Scottie 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``His name was discussed, he was available,'' said a  
high-ranking official with the Houston Rockets, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. ``He was never formally offered, but that's 
only because we decided quickly to do the trade with Portland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts denied the Knicks had been looking to deal Sprewell.  
</P>
<P>
	``Reports are that we shopped him around,'' Checketts said.  
``That's absolutely not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade rumors involving Sprewell have been floating around all  
preseason. Lakers coach Phil Jackson talked about a possible Glen 
Rice-Sprewell trade, and it's no secret that the Knicks twice 
approached the Seattle SuperSonics to ask about Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing general managers have also heard that the Milwaukee  
Bucks and Miami Heat are coveting Sprewell. But it seems unlikely 
Checketts would approve a trade of such a fan favorite to the 
former coach he despises, Pat Riley, or the former team president 
he dumped in April, Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Sprewell received the longest suspension and what  
amounted to the largest fine in league history for attacking and 
threatening the life of Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	He drives recklessly, stayed incommunicado all summer and has a  
reputation of being a troublemaker. In the Knicks' locker room, 
he's pretty much a loner. 
</P>
<P>
	Many owners and general managers around the league remain  
philosophically opposed to acquiring such a volatile player. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know me, they haven't coached me, they don't know  
that I come to practice every day and what I do,'' Sprewell said. 
``They just know what they're read and hear from a few other 
people. As far as I'm concerned, it's their loss and not mine.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Rocker Making Big Impression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker isn't sure exactly where it comes  
from, this inner fire that compels him to sprint from the bullpen 
like a charging bull or say things that leave his teammates shaking 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mouth of the South just knows it's been there as long as he  
can remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in Little League -- I must have been about 10 years  
old -- I struck out for the last out of the game,'' Rocker said 
Friday, reminiscing at Turner Field after the Atlanta Braves worked 
out for tonight's Game 1 of the World Series against the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw my bat into center field. I just hate to lose.''  
</P>
<P>
	At age 25, nearing the end of his first season as the Braves'  
closer, Rocker has left an indelible impression on the postseason 
with a pattern of conduct totally out of character for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Braves have been criticized for being too businesslike  
about their eight straight playoff appearances, Rocker picked a 
fight with New York Mets fans prior to the NL Championship Series 
by calling them ``stupid.'' He refused to back down when the teams 
went to Shea Stadium, sarcastically tipping his cap and matching 
the rowdy crowd insult for insult. 
</P>
<P>
	After totaling his sports car in a wreck the day before Game 6 --  
escaping without a scratch -- he pitched two scoreless innings in 
the 10-9 victory that sent the Braves to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker says now that his seemingly rash actions were a  
well-conceived plan to motivate himself and rattle the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does something written in the New York papers affect where my  
ball goes?'' he asked, not waiting for the answer. ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker was a starter through most of his career in the minors,  
putting up nondescript numbers. In fact, he was left unprotected 
for the first round of the expansion draft and didn't get picked by 
either Arizona or Tampa Bay -- quite a feat for a left-hander who 
throws in the upper-90s. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was converted to the bullpen during the 1997 season,  
split between Class A Durham and AA Greenville, and found ``the 
adrenaline rush I've been looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That winter, he was sent to Puerto Rico to refine his skills and  
wound up developing his trademark dash to the mound when he was 
called to pitch against Ivan Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the first big-name hitter I had ever faced,'' Rocker  
recalled. ``I wanted to go out there with a no-holds-barred 
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After striking out Rodriguez -- or so he says; the Texas catcher  
was unavailable to rebut the story -- Rocker kept on running. 
Nowadays, the Atlanta fans erupt every time he appears at the 
bullpen door, accompanied by the 1980s hair-band classic ``I Wanna 
Rock!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 210-pounder, who pumps weights at every  
opportunity and readily admits he would rather be playing for the 
NFL's Falcons, became the Braves closer after Kerry Ligtenberg's 
elbow gave out in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker wound up with 38 saves -- one away from the team record --  
and left the Braves to ponder what force they had unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here a very long time and, yeah, there's things I've  
wanted to say, but I knew I didn't have the right to say them,'' 
John Smoltz said, squirming a bit against his locker. ``He seems to 
be thriving on that. The guys are just leaving him alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker is clearly in his element in the World Series, where  
every comment is scrutinized, every action is analyzed. Cheer him, 
boo him, it doesn't matter. Just make sure you notice him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pitch with intensity, emotion and aggressiveness,'' said  
Rocker, usually seen around the clubhouse in a T-short bearing the 
name of pro wrestler Bill Goldberg. ``At times this year, I didn't 
have enough emotion or adrenaline. Those were the games where I 
didn't pitch as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker's competitiveness is unquestioned. Some of his actions  
could also be interpreted as selfish, however. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot off at his teammates last month when Eddie Perez's  
throwing error after a strikeout cost the Braves a victory -- and 
Rocker a save. In the division series against Houston, Rocker 
escaped a bases-loaded, no-outs situation in the 10th inning of 
Game 3 -- then said afterward that he felt no pressure when he came 
in because the runners wouldn't go on his pitching line. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rocker has been a dominating presence in the postseason,  
carrying the Braves to the World Series for the first time since 
1996. He has one win and three saves, allowing only three hits and 
no earned runs in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Braves point of view, he can keep on talking.  
</P>
<P>
	``Have you seen how big he is?'' Chipper Jones quipped. ``Who's  
going to say anything to him? Not me. He'd pound me in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would probably be a problem if he said things and then  
didn't perform on the field. But he's backing it up. If it's not 
broke, don't fix it.''

	Winifred Anthony Stearns of Hanover told McCain she supported a  
woman's right to choose. ``It's my hardest reconciliation with the 
Republican Party,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is abortion,'' McCain said, repeating the subject of  
her question to audience members who couldn't hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is choice,'' she corrected.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was ``a pro-life person because my belief is that  
life begins at conception.'' But the debate needs to go beyond 
that, he said. ``It is long past time that pro-life and pro-choice 
people sat down and agreed on goals we can agree on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional adversaries can agree on the need for adoption  
and foster care and get beyond the debate over abortion, which he 
said interest groups want to keep alive because it helps them raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns, who described herself as a Republican, was not entirely  
satisfied with the answer but said, ``I think it was as good a 
response as I could have expected from a Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she left the event committed to McCain. ``I was alive in  
World War II,'' she said. ``I admire his high principles and his 
high ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Registered Republicans in New Hampshire still favor Bush, the  
governor of Texas, 39 percent to 27 percent over McCain, a U.S. 
senator from Arizona, according to a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's an improvement for McCain over a similar poll in  
August that had Bush in the lead 45 percent to 10 percent. The 
other Republican presidential candidates are in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, what we are doing is working, which is a few brief  
remarks and then questions,'' McCain said Saturday in Hanover. 
``It's paying off, and straight talk works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted for the Concord Monitor by polling firm  
Research 2000 Wednesday and Thursday, after Elizabeth Dole dropped 
out of the race. The pollsters questioned 602 registered voters by 
telephone, and the poll had a margin of error of four percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Steve Forbes was favored by 9 percent, and Patrick  
Buchanan by 5 percent. Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch each 
was favored by 1 percent. Seventeen percent of the Republicans 
questioned said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, 40 percent of Democrats said they  
favored former Sen. Bill Bradley, against 37 percent who said they 
favored Vice President Al Gore, a statistical tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, 23 percent said they still hadn't decided on a  
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In potential general election match-ups, Bush beat Gore 50  
percent to 40 percent, but against Bradley, the outcome is a 
virtual tie, Bush 45 percent, Bradley 44 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Broad Spending Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are proposing a 1.4 percent  
across-the-board cut in federal spending that would affect all 
government operations except Social Security, Medicare and other 
benefits -- and lawmakers' own salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid their budget fight with President Clinton, top House GOP  
lawmakers laid out the proposal Friday as part of their effort to 
keep overdue spending bills from dipping into Social Security 
surpluses. They said the plan would save $4.5 billion by ordering 
agency directors to ferret out waste, fraud and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no drastic cut,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would veto an across-the-board reduction.  
The administration said the cuts could force layoffs of 39,000 
military personnel and the denial of food, education and other aid 
to thousands of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget  
Committee, used the GOP's weekly radio address today to credit the 
party with enforcing fiscal discipline on the government and 
slowing the growth of spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Granted, we also have a small surplus,'' Domenici said. ``But  
that doesn't mean we should go on a spending spree. Now is not the 
time to open the federal faucet and start throwing hard-earned tax 
dollars at a glut of Washington spending programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at budget talks between the two sides at the Capitol,  
the White House proposed a new savings plan of their own: a tax on 
tobacco companies triggered if teen-age smoking rises. The offer 
was described by participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Not affected by the across-the-board reductions would be the  
salaries of members of Congress. Since 1981, the money for their 
pay has come from a part of the federal budget not controlled by 
the spending bills. The rest of Congress' budget, such as office 
expenses, would be subject to the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers voted themselves a 3.4 percent pay raise this year.  
That $4,600 increase will boost their salaries to $141,300 
beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the government's payroll would be affected, though  
individual federal workers' salaries could not be cut because they 
are set by law. Agency heads might achieve payroll savings by 
layoffs or temporary furloughs or by not filling positions of 
workers who quit or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Also not affected would be payments to veterans and recipients  
of Medicaid, Social Security, Medicare and other benefits paid by 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said the cuts would still not achieve the  
GOP's goal of leaving Social Security surpluses alone. Citing 
Congressional Budget Office analyses, they say Republican spending 
plans dip into Social Security surpluses by at least $13 billion 
more than the GOP admits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad idea that is unacceptable,'' said White House  
budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Social Security surpluses for other spending has been done  
by both parties for decades, and has no effect on the government's 
ability to pay Social Security benefits. Protecting those surpluses 
also does nothing to revamp the program, which many experts say is 
needed to prepare it for baby boomers' approaching retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, both parties have latched onto the issue as they  
position themselves as guardians of the giant pension program for 
next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, across-the-board reductions have not fared well  
in Congress, where they inevitably end up cutting programs that 
lawmakers like. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP legislators have coalesced around their leaders' calls  
to protect Social Security's surpluses. They believe the strategy 
has made it harder for Clinton to find ways to pay for his spending 
demands, and helped burnish the GOP's image among the program's 
mostly elderly recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The across-the-board reduction will be attached to a mammoth  
spending measure covering the departments of Education, Labor and 
Health and Human Services that Congress plans to send the president 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the last of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal  
2000, which began Oct. 1, to be sent to Clinton. He has threatened 
to veto it -- one of six he has vetoed or might veto -- because it 
ignores his demands for $1.4 billion for hiring schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Friday signed a $69 billion bill that will fund  
operations of the Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug 
Administration. It includes a record $8.7 billion in emergency aid 
to farmers, but the president complained that it provides too 
little assistance for those who lost crops to drought or flooding, 
while providing money to other growers who don't need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House budget chief Jack Lew told congressional  
budget writers about the administration's new plan for taxing 
tobacco companies. The levy, which he referred to as a penalty, 
would encourage cigarette makers to stop marketing their product to 
teen-agers, he said, according to participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew provided no details about the tax.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has conceded his plan to raise cigarette taxes by 55  
cents a pack cannot pass Congress.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Flag Law Reveals Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Oregon students file into their  
classrooms next week, they will be asked to perform a ritual many 
never have done: recite the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, most schools will have enough American flags  
to go around by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers voted to put the pledge back in schools with a law  
that takes effect today. Under the law, school districts must 
display flags and give students the opportunity to recite the 
pledge at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was, after so many years of pledge-free classrooms,  
flags were tattered or missing altogether. The pledge used to be a 
part of the morning ritual, but the practice dropped off, 
particularly in middle and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	A few districts have bought their own, but others appealed to  
the Oregon Republican Party for a total of 3,000 flags. The party 
has supplied 1,000 flags and is helping raise money to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought schools would have flags -- little did we know,''  
party executive director Darryl Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't specify how many flags must be in the school or  
in which rooms. Administrators as most schools wanted to put flags 
in each classroom and an assembly area. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is not without its flaws. One problem is its lack of a  
specified time or location to say the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another problem occurred in a health class at Harriet Tubman  
Middle School, when several students wouldn't say the pledge 
because they said they don't believe in God, and disagree with its 
vow of allegiance to ``one nation under God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the class decided it would be up to the students to  
suggest reciting the pledge each day. Those who didn't want to do 
so would stand respectfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like it's a big chore or anything -- it's respectful  
to our country,'' said Sam Stuckey, 12. ``If you live in this 
country then you should do it.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-S. Baptist Leader Chides Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Southern Baptist Convention's targeting of  
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims for conversion on their holiest days is 
deliberately aggressive and runs counter to the spirit of the 
Gospel, a former convention official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to cultivate personal relationships rather than launch  
a new crusade that's confrontative and abrasive,'' said Keith 
Parks, who spent 13 years as president of the convention's 
International Mission Board. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the International Mission Board released a booklet  
urging members to pray for Hindus on their major festival, Divali. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the board enraged Jewish leaders by releasing a  
booklet aimed at Jews during the High Holy Days. Earlier, it 
targeted Muslims on Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks compared the efforts to Muslims trying to convert  
Christians to Islam at Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that we do not caricature other religions,'' he  
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention representatives say they don't want to offend, but to  
answer a divine calling -- even in the face of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks makes no apologies for spreading his faith as a missionary  
in Indonesia, but he objects to condemning other religions and 
singling out any group for conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's not sure Hindus, Jews, and Muslims would like his  
claim that he has access to the true God through Jesus Christ, but 
he said it's essential that a Christian's descriptions of other 
faiths be acceptable to members of those faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks said that many Baptists may also disagree with the  
confrontational outreach strategy, but few have said so publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks left the Southern Baptist Convention to join the more  
moderate Cooperative Baptist Fellowship after, he said, he was ``no 
longer acceptable'' to convention leaders who came into power in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pushing a fundamentalist agenda,'' he said. ``Recent  
convention actions are an expression of that agenda. They emphasize 
more a confrontative kind of evangelism with less emphasis on 
living out the gospel.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Goalie Signs $8.4M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Panthers goaltender Trevor Kidd  
took a short-term pay cut, signing a long-term contract Saturday 
that will keep him with the team through the 2002-03 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd signed a four-year, $8.4 million deal, which includes a  
base salary of $1.5 million this season and $2.3 million each of 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd agreed to the new deal before training camp in August.  
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Kidd would have made $2 million in base salary  
this season, but the contract was only a two-year deal, which he 
signed with Carolina last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They approached me, and I took a little cut from what I was  
supposed to make this year in order to do it,'' Kidd said. ``But it 
was a good thing for me and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd, who is 4-1-1 with a 1.96 goals-against average this  
season, was traded to the Panthers from Atlanta on the day of the 
expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> Strange To Captain Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- As a player or television golf  
analyst, Curtis Strange will be involved in the final three events 
on the PGA Tour -- a good time to starting scouting players for the 
Ryder Cup team he will take to The Belfry in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange, a two-time U.S. Open champion and member of five Ryder  
Cup teams, was selected as the next captain of a U.S. team that 
will try to retain the cup under what figures to be contentious 
conditions, a source familiar with the appointment said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA of America spokesman Julius Mason would not comment on the  
next captain, but said an announcement would be made at 10 a.m. EDT 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange declined comment at the National Car Rental Classic at  
Disney World, where he shot a 3-under 69 Friday morning to make the 
cut, then covered the afternoon rounds in his role as an analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is what I've said before, and that is it would  
be a tremendous honor,'' he said. ``I haven't heard anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a source, speaking on condition that he not be identified,  
told the AP that Strange's selection would be announced Monday 
morning at the PGA's headquarters in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Strange has been considered the leading  
candidate to succeed Ben Crenshaw since the day after the Americans 
staged the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history last month to 
defeat Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotional, tenacity,'' Tiger Woods said Friday night when  
asked what Strange would bring as a Ryder Cup captain. ``It'll be 
neat to have him over there in that environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange has won 17 times on the PGA Tour and became the first  
player since Ben Hogan to win the U.S. Open in consecutive years at 
Oak Hill in 1989. He won the Open the previous year at The Country 
Club, and was among the candidates to be captain for this year's 
Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA instead picked Crenshaw, whose team overcame a 10-6  
deficit on the final day with a dramatic singles charge that 
included such raw emotion and celebration that Europe complained 
bitterly about the Americans' lack of sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	What began with just about every American pumping his fist  
culminated with a wild charge across the 17th green when Justin 
Leonard holed a 45-foot putt that ultimately clinched the cup, 
although Jose Maria Olazabal still had a 25-foot birdie putt to 
keep the match alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery was especially notorious, hurling vicious insults at  
Colin Montgomerie and reportedly spitting on the wife of European 
captain Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange will be faced with leading a U.S. team to victory in  
Europe for the first time since 1993 at The Belfry -- and with 
handling a potentially volatile atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next two captains, whoever they are, with the PGA on both  
sides of the Atlantic, need to go out of their way to diffuse this 
situation,'' Strange said three weeks ago during the Buick 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit, the way they were treated by our galleries at  
Boston was uncalled for,'' he said. ``Nobody deserves that. There's 
an etiquette not only with the players, but with galleries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of his five Ryder Cup appearances was on a winner -- in  
1983 at the PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens -- and his 
overall record in the matches was 6-12-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Crenshaw was known as ``Gentle Ben,'' Strange was one of  
the most fiery players in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he's perceived over there, but I know he's  
tough enough to handle whatever happens,'' Davis Love III said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange won every year but two in the 1980s, culminating with  
his consecutive Open titles to close out the decade. He hasn't won 
since, and began working for ABC Sports in 1997. He continues to 
play at least 15 events on the PGA Tour each year along with his 
television work and remains close to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would be a great captain,'' Love said earlier this  
month. ``He was great at Oak Hill (as a captain's pick). He was 
like a leader. He knew things to do to pump you up, and what to do 
to keep you loose.''

<HEADLINE> Baby Jessica Couple Have Divorced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The couple who lost the battle for  
custody of Baby Jessica have divorced, citing the strain of the 
2 1/2-year case that provoked a national debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan and Roberta DeBoer ended their 17-year marriage Friday in  
Washtenaw County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple said in a statement that the strain of the custody  
battle with Jessica's birth parents, Dan and Cara Schmidt of Iowa, 
was more than their marriage could withstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of our daughter, who we know as Jessica, was more  
than our marriage could handle,'' they said. ``We still love one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Schmidts said earler this month that they, too, are  
divorcing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schmidt, then Cara Clausen, gave birth in 1991 to a girl  
she named Anna. Two days later, she signed papers giving up the 
child for adoption. Her parental rights were terminated and the 
DeBoers were granted legal custody as the baby's adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, Ms. Clausen filed papers to revoke her  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A national debate raged over the rights of biological and  
adoptive parents, and the case led to changes in the laws of Iowa 
and other states on the amount of time a birth parent has to make a 
claim on a child in an adoption proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schmidts finally won custody in August 1993 when the Supreme  
Courts in Iowa and Michigan sided with them. 
</P>
<P>
	A throng of photographers and TV cameras captured the screams  
and tears of the 2 1/2-year-old girl as she was taken from the DeBoers 
to the Schmidts. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby Jessica, once again Anna Schmidt, is an 8-year-old  
third-grader, and she has had no contact with the DeBoers since 
moving to Iowa. The Schmidts have another child, 6-year-old Chloe. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after they had to give up Jessica, the DeBoers adopted a  
10-day-old boy they named Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeBoers asked for privacy to protect Casey, now 5.  
</P>
<P>
	``We share our concern about Jessi and, first and foremost, want  
to protect our 5-year-old son, Casey,'' they said in the statement. 
``We want his identity to be based on his own achievements and 
aspirations.''

<HEADLINE> Two Russia Planes Said Shot Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechen fighters claimed they shot down  
two Russian warplanes in separate incidents Saturday, and 
government forces bombed and fired rockets on rebel positions in 
the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes come amid growing foreign criticism of the Russian  
offensive. Russian officials defended the Chechnya operation, 
saying it was a war against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen Health Ministry said that 163 people had been killed  
and 380 injured by Russian air and artillery bombardment on Friday 
and Saturday, the Interfax news agency reported. The toll could not 
be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Chechen fighters dug trenches in Grozny, the  
capital. Commanders have said they expected an assault by Russian 
troops that were massed less than eight miles from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media reported that some 10,000 more soldiers were being  
sent to Chechnya to bring the total troop strength to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some official Chechen agencies including the traffic police have  
been evacuated from their Grozny headquarters. Civilians continued 
to leave Grozny on Saturday, fearing an attack by Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen command said its troops shot down one fighter-bomber  
north of Grozny, and a second jet was downed southwest of the 
Chechen capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's air force said its planes had bombed rebel bases  
Saturday, but denied it had lost any planes. Chechen fighters have 
shot down three Russian warplanes in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the first plane was seen bailing out and appeared  
to have landed behind Russian lines, while the fate of the crew of 
the second jet was unknown, the Chechen command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia sent troops into Chechnya at the end of September,  
following weeks of airstrikes, with the declared aim of eliminating 
militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer and were 
blamed for a series of apartment explosions in Russia that killed 
some 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But increasingly, the Russian offensive appears aimed at  
restoring control over Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, on a visit to Kenya,  
said the Russian attacks were ``deplorable and ominous.'' She said 
the events of the past two days -- including the Thursday night 
bombing of a Grozny market that killed at least 143 people -- were 
of ``grave concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder condemned the  
``massacre on the Grozny marketplace'' and German politicians urged 
sanctions against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, in an interview with the  
Bild am Sonntag newspaper, called for freezing Western loans to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials reacted angrily to the foreign criticism.  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told European and Mideast policy 
makers in Mallorca that the only way to protect Russian security 
was through ``war against the terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of parliament,  
said neither the United States nor any other NATO country has ``the 
moral right to tell Russia how to settle the acute conflict in the 
North Caucasus,'' since they had bombed Yugoslav forces during the 
Kosovo crisis this spring, Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, bombs were heard exploding north of Grozny, and a  
spokesman at Chechnya's operational press service said that Russian 
artillery had targeted the city of Argun, 10 miles east of Grozny, 
in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces had taken control  
of the entire border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, to the 
northwest, to prevent incursions of Chechen guerrillas to carry out 
terrorist acts in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Travel Agents Boycott United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Through postings on Internet travel sites, faxes  
and customer bookings, travel agents across the country are venting 
their wrath on United Airlines for slashing the fee it pays them 
for selling tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``United Airlines has been expelled from this travel agency,''  
declares a sign posted on the marquee outside John Shands' agency 
in Brownsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure my $50,000 in business isn't going to make a whit of  
difference to United Airlines. But I'm just not going to support 
them any more on this,'' said Shands, who owns three travel 
agencies in south Texas. ``I will not suffer my financial death at 
the hands of corporate executioners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United on Oct. 7 announced plans to cut agents' commissions from  
8 percent to 5 percent, saying it would save $150 million a year. 
Since then, 16 other carriers have followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	United chairman James Goodwin, explaining the reasoning behind  
the cuts, said ``electronic capabilities'' are forcing the airline 
to find smarter ways to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents, however, say the airline's goal is to put travel agents  
out of business and force consumers to deal directly with them, 
ultimately resulting in higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust laws bar agents from acting together to boycott United  
or any other airline. But conversations in Internet chat rooms and 
elsewhere make it clear that such informal actions are under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society of Travel Agents, which represents 11,000  
U.S. travel agencies, has revoked United's membership in the 
association -- a mostly symbolic move -- and has proposed federal 
legislation to reverse the cuts. It also has asked the 
Transportation Department to rescind them. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline indicated it isn't feeling a pinch from any boycott.  
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 80 percent of airline tickets are still sold  
through retail travel agencies. But travel agents face stiff 
competition from Internet sites that allow consumers to shop for 
deals and buy directly from the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Tagariello, whose Buckhead Travel Partners in Atlanta  
has stopped doing United bookings, says the latest fee decrease 
could put as many as half of travel agents nationwide out of 
business within months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately at this point every carrier has followed suit  
and we cannot boycott everybody or we can't have anybody traveling 
anywhere,'' she said.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros third basemen Ken Caminiti was  
discharged from a hospital Saturday, where he was being treated for 
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, who missed 79 games this season with a calf problem,  
received three fractures in his lower back after falling from a

<HEADLINE> Marines Eyed in Bank Robberies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- They were two Marines on shore leave boozing it  
up in a bar in Thailand. An FBI photo shows them smiling, a young 
woman on each arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, they were fugitives, AWOL from Camp Pendleton and  
suspected in six bank robberies in California, Oregon and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why these two would up and decide to chuck it all for  
something like this is a shock to everyone,'' FBI spokesman John 
Iannarelli said last week of the turn of events that led his agency 
to issue arrest warrants for Nicholas Paul Hills, 21, and Benjamin 
Michael Johns, 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives and fellow Marines have been perplexed since the two  
disappeared in August, about the time the FBI issued warrants for 
their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills has called his mother and sister to say he won't be back  
for awhile, but they say they don't know where he is or why he 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's OK and told everybody that he loves us and that  
he's going to disappear for a couple of years,'' said Hills' 
sister, Michelle Kluewer, 24. She said the call lasted less than a 
minute because Hills feared the FBI was tracing it. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in the family knows what might have prompted him to  
abandon the Marines for a life of robbing banks, she said. He 
seemed normal when he returned home to Wisconsin for a week in 
July, she said. ``That's why it was such a shock when we heard 
about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hills, who lived in Juneau, Wis., had no previous criminal  
history. Johns, from Colorado Springs, Colo., was arrested Aug. 10 
for drunken driving, but he had no other criminal record. Efforts 
to reach his relatives were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither had significant discipline problems in their two years  
at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both lance corporals were members of a front-line Marine combat  
unit, but their training didn't include any SWAT or pistol 
exercises that would be particularly useful in robbing banks, a 
military official said. The FBI still considers them armed and 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank robbery accusations came to light in August when the  
FBI gave photos taken from security cameras during a holdup at a 
Bank of America in San Diego County to the Pendleton base newspaper 
because the suspects looked like they could be Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of their unit recognized Hills and Johns immediately,  
but the two had already fled. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI issued warrants on Aug. 21 charging them with armed  
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the holdups, authorities said, Johns appeared to be  
in charge, entering the bank first, waving a pistol and ordering 
people to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills acted as a lookout or jumped over the counter to take  
money from the drawers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two robberies were at Carlsbad and San Marcos,  
communities near the base. They were followed by heists in Palo 
Alto; Tukwila, Wash.; and Portland, Ore.

<HEADLINE> New Indonesian President Rays Homage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- New President Abdurrahman Wahid took  
time out from picking a Cabinet to pay homage Saturday at the 
burial sites of his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to greet  
Wahid, who arrived in the Jombang district, 370 miles east of 
Jakarta, by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by East Java Gov. Imam Utomo and other local  
military and civilian officials, Wahid visited nearby Tebuireng 
village, where the graves of his grandfather, Hasyim Ashary, and 
father, Wahid Hasyim, a former Muslim cleric, are located. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashary was the founder of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest  
nonpolitical Muslim organization. Wahid, a moderate Muslim cleric 
commonly known by his nickname Gus Dur, now heads the group after 
studying at Pesantren Tebuireng, a well-known center for advanced 
Islamic studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid, elected Wednesday to the nation's highest post by the  
People's Consultative Committee, also took the opportunity to visit 
relatives in his nearby home village of Denanyar. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his second visit to the burial sites this month. The  
first was with Megawati Sukarnoputri, his rival in the presidential 
election. She was elected as vice president on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the ailing 59-year-old Wahid -- who is nearly blind and  
has suffered two strokes in recent years -- had to be helped by 
aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati had been scheduled to join Wahid in Jombang, but local  
police said her visit was canceled. She tentatively planned to 
visit the grave of her father, Indonesia's founding President 
Sukarno, on Sunday instead. He is buried in Blitar, also in East 
Java. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying homage to the burial sites of ancestors is a widely  
practiced tradition on Java, Indonesia's main island. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid was scheduled to proceed to the East Java capital,  
Surabaya, before flying back to Jakarta. On Sunday, he is expected 
to make his first speech as president on the island of Bali, a 
Megawati stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
	The new president's main focus now is on his selection of a  
Cabinet that analysts hope will have strong economic credentials 
and be free of corruption and human rights abuses committed during 
decades of authoritarianism. He is expected to make his choices 
known within a few days.

<HEADLINE> Meat Diet Fattens Prices at Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A high-protein diet craze that orders up juicy  
slabs of steak, pork chops and even bacon may be beefing up meat 
prices on the wholesale market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confirmed pasta eaters are now red meat eaters,'' said Bill  
Plummer, a Chicago analyst among the industry watchers who contend 
the nation's latest diet fad is adding weight to prices on the 
sometimes faltering wholesale market. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protein diet promoted in such best sellers as ``Protein  
Power'' and ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution'' is billed as a way 
to fool the body's metabolism by nixing carbohydrates and sugars in 
favor of protein and fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for beef is expected to increase 1.6 percent this year  
over last year, according to data released Friday by the National 
Cattlemen's Beef Association. And demand for pork is already up 2.3 
percent this year, according to the National Pork Producers 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, prices are rising for meat and livestock  
futures -- speculative contracts for cattle, hogs and pork bellies. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are in  
the healthy 70-cents-a-pound range. Fresh pork bellies -- bacon to 
the rest of us -- have flirted with the 80-cents-a-pound mark, 
surpassing even the traditionally pricier untrimmed pork loins, 
though at least some of the rise is attributed to the flooding in 
North Carolina that wiped out about 30,000 hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real shock,'' says Dan Vaught, a livestock analyst with  
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, who also believes the 
high-protein fad is helping to bolster hog prices. The prices 
traditionally drop when people put away their grills as summer 
ends, but they don't seem to be doing so this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef  
Association, agreed that promotions for high-protein diets aren't 
hurting the industry, but she also points to improving economies 
that are able to buy more meat, particularly in southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Hockman of the National Pork Producers Council attributes  
the increased pork demand to ``chicken fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Michael Swinford of Rosenthal-Collins Inc. in Chicago  
expects the diet fad will be short-lived, especially since the 
American Dietetic Association recently called high-protein diets 
``a nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> 100 Years on a Plastic Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This is a story about billiard balls, false teeth and a triumph  
of failed research. In short, it's about how plastics came to be. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, it's about chemistry.  
</P>
<P>
	What makes plastic plastic is the molecules -- made from atoms of  
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other stuff. The molecules are 
immense, often resembling chains, sometimes with side-chains or 
ring structures sticking out like legs on a centipede. These side 
structures can prevent the main chains from packing close together 
in an orderly way. That makes plastic flexible and often 
transparent. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes certain plastics hard is letting the molecule chains  
snarl together like a pile of spaghetti -- very stiff spaghetti. If 
these strands slip when heated, the plastic can be remolded. But if 
they won't budge, the plastic keeps its original shape. 
</P>
<P>
	We think of plastic -- its name from the Greek plastikos, meaning  
shapeable -- as the ultimate synthetic material, a landmark in the 
striving to outdo nature. But the earliest manmade plastics owe a 
lot to nature, specifically cellulose, the main stuff of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1862, British chemist Alexander Parkes announced he had  
modified a cellulose-based mixture called collodian that doctors 
used to cover cuts. The new stuff, Parkesine, could be warmed and 
then molded into shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkes' company went broke, but American inventor John Wesley  
Hyatt struck gold through his own tinkering with collodian. Going 
after a $10,000 prize offered for a substitute for ivory to use in 
billiard balls, he created celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
	It quickly became a material for combs, shirt collars, movie  
film and more. Still, it had some big problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, people who used celluloid plates to hold their  
false teeth found that when they drank hot tea, the plates warped. 
The good news was that the stuff wouldn't blow up, as the New York 
Times felt compelled to assure its readers in an 1875 editorial 
titled, ``Explosive Teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But celluloid presented a very real hazard. Early movie film  
could burst into flames in projectors. It was succeeded by ``safety 
film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until this century did inventors began to make plastics  
completely from synthetic materials. The first, announced in 1909, 
was Bakelite. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakelite was an accident, the result of a failed quest. Its  
inventor, American chemist Leo Baekeland, was trying to find a 
substitute for shellac. The sticky, amber-colored stuff he got by 
mixing phenol and formaldehyde didn't work for that. But he came to 
realize it was great plastic: It was cheaper than celluloid and 
could be quickly molded into hard shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, as Baekeland's company proclaimed, ``The Material of a  
Thousand Uses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It found its way into radios, light sockets, jewelry,  
telephones, washing machines, fishing reels, guns. Bakelite ``set 
the mold for the modern plastic industry,'' says the American 
Chemical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	More plastics followed in the early 20th century, like  
Cellophane, the invention of a Swiss textile engineer, Jacques 
Brandenberger, who wanted to keep wine spills from spoiling 
tablecloths. The 1930s brought nylon, Teflon, the clingy wrap 
material Saran and polyethylene, widely used in things like milk 
jugs and grocery bags. By 1940, Henry Ford could swing an ax 
against a prototype plastic car to show how tough it was. 
</P>
<P>
	As for that ancestral stuff, celluloid -- you can still use it.  
Every time you whack a pingpong ball.

	The plastic seat-back tray was returned to an upright position.  
The plastic airsickness bag was properly stowed. The plastic

Taking her mother's bills, the clerk clacked plastic cash-register

lenses (33.2 million made annually). Another adjusted his plastic 
teeth. A janitor swept with a plastic broom. 
</P>
<P>
	At a concourse hotdog stand, a vendor pulled plastic wrap from a  
package of buns, an ounce or less of the yearly 13.8-billion-pound 
output of flexible plastic packaging, and tossed it in a plastic 
trashcan lined with a plastic bag. A customer undid a plastic 
button at his cuff, rolled up his sleeves and squeezed mustard from 
a plastic bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic suitcases, some with plastic wheels, some wrapped in  
plastic sheeting, appeared on a plastic belt.

	A man cupped his hands around a plastic lighter, lit a  
cigarette, pointed to a plastic dispatcher's booth. Something 
yellow, plastic, poked out from behind it -- a bumper (value of the 
automotive plastics industry: $3 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	The cab's plastic seat was hot. The plastic air conditioning  
vent was closed. From the plastic divider stared a plasticized 
photo of the driver. He pushed a plastic button on a meter. The

	On the highway, one of the 850,000 plastic Corvettes in the  
United States sped by. Plastic lights atop a police car flashed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the E-Z lane of the toll booth, the driver held a plastic box  
up to the windshield -- an electronic badge. The plastic bar went 
up. The cabbie gripped the plastic steering wheel, and drove on.

	Scott Reilly's life is plastic. His Atlanta store,  
Retromodern.com, is stuffed with things artificial and exuberant 
and, always, polymer-based. The man occupies a plastic cosmos -- 
fiery oranges, fierce greens, passionate purples. A lemon in a 
shiny Melamine bowl. ``That's sexy!'' Reilly enthuses. 
</P>
<P>
	He's right, of course. Extruding our way to a better tomorrow,  
we shape plastic and it shapes us, making our world as curved and 
bendable as we'd like. This stuff does everything: It's modular! 
Stackable! Bendable! Malleable! Slippery! 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say cotton is the fabric of our lives. But I don't  
think so. I think it's plastic,'' Reilly says. ``A world without 
plastic is a world I wouldn't want to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just try to imagine, or recall, such a world. Here -- for better

dinners that don't ignite in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware parties.  
</P>
<P>
	Batters hit in the head and trotting to first uninjured.  
Astroturf -- and indoor arenas. High-tech fishing lures. Inflatable 
rafts, so much lighter and more portable than wood or aluminum. 
Brawling hockey players' grimaces mashed against Plexiglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboys and Penthouses sealed in polyethylene bags on the  
newsstand. Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
	World War II airplane radar. Modern parachutes.  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Potato Head.  
</P>
<P>
	Silly Putty. Legos. Barbie and GI Joe. Hula hoops. Stretch  
Armstrong. Silly string. The see-through eggs in gumball machines 
that hold spider web tattoos and fake diamond rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shampoo bottles that don't break and cut your feet when you drop  
them in the shower. Toothbrushes for the masses. Throwaway lighters 
and ball-point pens. Cheap digital watches. Half the inventory at 
the Kmart down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Disposable diapers.  
</P>
<P>
	Band-Aids. Unbreakable eyeglasses. Featherweight prosthetic  
limbs. Replacement joints. The Jarvik-7 artificial heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The bubble boy.

<P>
	The powder-blue Dacron zip-up jacket worn by the barber named  
Lou who used to cut your father's hair.

</P>
<P>
	Spandex. Press-on nails. Pink flamingoes on the next-door

</P>
<P>
	Non-ivory piano keys -- and plastic laptop pianos. Naugahyde.  
Lunchbox carrot sticks in a Baggie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Pilot instead of an appointment book in your shirt  
pocket. Floppy diskettes. The iMac. Compact discs. Cassettes. 
Videotapes. ``Frampton Comes Alive'' on vinyl.

	Movies.

<P>

 *IV: PLASTIC -- HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT IT?

 *Plastic flowers and coffins will outlast critics

</P>
<P>
	``When you die,'' says Jim Kieszkowski, ``it's kind of like  
forever'' -- and in that way, it's kind of like plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieszkowski is an expert on plastic and death.  
</P>
<P>
	His company, Oak Grove International of Manistee, Mich., has  
made fiberglass coffins since 1992. Some of them look like wood, 
some of them look like brass. Some of them are emblazoned with the 
logos of the University of Kentucky or Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieszkowski is a true believer. Wood decays, metal rusts, but  
plastic is eternal. It will seal out worms and water and whatever; 
it will seal in the decaying dearly departed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kieszkowski knows that he's up against some powerful  
prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go back,'' he says, ``to that plastic pop bottle'' -- to the  
lingering conviction that plastic is disposable, flimsy, cheap and 
fake, an inferior version of the real thing, whatever the real 
thing might be. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always that way. Earlier in the century, plastic was  
considered one of the great wonders of the modern age. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakelite, invented in 1909, was electrically resistant,  
chemically stable, shatterproof. It wouldn't crack, fade, crease or 
discolor. Cellophane was the first clear, flexible, waterproof 
wrap. Nylon almost instantly transformed women's legs and lives. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1945 through the 1970s, the plastic industry grew by 15  
percent a year. All of that material found many uses, not all of 
them prudent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plastic and there's plastic,'' says pop historian Alex  
Shear. He admires the hardy toy trucks and doll furniture made by 
Renwal, and the molded chairs designed by Charles Eames. He 
shudders at the stuff that wound up on the sale table at 
Woolworth's. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things were downright ugly,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	The list of worrisome things from science, wrote Lewis Thomas,  
includes ``behavior control, genetic engineering, transplanted 
heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic 
flowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic became a metaphor -- for wastefulness (under pressure,  
McDonald's dropped its plastic packaging, though paper's half-life 
in a landfill is not much less than polystyrene's) and for the 
falseness of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben, I just want to say one word to you,'' the phony neighbor  
intones in ``The Graduate,'' pulling the title character aside for 
a heart-to-heart. ``Just one word --'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you listening?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I am.''  
</P>
<P>
	(Pause...) ``Plastics.''  
</P>
<P>
	Norman Mailer once called plastic ``a malign force loose in the  
universe that is the social equivalent of cancer.'' Plastic is 
sickening us, killing us, he said, and others agree. Though the 
industry calls such claims nonsense, scientists continue to probe 
the dark side of polystyrene. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember: Plastic is forever and outlasts even its critics.  
</P>
<P>
	``Praise the falseness that is true. Praise the lie that  
lasts,'' writes the poet John Stone in ``In Praise of Even 
Plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic has become the stuff of our lives. We recycle it in ever  
greater amounts (1.45 billion pounds last year), and use it in 
Happy Meal toys, hip replacements, keyboards like the one on which 
this story was written -- and, yes, in coffins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieszkowski's company makes more than 2,000 fiberglass caskets  
each year. Business is good and attitudes are changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, he says, ``I hear people saying, `If that fiberglass  
boat was good enough for Dad to take the kids out fishing on the 
lake, it's good enough to bury him in.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He foresees a day when plastic will be as common six feet down  
as it is everywhere else.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Orders Freezes in W.Va. Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- State regulators are asking the coal  
industry to inform them of how many mining operations might be 
affected by a judge's order that bans the disposal of mining waste 
in streambeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Division of Environmental Protection will begun a survey of  
mining operations Monday, asking operators to anticipate how the 
ruling will affect them, said DEP spokesman Andy Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Gov. Cecil Underwood on Friday ordered a state  
hiring and spending freeze in preparation for tighter budgets next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide budget cut of as much as 10 percent may be needed  
after Jan. 1, Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our efforts to diversify West Virginia's economy  
produced a budget surplus last fiscal year, despite a $13 million 
shortfall in coal severance taxes, the expected impact of this 
ruling will be much more devastating to the state and local 
budgets,'' Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for environmentalists who sued the coal industry  
last year, U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II ruled Wednesday 
that dumping mining waste in West Virginia's streams fouls the 
water in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bans mining operations within 100 feet of a stream.  
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could all but shut down mountaintop removal mining, a  
strip mining technique used increasingly in Appalachia. The top of 
a ridge is sheared off, the coal is extracted, and the leftover 
rock and dirt are pushed into a nearby river valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of this ruling will be ... devastating to state and  
local budgets,'' Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal industry leaders warned that the ruling could also cripple  
traditional underground mining, which also disposes of waste in 
river valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave us a death sentence, is what they've done,'' said  
Ernest Woods, president of United Mine Workers Local 5958. ``We're 
dinosaurs now. And they'll be going after the deep mines next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is the No. 2 coal-producing state, behind Wyoming.  
The coal industry accounts for 3 percent of all jobs in West 
Virginia, down from 9.5 percent in 1979. The nearly 19,000 jobs 
tied to the industry provided more than $950 million in wages in 
1998, with workers averaging $50,800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had 392 underground mines and 227 strip mines last  
year, with strip mining accounting for less than one-third of West 
Virginia's total production of 181 million tons of coal. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators said they do not yet know exactly how many  
mines are affected by the ruling. But the state Tax Department said 
it could cost West Virginia as much as $100 million this fiscal 
year, out of an annual budget of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia's congressional delegation has asked federal  
regulatory agencies to join in an appeal of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountaintop-removal strip mining is growing in West Virginia, in  
part because that is where the untouched deposits lie and because 
coal companies that practice such mining are often freed from the 
requirement that they restore the land to its approximate original 
contour. 
</P>
<P>
	They simply fill in the nearby stream, leaving terrain that is  
flat or gently rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was upset with the ruling. Cindy Rank, a  
spokeswoman for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, one of the 
environmental groups that sued, was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always believed that the law was meant to protect all  
our resources, including streams and people, much more than has 
been done in the past 10 years,'' Ms. Rank said.

<HEADLINE> Gay Attack Fence Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Paul Etchepare sits in his tan pickup on a  
warm fall afternoon and sighs as he looks at the roughhewn fence 
that sits on his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Built to complement the rocky, sagebrush-covered foothills, the  
crisscrossed logs instead have become an international symbol of 
hate, the site where Matthew Shepard was tied up, beaten into a 
coma and left to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``I literally tried to think of something that wouldn't be  
offensive or ugly or tacky, so I designed that fence,'' Etchepare 
said. ``It's ironic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay.  
His killing inspired a national debate over hate crimes and led to 
measures across the country adding sexual orientation to 
anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements are scheduled Monday in the trial of Aaron  
McKinney, 22, one of two men accused in the attack of the 
University of Wyoming student. He could receive the death penalty 
if convicted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping  
in April and received two life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's trial and the recent one-year anniversary of  
Shepard's death brought Etchepare's thoughts back to the reasons he 
erected the rustic obstacle aimed at keeping ``honest people'' from 
traveling where they shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in Denver, Etchepare, 53, is a descendant of  
Basque sheepherders who sought a new life in Wyoming. His family 
bought the Warren Livestock Co., which was incorporated in 1883 by 
the state's first governor, and he established Laramie as his 
summer home four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the safest, the most comfortable,'' he said. ``I  
purposefully made the choice -- and I can live anywhere -- that this 
was going to be my hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etchepare decided to build a barrier to deter trespassers from  
following a trail from the family ranch onto neighboring property. 
He opted for a three-section, buck-and-rail fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it to be attractive,'' he said. ``It was this or put  
up some ugly 'No Trespassing' sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around 4 p.m. on Oct. 7, 1998, Etchepare was showing property to  
a prospective buyer. The two were in the middle of a patch of 
sagebrush and wheatgrass about 500 yards from a small hill. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of that hill -- unknown to Etchepare -- a small  
figure was lying unconscious on the fence, his wrists bound and 
clothesline fastening his ankles to one of the posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, Etchepare returned to the property and saw  
police cars. There had been a ``near homicide,'' he was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Etchepare learned the details of Shepard's brutal beating, and  
discovered that one of his relatives and the Shepards were longtime 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Etchepares offered to help Dennis and Judy Shepard in their  
darkest hour, shooing away throngs of reporters, issuing updates on 
the young Shepard's condition and managing the family's affairs 
until the numbing shock ever so slightly began to subside. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, died five days after he was lashed to the fence and  
pistol-whipped on the freezing prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	Etchepare said the crime made him question his decision to move  
to Laramie. His anger subsided though, when he realized other 
residents were also shaken by the killing and portrayals of Laramie 
as a hate town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was affected and everyone was hurt,'' he said. ``It  
just made me like Laramie that much more. These are wonderful 
people. ... Laramie has nothing at all to feel guilty about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Etchepare begins to drive away, he says he isn't sure what to  
do with the fence. Many people have suggested he destroy it. Others 
want it preserved. For now, he's doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't win either way,'' he said. ``It just works better to  
turn a blind eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving his property, he nailed up a ``No Trespassing''  
sign.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income Gets Gov't Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite low corn and soybean prices, a typical  
Iowa farmer stands to clear $48,000 this year, thanks to good 
weather and the federal farm program. Now $16,000 more is coming 
from Washington. In Texas, where a 1,700-acre cotton farm can 
expect to earn about $180,000, the government is going to make it 
an even $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On many farms, the aid is expected to boost income by 25 percent  
to 30 percent or more even as producers are bringing in bumper 
crops, according to an analysis by Texas A&AMP;M University's 
Agricultural and Food Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash comes from the $8.7 billion package of emergency farm  
assistance that President Clinton signed into law on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa alone will get an estimated $610 million, or $25 for every  
acre of farm land in the state. That would increase the state's net 
farm income this year to $2.6 billion, $400 million over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``From an economic standpoint the year is looking pretty  
positive and certainly brighter if the president signed that 
bill,'' said Ron McCartney, speaking over the din of his combine as 
he harvested his northeast Iowa farm last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistance package will benefit virtually every grain and  
cotton farm in the country, large or small, regardless of their 
financial situation or how good their crops were; the bigger the 
farm, the bigger the check. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing government programs, which guarantee minimum prices for  
crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton, ensure that with 
good crops most farmers can make enough money to cover their 
operating costs, economists say. But many farmers, especially those 
who borrowed heavily for land and equipment, say they would have 
trouble staying in business without this latest government aid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the extra money, a 950-acre corn and soybean farm in Iowa  
will have net income, not including long-term debt and depreciation 
costs, of about $64,000, according to the Texas A&AMP;M analysis. A 
2,200-acre Iowa farm would get an extra $38,000, boosting its net 
income for the year to $146,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of the aid varies widely according to crop and region  
of the country, but it is a significant amount of money for nearly 
any operation: 
</P>
<P>
	--A 425-acre rice operation in California would get $53,000, more  
than double what the farm would otherwise make this year. Rice 
farmers have been hit particularly hard by a slump in export 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	--A typical farm in eastern North Dakota that grows wheat, barley  
and sunflowers would get $18,000, adding 31 percent to the 
operation's expected income. 
</P>
<P>
	--In South Carolina, a 1,500-acre corn and soybean operation can  
expect to get a check for $30,000, increasing its net income by 35 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the aid package, about $6 billion, was  
designed to compensate farmers for the depressed commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that, $5.5 billion is going to growers as a doubling of the  
annual ``market transition'' payments they ordinarily would get 
under the 1996 farm law. The new total payment for the year is 
capped at $160,000 per farm; landowners can receive some of the 
money so long as they share in the expenses of the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $475 million in the aid package is earmarked for  
farmers who grow soybeans, sunflowers and other oilseed crops that 
were omitted from the market transition payments. 
</P>
<P>
	There is an additional $1.4 billion in the aid package for  
producers, primarily on the East Coast, who lost crops to drought 
and flooding this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the way the bailout was put together say that too  
much of the money is going to large farms and landowners in a 
handful of states. 
</P>
<P>
	Six states -- Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, Kansas and  
Minnesota -- will get at least $2.8 billion among them. Some farmers 
fear that better-off producers will use the extra cash to expand 
their operations and drive up land values and rents in the process. 
At the very least, economists agree, the payments will prevent land 
rents from falling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like everybody is getting'' the money, regardless of  
need, said Don Peterson, a specialist in farm management at South 
Dakota State University. ``It's going to allow those that had good 
yields ... to gobble up those that had bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has expressed similar concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``The current farm programs tend to reinforce larger  
operations,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ``The fact 
that you've got an emergency proposal that builds on the existing 
structure I think will provide some impetus for some additional 
consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farm organizations resisted efforts by Glickman to change the  
way the aid would be delivered, saying that only would slow the 
payments. Farmers say that operations of all sizes need and deserve 
the help until commodity prices rebound. With grain surpluses 
worldwide, prices are expected to remain low at least through next 
year unless there are large-scale crop failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the money they're throwing us is  
going to be helpful ... but it's not really a long-term solution by 
any means,'' said McCartney.

<HEADLINE> Kiss A Native Wins at Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Unbeaten Kiss A Native, who had won his only two  
starts by an average of 15 lengths, moved into stakes company at 
Calder Race Course Saturday and scored a five-length victory over 
Snuck In in the Open division of the $400,000 Florida Stallion 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory raised the colt's earnings from $30,500 to $275,500  
and may well have earned him a start in the $1 million Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiss A Native, bred and owned by John Franks, did not make his  
debut until Sept. 20 at Calder and could have been claimed that day 
for $32,000. He won by 20 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, he decisively outfinished Snuck In, who had won the  
first two legs of the Open division of the three-tiered Stallion 
Stakes. Megacles came from last to finish third, 2 1/2 lengths behind 
Snuck In. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Cornelio Velasquez, Kiss A Native was the 7-5 favorite  
with Snuck In at 8-5. Kiss A Native ran 1 1-16 miles in 1:44.40 and 
paid $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In the filly division of the Stallion Stakes, Miz United States,  
a 27-to-1 shot, took the lead at the start and held on for a neck 
victory over Regally Appealing, the overwhelming favorite. 
Plettenberg Bay, an entry with Regally Appealing, was a distant 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Miz United States, ridden by Robbie Albarado, went 1 1-16 miles  
in 1:45.80 and paid $56.20. She had raced only twice prior to the 
Stallion Stakes and had earned $25,700 compared to $175,645 for 
Regally Appealing, a two-time stakes winner. Owned by Laurie Plesa 
and Trilogy Stable, Miz United States boosted her earnings to 
$265,700. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiss A Native had the lead an the rail going to the first turn  
but was second to Frozen Field down the backstretch before 
reclaiming the lead at the three-eighths pole. Snuck In was second 
at the eighth pole, but Kiss A Native ran away from him over the 
final sixteenth of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bill White decided to run the colt in the Stallion  
Stakes finale after he won an allowance race by 11 lengths on Oct. 
9, even though the two races were only a week apart. Hurricane 
Irene then hit South Florida, forcing a week's postponement of the 
Stallion Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I now believe in Santa Claus,'' White said. ``It was a  
million-to-one shot that the race would be delayed a week. It 
really helped us. He's a special kind of colt. Mr. Franks and I 
will seriously consider running him in the Breeders' Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were four other stakes, ranging from $100,000 to $300,000  
on the 13-race program, and Velasquez won two others in addition to 
the $400,000 Open division. He also won the $200,000 Calder Oaks 
and the $100,000 Flying Pidgeon Handicap on horses that were to 
have been ridden by Julio Garcia, who was injured Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, on the turf, Velasquez's mounts closed with a  
rush. Crystal Symphony won the Oaks by 3 1/4 lengths over Beyond The 
Sun, with Sangam third. The winner covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:53 and 
paid $25.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Flying Pidgeon, a race for older horses, Wicapi finished  
with a rush between horses to win by a half-length. The Kaiser was 
second by a neck over Blazing Sword. Wicapi ran 1 3/8 miles in 2:20.60 
and paid $32.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Another long shot, Princess Pietrina, came from last and edged  
Hurricane Bertie by a nose in the $300,000 Princess Rooney 
Handicap, a Grade III event. Princess Pietrina ran six furlongs in 
1:10.40 and paid $26.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Daisies and Nites won her third straight stakes, going wire to  
wire for a half-length victory over Holy Capote in the $146,750 
Calder Breeders' Cup Handicap for fillies and mares. Ridden by Jose 
Rivera II, Daisies and Nites ran 1 1/8 miles on the turf in 1:52.20 
and paid $6.20.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Community Still Hurting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A security videotape of the first moments of the  
Columbine massacre is broadcast nationwide. A student is arrested 
for making fresh threats. A surviving student's mother commits 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after a dozen students and a teacher were killed in  
the shooting attack, aftershocks continue to assail the Columbine 
community, and many wonder if it will ever end. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest emotional assault occurred Friday when the mother of  
one of the most gravely injured students walked into an Englewood 
pawn shop, asked to see a gun, loaded it when the clerk's back was 
turned and killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was all over and it started all over again,''  
said Angie Amaro, whose 15-year-old daughter, Crystal, attends 
Columbine. ``This is another victim of Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tragedy like the Columbine attack can cause feelings of  
helplessness and fresh waves of grief to take hold about six months 
later, psychologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another layer of tragedy for the people of  
Columbine to have to deal with,'' said John Eachon, vice president 
of Access and Extended Services, whose counselors have worked with 
students in the wake of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors are telling parents and students ``they need to  
connect with friends, family and the faith community,'' Eachon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was around lunchtime April 20 when students Eric Harris, 18,  
and Dylan Klebold, 17, scattered gunfire and bombs at the suburban 
high school, killing 13 and injuring about 26 before they committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst school shooting in U.S. history drew together  
grief-stricken Littleton-area residents. They comforted each other 
and volunteered to help the victims' families. The students 
returned to classes in August after a stirring, rowdy ``take back 
the school'' rally. 
</P>
<P>
	In the passing months, however, the stark reality of the  
massacre has surfaced again and again. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, CBS-TV was criticized by some residents and  
Columbine families after it broadcast a brief segment of the 
security camera videotape that showed the opening moments of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old student was arrested last week for allegedly  
threatening ``to finish the job'' begun by the student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	And Friday, Carla June Hochhalter committed suicide.  
</P>
<P>
	It should have been a better time for the family. Her daughter,  
17-year-old Anne Marie, had recently moved her legs for the first 
time since the attack. The family was preparing to move into a new 
home that was equipped for Miss Hochhalter's wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Michalik, whose son Richard Castaldo also was injured  
last spring, said she thought the family had finally turned a 
corner emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all depressed and devastated ... she was no different  
from us,'' Mrs. Michalik said. ``I thought she was better, 
especially when Anne Marie moved her legs for the first time last 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Michalik admitted she, too, has struggled with emotions  
because of her child's injuries. ``There was I time where I thought 
I had nothing to live for. I know what she went through,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Cohn, whose 15-year-old son, Aaron, survived the library  
attack, said, ``I just can't take it. That's my feeling. I can't 
believe someone killed themselves over those idiots. Her daughter 
pulled through a lot. It's been terrible for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn and his son have been to counseling, but the sessions have  
been of little help to Aaron. ``Until he opens up, there's nothing 
we can do,'' Steve Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stress is eroding his sense of safety, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I drive by the school and I'm looking behind every tree. I  
feel like a cop. I want to prevent it before it happens again,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Columbine Victim Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Even six months after the massacre at  
Columbine High School the suffering just won't end. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla June Hochhalter, whose daughter was critically wounded in  
the April attack that left 15 others dead, took her own life 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This pain and suffering is not fair. We do not understand  
it,'' District Attorney Dave Thomas said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With her daughter making her best progress yet from spinal cord  
wounds that had left her unable to move, no one could say why Mrs. 
Hochhalter committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	She left a note, but its contents were withheld by authorities.  
The Denver Post reported that she apologized to her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Mrs. Hochhalter visited a pawn shop Friday  
morning in nearby Englewood. She asked to see a .38-caliber 
handgun, loaded it with ammunition she had brought with her and 
killed herself with a shot to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	The clerk had turned his back to fill out required paperwork  
when Mrs. Hochhalter fired one bullet into a store wall, then fired 
again into her right temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Michalik, whose son Richard Castaldo also was injured in  
the April 20 shootings, said she became friends with Mrs. 
Hochhalter while their children went through painful rehabilitation 
at Craig Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she was better, especially when Anne Marie moved her  
legs for the first time last week,'' Mrs. Michalik said Friday. 
``There was something finally, something to look forward to. There 
were finally happier times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Michalik admitted she also had gone ``through my down  
stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The feelings are to be expected, said Harriet Hall, the  
psychologist in charge of counseling the Columbine victims. She 
said research has shown that grief can really take hold about six 
months after a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say some people go through the worst grieving from four  
to six months. I think you really start noticing the person's 
missing,'' said Linda Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed at 
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Michalik said Mrs. Hochhalter may have felt overburdened.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing was too much for her,'' she said. ``They had  
to move (because her daughter was paralyzed). She didn't want to 
move out of the old house. She was settled. Then they had to 
remodel, live in hotels and I think it was too much for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Marie, a senior, is taking a physics class at Columbine  
while a tutor teaches the rest of her classes at home. She was with 
her father, Ted Hochhalter, at an elementary school accepting a 
check from a fund raiser for medical bills when her mother went to 
the pawn shop, the Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The suicide was the latest shock for students and families in  
the Littleton area. Jefferson County School District officials 
planned to have grief counselors available this weekend to help 
deal with any trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	A student was arrested this week for allegedly threatening ``to  
finish the job'' begun by the two student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, CBS-TV was criticized for airing a snippet of the  
security camera videotape that was taken in the school cafeteria as 
the massacre unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying several weapons and setting off homemade bombs,  
teen-agers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a 
teacher and wounded about 26 others before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely horrified,'' said Steve Cohn, parent of a  
15-year-old Columbine student who survived the assault. ``We've 
been under a lot of stress recently but what do you do?''

<HEADLINE> Japan Struggles Decade After Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- All summer the stock market set new records. A home  
purchased for $200,000 a few years ago is now worth almost twice 
that. Growth has been so robust for so long that experts say we are 
witnessing the birth of a new and better economy. 
</P>
<P>
	America in 1999? No, that was Japan in '89.  
</P>
<P>
	Newly-rich brokers and bankers sipped green tea instead of  
cappuccino, but in many ways, the scene in Tokyo back then was 
eerily similar to New York today. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Japan was enjoying a prolonged bull market. The  
benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average soared toward 40,000, doubling 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies were leading the world in autos, electronics  
and banking, and investors seemed to believe the good times would 
never end. But then Japan showed that even great wealth can 
disappear in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese stock market lost one-third of its value in the  
first three months of 1990, and it would be two more years before 
it hit bottom. In some parts of Tokyo, real estate prices plunged 
70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse wiped out 840 trillion yen (dlrs 7.9 trillion)  
worth of business capital and household wealth between 1990 and 
1996 -- the equivalent of subtracting an economy the size of 
Britain's from the world each of those years. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the collapse was astounding, but more troubling  
for many has been how long it has lingered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years after the ``bubble economy'' began to deflate,  
Kazuhide Furukawa is one of many Japanese forced to put life on 
hold because of bad economic times. He lost his job as a political 
aide more than a year ago and has been looking for work ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to be OK,'' he says after a morning of  
scrolling through computerized job postings at a Tokyo employment 
center. ``Then I realized there are hardly any jobs that pay enough 
for me to keep my living standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are looking for young workers who they can pay less.  
``My age is considered too old,'' laments Furukawa, who is 34. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been doing secretarial work on nights and weekends, and  
he still has some savings. But Furukawa had hoped to marry this 
year and now worries that if he doesn't find a good job soon his 
fiancee may change her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Furukawa's plight is still relatively rare. The 4.9 percent  
unemployment rate is a record-high for Japan but not so bad 
compared to many countries in Europe or even the United States, 
where the rate is 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But job loss is not the only thing the Japanese worry about.  
</P>
<P>
	The collapse in asset prices devastated corporate and government  
pension funds. And the national pension system could go into the 
red for the first time ever this year, the government has said. 
</P>
<P>
	So many Japanese are worried about life after they retire.  
</P>
<P>
	A survey conducted in June by the mass-circulation Asahi  
newspaper showed that about 85 percent felt anxiety about growing 
old, up from 66 percent in a similar 1994 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoko Oshida, a 47-year-old housewife, is one of them. ``Our  
children are grown so we will manage. But we can't count on the 
pension system,'' she says. She and her husband, who works in the 
transportation industry, have been saving more privately instead. 
</P>
<P>
	After stumbling along at an average growth rate of just over 1  
percent a year between 1992 and 1996, Japan's economy sank into a 
recession that lasted more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy has shown surprising signs of life this year. It  
expanded at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the most recent 
quarter after a 8.1 percent growth spurt in the first quarter. But 
while the worst may be over, economists say a full recovery could 
still be years off. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rise in the U.S. stock market and soaring housing  
prices, many people worry that the United States may also have a 
Japanese-style ``bubble economy.'' But there are some good reasons 
to believe Japan's experience won't be repeated here. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's bubble expanded as investors used paper profits on  
stocks to make increasingly large bets in the market. Even big 
companies joined in, generating corporate revenues through market 
speculation instead of by selling products -- something that, for 
the most part, hasn't happened in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	And while many U.S. firms have continued to focus on  
restructuring and cost-cutting during the good times, many Japanese 
companies did not. That failure made them vulnerable when the 
downturn came. 
</P>
<P>
	Even since the crash many Japanese businesses have chosen to  
simply wait and hope the problem goes away rather than enact 
painful cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	An official report late last year blamed many of Japan's current  
troubles on a decade-long denial of its economic problems -- a 
refusal by government and companies to believe that all that money 
was really gone. They decided to ``leave the embarrassing problem 
untouched'' and hope for a recovery in prices, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Makoto Seki, head of a telecommunications equipment company in  
Tokyo, gave up waiting for recovery last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that business might never get back to where it was  
in the late 1980s, he implemented a drastic restructuring. Seki 
laid off one-third of his 200 employees and dropped a major product 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only way for us to survive,'' says the head of Seki  
Technotron Corp. ``We shrunk all at once so we could get to the 
stage where we can grow again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many large companies too have unveiled similar restructuring  
programs this year, but economists and many businessmen say such 
measures are only a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Japanese people to be successful in the next century  
everybody has to go through a painful process now,'' says Seki. 
``But almost nobody is willing to go through that process. That's 
why it's hard to be very optimistic for Japan.''

<HEADLINE> Maddux To Start Game 1 for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux will start Game 1 of the World Series  
tonight for Atlanta instead of Tom Glavine, scratched because of 
flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine would have been pitching against the New York Yankees on  
seven days' rest, while Maddux is starting on five days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Series between two of baseball's winningest teams in 1999 is  
a duel for the decade with two of the game's most successful 
postseason pitchers on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are seeking their third World Series title in four  
years while the Braves have won eight division titles, five 
National League pennants and one World Series since 1991. The 
winner can lay claim as the dominant team of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that's going to be one of the things that's making  
this a good World Series,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	That and some of the best pitching in baseball. Both teams come  
in with glitzy rotations that should produce tight, tense games. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux has a 2-2 World Series record, splitting decisions  
against Cleveland in 1995 and the Yankees in 1996, including a loss 
in New York's Game 6 clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	While he is 221-126 in his career during the regular season,  
including a 19-9 record this year, he is only 10-9 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees counter with Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban import who  
was 17-9 and emerged as the No. 1 pitcher on New York's staff. 
Using a high leg kick and corkscrew motion, El Duque is 4-0 in five 
career postseason starts and his 0.97 ERA is third best in history 
for starters with more than 30 innings in playoffs and World 
Series. He was MVP of the American League Championship Series when 
he had a 1.80 ERA in two starts against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is that he changes speed,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``That's what makes him so effective. You may see a 
fastball and then there will be another fastball, but maybe a few 
miles an hour quicker or slower. He uses both sides of the plate. 
He's able to throw the breaking ball from a number of different 
release points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox offered a scouting report on Hernandez that starts and  
finishes with the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can pitch out of the strike zone pretty good,'' Cox said.  
``He can come at you from all angles. He can get you off balance, 
straighten you up and still make you lunge and feel for breaking 
stuff off the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be patient for a ball you can handle. He's tough.  
He didn't start the other series because he's just an average 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre became sold on Hernandez's postseason capabilities a year  
ago when he rescued the Yankees in Game 4 of the ALCS against 
Cleveland after the Indians won two of the first three games. 
Hernandez pitched seven shutout innings, allowing only three hits, 
and the Yankees never lost another game en route to their 24th 
World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look in the eyes,'' Torre said. ``It's just something  
inside him. I guess it goes back to where he came from and how 
tough it was to get over here and have an opportunity to pitch at 
the major league level. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you do it, now you realize it's in that memory bank  
and it's in that feel, and then you do it again and now we expect 
it every time we send him out there. It's not saying he's going to 
win, but I know one thing -- he's going to empty the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves handled El Duque easily in interleague play. They  
beat him 7-2 in 1998, his first regular-season loss, and tagged him 
for four home runs in a 10-7 win this season. 
</P>
<P>
	So he'll be the one making adjustments this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be able to say as far as my technique and  
approach and what I'm going to do,'' he said through an 
interpreter. ``Obviously, it's something I should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was asked if facing the Braves was more personal,  
considering how they hit him in their previous encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congratulations to them,'' he said. ``Congratulations.''

<HEADLINE> French Woman Wins Cycling Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- France's Felicia Ballanger, the most dominant  
woman in track cycling history, swept the time trials Saturday to 
capture her 10th world championship gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old won in 34.477, one day after claiming the  
sprint. She is unbeaten in both events at the worlds since first 
winning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Another French rider, Laurent Gane, gave France its sixth gold  
medal with a victory in the men's sprint. He upset two-time Olympic 
champion Jens Fiedler, helped by the German's rules infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gane was awarded the first heat in the best of three event when  
Fiedler blocked his path to the inside of the track. He then 
eliminated the German in the second heat. 
</P>
<P>
	France now has tied its six golds in 12 events at last year's  
world held in Bordeaux heading in Sunday's final day. Germany has 
claimed two. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Bruno Risi also became the first rider who wasn't  
French or German to win a title when he captured the points race. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Risi won his fourth world title in the event by  
passing three riders on the last curve of the final sprint. The 10 
points awarded pushed his total to 25 points.

<HEADLINE> Menchu Urges Culture Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu  
urged students to press for the right to preserve their language 
and cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu, here for three days of discussions on bilingual  
education and cultural issues, won the prize in 1992, almost a 
decade after she published, ``I Rigoberta Menchu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Friday to more than 500 students at the Tucson  
Convention Center, Menchu urged them to learn as many languages as 
possible and never to lose their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu said she believes efforts to eliminate bilingual  
education in the United States will be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this proposal is going to win,'' Menchu said,  
adding that Hispanics ``have to unite and fight for this ideal -- 
and more than an ideal it's a right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menchu has conceded that she used the testimony of other victims  
to construct her own story of Guatemala's civil war, but defended 
the book as a testimonial that accurately depicts the suffering of 
her people, the indigenous Quiche.

<HEADLINE> Broken Rib Couldn't Stop O'Neill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Nothing stops Paul O'Neill.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not a measly little broken rib.  
</P>
<P>
	In the parking lot at Yankee Stadium 12 days earlier, he had a  
pained expression as he returned from the hospital after learning 
he cracked the rib while trying to run down a foul fly at Tampa Bay 
on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, it was the Braves who were feeling his pain.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill's two-run single off John Rocker put the Yankees ahead  
in a four-run eighth inning, and New York extended its World Series 
winning streak to nine with a 4-1 win in the opener against 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good, I really do,'' O'Neill said, playing down  
the injury. ``For the most part, it's feeling better day by day. 
Right now, I don't feel it's changing anything I do on the field. 
I'm sick of talking about it, to tell you the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill didn't want to take any credit, trying to deflect it to  
Chuck Knoblauch, who loaded the bases with a bunt that first 
baseman Brian Hunter fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a break on the bunt and that set up the whole inning  
for us,'' O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, O'Neill played the entire postseason with a  
torn hamstring and limped through the World Series against Atlanta, 
going just 2-for-12 with no RBIs. But he also made a great catch on 
Luis Polonia's liner with two outs and two on in the ninth to 
preserve a 1-0 Game 5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he had just one RBI in 46 career World Series at-bats  
before his hit against Rocker, batting just .152 (7-for-46). 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he is the heart of the Yankees. New York owner George  
Steinbrenner calls him a ``warrior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``O'Neill's a gamer,'' Derek Jeter said. ``When he seems like  
he's not going to get a hit, he comes up and gets a big hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, who let the right fielder talk his  
way into the lineup for the AL Championship Series opener, jokes 
that O'Neill is like a calendar: He knows October is approaching 
when O'Neill starts destroying Gatorade jugs and water coolers. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Saturday night, that was about all O'Neill was destroying.  
</P>
<P>
	When he stepped up to the plate against Rocker, who relieved  
after Jeter's game-tying single off Greg Maddux, he was just 
8-for-32 this postseason with a grand total of one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been 0-for-2 against Rocker, and the Yankees were a  
combined 1-for-7 against the talkative left-hander, whose 
postseason has been notable for his verbal fights with New York 
Mets' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker allowed just 10 of 27 inherited runners to score and held  
left-handers to a .140 batting average during the regular season. 
So he was the perfect choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Left-handers aren't going to make a living off Rocker,''  
O'Neill said. ``He throws too hard and too well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill hit .190 against lefties during the season, the lowest  
of any Yankees regular. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that happened in the past, you just throw out the  
door,'' Jeter said. ``He's not up there thinking about his 
struggles against lefties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill fell behind 0-1 in the count, then took three straight  
balls, so he knew Rocker had to come in with a strike. Then he 
turned on a 96 mph fastball, clapped his hands as he saw it roll 
into the outfield, and the Yankees were on top. 
</P>
<P>
	``Breaks are part of the game,'' O'Neill said. ``The ball finds  
a hole like tonight and we win. It's a double play and we still 
might be playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 36, O'Neill doesn't know how much longer his Yankees career  
will last. On Saturday night, he once again showed that even at a 
fraction of his best, he can still come through.

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Host School Music Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A concert with a purpose brought stars of  
rock, soul, blues and country music to a giant tent on the White 
House lawn Saturday to support the cause of bringing music back to 
cash-starved schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was a testimonial to the power of music to transform  
young lives and President Clinton, remembering his own music 
teachers, said, ``I don't think I would have become president if it 
hadn't been for school music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the president said: ``I learned that music was more  
than scales and keys or how to make sure I was always in tune. 
Music taught me how to mix practice and patience with creativity. 
Music taught me how to be both an individual performer and a good 
member of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the lesson for everyone, he said, is that ``we are stronger  
when we are playing in harmony based on our common humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said those gathered under the  
tent included educators, children's music advocates, some of the 
nation's best performing artists ``and people like me who never 
learned to carry a tune but who appreciate people who do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, she said, is to ``to put music back in our schools and  
back in our children's education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more than two-hour concert, a reprise of popular hits as the  
20th century ends, was performed by a roster of the stars of 
American music. 
</P>
<P>
	They included: Eric Clapton, Lenny Kravitz, Sheryl Crow, B.B.  
King, Garth Brooks, Gloria Estefan, John Fogerty, Al Green, and 
John Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars who did the introducing involved another roster of  
stars: Gwyneth Paltrow, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Keri Russell, 
Angela Bassett, Sarah Jessica Parker, Calista Flockhart and Robert 
de Niro. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Save the Music'' concert was sponsored by the VH1 cable  
music channel and the National Endowment for the Arts to spark 
interest in raising money to buy instruments and sponsor music 
education in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors said that only a quarter of the nation's eight  
graders are able to take part in instrumental music programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady paid tribute to the teachers who ``are bringing  
the power of music into our children's lives'' and the young people 
``who are playing their hearts out in schools across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing music, she said, changes lives, by sparking the  
creativity of young people, teaching discipline and persistence, 
and serving as an anchor keeping kids in school and out of gangs 
and destructive activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the Save the Music initiative credited music  
instruction with building ``brain power'' and an enhanced ability 
to master basic math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
	At concert's end, Clinton thanked the musicians and offered his  
respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect them so much I left my saxophone up at the White  
House,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lott Bill Would Extend Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is pushing a  
bill to extend expiring tax breaks. The bill puts the Mississippi 
Republican at odds with the Senate's chief tax writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's legislation, at an estimated cost of $33 billion over 10  
years, blends parts of similar bills approved by the Senate Finance 
Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. It would extend 
several expiring credits through 2001 and make the business 
research and development credit permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	In all but its first year, however, the bill would spend some of  
the projected non-Social Security budget surplus. President Clinton 
has threatened to veto the five-year, $23.2 billion House version 
for the same reason; the $8.5 billion Finance Committee measure is 
fully paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said ``there  
was significant opposition'' from Republicans and Democrats to an 
earlier version of his bill that would have made the R&AMP;D credit 
permanent and would have spent non-Social Security surplus money. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final days of the session, when time is short, we will  
need a consensus package,'' Roth said Friday. ``I believe the 
Finance Committee bill has the best chance of obtaining that 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said the majority  
leader's bill is more straightforward than other versions and 
achieves the goal of removing expiring tax credits from the 
congressional agenda during the 2000 election year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to not have to come back and do all of this again  
next year,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also would drop several provisions in the other bills.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, he would not extend energy-tax credits, including  
those for wind-produced electricity or those for power produced 
with chicken manure. The first is a priority for Midwestern 
lawmakers, while the second is sought by Roth, whose home state of 
Delaware is prime poultry country. 
</P>
<P>
	While the R&AMP;D credit would be made permanent in Lott's bill,  
companies could not claim it until Sept. 30, 2000, to remove it 
from the tight fiscal 2000 budget. The credit, which expired on 
June 30, is prized by the high-tech industry and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would ensure that millions of individual taxpayers  
do not run afoul of the complex alternative minimum tax, or AMT, by 
claiming numerous personal credits. Those credits would be exempted 
from AMT consideration through Dec. 31, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would make the AMT fix permanent, while the  
Finance Committee version applies to the 1999 and 2000 tax years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences between the bills, congressional leaders  
of both parties and Clinton say a compromise on extension of the 
expiring credits will be reached by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have an agreement ... so we don't have to go to  
conference forever to get it done,'' said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. A conference committee works out differences 
between House and Senate bills on the same subject.

<HEADLINE> Flooded N.C. Town Won't Back Buyout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Officials in this town made  
uninhabitable by floodwaters are refusing to allow residents to ask 
the government to buy their homes, which are located in a flood 
plain. 
</P>
<P>
	Any North Carolina homeowner or business in an area prone to  
repeated flooding may be eligible for the buyouts, which are funded 
jointly by the federal and state government. But the local 
government must first ask the state for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some of Princeville's 2,100 residents want to talk  
about buyouts, Mayor Delia Perkins said the Town Council had not 
discussed them and would not do so in the foreseeable future. Town 
officials have focused on rebuilding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had other major things to worry about, rather than  
having to worry about buyouts,'' Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeville became a soggy ghost town last month after 20 inches  
of rain following Hurricane Floyd submerged the town under 15 feet 
of water. The damage was so extensive that Princeville officials 
have indicated it will be at least next year before the town will 
be fit for occupancy again. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the state, homeowners hoping to move from flood-prone  
areas began signing up for buyouts as soon as the rain stopped. But 
Perkins had asked government disaster officials not to talk about 
the program with her constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't understand it, and anything that you don't  
understand, you fear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But residents found out about the program as nearby Tarboro and  
Rocky Mount began working on their own buyout applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Few of the town's property owners have flood insurance, and some  
want their town leaders to at least discuss the possibility for a 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettie Sherrod, a longtime Princeville resident, criticized the  
Town Council's unwillingness to open all options to its 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad that a town would try to control their people like  
that,'' she said. ``Every avenue has to be open to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners approved for buyouts are paid what the government  
estimates the homes were worth before they were flooded. Buildings 
are demolished, and nothing else may be built on the land. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Princeville sits in the flood plain. If many buyouts were  
approved, the town's inventory of taxable property would be hit 
hard and town revenue would drop. 
</P>
<P>
	But Perkins said the loss of taxable property was not her reason  
for refusing to consider a buyout application. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they will not bypass Princeville's local  
officials and accept buyout applications on their own. The state 
office doesn't want to get in the middle of disputes between local 
governments and their residents, said Gavin Smith, assistant 
director of the state's hazard mitigation office. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I think it's best to say that we really would  
like the town leadership to work with their citizens to reach a 
decision on how they want to proceed,'' Smith said. ``We will not 
tell communities what they should or should not do.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Judge Accused of Heroin Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A judge facing re-election next month was  
accused of shooting heroin in her chambers and dismissing charges 
against her dealer in exchange for drugs, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Justice Gigi Sullivan was stripped of her duties after  
charges were announced Friday. She faces arraignment Monday and 
will remain on the Nov. 2 ballot for now, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sullivan, 38, shot heroin, snorted cocaine and misused  
prescription drugs before presiding over cases, state Attorney 
General Mike Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	She is accused of accepting drugs in exchange for dismissing  
charges against her supplier, Donald Geraci, a used car dealer and 
former restaurateur, and other dealers in a drug ring he led, 
Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sullivan also tipped off Geraci when police had warrants for  
his arrest and when they planned to search his home and restaurant, 
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Patrick Thomassey, said Ms. Sullivan had a  
prescription drug problem after an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``She managed to keep a handle on that, with help, but  
apparently something happened and she ended up in this position,'' 
he said. ``These are only allegations. She maintains her 
innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Democrat, Ms. Sullivan Republican opponent, David Sosovicka,  
had little comment, saying she is ``presumed innocent until proven 
guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the felonies Ms. Sullivan faces are possession of heroin  
and cocaine, kiting a $2,000 check, accepting bribes and 
burglarizing Geraci's used car lot. 
</P>
<P>
	District justices in Pennsylvania hold preliminary hearings and  
set initial bail for criminal offenses. They rule on minor crimes 
and traffic tickets and can issue protection-from-abuse orders. 
Magistrates also rule on civil matters up to $8,000, can perform 
weddings and decide landlord-tenant disputes.

<HEADLINE>  Jarrett's Finishes Have Him Confused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett has this problem at North  
Carolina Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems like all he can do is finish second.  
</P>
<P>
	Six times in the last seven races on the 1.017-mile oval,  
Jarrett has been the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confusing situation for the second-generation NASCAR  
star, who is on the verge of winning his first Winston Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll continue the streak that we've had,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, thinking about that, he shook his head and added,  
``Actually, I don't want to continue that streak. But, if we have 
to take second, I will. We'd like to get into victory lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he keeps coming in second on a track where he has yet  
to win, Jarrett scratched his head and said, ``It's just that 
somebody always seems to be faster at the end of this race than 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's led the most laps and looked ready to win. And there also  
have been times when his Ford wasn't the second-best car at The 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case eight months ago, and it made no difference.  
</P>
<P>
	``We finished second somehow,'' Jarrett said. ``We just managed  
to do things right at the end and got into second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost to a lot of good race cars and drivers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett goes into Sunday's Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 with  
a 246-point lead over Bobby Labonte and a 319-point edge Mark 
Martin -- the only drivers with any realistic chance to catch him in 
the final four races of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	All Jarrett needs to do is finish 13th or better in each race to  
clinch the championship, no matter what Labonte and Martin do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still plan on being aggressive Sunday,'' Jarrett said. ``We  
know the best way for us not to lose any points is to win the race, 
and that's what we've come to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won the spring race here, will start from the pole,  
with Jarrett third and Labonte fifth in the 43-car lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire wear probably will determine the winner of Sunday's 393-lap  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if your car feels good on new tires, you just can't go as  
hard as you would like,'' Jarrett said. ``You just aren't going to 
have anything left at the end of that run. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I think the last 40 laps of a run are the most  
important. That's when you can make up the most time. What we do is 
work a lot with shock and spring combinations here to try to allow 
ourselves to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin noted that the asphalt pavement is just about worn out.  
</P>
<P>
	``What the pavement does to the tires makes them get real slick  
in the race, and that's not always my forte,'' Martin said. ``The 
only way I know how to go fast is to give it gas, and when I do 
that, my tires spin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darlington is the same kind of track, and we've had real good  
luck and a good record and Darlington and here. But I'd have to say 
one thing about the race track that's hard for me is the fact that 
it just eats the tires alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who leads the series with seven victories this  
season, also figures to be a factor on a track where he has won 
three of the last five races -- including this event last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	With new crew chief Brian Whitesell, Gordon has won two of the  
last three races and has moved to fourth in the standings -- 
although he trails third-place Martin by 115 points and is just 
nine ahead of sensational rookie Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to focus on winning races and seeing how far up  
in the points we can get before this year is out,'' said Gordon a 
three-time Winston Cup champ. ``We're going through what we're 
going to need in the offseason and 2000 to get ready for the new 
Monte Carlo and be back in action as a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to win races. We'd love to have 10, but we'd have to  
win three of the last four races to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Games Going Later and Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- For once, 13-year-old Brett Poythress won't have  
to wait until homeroom at school to find out how his beloved 
Atlanta Braves fared the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Poythress made the 6-hour trek from Richmond Hill  
on Saturday to be at Turner Field in person for Game 1 of the World 
Series between the Braves and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of kids who don't watch baseball as much because  
it gets so late,'' said Poythress, whose mother Diane won't let him 
stay up past 11 p.m., ``no matter how late the game is going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And lately for the Braves, they've been going pretty late.  
Atlanta has gone into extra innings three times during its playoff 
run, including a 15-inning Game 5 of the NL Championship Series 
against the New York Mets and an 11-inning clincher in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to be here well past 1 a.m.,'' said Doug Mabeus of  
Woodstock, who was accompanied by his 11-year-old son Austin at 
Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite efforts by baseball officials in the past two years to  
shorten games, they seem to stretch on during the postseason, as 
they start later to accommodate television broadcasts and the 
breaks between half-innings are about 30 seconds longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to figure out a way to keep it under three hours,''  
said Joe Farrauto, who brought his 12-year-old son Sam to Atlanta 
from Buffalo, N.Y. for Game 1. ``And there is no reason on a 
Saturday why they can't start in the afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, nine-inning games averaged 2:53, a  
seven-minute increase from the previous year and the second-longest 
ever, just a minute behind 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The postseason has produced even longer games -- an average of  
3:23, with the Braves averaging 3:25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even I can't last that long sometimes,'' said Mary Lynn  
Larussa of Birmingham, Ala., whose 7-year-old niece Addison Weaver 
has never seen the Braves in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``She probably won't be able to stay awake, even if they don't  
go extra innings,'' Larussa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig vowed before the season started that  
games would be shorter. His motivation was the length of games 
during the 1997 World Series between Florida and Cleveland. The 
average time was 3:31, and Game 3 lasted 4:12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves and the Yankees hooked up for the longest game in  
World Series history in 1996, with the Yankees beating Atlanta 8-6 
in 10 innings in Game 4, which took 4:17. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put the final out at somewhere around 12:30 a.m. on  
the East Coast in this year's opener, which started shortly after 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I got tickets for tonight, because there'd be no  
way we could do this on a school night,'' Mabeus said. ``He loves 
baseball, but I don't know for how much longer with as late as 
these games are getting.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Slams N.H. Income Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Republican Steve Forbes mixed  
presidential and state politics Saturday, warning that New 
Hampshire should stay away from implementing an income tax to help 
pay for schools. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's state Supreme Court threw the state into turmoil  
just over a week ago when it threw out a phased-in statewide 
property tax enacted in April and left intact the state's 
obligation to pay $825 million annually to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes told a crowd that his home state of New Jersey went  
through an education-funding crisis similar to what New Hampshire 
is going through now. He said state officials then promised an 
income tax would reduce property taxes, although that later proved 
not to be true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't fall into that same trap,'' he advised.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also spoke about his favorite issue: scrapping the  
complicated federal tax code and replacing it with a flat tax 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody understands the tax code. It's the black hole of the  
universe. It's not enough these days to pledge not to raise taxes, 
we need someone who will actually cut them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spoke in the front yard of former Manchester mayor Emile  
Beaulieu, who said the flat tax proposal is an important reason 
he's now behind Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing casual khakis and a green bomber jacket, Forbes and his  
wife, Sabina, posed before his speech with supporters in front of a 
backdrop of pumpkins, corn stalks and hay bales. His campaign 
handed out digital photographs to people as they left the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucille Power of Derry was impressed that Forbes let residents  
ask him questions. She's been turned off that Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush does not talk directly to people about policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been to see Bush a couple of times, and he doesn't take  
questions from people,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Penn St. 31, No. 16 Purdue 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Second-ranked Penn State converted  
three turnovers into 21 points and survived a 379-yard passing 
effort by Drew Brees to beat No. 16 Purdue 31-25 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) forced Brees into four incomplete  
passes in the final minute after he had moved the Boilermakers 
(5-3, 2-3) 58 yards to a first down at the 12 with 31 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees, who was 31-of-48, had his first down pass tipped at the  
line of scrimmage by cornerback Anthony King on a blitz. A pass to 
Randall Lane went incomplete on the next play and on third down he 
threw the ball out of the end zone to avoid a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees then threw past the outstretched arms of Chris Daniels,  
and Purdue was out of downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 315th for Penn State's Joe Paterno, moving  
him past Amos Alonzo Stagg into third place among major-college 
coaches and within eight of Bear Bryant's record total. It was the 
10th consecutive victory for Penn State, the second-longest winning 
streak among majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State got a touchdown from linebacker LaVar Arrington when  
he sacked Brees and forced a fumble. Arrington picked up the ball 
at the Purdue 2 and carried it into the end zone untouched. The 
Nittany Lions also scored a touchdown in the third quarter on a 
25-yard interception return by Courtney Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mistake by Purdue produced a 14-14 halftime tie. Antoine  
Neal was attempting to return a punt when he mishandled the ball 
and Mac Morrison recovered for Penn State at the Purdue 41. Two 
plays later, cornerback James Dunnigan was beaten by Eddie 
Drummond, who caught a 39-yard TD pass from Kevin Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and Chafie Fields hooked up for a 78-yard TD pass  
behind Dunnigan to put Penn State ahead for good 21-14 on the first 
play of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's interception with 10:19 left in the third quarter made  
it 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
	A 27-yard field goal by Travis Dorsch, who missed two attempts  
in the first half, made it 28-17 and the Boilermakers converted a 
Penn State mistake to get back into the game. Mike Rose recovered 
reserve quarterback Rashard Casey's fumble at the Penn State 26 and 
Purdue scored in three plays, the last a 4-yard pass from Brees to 
Lane. The same combo connected on a 2-point conversion pass with 
2:05 left in the third period and Penn State led only 28-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Forney scored the only points of the fourth quarter on a  
24-yard field goal with 8:01 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue had another scoring bid end on a fumble by Sedrick Brown,  
who lost the ball at the Penn State 42 when hit by King, and 
Anthony Adams recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became the first team to score a touchdown against the  
Nittany Lions in the first quarter by moving 80 yards in six plays 
to score on a 2-yard run by Brown. Bress completed a 28-yard pass 
to Larry Shyne and two for a combined 24 to Vinny Sutherland on the 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington had two sacks of Brees, who had been taken down only  
five times this season. The Lions had five sacks of Brees, whose 
223 yards passing in the first half was more than the average of 
188.7 Penn State had allowed in its first seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington hit Brees early in the second period and the ball  
popped loose. Arrington recovered at the Purdue 2 and went into the 
end zone for his second career TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees moved the Boilermakers 76 yards in six plays in the second  
quarter, putting Purdue ahead 14-7 on a 9-yard pass to Donald 
Winston. Brees was 4-of-4 for 58 yards on the drive, including a 
38-yarder to Chris Daniels on the play before the TD. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers missed a pair of scoring chances in the first  
half when Dorsch had a 40-yard field goal attempt fall short and a 
37-yard attempt blocked by Arrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue had won 10 straight at home and was 15-1 at Ross-Ade  
Stadium in three seasons. The only loss previous loss at home was 
42-17 to Penn State in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Cone, Millwood Face Off in Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood and David Cone have very different  
memories of the last time the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees 
met in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cone pitched the momentum shifting Game 3 against Atlanta  
in 1996, Millwood was struggling to stay awake in an Australian 
casino watching the games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they will oppose each other in Game 2 of this year's  
World Series, with Cone trying to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead 
following a 4-1 victory in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably the most exciting time of my baseball  
career up until now,'' said Millwood, who was pitching in the 
Australian winter league in 1996. ``I was able to make the All-Star 
team this year and that was a lot of fun. But that comes second 
fiddle to something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Series starts are nothing new for Cone, who made his first  
in 1992 for Toronto against Atlanta and will make his fifth Sunday. 
Three of his previous four have come against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always know they're going to be tight games,'' Cone said.  
``Because of Atlanta's pitching, the margin for error is very 
minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone's start against Atlanta in Game 3 in 1996 might have been  
his most memorable. The Braves won the first two games, outscoring 
New York 16-1 at Yankee Stadium, and headed home confident they 
would repeat as World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Cone held Atlanta to one run and four hits over six  
innings and the Yankees won 5-2. New York went on to win the next 
three games and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game turned the Series around and gave us credibility  
again,'' Cone said. ``At that point, down 2-0, the Braves were 
talking about their place in history and people were saying it was 
a complete mismatch. That got us back in the Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood was originally scheduled to start Game 3 on Tuesday in  
New York. But after Tom Glavine was scratched from his Game 1 start 
because of the flu, manager Bobby Cox moved Millwood to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem he had was selling two of his tickets to  
another player thinking he wasn't pitching,'' Cox said. ``Because 
of his family members, he had to get the two tickets back. That's 
the only problem he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood got his tickets back, but now he's looking for more.  
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone's got any, let me know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old right-hander has been Atlanta's most consistent  
starter this season on a staff filled with Cy Young Award winners. 
Millwood went 18-7 with a 2.68 ERA and led the majors with a .202 
batting average against. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood has been even better in his first postseason. He is 2-0  
with one save and a 2.38 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unfazed by the change and even thinks it might benefit  
him to pitch at home instead of at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really matter to me where I pitch, but if I had to  
pick, I'd much rather pitch at home,'' Millwood said. ``I think our 
field being a little bigger down the line frees you up to be able 
to do a little bit more with their lefties.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Newspaper Backs GOP Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a major blow to the Democratic  
frontrunner for mayor, The Philadelphia Inquirer has endorsed 
Republican challenger Sam Katz, who is trying to become the city's 
first GOP mayor in 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement, to appear in Sunday's paper, is another hit in  
the already foundering campaign of Democrat John F. Street, now 
neck and neck with Katz in the polls. The Inquirer last endorsed a 
Republican in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial board praised both Katz and Street saying, ``It's  
easy to imagine either man making a good mayor.'' But the board 
said the choice came down to whose style and strategy for improving 
the city would offer the most hope and reward in the next 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this pairing, only Sam Katz has a chance to surprise and  
soar, to inspire and innovate in the way a gamble named Ed Rendell 
once did for a desperate city,'' the editorial said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell is a popular mayor who is prevented by term limits from  
seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited Katz's education reform proposals and his  
support for school vouchers as worth trying; Street is opposed to 
vouchers. They also liked Katz's approach at lowering the city wage 
tax and streamlining city administration instead of Street's more 
cautious plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Street has been a member of City Council for 19 years and was  
considered a strong frontrunner with near incumbent status just six 
months ago. But throughout the fall campaign of the businessman 
Katz has gained on Street in polls, and observers now call the 
outcome a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz campaign manager Bob Barnett said of the endorsement: ``We  
think this could be very persuasive as people try to sort through 
10 months of information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street's campaign said the endorsement is not much of a  
hindrance nor a big influence on voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The editorial board will not be the ones knocking on doors  
asking for you to vote for Street,'' spokesman Ken Snyder said.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Earns $84 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Air Canada, which is fighting a takeover bid by  
Onex Corp., said Friday it earned $84 million in the third quarter 
in contrast to a loss of $41 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 figures were affected by a two-week pilots' strike that  
severely hindered service. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 amounted to 44 cents a  
share, compared with a loss of 22 cents in the third quarter last 
year, Air Canada announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $1.22 billion in the latest quarter from $1.0  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of this year, profit totaled $135  
million, up from $2.7 million the previous year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $3.28 billion from $3.0 billion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the first nine months of 1999, Air Canada has recorded its  
best ever operating income and highest operating margin since the 
airline was privatized in 1988,'' Air Canada president and chief 
executive officer Robert Milton said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings ``validate that Air Canada is well-positioned to  
take the lead role in the restructuring of Canada's aviation 
industry,'' Milton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada this week offered to buy back shares in order to  
block the Onex takeover bid, helped by major investments by global 
partners Lufthansa and United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock repurchase offered up to $540 million for 35 percent  
of the company's shares, which would give Air Canada a large enough 
voting bloc to defeat the Onex bid at a shareholder meeting Nov. 8 
in Montreal. To win approval, Onex needs a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has also offered to buy Canadian Airlines and run it  
as a separate company, and start a discount regional airline based 
in eastern Ontario as part of a restructuring plan for Canada's air 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Air Canada rose 12 1/2 cents to $6.50 in trading Friday  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Crimea Natural Gas Pipeline Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian authorities on Saturday formally  
opened a pipeline providing natural gas to southeastern Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
	President Leonid Kuchma, who was visiting the Black Sea  
peninsula on an electoral trip, lit a torch in the town of Kerch, 
symbolizing the completion of the 14-month project. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an ordinary event for the peninsula's residents,''  
he said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The 146-mile pipeline cost the equivalent of $60 million to  
build. It links the Crimean cities of Dzhankoi, Feodosia and Kerch, 
improving natural gas supplies to about 30 percent of the 
peninsula's populace. Crimea's 2.6 million residents long have 
coped with energy and hot water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline was planned years ago, but its construction was  
frozen in 1995 due to a lack of funds.

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Joao Cabral de Melo Neto, a  
diplomat whose epic poetry chronicled life in Brazil's arid 
outback, died on Oct. 9. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Recife, 1,200 miles northeast of Rio, Melo Neto served  
as Brazil's ambassador in Spain and Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The outback where Neto was born was the theme of much of his  
poetry, especially in the 1954 epic ``Morte e Vida Severina,'' or 
``Life and Death Severina,'' a tale of a poor woman from the 
outback. 
</P>
<P>
	The epic is considered a classic of Brazilian literature and  
became an award-winning television musical.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows McCain Gaining on Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- A new poll suggests Republican presidential  
candidate John McCain is gaining on George W. Bush in the New 
Hampshire primary campaign. It also shows Bill Bradley and Al Gore 
in a virtual tie in New Hampshire's Democratic race. 
</P>
<P>
	Registered Republicans favored Bush, the governor of Texas, 39  
percent to 27 percent over McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona. A 
similar poll in August had Bush in the lead 45 percent to 10 
percent. The other Republican presidential candidates are in single 
digits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, what we are doing is working, which is a few brief  
remarks and then questions,'' McCain said Saturday in Hanover. 
``It's paying off, and straight talk works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted for the Concord Monitor by polling firm  
Research 2000 Wednesday and Thursday, after Elizabeth Dole dropped 
out of the race. The pollsters questioned 602 registered voters by 
telephone, and the poll had a margin of error of four percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of Democrats said they favored Bradley, against 37  
percent who said they favored Gore, a statistical tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Steve Forbes was favored by 9 percent, and Patrick  
Buchanan by 5 percent. Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer and Orrin Hatch each 
was favored by 1 percent. Seventeen percent of the Republicans 
questioned said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, 23 percent said they still hadn't decided on a  
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In potential general election match-ups, Bush beat Gore 50  
percent to 40 percent, but against Bradley, the outcome is a 
virtual tie, Bush 45 percent, Bradley 44 percent.

<HEADLINE> No Contest in Tyson Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It was another Mike Tyson fiasco -- a punch to  
the jaw after the bell that knocked down Orlin Norris, who claimed 
he couldn't continue because of a sprained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	After several minutes of chaos following the punch, which ended  
the first round of the scheduled 10-rounder, the fight was called a 
no contest to a chorus of boos and epithets Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't want to fight anymore,'' the angry Tyson said.  
``I'm tired of this. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw it. How I hit him in the jaw and he hurt his leg?  
Anyone who's competitive, even if he's got a fractured leg, would 
get back up and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said he could have quit when knocked out by Buster Douglas  
in the 10th round in 1990 and stopped by Evander Holyfield in the 
11th round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have quit in there but I took my beating like a man,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre fight came almost two years and four months after  
Tyson was disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in the 
same MGM Grand Garden ring. 
</P>
<P>
	A videotape of the end of the fight showed that Norris' knee  
twisted under him when he fell to the canvas from Tyson's left. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just hit me after the bell,'' Norris said. ``I just went  
down the wrong way on my right knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tyson said: ``He walked back to his corner. That shows you  
how twisted his knee was. He must have hurt it getting on the 
stool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Flip Homansky examined Norris. ``He said his knee was  
swollen. It was definitely hurt,'' said Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman 
of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought the blow was intentional, Ghanem said,  
``That's what we will have to decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said the fight will be reviewed on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ratner, the commission's executive director, said that  
referee Richard Steele thought the punch was definitely after the 
bell, ``but he didn't believe it was on purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's $8.7 million purse was being held.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're probably going to take it like they did before,''  
Tyson said. He was fined $3 million when his license was revoked 
following his suspension for biting Holyfield on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said Norris would get his money. ``There is no  
suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris was supposed to get $800,00, but he was paid only a  
little more than $200,000 because of a court order involving a 
lawsuit against him, his manager's share and an IRS lien. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round was marked by a lot of mauling -- it was Tyson's  
first fight since he knocked out Francois Botha on Jan. 16, and it 
was only Norris' second fight in 14 1/2 months. Tyson did land a 
couple of rights to the head, Norris got in a couple of punches, 
and then the bell rang -- and Tyson decked him with a left to the 
jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson went to a neutral corner, followed by Steele, who lectured  
him. Steele then turned and signaled he was penalizing Tyson two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	While this was happening, Norris got up and walked slowly to his  
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele then conferred with Ratner, and Homansky was summoned  
into the ring to examine Norris. Homansky then went to speak with 
the commissioners, and the no contest ruling was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is supposed to fight Shannon Briggs, who was at ringside,  
on Feb. 26 in Madison Square Garden. How that fight will be 
affected will not be known until after the commission meets. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield, the commission  
revoked his license and it was a little more than a year before it 
was restored. Tyson left the ring in a rage that night, and bedlam 
broke out in the MGM Grand casino afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Tyson wore a look of disgust as he left the ring.  
</P>
<P>
	As for the fans, they were just content to boo and curse when  
Tyson left. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris also was booed when he left the ring wearing an ice bag  
on his knee, and was taken to Valley Hospital on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Tyson, who weighed 280 pounds when released from  
a Maryland jail on May 28, officially weighed 223 pounds and looked 
a little soft upon entering the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	But how his condition might have affected his performance will  
never be known. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Norris weighed 218 pounds for a fight he said he  
waited 10 years to have. 
</P>
<P>
	It had to be a very unsatisfactory ending for Norris, who did  
not get a win and almost certainly won't get another shot at Tyson.

	Tyson, an undisputed heavyweight champion in the late 1980s, was  
fighting for only the eighth time in eight years. His career was 
interrupted by a three-year prison term in Indiana on a rape 
conviction, and a 3 1/2-year jail term in Maryland for assaulting two 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	His record remains 46-3 with 40 knockouts. Norris, a former  
cruiserweight champion has a 50-5 record with 27 knockouts.

<P>
	Before the fight, Tyson said he might be rusty, but ``I will  
look sensational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was not sensational, but once again he was controversial.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush, Gore Leading Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just over a year before the election, Democrat  
Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush hold strong leads nationally 
in the races for their parties' nomination, a poll released 
Saturday finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Newsweek poll suggested former Sen. Bill Bradley  
would receive 26 percent of the votes of registered Democrats and 
those who lean toward voting for a Democrat, while the vice 
president would get 49 percent. Those numbers are statistically 
unchanged from a similar Newsweek poll in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said Bush, the Texas governor, would win 57 percent  
of the votes of registered Republicans and those who lean toward 
voting for a Republican. Next was Sen. John McCain of Arizona, with 
12 percent, publisher Steve Forbes with 6 percent, Pat Buchanan and 
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah each with 4 percent, and Gary Bauer with 3 
percent. Buchanan has indicated he will leave the Republican Party 
to run as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gore were to face Bush in the general election next year,  
Bush would defeat Gore by a 49-40 margin, the poll said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Bradley were to face Bush, Bush would win 47 percent and  
Bradley 42 percent, a slight edge for Bush, according to the 
survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted by Princeton Research Associates, who  
interviewed 755 adults on Thursday and Friday, after Elizabeth 
Dole's withdrawal Wednesday from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a new poll in New Hampshire said registered  
Republicans in the state favor Bush 39 percent to 27 percent over 
McCain. That was an improvement for McCain compared with a similar 
poll in August that had Bush in the lead 45 percent to 10 percent. 
The New Hampshire poll put other Republican presidential candidates 
in single digits in the critical primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted for the Concord Monitor by polling firm  
Research 2000 on Wednesday and Thursday. The poll questioned 602 
registered voters were by telephone. The poll had a margin of error 
of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Republicans on  
Saturday to improve upon their pledges that they would avoid using 
Social Security surpluses to pay for other budget needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can do better,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio  
address, adding that he will submit legislation this week that 
would enact part of a Social Security rescue plan he outlined early 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits  
any government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay 
off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first big step toward truly saving Social  
Security. It will take the trust fund out beyond the life span of 
the baby boom generation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans previously have rejected the proposal -- first  
mentioned in the president's State of the Union Address -- and 
proclaimed any further discussion of it dead for the year. But John 
Feehrey, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said 
GOP leaders would have another look at Clinton's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, both political parties have used Social Security's  
surpluses to cover spending without diminishing the system's 
benefits. In return, the program gets Treasury bonds to save for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next year's elections, each party is eager to  
cast itself as a defender of the massive pension program for the 
elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have pledged that henceforth,  
they will only spend Social Security surpluses to reduce government 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., used the weekly Republican radio  
address to reiterate the GOP's position on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``surplus must be off limits,'' he said. ``This money must  
not be used to pay for other government spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sparing between Republican lawmakers and the White House over  
fiscal 2000 budget priorities, however, has sparked accusations 
from each side that the other is cheating on that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent television ads and news conferences, Republicans have  
touted their support for a Social Security ``lockbox'' that would 
wall off the program's surpluses. At the same time, they accuse 
Democrats of supporting spending proposals that would eat up the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it happens, neither claim is true,'' Clinton said Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that while the Republican lockbox designates Social  
Security surpluses for debt reduction, it does not specify what 
would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their plan doesn't extend the solvency of Social Security by a  
single day,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying down the debt presumably would allow the government to  
save billions it would otherwise have to pay in interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants use those savings -- $544 billion that  
would accrue between 2011 and 2015 in the form of income tax 
surpluses, according to White House estimates -- to help pay Social 
Security benefits after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that would forestall the date, from 2034 to 2050, that  
the retirement program, burdened by that massive generation, is 
expected to run short of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who want to see tax cuts in coming years, have  
objected to the fact that Clinton's plan would give Social 
Security, which has traditionally been financed with a separate 
payroll tax, a claim on other tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Many GOP lawmakers would prefer to try to raise extra money for  
retirement benefits by letting Americans invest some Social 
Security taxes in individual stock market accounts.

<P>
	PORTLAND, Tenn. (AP) -- Seven people, including five teen-agers,  
died in a fiery head-on collision, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nissan Stanza filled with the five youths may have been  
speeding Friday when it rounded a curve on Highway 52 west of 
Portland and struck a Chevrolet Blazer, state trooper Gary 
Holpsford told Nashville's WKRN-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazer burst into flames and killed the couple inside:  
Stephen L. Carney, 43, and his wife Donna E. Carney, 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five teens killed were siblings. They were  
identified as James H. Brassell, 16; Alicia D. Brassell, 13 and 
Redona Tiffany Brassell, 17. Also killed were 19-year-old Joe 
Farquhar, and Jamie Marie Green, 16.

<HEADLINE> Glavine Misses Game 1 With Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Tom Glavine, who caught the flu from his family,  
was replaced by Greg Maddux as the Atlanta Braves' starter against 
the New York Yankees on Saturday night in Game 1 of the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really sick, dehydrated,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said  
before the game. ``He's got some fluids in him, I guess. He won't 
be here at all tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, who last pitched in Game 3 of the NL Championship  
Series on Oct. 15, would have been pitching on seven days' rest, 
while Maddux, who started Game 5 last Sunday, faced the Yankees on 
five days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maddux took a shutout into the eighth inning, he was the  
loser in Atlanta's 4-1 defeat, allowing all four runs -- but just 
two earned -- and five hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made no difference,'' he said of the short notice.  
``Actually, I was glad. I didn't want to sit around doing 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine called Braves third-base coach Ned Yost on Friday night  
to tell him he was too sick to pitch and asked for the manager's 
telephone number at his farm house. He then spoke with Cox around 
11:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux seemed at ease before the game, working out in the  
outfield. He walked into the Braves dugout about two hours before 
the game and Cox introduced him to Hall of Famer Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood, originally slated to start Game 3 Tuesday at  
Yankee Stadium, replaced Maddux as Sunday night's starter against 
David Cone in Game 2. Millwood was about to sell his Game 2 tickets 
but got them back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I need to buy a few more,'' he said. ``So if anybody's  
got any, let me know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine has never been on the disabled list and has made 33 or  
more starts in four consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tommy,'' Cox said, ``has pitched at times with a bad arm  
through his career, shoulder, elbow, two broken ribs, two bad 
knees, a bad ankle, an infected toe and he's never missed a start 
that I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said Glavine probably would start Game 3 against Andy  
Pettitte, and John Smoltz would go in Game 4 against Roger Clemens. 
If Glavine still feels weak, he could flip flop with Smoltz and 
start the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine's wife had the flu starting last weekend in New York,  
and the bug was passed on to his kids and parents before he caught 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely nothing you can do to prevent it, except  
keep Tommy home for a day or two and hope nobody else gets it,'' 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Glavine's illness would have caused panic on most other  
teams, the Braves have four starters who would be aces if they 
pitched for other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux entered with a 2-2 World Series record, splitting  
decisions against Cleveland in 1995 and the Yankees in 1996, 
including a loss in New York's Game 6 clincher. He pitched a 
two-hit shutout to beat the Indians in the '95 opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not throw yesterday, except in the outfield, a little  
catch,'' Cox said. ``He threw a lot the day before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux started against the Yankees in a regular-season  
interleague game July 16 at New York and was chased after 3 1-3 
innings, allowing five runs and nine hits. The Braves rallied to 
win 10-7 on Andruw Jones' three-run homer off Mariano Rivera with 
two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Maddux's quickest unscheduled exit since June 17, 1996,  
when he gave up seven runs and 11 hits in 3 1-3 innings at 
Colorado's Coors Field. He pitched two shutout innings at Montreal 
on Sept. 28, 1996, then left as the Braves set up their rotation 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last regular-season start this year, he lasted three-plus  
innings against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	While he is 221-126 in his career during the regular season,  
including a 19-9 record this year, is just 10-10 in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because it's the World Series doesn't mean people aren't  
allowed to get sick,'' said Yankees manager Joe Torre, who learned 
of the switch about five hours before game time. ``I hadn't really 
made a lineup out anyway to that point.''

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Host School Music Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A concert with a purpose brought stars of  
rock, soul, blues and country music to a giant tent on the White 
House lawn Saturday to support the cause of bringing music back to 
cash-starved schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was a testimonial to the power of music to transform  
young lives and President Clinton, remembering his own music 
teachers, said, ``I don't think I would have become president if it 
hadn't been for school music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the president said: ``I learned that music was more  
than scales and keys or how to make sure I was always in tune. 
Music taught me how to mix practice and patience with creativity. 
Music taught me how to be both an individual performer and a good 
member of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the lesson for everyone, he said, is that ``we are stronger  
when we are playing in harmony based on our common humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said those gathered under the  
tent included educators, children's music advocates, some of the 
nation's best performing artists ``and people like me who never 
learned to carry a tune but who appreciate people who do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, she said, is to ``to put music back in our schools and  
back in our children's education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more than two-hour concert, a reprise of popular hits as the  
20th century ends, was performed by a roster of the stars of 
American music. 
</P>
<P>
	They included: Eric Clapton, Lenny Kravitz, Sheryl Crow, B.B.  
King, Garth Brooks, Gloria Estefan, John Fogerty, Al Green, and 
John Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars who did the introducing involved another roster of  
stars: Gwyneth Paltrow, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Keri Russell, 
Angela Bassett, Sarah Jessica Parker, Calista Flockhart and Robert 
de Niro. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Save the Music'' concert was sponsored by the VH1 cable  
music channel and the National Endowment for the Arts to spark 
interest in raising money to buy instruments and sponsor music 
education in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors said that only a quarter of the nation's eight  
graders are able to take part in instrumental music programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady paid tribute to the teachers who ``are bringing  
the power of music into our children's lives'' and the young people 
``who are playing their hearts out in schools across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing music, she said, changes lives, by sparking the  
creativity of young people, teaching discipline and persistence, 
and serving as an anchor keeping kids in school and out of gangs 
and destructive activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the Save the Music initiative credited music  
instruction with building ``brain power'' and an enhanced ability 
to master basic math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
	At concert's end, Clinton thanked the musicians and offered his  
respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect them so much I left my saxophone up at the White  
House,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  America's Cup Races Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Yachts crunching together and  
cracking apart today led to the postponement of the last races of 
the first round-robin in the America's Cup challenger series. 
</P>
<P>
	As other challengers fought aggressively -- and expensively -- to  
make up ground, Italy's Prada extended its unbeaten run by 
defeating the last of the American favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	After being postponed for almost two hours because of dead calm  
on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf, racing began in near-perfect conditions 
of around 10 knots on wind and as dolphins chased at least one 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-spending Italian team beat New York's Young America to  
become the only unbeaten syndicate in the first round-robin of the 
regatta to decide who will take on defender New Zealand for 
sailing's most prized trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada defeated San Francisco's AmericaOne on Friday, and faces  
only the less-favored Abracadabra from Hawaii and the French 
challenge in the remaining races. 
</P>
<P>
	The only losses for AmericaOne and Young America have been at  
the hands of the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
	The two American boats were due to battle for second place on  
Sunday, the last day of racing scheduled for the first round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	But AmericaOne asked officials to delay further races until it  
could make repairs after America's Cup veteran Dennis Conner's boat 
Stars and Stripes clipped AmericaOne's stern less then 2 minutes 
before the start of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Swiss team Fast 2000 also asked for a delay after  
a bulkhead tore loose from the hull just minutes into their race 
against the French team. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials late Saturday granted the requests and canceled  
further racing until Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon was docked 1/2 of one point for colliding with the  
Spanish team. The Japanese boat won the race, but had a piece of 
its bow torn away. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada defeated Young America despite skipper Ed Baird's boat  
being just quicker over the start line, and extending its lead on 
the first leg by taking better wind on the right side of the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada matched Young America for speed downwind.  
</P>
<P>
	But as Young America was leading going into the last leg, it  
made a mistake and lost control its spinnaker. Prada were able to 
pass the American boat and win by 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast 2000 dropped out of its morning race after crew heard a  
noise just after the start and found a bulkhead had separated from 
the hull. The French team and San Francisco's America True had wins 
by default. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Japan-Spain race, Nippon was penalized for the collision,  
but this was canceled by a penalty to Spain when its trail boat 
picked up a crew member who went overboard and put him back on the 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning races, the Spanish Challenge defeated Stars and  
Stripes by 1 minute, 8 seconds; America True defeated Young 
Australia by 1:16; and AmericaOne defeated Abracadabra by 1:18. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, AmericaOne defeated Stars and Stripes by 1:00;  
Young America defeated Young Australia by 2:49; Nippon defeated the 
Spanish challenge by :59; and Abracadabra defeated the French 
challenge by :36. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> USOC Creates Drug-Testing Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee will  
soon look more like U.S. Olympics Inc., taking on a corporate 
structure and jettisoning a relic of the not-so-old days when it 
had the appearance of a rich, white men's club. 
</P>
<P>
	The new USOC, previewed to the board of directors Saturday and  
subject to final approval in February, would shake up the 
leadership, redefine the organization's mission, streamline 
decision-making, build diversity and improve relationships with the 
sports and athletes the USOC serves. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes have to take place,'' USOC executive director  
Dick Schultz told the board. ``It doesn't have to be done 
overnight, but it has to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board voted unanimously to endorse in principle the  
structural changes, and also voted unanimously to support the 
creation of an independent drug-testing agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In voting for the United States' bid city for the 2007 Pan  
American Games, the board chose San Antonio over the Raleigh-Durham 
area of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they had to make a choice on who might win the  
international bid, and we had a lot going for us with 62 percent of 
our people being Hispanic,'' said Susan Blackwood, head of the San 
Antonio bid effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh mayor Tom Fetzer had tears in his eyes as he heard the  
vote go against his group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crushing disappointment,'' Fetzer said. ``You put two  
years of your life into something. ... But we did the best we could 
and we came in second, and there's no shame in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the 1960s and early '70s, when the USOC was a chummy  
gathering of a couple dozen white guys more interested in securing 
tickets and perks than in helping athletes, volunteer leaders and a 
loose structure sufficed. It was a time of amateurism on the field 
and in the board room. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the USOC was restructured in the late '70s and moved  
to Colorado Springs, it remained a small, volunteer endeavor with 
20 to 25 employees and a budget under $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the USOC is a $125 million a year operation with 550  
employees and more than 20 committees that have to be coordinated. 
The Olympics have grown explosively, professionals can play in the 
games, and the money at stake is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal in Salt Lake City didn't spark the changes  
being proposed -- the need for change was recognized a year earlier 
-- but the new leadership structure, along with a new written code 
of conduct, may help the USOC avoid another scandal in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a paid staff dealing with issues on an ongoing  
basis,'' USOC president William J. Hybl said. ``We have a great set 
of volunteers, and I think we're in great shape as far as policy 
goes. But we need to define very clearly that the staff is 
implementing that policy. What is being proposed is the best 
corporate structure in terms of what we are doing and how we can do 
it in the years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the USOC now functions as a chief executive  
officer, responsible for overall leadership, presiding at board and 
executive committee meetings, and appointing committee members and 
chairs. He serves as a volunteer for one four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new USOC, that voluntary person's title would shift to  
chairman and president, and he or she would appoint only oversight 
and governance committee members and chairs while serving for up to 
three four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than developing the USOC's mission, goals and strategy  
and making some operating decisions, the volunteer leader would 
receive strategy from the CEO and monitor operating performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-paid leader holding the title CEO and Secretary General  
would become the most powerful voice in the USOC, taking over the 
position now held by the executive director. A search for CEO 
candidates is already under way, and one could be named as early as 
February if the board approves the constitutional changes needed to 
implement the new structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The CEO would become a voting member of the board and the  
executive committee, would appoint operating committees and 
nominate their members. He or she would manage all staff functions 
and investment strategies, oversee and coordinate revenues, submit 
the budget and oversee spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, proposed by consultants at McKinsey and Company,  
also would revamp the role of the executive committee, streamlining 
it and shifting it from operational duties to the setting of policy 
guidelines and general oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors also would have a somewhat different  
agenda, making it more subservient to the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The point of all the changes -- and there are many others that  
affect the USOC from top to bottom -- is to allow the USOC to 
function more efficiently and to respond to changes more 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Epitomizing that goal is a simple new mission statement:  
</P>
<P>
	``Lead the world's best national Olympic committee: Help U.S.  
Olympic athletes achieve sustained competitive excellence while 
inspiring all Americans and preserving the Olympic ideal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas hex continues over Nebraska.  
</P>
<P>
	Major Applewhite threw for two second-half touchdowns as No. 18  
Texas rallied for a 24-20 victory Saturday over No. 3 Nebraska, 
seriously damaging the Cornhuskers' bid for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has won three straight over Nebraska since the merger of  
the Big Eight and Southwest conferences before the 1996 season. 
Texas (6-2, 3-1 Big 12) is the only team to beat Nebraska (6-1, 
3-1) three times in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska led 20-17 after quarterback Eric Crouch's 9-yard TD run  
with 7:52 left to play before Applewhite drove Texas 60 yards on 
four plays for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting wideout Ryan Nunez with a 39-yard pass to the  
Nebraska 21, Applewhite found tight end Mike Jones in the flat. 
Jones broke three tackles, including one at the goal line, in 
completing a 17-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite was 9-of-21 for 47 yards in the first half as  
Nebraska built a 13-3 lead. He was 8-of-9 in the second half for 
166 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His 13-yard strike to Kwame Cavil in the third quarter gave  
Texas its first lead at 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Hodges Mitchell had 20 carries for 83 yards and three  
receptions for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Alexander led the Cornhuskers with 136 yards on 21 carries.  
Crouch passed for 204 yards but was held to 35 yards rushing on 17 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, which outgained Texas 429-275, dropped a game behind  
undefeated Kansas State in the race for the North Division title 
and a berth in the Big 12 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska players had talked all week about beating Texas and  
avenging last year's 20-16 loss that ended the Huskers' 47-game 
home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska appeared to take control early, scoring on three  
consecutive possessions for a 13-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Brown kicked field goals of 22 and 32 yards and running  
back Correll Buckhalter broke a tackle and a carried a Texas 
defender into the end zone on a 5-yard TD run with 45 seconds left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	With Texas forced to punt into a stiff wind, two of the  
Cornhuskers' scoring drives started at the Longhorns' 17 and 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, which drove 46 yards on its first possession to set up a  
field goal attempt that bounced off the left upright, managed just 
five first downs in the first half. After the first drive, Nebraska 
held Texas to three-and-out on the next five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas defense kept it close by forcing three Nebraska  
turnovers on fumbles, two by Crouch and one by Buckhalter at the 
Texas 1 that cost the Huskers a fourth-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas started the second half with the wind at its back. After a  
short Nebraska punt Texas started its first drive at the 
Cornhuskers 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Robertson pulled Texas within 13-10 four plays later on a  
1-yard run, his sixth touchdown this season on just 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jones' touchdown, Nebraska drove to the Texas 38 on its  
final possession but turned the ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas was able to run out the final 2:15 because the Huskers had  
already used all their timeouts.

<HEADLINE> USOC Seeks To Revamp Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee will  
soon look more like U.S. Olympics Inc., taking on a corporate 
structure and jettisoning a relic of the not-so-old days when it 
had the appearance of a rich, white men's club. 
</P>
<P>
	The new USOC, previewed to the board of directors Saturday and  
subject to final approval in February, would shake up the 
leadership, redefine the organization's mission, streamline 
decision-making, build diversity and improve relationships with the 
sports and athletes the USOC serves. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes have to take place,'' USOC executive director  
Dick Schultz told the board. ``It doesn't have to be done 
overnight, but it has to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the 1960s and early '70s, when the USOC was a chummy  
gathering of a couple dozen white guys more interested in securing 
tickets and perks than in helping athletes, volunteer leaders and a 
loose structure sufficed. It was a time of amateurism on the field 
and in the board room. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the USOC was restructured in the late '70s and moved  
to Colorado Springs, it remained a small, volunteer endeavor with 
20 to 25 employees and a budget under $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the USOC is a $125 million a year operation with 550  
employees and more than 20 committees that have to be coordinated. 
The Olympics have grown explosively, professionals can play in the 
games, and the money at stake is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal in Salt Lake City didn't spark the changes  
being proposed -- the need for change was recognized a year earlier 
-- but the new leadership structure, along with a new written code 
of conduct, may help the USOC avoid another scandal in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a paid staff dealing with issues on an ongoing  
basis,'' USOC president William J. Hybl said. ``We have a great set 
of volunteers, and I think we're in great shape as far as policy 
goes. But we need to define very clearly that the staff is 
implementing that policy. What is being proposed is the best 
corporate structure in terms of what we are doing and how we can do 
it in the years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the USOC now functions as a chief executive  
officer, responsible for overall leadership, presiding at board and 
executive committee meetings, and appointing committee members and 
chairs. He serves as a volunteer for one four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new USOC, that voluntary person's title would shift to  
chairman and president, and he or she would appoint only oversight 
and governance committee members and chairs while serving for up to 
three four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than developing the USOC's mission, goals and strategy  
and making some operating decisions, the volunteer leader would 
receive strategy from the CEO and monitor operating performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-paid leader holding the title CEO and Secretary General  
would become the most powerful voice in the USOC, taking over the 
position now held by the executive director. A search for CEO 
candidates is already under way, and one could be named as early as 
February if the board approves the constitutional changes needed to 
implement the new structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The CEO would become a voting member of the board and the  
executive committee, would appoint operating committees and 
nominate their members. He or she would manage all staff functions 
and investment strategies, oversee and coordinate revenues, submit 
the budget and oversee spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, proposed by consultants at McKinsey and Company,  
also would revamp the role of the executive committee, streamlining 
it and shifting it from operational duties to the setting of policy 
guidelines and general oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors also would have a somewhat different  
agenda, making it more subservient to the executive committee. 
</P>

	The point of all the changes -- and there are many others that

function more efficiently and to respond to changes more 
effectively.

<HEADLINE>  America's Cup Races Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Yachts crunching together and  
cracking apart today led to the postponement of the last races of 
the first round-robin in the America's Cup challenger series. 
</P>
<P>
	As other challengers fought aggressively -- and expensively -- to  
make up ground, Italy's Prada extended its unbeaten run by 
defeating the last of the American favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	After being postponed for almost two hours because of dead calm  
on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf, racing began in near-perfect conditions 
of around 10 knots on wind and as dolphins chased at least one 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-spending Italian team beat New York's Young America to  
become the only unbeaten syndicate in the first round-robin of the 
regatta to decide who will take on defender New Zealand for 
sailing's most prized trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada defeated San Francisco's AmericaOne on Friday, and faces  
only the less-favored Abracadabra from Hawaii and the French 
challenge in the remaining races. 
</P>
<P>
	The only losses for AmericaOne and Young America have been at  
the hands of the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
	The two American boats were due to battle for second place on  
Sunday, the last day of racing scheduled for the first round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	But AmericaOne asked officials to delay further races until it  
could make repairs after America's Cup veteran Dennis Conner's boat 
Stars and Stripes clipped AmericaOne's stern less then 2 minutes 
before the start of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Swiss team Fast 2000 also asked for a delay after  
a bulkhead tore loose from the hull just minutes into their race 
against the French team. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials late Saturday granted the requests and canceled  
further racing until Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon was docked 1/2 of one point for colliding with the  
Spanish team. The Japanese boat won the race, but had a piece of 
its bow torn away. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada defeated Young America despite skipper Ed Baird's boat  
being just quicker over the start line, and extending its lead on 
the first leg by taking better wind on the right side of the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada matched Young America for speed downwind.  
</P>
<P>
	But as Young America was leading going into the last leg, it  
made a mistake and lost control its spinnaker. Prada were able to 
pass the American boat and win by 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast 2000 dropped out of its morning race after crew heard a  
noise just after the start and found a bulkhead had separated from 
the hull. The French team and San Francisco's America True had wins 
by default. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Japan-Spain race, Nippon was penalized for the collision,  
but this was canceled by a penalty to Spain when its trail boat 
picked up a crew member who went overboard and put him back on the 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning races, the Spanish Challenge defeated Stars and  
Stripes by 1 minute, 8 seconds; America True defeated Young 
Australia by 1:16; and AmericaOne defeated Abracadabra by 1:18. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, AmericaOne defeated Stars and Stripes by 1:00;  
Young America defeated Young Australia by 2:49; Nippon defeated the 
Spanish challenge by :59; and Abracadabra defeated the French 
challenge by :36. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Still Thinks He Can Be Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- There was a time when Mike Tyson thought no one  
could beat him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was 20 years old and the youngest heavyweight champion  
ever, with the world at his feet and a bright boxing future ahead 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just 13 years ago, but it must seem to Tyson that an  
eternity has passed between the time he terrorized the boxing world 
to now, when he is merely another heavyweight on the comeback 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 20, I didn't feel a guy with a gun could beat me,''  
Tyson said. ``Now I still feel I can conquer the world, but I know 
now it takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson returns to the ring tonight for just the eighth time in  
eight years when he meets Orlin Norris in a scheduled 10-round 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	He's coming off yet another stint in prison and had to lose  
nearly 60 pounds to get back into fighting shape for the fourth 
comeback of his once remarkable career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel young,'' Tyson said. ``I'm strong and believe I  
can still compete with the current crop of heavyweights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson didn't show that in January against Francois Botha, who  
won the first four rounds on two ringside scorecards before being 
knocked silly by a single Tyson right hand in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to show it against Norris, who was picked for this  
fight by Tyson's handlers because they don't feel he can hurt 
Tyson. Yet, Norris has the boxing skills to give Tyson much-needed 
rounds in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm rusty, I'm rusty,'' Tyson said. ``I'll still look  
sensational. I'm in a perfect frame of mind for fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, a 34-year-old former cruiserweight champion, has had  
only mediocre success in the heavyweight ranks. This fight, though, 
is one he has wanted for more than a decade, from the time when 
Tyson seemed invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is a 10-1 favorite in his first fight since serving 3 1/2  
months in a Maryland jail for assaulting two motorists after a 
minor accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds to 218 for Norris.  
</P>
<P>
	While Tyson has not been active, Norris hasn't exactly been  
fighting on a regular basis. Norris has fought less than one full 
round in 14 1/2 months, stopping Pele Reid in the first round of their 
June 26 fight in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect Tyson to come out and try to blow me out in one, two  
or three rounds,'' Norris said. ``That's the type of fighter he is. 
He wants to get it over with quickly and get out of there. I knew 
that way back. It doesn't bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson (46-3, 40 knockouts) is reportedly getting $10 million for  
the fight, which will be televised by Showtime to the cable 
network's subscribers. Norris (50-5, 27 knockouts) will get his 
biggest payday, an $800,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the telecast will be an IBF junior lightweight title  
fight between champion Roberto Garcia (32-0, 24 knockouts) and No. 
1 contender Diego Corrales (28-0, 23 knockouts) of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Garcia's third defense of the 130-pound title he won  
on points over Harold Warren on March 13, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bush-Bashing Biographer Had Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The unauthorized biographer of GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush was hoping for a best seller. He may 
end up with a libel lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	His publisher already has recalled the book and suspended  
further sales, shipment and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	James Howard Hatfield, who accused the Texas governor of burying  
a cocaine arrest, allegedly hid a secret of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Friday that Hatfield was convicted in 1988 for  
plotting to murder a co-worker. And they tell of a second 
conviction in an embezzlement scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday afternoon, publisher St. Martin's Press had recalled  
all 70,000 copies of the book -- ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and 
the Making of an American President'' -- from stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation, first reported in The Dallas Morning News, had  
the Bush campaign's legal staff reviewing the work for possible 
libel implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (the book) was not checked,'' Bush spokeswoman  
Karen Hughes said Friday. Bush had previously denounced the book as 
``science fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have enough information from our own investigation to make  
the decision that the book must be pulled,'' said Sally Richardson, 
president and publisher of St. Martin's Press trades division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly believe it would be irresponsible to continue to  
keep the book in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was still on parole from a 15-year prison term while  
writing the book, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine  
possession, but only did community service after his father, former 
President Bush, intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest record was later expunged at the request of the elder  
Bush, the book alleged. Hatfield attributed the story to three 
anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Hatfield through St. Martin's Press were  
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, due out in January 2000, was released early after the  
manuscript arrived with the cocaine story. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some merchants, such as online bookseller Amazon.com,  
said they would no longer sell the book, the flap wasn't enough to 
dissuade other merchants like Barnes &AMP; Noble, which said it will 
continue peddling the biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, 41, maintains it's a case of mistaken identity.  
</P>
<P>
	But Eddie Cobb, the Arkansas parole officer overseeing the  
convict's parole, said the writer and former prisoner are one and 
the same, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dallas attorney also identified the author as the convicted  
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Norman L. ``Happy'' Nelson Jr., who knew Hatfield for  
about nine years before the 1988 conviction, was stunned to see 
Hatfield's picture in a local newspaper as the Bush biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture in the paper ... that was him,'' Nelson said. ``I  
quite frankly didn't like him denying that he had a record, when I 
knew he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Castlebury, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice, confirmed that a James Howard Hatfield was arrested in 
February 1987 for solicitation of capital murder -- hiring a hit man 
to plant a bomb beneath a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was found guilty, Hatfield went to prison in April 1988  
and spent the next five years there. Upon his release, Hatfield was 
turned over to federal authorities; he wound up doing a short 
stretch in El Reno, Okla., for embezzling nearly $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was released in December 1994 after doing time in a  
halfway house, said El Reno spokesman Leon Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield then moved to Arkansas with the approval of Texas  
authorities and remained on parole through April 15, 2003, said 
Castlebury.

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Ohio St. 20, No. 24 Minn. 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ohio State's offense sputtered again but  
special teams came through, lifting the 22nd-ranked Buckeyes past 
No. 24 Minnesota 20-17 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Stultz kicked a 40-yard field goal with 1:15 left and Matt  
Wilhelm recovered Tyrone Carter's fumble on the ensuing kickoff as 
the Buckeyes (5-3, 2-2 Big Ten) avoided their first 1-3 conference 
start since 1988 and extended their dominance over the Gophers to 
16 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Westbrooks caused the fumble that secured Ohio State's  
improbable victory over the Gophers (5-2, 2-2), who dominated the 
game statistically until failing to gain a first down in three 
fourth-quarter possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers were hoping for a number of firsts Saturday at the  
Metrodome -- their first 6-1 start since 1967, their first victory 
over Ohio State since 1981 and their first victory over a ranked 
team in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory over the Buckeyes also would have given Minnesota its  
first winning season since 1990 and made the Gophers eligible for a 
bowl bid for the first time since 1987. But they allowed the 
Buckeyes to hang around too long, then faltered in crunch time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's Steve Bellisari, benched for four second-half  
series, returned at quarterback and took a halfback option from 
Michael Wiley 28 yards to the Minnesota 24, setting up Stultz' 
43-yard field goal that tied it at 17 with just over six minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers went three-and-out again, and the Buckeyes drove 40  
yards in 10 plays, eating 3:25 off the clock for the go-ahead field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Wiley, who gained just 37 yards on his first 11 runs,  
darted up the middle for a 44-yard touchdown that gave Ohio State a 
14-10 lead through the third quarter following a switch from 
Bellisari to fellow sophomore Austin Moherman. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moherman coughed up the ball on the Buckeyes' next  
possession when Karon Riley got his Big Ten-best 12th sack and 
stripped the ball at midfield. Astein Osei recovered and the 
Gophers drove 52 yards for the go-ahead touchdown, a 7-yard romp by 
Thomas Hamner that gave Minnesota a 17-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers led just 10-7 at halftime despite dominating the  
game in almost every phase, including a 187-46 edge in total yards, 
114-12 in rushing yards and 10-2 in first downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State needed to go just five yards for a 7-0 lead after  
Buckeyes cornerback Nate Clements intercepted Billy Cockerham's 
second pass of the game and returned it 36 yards, setting up 
Wiley's first touchdown run, a 3-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockerham's 9-yard keeper on the first play of the second  
quarter tied it at 7, and Dan Nystrom's 30-yard field goal on the 
Gophers' next possession made it 10-7.

<HEADLINE> La. GOP Gov. Wins Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Republican Gov. Mike Foster won a second term  
Saturday, becoming the second member of his family to usher in a 
new century as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's unique open primary system puts all candidates into  
one primary race, regardless of party. If no one wins more than 
half the votes, the top two candidates go to a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	With 82 percent of the precincts reporting, Foster had 632,275  
votes, or 61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	His closest challenger, U.S. Rep. Bill Jefferson of New Orleans,  
had 315,562, or 31 percent. None of the other 10 candidates had 
more than 3 percent of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're there,'' Foster said late Saturday, declaring victory at  
his election party in Lafayette. ``I'm ready to get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, a Democrat elected in 1990 as the state's first black  
congressman since Reconstruction, conceded the race a few hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	During the campaign, the congressman had blamed Foster for  
Louisiana's public education woes and tried to tie the governor to 
former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. He questioned Foster's 1995 
purchase of Duke's list of supporters, for which Foster was ordered 
to pay a $20,000 ethics violation fine for failing to disclose it 
on a campaign report. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster called the flap over the list a ``non-issue'' and  
countered with saturation television ads reminding voters that he 
was the first governor in at least 30 years to push three straight 
teacher raises through the Legislature, adding $1 billion to the 
overall education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2.7 million registered voters in Louisiana, 1.6 million  
are Democrats, and the rest are about evenly split between 
Republicans and independents. But party label means little in 
Louisiana, where voters often make decisions along racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, a wealthy planter whose grandfather served two terms as  
governor at the turn of the century, came out of nowhere in 1995 to 
win the seat that had been dominated off and on for years by 
populist Democrat Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana voters had grown weary of Edwards' troubles with  
federal prosecutors. Edwards had poured money into health programs 
that were abused by health care providers, while teachers went 
without pay raises and university buildings deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	In four years, Foster overhauled the health care program, spent  
$80 million on university buildings and doubled the highway paving 
program. His approval ratings soared to 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster also backed a plan to offer free college tuition to  
Louisiana high school graduates with at least a 2.5 grade point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other candidates in the primary field who showed in  
pre-election polls were Phil Preis, a Democrat who has never held 
office, and state Sen. Tom Greene, a Christian right Republican who 
complained Foster didn't do enough to rid the state of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana's is one of three gubernatorial races this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paul Patton faces four challengers  
in his bid for re-election. And in Mississippi, a cliffhanger is 
developing to replace Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice, who cannot run 
for a third term. Both elections are Nov. 2.

<HEADLINE> Gehrig Tops All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lou Gehrig narrowly topped Babe Ruth to finish  
first in voting for baseball's All-Century team, with Hank Aaron 
third followed by Ted Williams and Willie Mays. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most controversial selection on the 30-man team announced  
Saturday, banned outfielder Pete Rose was elected to the ninth and 
final outfield spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Four active players were among the 25 elected by fans: New York  
Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, scheduled to start Game 4 of the 
World Series; St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire; Seattle 
outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., and Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr. at 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Five players bypassed by fans were added to the team by a panel  
of experts: shortstop Honus Wagner, outfielder Stan Musial and 
pitchers Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting, sponsored by MasterCard International, was conducted by  
fans from July 13-Sept. 19, and all 18 living members of the team 
are expected to attend on-field ceremonies Sunday night. Fans were 
asked to pick two players at each infield position, two catchers, 
six pitchers and nine outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was invited to the ceremonies, even though he accepted a  
lifetime ban from baseball in 1989 following an investigation of 
his gambling. He told baseball he will miss the pregame news 
conference to make a casino appearance in New Jersey, then arrive 
for the on-field ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig didn't invite Rose to the  
All-Star game, when the living members among the 100 on the ballot 
were honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attendance at any function like that was forbidden,'' Selig  
said then. 
</P>
<P>
	He reversed course a month later and said Rose would be allowed  
to come to the Series if elected. He repeated Saturday that he 
didn't think Rose's inclusion will diminish the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only hope is it will be as good as the ceremonies from the  
All-Star game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it detracts from it at all,'' Braves manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``I know that's going to be a big deal. That's 
fine. I've always liked Pete Rose. I feel bad under the 
circumstances which he stands today. But the rules are the rules. 
If he's allowed to come here, that's great. And I will be the first 
to shake his hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's former teammate, Johnny Bench (1,010,403), finished first  
at catcher, easily ahead of Yogi Berra (704,208) and Carlton Fisk 
(322,384). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor,'' Berra said. ``Think of all the great  
catchers: Bill Dickey, Josh Gibson, Roy Campanella, Mickey 
Cochrane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig (1,207,992) was tops among first basemen, followed by  
McGwire (517,181) and Jimmie Foxx (351,488). Jackie Robinson 
(788,116) led second basemen, followed by Rogers Hornsby (630,761) 
and Joe Morgan (608,660). 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken (669,033), who switched to third base in recent years,  
topped the voting for shortstops. Ernie Banks (598,168) beat out 
Ozzie Smith (589,025) for second in the closest voting for a spot 
on the team. Wagner was fourth at 526,740. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw all of 'em,'' Banks said. ``I feel like I played 100  
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a spot dominated by players from late in the century, Mike  
Schmidt (855,654) led at third base, followed by Brooks Robinson 
(761,700) and George Brett (656,511), with Eddie Mathews (174,529) 
far behind in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth (11,58,044) led the outfielders, followed by Aaron  
(1,156,782), Williams (1,125,583), Mays (1,115,896), Joe DiMaggio 
(1,054,423), Mickey Mantle (988,168), Ty Cobb (777,056), Griffey 
(645,389) and Rose (629,742). 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente (582,937) was 10th, followed by Musial  
(571,279), Shoeless Joe Jackson (326,415) and Reggie Jackson 
(296,039). 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Ryan (992,040) topped pitchers, followed by Sandy Koufax  
(970,434), Cy Young (867,523), Clemens (601,244), Bob Gibson 
(582,031) and Walter Johnson (479,279). 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (431,751), who started Saturday night's World Series  
opener for Atlanta, was seventh, followed by Steve Carlton 
(405,365), Satchel Paige (399,657), Spahn (337,215) and Tom Seaver 
(330,219). 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson (249,747) was 14th in fan voting and Grove (142,169)  
finished 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Five fans who won a sweepstakes will sit with living members of  
the All-Century team during Game 2.

<HEADLINE> Cathedral Bars Ezra Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's no place for Ezra Pound at the Cathedral  
of St. John the Divine. 
</P>
<P>
	The dean of the cathedral has overruled a decision by a group of  
poets and writers to honor Pound with a place in St. John's Poet's 
Corner because of his anti-Semitic writings and broadcasts from 
Italy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Very Rev. Harry S. Pritchett Jr. informed members of the  
Poet's Corner electing panel of his decision in a letter last week, 
The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which includes John Updike, Robert Pinsky and Donald  
Hall, had voted to honor Pound and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Pritchett 
said he had intended to accept the nominations until the 
congregation protested the plans for Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	In broadcasts from January 1941 to July 1943, Pound blamed Jews  
and other groups for global economic problems. He was indicted for 
treason in 1943, and imprisoned by American forces near Pisa in 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
	The Poet's Corner at the cathedral was founded in 1984 to  
celebrate American writers and modeled after the Poet's Corner in 
Westminster Abbey. Carved stones, measuring about 6 square feet, 
have been laid in the corner on the north side of the cathedral's 
nave to honor 33 writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those writers include Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Emily  
Dickinson, William Carlos Williams, T.S. Eliot and William 
Faulkner.

<HEADLINE> Howard U. Nurses Approve Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a daylong strike, nurses at Howard  
University Hospital approved a three-year contract Friday that 
provides for a 7 percent base pay increase and forced overtime only 
in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got everything we wanted,'' said Mary Jones-Bryant,  
chairwoman of the District of Columbia Nurses Association. She said 
the decision to strike was ``agonizing'' but worth it in the end: 
``We showed unity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Howard, one of the nation's largest and best  
known historically black teaching hospitals, said management's goal 
was to give nurses the pay they deserve while making sure the 
institution has enough resources to invest in patient care, 
research and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident the agreement ... allows us to maintain that  
balance,'' said spokeswoman Donna Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after weeks of negotiations, a 12-hour strike  
Friday and a 1 1/2-hour vote. Union officials would not reveal the 
vote breakdown, but Jones-Bryant said the proposal was strongly 
approved. About 100 nurses, pharmacists and other union members 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year contract gives nurses a 2 percent base pay  
increase in the first year, 3 percent in the second year and 2 
percent in the third year, Jones-Bryant said. Raises for 
pharmacists were slightly higher, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most nurses who went on strike are to return to work Saturday  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nurses here are tired, they worked all night and they  
marched all day,'' Jones-Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had argued that forced overtime and inadequate  
staffing levels erode the quality of care and threaten patient 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times you're giving just the bare needs, but you can't stop  
to listen and talk to patients when they need it,'' said Joyce 
Purnell, a striking nurse normally assigned to the hospital's 
Intensive Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 137-year-old teaching hospital has invested heavily in new  
technology in recent years, but staffers at the 340-bed complex had 
not had raises in three years, union members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital personnel records indicate 57 percent of the nurses  
earn more than $60,000 base pay. They also receive time and a half 
for overtime and double time for holidays, said Brock, the hospital 
spokeswoman. ``They are among the highest paid nurses in the 
District of Columbia,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials insisted Friday that they had negotiated with  
the union in good faith since April. They also expressed regret 
that a federal mediator had failed to resolve differences with the 
union.

<HEADLINE> ABC Keeps 'NYPD Blue' on Tuesdays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Producer Steven Bochco won his battle to keep  
his Emmy-winning ``NYPD Blue'' in its Tuesday time slot, but 
there's a catch. 
</P>
<P>
	The cop drama won't return for its new season until Jan. 11,  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said Friday it would move ``Once and Again,'' the new drama  
that has been airing Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET, to Mondays at 10 in 
January, once the pro football season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can certainly live with this compromise,'' Bochco said on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's deliberations over its schedule had turned into a public  
relations disaster when a furious Bochco denounced the network for 
thinking of moving his show. ``NYPD Blue'' has aired in the same 
Tuesday night time slot since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco had suggested that ABC wanted to give ``Once and Again''  
the Tuesday time slot for financial reasons because it was produced 
by a company within the Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had set up the conflict by premiering ``Once and Again,'' a  
drama about two divorced parents, in the ``NYPD Blue'' time slot in 
September and not saying where it would go when ``NYPD Blue'' was 
ready to return in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once and Again,'' starring Sela Ward, started strong in the  
ratings but has faded in its time slot behind ``Judging Amy,'' 
CBS's new hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... believe this scheduling decision allows us the  
opportunity to maximize the potential of both series,'' said Stu 
Boomberg, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco said he's concerned about ABC losing more viewers to CBS  
Tuesday nights before ``NYPD Blue'' can return in January. But he 
said it will be an advantage for his show to air 22 new episodes in 
a row early next year without having to pause for reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once and Again'' will premiere in its new time slot on Jan.  
24. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise isn't a long-term solution. ABC will have to  
decide again next fall what to do with ``Once and Again,'' if it is 
renewed for a second season, when ``Monday Night Football'' 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a problem if we get picked up for an eighth  
season,'' Bochco said. ``If we do well from January through May in 
our time slot, there's no downside for us. If they don't pick us 
up, someone else will.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Denounces Chechnya Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The Russian military's attacks in Chechnya  
are ``deplorable and ominous,'' and the events of the past 36 to 48 
hours in the breakaway republic are of ``grave concern,'' Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces were consolidating their positions around Grozny,  
the Chechen capital, after an air, artillery and ground onslaught 
that left the Chechen forces with heavy losses. A missile attack 
Thursday night on a Grozny marketplace killed at least 143 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia sent troops into Chechnya at the end of September,  
following weeks of airstrikes, ostensibly to eliminate the 
militants who invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who was winding up a six-nation Africa visit, said she  
hopes to speak soon with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov about 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to make it quite clear our concern about these  
events,'' she said. The Chechnya problem ``cannot be solved by 
military means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that Russian tactics are creating displacement of the  
Chechen population from their homes. Many have been forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the White House also expressed concern about what  
spokesman Joe Lockhart called the ``terrible loss of life'' in 
Chechnya. But the administration avoided pointing a finger of blame 
for the missile attack after a Russian military spokesman said it 
was a special operation, contradicting Russian political officials 
who denied any responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said President Clinton recently sent a letter to  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressing concern about the 
escalation of violence as Russia tries to quell rebels in Chechnya 
and terrorist attacks in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Man Pays $19,000 For Wild Horse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURNS, Ore. (AP) -- When the bidding started Saturday on a  
6-month-old Kiger mustang filly fresh off the range, 91-year-old 
retired wildlife biologist Bob Smith sat in the front row and kept 
his yellow bidding card held high. 
</P>
<P>
	When Smith finally laid his bidding card in the blanket covering  
his legs, the crowd of some 500 people packing the Harney County 
Fairgrounds grandstands for the first Kiger mustang auction shook 
their heads in disbelief, clapped and thumped each other on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had agreed to pay a record $19,000 for the privilege of  
adopting the wild horse of his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most wild horses are just that, feral horses,'' said Smith,  
looking like anything but a high roller in a crumpled felt hat, 
faded green quilted jacket, and frayed tan slacks. ``But these are 
the Spanish mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted a real bona fide mustang most all of my life,''  
said Smith, who worked as a buckeroo in his youth and a biologist 
for U.S. Fish and Wildlife service before retiring in Central 
Point. ``I probably won't be around by the time the next one of 
these comes around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1971 when the U.S. Bureau of Land Management began  
rounding up wild horses to keep them from overgrazing public 
rangeland, many ranchers considered them no better than coyotes, to 
be shot on sight. 
</P>
<P>
	But each year the buzz has been building on those showing colors  
and traits of the Sorraias, Andalusians, Garranos and Spanish Barbs 
that the Spanish brought to the New World in the 16th and 17th 
centuries -- especially the Kigers, which make their home in the 
high desert of southeastern Oregon on the flanks of Steens 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	With demand growing, BLM two years ago abandoned the lotteries  
held to award adoption picks, and the $125 adoption fee, in favor 
of competitive bidding. Because the Kigers are only rounded up 
every three years, this was the first time they had been adopted by 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The price Smith paid doesn't approach the $50,000 that Stephen  
Spielberg's Dreamworks studio purportedly paid Oregon breeder Bill 
Littleton for Donner, a ranch-bred Kiger stud that will serve as 
the model for the upcoming animated motion picture ``Spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it easily doubled anything paid at a BLM wild horse auction  
and was half-again the high end for ranch-bred Kigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The next highest at Saturday's auction was a 2-year-old filly  
for $2,500. The top stud was a 1-year-old that went for $2,100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unreal, isn't it?'' said Mack Isley of Pasco, Wash., the  
president of the Kiger Musteno Association. ``It looks like some 
people are finally beginning to realize the value of these horses. 
It isn't just the Kiger. It's all wild horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kigers were first rounded up in 1974 on Beaty Butte, where  
BLM Burns District wild horse manager Ron Harding had heard there 
might be horses exhibiting the dun factor characteristic of the old 
Spanish breeds. They were moved to a range management area along 
Kiger Creek, which flows off Steens Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	The dun factor shows four colors. Dun is golden with black  
points. Red dun is reddish. Grulla (pronounced the Spanish way, 
GROO-ya) is a warm mouse-gray. Claybank, the rarest, is similar to 
buckskin. 
</P>
<P>
	The most sought-after horses have zebra striping on their legs,  
a dorsal stripe down the back, fine muzzles, eyes wide apart, and 
hooked ears with dark outlines and tufts of hair at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he knew immediately upon seeing the little filly in  
the viewing pens on Friday that she was the horse he wanted, no 
matter what it cost. 
</P>
<P>
	He liked her light dun color, the good zebra striping on her  
legs, her fine head and overall conformation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought him a lawn chair and he just sat and watched her for  
an hour,'' said his friend and trainer Coni Floray. ``It's a dream 
come true.''

<HEADLINE> Bullish Economist Awaits Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The U.S. economy continues to defy what most economists  
previously believed to be well-established laws. This has prompted 
optimists among us to declare that the soul of the economy has 
escaped the earthly constraints of past business cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	I doubt that this is the case.  
</P>
<P>
	There is certainly some evidence to support the claim that we  
have entered a new era: declining and then stable inflation since 
1990, steadily increasing investment in growth-producing capital, a 
long-awaited surge in productivity, a passage from federal 
government deficits to surpluses, an impressive and continuing 
growth in jobs at a time of low unemployment and, last but not 
least, an unprecedented rise in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it is the role of the stock market that is probably least  
understood, least appreciated, and therefore, most worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	We know that as apparent wealth in the form of stocks and real  
estate increases, consumption increases. Since consumption is the 
largest component of our economy's total demand, increases in stock 
prices, and more recently real estate prices, have contributed to 
steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But since investors are reluctant to cash in their shares, the  
increased spending must come from additional borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The private savings rate has now turned negative. For the first  
time in recent history, households as a whole are spending more 
than their incomes. There is nothing inherently wrong with this -- 
if the wealth is real. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, as a society we may believe we are borrowing to  
invest in assets that will pay off handsomely in the future, 
allowing us to repay the loans and still consume more now and 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the individual investor, U.S. corporations play a  
key role in this process. Firms make decisions to invest in 
growth-producing real assets with funds we leave in the stock 
market. They also borrow some of the money, contributing to the 
need for higher future payoffs before cash in the form of dividends 
can find its way back to the stockholders and into consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the firms' investment decisions produce payoffs that  
are less than those anticipated by the stockholders? This could 
very well be the situation today. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, stockholders have demanded returns well in excess  
of those available on government bonds. A recent survey of 
individual investors indicates that they expect returns of about 15 
percent over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the current price-earnings' ratios on stocks  
indicate that investors are naively expecting firms to earn totally 
unrealistic returns on their plowed-back earnings. When it becomes 
evident that this isn't in the cards, the stock market could be in 
for a rough time. 
</P>
<P>
	The most optimistic argue that as long as investors have a long  
horizon, they no longer should demand significantly higher returns, 
and that this fact alone accounts for the high level of stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While this may be theoretically correct, anecdotal evidence  
suggests the opposite. Investing in the stock market seems to have 
become almost a fad, and it is doubtful that stockholders are 
expecting future returns as low as this argument requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the problem is the fact that firms appear to be taking  
the high level of stock prices as evidence that investors have 
lowered their requirements. Corporations are re-investing an 
all-time high percentage of their earnings in new capital assets 
(or buying back their own stock). 
</P>
<P>
	In the short-run, this has the effect of sustaining the  
appearance of being in a ``New World'' of unlimited growth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the most pessimistic argue that current stock  
market prices reflect a bubble. Investors are unconcerned with 
future corporate earnings, but they believe that prices will 
continue to rise because the market expects them to. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas fads can be sustained for longer periods, bubbles burst  
suddenly, as in the United States in 1929 and in Japan at the end 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the rising market is due to a bubble or a fad is not the  
most important point. In either case, a correction is inevitable, 
and it is the unwinding of the process now generating the apparent 
wealth that will have serious economic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	As market forces destroy the perceived wealth, consumption and  
investment will fall at the same time that the debt taken on by 
individuals and firms remains as a huge overhang. A subsequent 
recovery will eventually come, but most likely will be distant and 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, this process has been called the business cycle.  
When we consider the role the stock market has played in the recent 
prolonged period of economic expansion, there is little reason to 
believe nirvana has been achieved -- at least this time around.

<HEADLINE> Actress Swank Discusses New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hilary Swank says immersing herself in her role  
as a girl pretending to be a guy in the new film ``Boys Don't Cry'' 
had her wondering where her own personality was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Swank, nearly two years after a season on ``Beverly Hills,  
90210,'' stars in the true story of Teena Brandon, a 21-year-old 
woman who was raped and murdered in 1993 near Falls City, Neb., 
after passing as a man named Brandon and seducing several of the 
town's women. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a month after shooting was complete to ``totally detox  
Brandon out of my system,'' she says in the latest Entertainment 
Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had been stifling my own mannerisms for so long. I was  
scared I was never going to be all the way Hilary again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film's release recently expanded to theaters  
nationwide. The movie has Swank being mentioned for an Oscar 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Digital Effects Worry Stunt Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Phil Culotta misses getting beaten up.  
</P>
<P>
	The veteran stuntman was hired to double for Kevin Bacon in an  
upcoming sci-fi movie, but like a growing number of America's stunt 
performers, Culotta said he lost most of the daring-do to a 
computer-generated replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make my money being physical,'' Culotta said. ``But they're  
taking me out of so many scenes that I just sit there and go, 'Wow. 
I better find a job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As digital effects become more realistic and less expensive,  
many stuntmen fear computer graphics could turn rough-and-tumble 
Hollywood daredevils into glorified stand-ins. The success of 
digitized characters like Jar Jar Binks in ``The Phantom Menace'' 
led the Screen Actors Guild to begin monitoring the trend this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find it's going to be hard to replace a performance from  
Jack Nicholson or Jim Carrey with animation, but it's certainly 
easy to replace an anonymous figure who falls from a building,'' 
said SAG spokesman Rafe Greenlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Rondell of the trade organization Stunts Unlimited  
estimated only about 200 stunt performers now work full-time, down 
from about 400 in the 1970s. The rest -- SAG has about 1,850 stunt 
members -- must supplement their income with other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology known as ``motion capture'' enables studios to  
compile libraries of stunts by recording the movements of a 
performer wearing a sensor-covered bodysuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The footage is recorded without putting the performer at risk,  
and computers animate the figure and superimpose it on a 
background. The image could become a soldier falling from a cliff 
or a firefighter plunging from a skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
	During the making of ``Titanic,'' footage of a handful of stunt  
performers was captured and multiplied to simulate dozens of 
passengers sliding from the deck of the broken ship as it sunk 
beneath the waves in the film's climactic scene. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bob Hoffman, spokesman for Digital Domain, a special effects  
company that worked on the film, said those effects were only used 
for scenes that would be too risky for real human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than putting people out of work, he said, computers keep  
people from trying stunts that would risk their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have a man fall 350 feet into the water and hit a  
giant propeller on his way down,'' Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Endoso, another member of Stunts Unlimited, said he  
worries about losing work but welcomes technology that makes his 
job safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when a stuntman knew he was going to get  
hurt,'' said Endoso, who has appeared in nearly 60 features. ``When 
you were hit by a car, you were hit. ... Digital stunts are another 
step that we'll have to adjust to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman insists computers will never replace old-fashioned  
flesh-and-bone actors and stunt workers. Still, the illusion is 
becoming more convincing -- and more threatening to the stunt 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the effects are cheap and totally believable to the  
audience, we're going to be gone,'' said Rondell, who spent 42 
years as a stuntman. ``The day is coming,''

<HEADLINE> 84 Injured in Austria Disco Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Fire swept through two discos packed with  
teen-agers after plastic foam packaging material that had been 
spread out on the dance floors caught on fire, Austrian media 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 84 people injured in the fires were treated for  
minor burns and smoke inhalation and sent home. Three people were 
expected to be hospitalized for several weeks, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger blaze broke out shortly before midnight Friday at the  
Joy Disco in St. Agatha village near Bad Goisern, 120 miles 
southwest of Vienna, during a party in which pieces of plastic foam 
were strewn ankle-deep on the dance floor, the Austria Press Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian radio said the blaze was apparently caused by a burning  
cigarette tossed onto the plastic foam, which the disco management 
had been told was fireproof. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire at the Joy Disco broke out about two hours after a  
blaze had erupted at the Tobago nightspot in Oberndorf, 10 miles 
north of Salzburg on the German border. APA reported that 10 people 
were injured at that disco, where the dance floor was also covered 
with plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries at the Tobago fire were serious, the  
Austrian agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Joy Disco, some 200 people stormed to the emergency exit,  
only to find it blocked by slot machines, Austrian radio reported. 
The crowd jammed the main door, trampling several people, according 
to an Austrian radio reporter at the scene, 
</P>
<P>
	``There was panic. People crawled on top of each other,'' one of  
the rescuers told Austrian radio without giving his name. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 rescuers rushed to the scene. Austrian radio said it  
took firefighters about two hours to bring the blaze under control. 
Fifteen physicians helped those suffering from burns and smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was organized to mark the takeover of the disco by a  
new manager, Austrian radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of the 700 discos and pubs surveyed last  
summer by the Austrian Ministry for Social Affairs were found to 
contain emergency exits that lacked adequate lighting and easy 
access, Austria Press Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Illinois 35, No. 9 Michigan 29 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The hangover continued for No. 9  
Michigan as Illinois reeled off four straight second-half 
touchdowns for a 35-29 upset of the Wolverines on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Kittner threw four touchdown passes and Rocky Harvey ran 54  
yards for an insurance touchdown for the Fighting Illini (4-3, 1-3 
Big Ten), who had been forced to practice on Sunday after a 
lackluster loss to Minnesota a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten), who led 27-7 midway through  
the third quarter, had two chances to take the game back in the 
fourth quarter, but failed each time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illini took a 28-27 lead on Kittner's 59-yard touchdown pass  
to Harvey with 2:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Brady's passing drove Michigan to the Illinois 28, but a  
high snap from center Steve Frazier sailed over Brady's head from 
the shotgun formation and he fell on it for a 25-yard loss. Brady's 
pass was picked off at the Illinois 46 by Trayvon Waller two plays 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed the Illini would be content to run the remaining 1:15  
off the clock, but Harvey -- on the second snap -- bolted through the 
line and outraced everybody to the end zone for another TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, fighting the clock by hitting sideline passes, drove the  
Wolverines from the Michigan 20 to the Illinois 16. His third-down 
pass was intercepted near the goal line by Tony Francis, who 
fumbled into the end zone. Illinois safety Muhammad Abdullah fell 
on it, giving Michigan a safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittner completed 24-of-33 passes for 280 yards with no  
interceptions and Harvey rushed 17 times for 106 yards for 
Illinois. Brady was 23-of-38 for 307 yards with two interceptions 
for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines, off last week after a 34-31 loss at Michigan  
State, looked sluggish in the first quarter and Illinois made them 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan went three-and-out on its second possession and the  
situation was made worse when Cory Sargent shanked a punt that 
traveled only 29 yards to midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kittner completing 3-of-3, including a 33-yarder to Lloyd  
Brandon, the Fighting Illini went 50 yards in five plays with 
Kittner hitting Jameel Cook from 6-yards out for the touchdown and 
a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	That apparently was the wakeup call Michigan needed as the  
Wolverines scored on their next three possessions for a 20-7 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like the lead might be even more when Michigan  
recovered a fumbled kickoff return at the Illinois 17, but the 
Wolverines failed to convert the turnover into points. A holding 
penalty, an incompletion and an 11-yard sack by Seth Tesdall pushed 
the Wolverines back to the 29. Fred Wakefield then blocked Jeff Del 
Verne's 46-yard field goal attempt with 4:22 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady engineered Michigan's comeback from the early deficit with  
a 6-yard touchdown pass to Marquise Walker with 1:43 left in the 
first quarter and a 31-yard scoring strike to Marcus Knight with 
9:14 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Drew Henson replaced Brady for Michigan's second  
possession of the second quarter, but wasn't much of a factor. 
Henson handed off to Anthony Thomas three straight times. Thomas, 
who rushed for 128 yards on 21 carries, reeled off runs of 5, 10 
and 25 yards for the touchdown. Wakefield blocked that PAT attempt 
and the Wolverines settled for a 13-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas scored on a 1-yard run to cap an 88-yard, 15-play drive,  
putting Michigan up 27-7 with 6:01 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kittner hitting 4-of-7 for 73 yards, the Illini answered  
with an 80-yard drive touchdown drive that closed the gap to 27-14. 
The score came with 2:41 left in the third quarter when Kittner 
hooked up with third-string quarterback Walter Young in blown 
coverage for a 31-yard touchdown pass play on fourth-and-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illini used up 7:11 on a 77-yard, 17-play drive, closing the  
gap to 27-21 on Kittner's 3-yard TD toss to Brian Hodges with 6:25 
left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Illinois' first victory at Michigan since 1993 when the  
Illini won 24-21 in another comeback.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Flag Law Reveals Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Oregon students file into their  
classrooms next week, they will be asked to perform a ritual many 
never have done: recite the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, most schools will have enough American flags  
to go around by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers voted to put the pledge back in schools with a law  
that takes effect today. Under the law, school districts must 
display flags and give students the opportunity to recite the 
pledge at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was, after so many years of pledge-free classrooms,  
flags were tattered or missing altogether. The pledge used to be a 
part of the morning ritual, but the practice dropped off, 
particularly in middle and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	A few districts have bought their own, but others appealed to  
the Oregon Republican Party for a total of 3,000 flags. The party 
has supplied 1,000 flags and is helping raise money to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought schools would have flags -- little did we know,''  
party executive director Darryl Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't specify how many flags must be in the school or  
in which rooms. Administrators as most schools wanted to put flags 
in each classroom and an assembly area. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is not without its flaws. One problem is its lack of a  
specified time or location to say the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another problem occurred in a health class at Harriet Tubman  
Middle School, when several students wouldn't say the pledge 
because they said they don't believe in God, and disagree with its 
vow of allegiance to ``one nation under God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the class decided it would be up to the students to  
suggest reciting the pledge each day. Those who didn't want to do 
so would stand respectfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like it's a big chore or anything -- it's respectful  
to our country,'' said Sam Stuckey, 12. ``If you live in this 
country then you should do it.''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett's Finishes Has Him Confused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett has this problem at North  
Carolina Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems like all he can do is finish second.  
</P>
<P>
	Six times in the last seven races on the 1.017-mile oval,  
Jarrett has been the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confusing situation for the second-generation NASCAR  
star, who is on the verge of winning his first Winston Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll continue the streak that we've had,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, thinking about that, he shook his head and added,  
``Actually, I don't want to continue that streak. But, if we have 
to take second, I will. We'd like to get into victory lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he keeps coming in second on a track where he has yet  
to win, Jarrett scratched his head and said, ``It's just that 
somebody always seems to be faster at the end of this race than 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's led the most laps and looked ready to win. And there also  
have been times when his Ford wasn't the second-best car at The 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case eight months ago, and it made no difference.  
</P>
<P>
	``We finished second somehow,'' Jarrett said. ``We just managed  
to do things right at the end and got into second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost to a lot of good race cars and drivers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett goes into Sunday's Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 with  
a 246-point lead over Bobby Labonte and a 319-point edge Mark 
Martin -- the only drivers with any realistic chance to catch him in 
the final four races of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	All Jarrett needs to do is finish 13th or better in each race to  
clinch the championship, no matter what Labonte and Martin do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still plan on being aggressive Sunday,'' Jarrett said. ``We  
know the best way for us not to lose any points is to win the race, 
and that's what we've come to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won the spring race here, will start from the pole,  
with Jarrett third and Labonte fifth in the 43-car lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire wear probably will determine the winner of Sunday's 393-lap  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if your car feels good on new tires, you just can't go as  
hard as you would like,'' Jarrett said. ``You just aren't going to 
have anything left at the end of that run. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I think the last 40 laps of a run are the most  
important. That's when you can make up the most time. What we do is 
work a lot with shock and spring combinations here to try to allow 
ourselves to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin noted that the asphalt pavement is just about worn out.  
</P>
<P>
	``What the pavement does to the tires makes them get real slick  
in the race, and that's not always my forte,'' Martin said. ``The 
only way I know how to go fast is to give it gas, and when I do 
that, my tires spin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darlington is the same kind of track, and we've had real good  
luck and a good record and Darlington and here. But I'd have to say 
one thing about the race track that's hard for me is the fact that 
it just eats the tires alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who leads the series with seven victories this  
season, also figures to be a factor on a track where he has won 
three of the last five races -- including this event last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	With new crew chief Brian Whitesell, Gordon has won two of the  
last three races and has moved to fourth in the standings -- 
although he trails third-place Martin by 115 points and is just 
nine ahead of sensational rookie Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to focus on winning races and seeing how far up  
in the points we can get before this year is out,'' said Gordon a 
three-time Winston Cup champ. ``We're going through what we're 
going to need in the offseason and 2000 to get ready for the new 
Monte Carlo and be back in action as a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to win races. We'd love to have 10, but we'd have to  
win three of the last four races to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dockworkers Threaten Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii dockworkers are threatening to walk off  
their jobs unless they are paid the same as their West Coast 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 507-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local  
142 on Friday completed voting to authorize a strike if talks fail 
with representatives of the state's four major shipping companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Oahu members, the largest contingent with 427 workers,  
authorized a strike on Friday, following earlier votes by members 
on the islands of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were scheduled to resume negotiations today. The  
union wants pay raises similar to the three-year, 8 percent wage 
increase West Coast dockworkers received. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 142 President Eusebio Lapenia pledged to talk around the  
clock until a deal is reached. He said the union doesn't want to 
strike, but will if forced. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is at stake is to be treated like the rest of the  
longshore workers in the industry,'' Lapenia said. ``No matter what 
work you do, you always want parity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Ho, chief negotiator for the Hawaii Employers Council, which  
represents the shippers, refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side will discuss salaries, but published reports said  
the old contract paid Hawaii workers anywhere from $55,000 to 
$150,000, depending on their job, hours and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why shouldn't we get what the West Coast got?'' dockworker  
Leonard Drago said. ``We do the same work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ben Cayetano has offered to mediate but remains confident a  
strike will be averted. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a strike has triggered panic buying of staples  
like rice, Spam and toilet paper in Hawaii, where 90 percent of 
goods arrive by ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, dockworkers staged a work slowdown that created a  
backlog of unloaded cargo ships in Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	If dockworkers strike, ships that arrive in Hawaii will sit in  
port without being unloaded. And if the walkout drags on, shipping 
companies will stop sending vessels on the five-day journey from 
the West Coast.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Congregation Mourns Pastor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MATHER, Calif. (AP) -- With his white beard and jovial attitude  
and giving nature, friends and neighbors say the Rev. Edward R. 
Sherriff made a perfect Santa Claus at Christmas parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they fear his generosity may have gotten him killed.  
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old gay pastor, known as a ``champion of the  
underdog,'' was found stabbed to death earlier this week in what 
police believe was a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always taking in strays, people who had been thrown out  
of their home because of their sexuality,'' said longtime friend 
Jim McGuirk, of Spokane, Wash., where Sherriff founded the city's 
first crisis hot line for gays and lesbians when he lived there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy who would give you the shirt off his back,  
without question,'' McGuirk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Richardson, Sherriff's neighbor of several years, said she  
saw him bring home ``questionable characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried to rehabilitate people, get them on their feet,''  
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made in the killing.  
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors called police Wednesday night after seeing two men  
driving Sherriff's two vehicles away. Police found one of them in 
south Sacramento on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility that Sherriff  
was killed by someone he knew, but believe it was a robbery, police 
spokesman Glenn Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherriff, who served at the Cathedral of Promise Metropolitan  
Community Church in suburban Sacramento, was known to parishioners 
as ``Reverend Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, mourners left flowers and notes at the Samaritan  
Center, a food pantry that Sherriff founded and ran. He also 
operated Out of the Closet, a thrift store that helped support the 
food pantry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helped me and my family, helped us financially more than  
most people would,'' said Henry Rogers. ``It's a great loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marghe Covino, spokeswoman for the Lambda Community Center, a  
local gay advocacy group, said Sherriff was an advocate for the gay 
community and a ``champion of the underdog and the downtrodden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said Sherriff recently installed a security system at  
his house after someone robbed it of thrift store receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Miller, a friend and former co-worker of Sherriff's,  
remembered him as a perfect Santa Claus at church Christmas 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fit him well because he was such a giver,'' she said. ``He  
was the most giving man I've ever met. He didn't care who you were 
or what you did, he just wanted to help.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Brands Bradley 'Insurgent' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, hoping to conjure  
voter distrust of free-spending liberals, brands rival Bill Bradley 
a ``left-of-center insurgent'' and his plan for universal health 
insurance a ``throwback to an earlier generation'' before 
Democratic lawmakers accepted the discipline of balanced budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore called Russia's  
Boris Yeltsin an ``on-again, off-again'' president even while 
voicing confidence that a stable Russia will carry on despite 
corruption and crime troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeltsin's episodic approach to the presidency has not helped  
their ability to get on top of all these problems,'' Gore said, 
adding that Yeltsin still is due credit for his role in Russia's 
emergence from communism. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, struggling through an unexpectedly tight  
Democratic nomination race with Bradley, met with AP editors and 
reporters Friday in the White House's Roosevelt Room, across the 
hall from the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a lucky-charm knock on the wood table as he committed  
himself to weekly, general election debates with the Republican 
nominee -- ``If I have the privilege of being the Democratic 
nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly feeling the squeeze of Bradley's competitive bankroll  
and rise in polls, Gore offered his harshest assessment yet of the 
former New Jersey senator's $65 billion plan to eliminate Medicaid 
and give poor people government subsidies to buy into the Federal 
Employee Health Benefits Program or purchase private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who has said he would tap the budget surplus to pay for  
the plan, would instead have to raise taxes or go ``deeply into 
deficits,'' Gore contended. The vice president wants to reserve the 
surplus for shoring up Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``His health care plan is a throwback to an earlier generation  
of policy analysis,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party has gained a lot of credit with voters  
over the last seven years for accepting fiscal responsibility. ... 
That means paying attention to what happens to the budget surplus 
and not squandering it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore defended the criticism implied in his new ``I stayed and  
fought'' slogan -- that Bradley is a quitter for leaving the Senate 
in 1997 and abandoning the battles with Congress' Republican 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the difference between Bradley and other Democrat  
senators who left that year, including four whose endorsements Gore 
now trumpets, is that unlike Bradley, the others ``are not running 
for president and they're not saying that they're left-of-center 
insurgents that represent the true sprit of the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning in New York on Saturday, said ``common  
sense and willing to think long term'' best described his philosphy 
on issues such as health care, poverty, and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that about 44.3 million people lacked health insurance in  
1998, about a million more than the year before, Bradley said, 
``You can either nibble around the edges of that problem or you can 
confront it and put the cost out there and very clearly state what 
it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for responding to Gore's barbs, the former professional  
basketball player said: ``I'm also a competitor and been in enough 
games and competition to know you can take the elbows only so many 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, Gore  
unspooled a point-by-point indictment of the Texas governor's 
record on everything from Social Security to nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	At once charming and prickly, Gore said he got stuck with the  
``stiff and wooden rap'' because of his habit as vice president of 
pausing before every utterance to make ``an internal vet'' of what 
he was about to say and whether it would contradict administration 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboy boots spiced his bureaucratic blue suit and a blip of bad  
grammar -- ``to get shed of that,'' he said at one point -- was 
explained away with a folksy ``that's the way it's said in 
Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been to his home state once since opening his Nashville  
headquarters. His press, research, fund raising, legal and 
accounting operations plan to remain for some time on Washington's 
K Street, the city's lobbying and legal corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore delighted in the move, bragging that one woman  
brought 12 homebaked pies by his Nashville offices last week. 
``That never happened on K Street,'' he chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
	Other points from the hourlong conversation:  
</P>
<P>
	--He rejected Bradley's call for automatic, annual increases in  
the minimum wage, indexed to the median wage. ``The president and 
the Congress should regularly increase the minimum wage with an eye 
to the circumstances that prevail at the time.'' Both Gore and 
Bradley favor a $1 increase in the current $5.15 wage. 
</P>
<P>
	--President Clinton is welcome on the Gore campaign trail.  
``He'll help in the future. I don't know how. We haven't talked 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Having served 16 years in the House and Senate, Gore said he  
knows Congress and is well-positioned to make ``a fresh start'' 
after Clinton's acrimonious relations with the Republican 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	--The vice president, who last week pledged, if elected,  
permanently to ban new drilling for oil and gas along the 
California and Florida coasts, implied dissent on Clinton's mere 
extension of a drilling moratorium last year. ``I don't talk about 
my private arguments,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	--He refused to take a position on eliminating Justice Department  
oversight of the Teamsters. The matter, being pressed by the 
powerful labor union at the same time Gore is courting its 
endorsement, should be decided ``on the legal merits not on the 
basis of what I think or what the president thinks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Army Targets Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's new military rulers have  
created an army-appointed body to investigate corrupt politicians 
and recover illicit wealth that could total billions of dollars, a 
private Pakistani newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	A general will head the new panel, The News reported. The report  
said the panel also will have separate, smaller bodies working in 
each of Pakistan's four provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani army chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who overthrew  
Pakistan's civilian government on Oct. 12 in a bloodless coup, has 
made pursuing the corrupt a key promise of his military government. 
Many Pakistanis have welcomed the country's new military rulers, 
saying that successive elected governments led by Benazir Bhutto 
and the recently deposed Nawaz Sharif were rife with corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif, who had become increasingly unpopular despite a  
two-thirds majority that swept him to power in 1997, has been in 
``protective custody'' since the coup while being investigated for 
corrupt practices, army officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif is being held along with several of his Cabinet  
ministers, including the former head of his anti-corruption unit, 
Saif-ur-Rehman. Sharif's brother, Shahbaz, former chief minister of 
Punjab province, Pakistan's largest, also is in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, advertisements have been published in newspapers  
urging Pakistanis who have not paid outstanding bank loans to pay 
up before Nov. 14 or face criminal charges. Unpaid bank loans are 
believed to total $5 billion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Amnesty  
International have demanded Sharif either be charged or released 
immediately. Pakistan's human rights activists, who were loud 
critics of Sharif's ousted government, demanded the ex-premier be 
given immediate access to a lawyer and family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi earlier said Sharif is in  
good health and was being well treated, although no one has seen 
him since his ouster. Quereshi said the men are in custody while 
charges against them are being investigated and to protect them 
against public protests that might erupt against their former 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Pakistan has been peaceful since the coup that ended  
this poor nation's 11-year attempt at establishing democratic rule. 
There have been no demonstrations of protest or support for 
Sharif's government, and small groups of people danced in the 
streets in the southern city of Karachi when the army took over. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League said  
Thursday they would not rally their workers to demonstrate, saying 
they did not want a confrontation with the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan has been ruled by the army for 25 of its 52-year  
history. The last military ruler, Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul Haq, died in 
1988 in a mysterious plane crash, paving the way for the first free 
and fair elections in 11 years. Ms. Bhutto was elected but 
dismissed 20 months later for allegedly engaging in widespread 
corrupt practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people have expressed a desire for early democratic  
elections. Musharraf, the ruling army general, has refused to give 
a time frame for elections.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Orders Freezes in W.Va. Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- State regulators are asking the coal  
industry to inform them of how many mining operations might be 
affected by a judge's order that bans the disposal of mining waste 
in streambeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Division of Environmental Protection will begun a survey of  
mining operations Monday, asking operators to anticipate how the 
ruling will affect them, said DEP spokesman Andy Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Gov. Cecil Underwood on Friday ordered a state  
hiring and spending freeze in preparation for tighter budgets next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide budget cut of as much as 10 percent may be needed  
after Jan. 1, Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our efforts to diversify West Virginia's economy  
produced a budget surplus last fiscal year, despite a $13 million 
shortfall in coal severance taxes, the expected impact of this 
ruling will be much more devastating to the state and local 
budgets,'' Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for environmentalists who sued the coal industry  
last year, U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II ruled Wednesday 
that dumping mining waste in West Virginia's streams fouls the 
water in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bans mining operations within 100 feet of a stream.  
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could all but shut down mountaintop removal mining, a  
strip mining technique used increasingly in Appalachia. The top of 
a ridge is sheared off, the coal is extracted, and the leftover 
rock and dirt are pushed into a nearby river valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of this ruling will be ... devastating to state and  
local budgets,'' Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal industry leaders warned that the ruling could also cripple  
traditional underground mining, which also disposes of waste in 
river valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave us a death sentence, is what they've done,'' said  
Ernest Woods, president of United Mine Workers Local 5958. ``We're 
dinosaurs now. And they'll be going after the deep mines next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is the No. 2 coal-producing state, behind Wyoming.  
The coal industry accounts for 3 percent of all jobs in West 
Virginia, down from 9.5 percent in 1979. The nearly 19,000 jobs 
tied to the industry provided more than $950 million in wages in 
1998, with workers averaging $50,800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had 392 underground mines and 227 strip mines last  
year, with strip mining accounting for less than one-third of West 
Virginia's total production of 181 million tons of coal. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators said they do not yet know exactly how many  
mines are affected by the ruling. But the state Tax Department said 
it could cost West Virginia as much as $100 million this fiscal 
year, out of an annual budget of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia's congressional delegation has asked federal  
regulatory agencies to join in an appeal of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountaintop-removal strip mining is growing in West Virginia, in  
part because that is where the untouched deposits lie and because 
coal companies that practice such mining are often freed from the 
requirement that they restore the land to its approximate original 
contour. 
</P>
<P>
	They simply fill in the nearby stream, leaving terrain that is  
flat or gently rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was upset with the ruling. Cindy Rank, a  
spokeswoman for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, one of the 
environmental groups that sued, was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always believed that the law was meant to protect all  
our resources, including streams and people, much more than has 
been done in the past 10 years,'' Ms. Rank said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Weekly Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Barry Goldwater thought he would be  
running for president against John F. Kennedy, he talked with the 
president and said that they informally agreed to travel together 
in a debate-based campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems a pipe dream in looking at some of today's negative  
campaigning,'' the late Arizona senator wrote of the idea. It 
probably was, even then. And Kennedy was assassinated a year before 
the 1964 election Goldwater lost to a Democratic landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Vice President Al Gore wants weekly debates throughout the  
2000 campaign, an idea he said came to him when he recalled the 
Goldwater-Kennedy story. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that is a pipe dream, too, since challenger Bill Bradley  
is not buying Gore's challenge to debate him every week. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, the vice president  
said that if he wins the Democratic nomination, ``I will make the 
same challenge to the Republican nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean as many as 10 debates between the nominees,  
instead of the customary three, which wouldn't leave much time for 
anything else. ``I'd rather turn campaigns into that than what they 
have become now,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore prods Bradley -- ``I really was surprised when he  
didn't accept -- Republican Steve Forbes has offered to restrain his 
campaign advertising against Gov. George W. Bush in an effort to 
get the GOP front-runner into a series of at least five debates. No 
go there, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and the other four Republicans trying to overtake Bush  
had an hour's debate among themselves in Durham, N.H., on Friday 
night, without breaking new campaign round. They meet again this 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley open at a forum in Hanover, N.H., on Wednesday.  
After challenging Bradley to debate him every two weeks, Gore upped 
it to weekly. He put that to Bradley when they both addressed a Des 
Moines Democratic dinner on Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about it, Bill? If the answer is yes, stand up and wave  
your hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley just smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president began his debate demands after Bradley  
started gaining on him. Bradley has agreed to meet him seven times 
before the New Hampshire presidential primary on Feb. 1. The Gore 
campaign called that timid, saying that there have been more than 
40 invitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Not enough for Gore. ``It's an unusual opportunity to do  
something that's never been done before and that is to have a 
full-blown issues-oriented debate with a different issue each 
week,'' he said in the AP interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Leadership Council is running TV ads mocking the  
Democratic rivals as look-alikes. ``So what are we going to 
debate?'' one ad asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Republicans don't have a similar problem as they debate  
without Bush. After saying that he would wait until next year, when 
people are paying more attention, Bush agreed to appear at a 
90-minute GOP candidate forum in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2. He's 
expected to do one more, in Iowa, in December, and will be in at 
least three early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried for more by saying that if Bush would agree to an  
early series debates, he'd skip the kind of TV attack ads he used 
against GOP rivals in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have this series of in-depth debates, in my ads I'll  
only use material from those debates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush replied that Forbes can advertise as he chooses, that  
negative tactics would backfire and that he will debate on his own 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runners can pick their spots, although not without some  
risk. Ronald Reagan skipped a Republican debate in Iowa in 1980, 
saying it would be divisive. He changed his mind about debates 
after losing the Iowa caucuses that year, and used them to 
advantage in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dukakis probably set the record for debating on his way  
to the 1988 Democratic nomination. He appeared in 21. Gore was 
among the debaters that year, but an early campaign dropout. 
</P>
<P>
	But a record of sorts for memorable tactics in a primary debate  
belongs to a minor candidate in New Hampshire in 1972. At the 
debate table with the Democratic heavyweights, Ned Coll said the 
issue was poverty. He came with a prop to dramatize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time it came his turn to talk, he dangled a rubber rat by  
the tail. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Economist Says Growth Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the American economy, it is the best of times. Incomes are  
up, poverty is down. Our skies and waters are getting cleaner, and 
we are at peace. As the 20th century comes to a close, it's going 
out with a bang in America, at least economically. 
</P>
<P>
	The future ride will not be bump-free. Alan Greenspan can't live  
forever. He could be replaced by a buffoon or the wrong kind of 
intellectual. The Internet will eventually be fully integrated into 
the American economy, and some of those dotcoms without profits 
will ultimately disappear. We could have a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But barring wars or political upheaval, the bumps will be  
modest. Since 1982 we have had one bad year, 1991, and even then 
output was down less than one percent. 
</P>
<P>
	You can argue that the rate of growth in the good times doesn't  
match up to past expansions. But it is still a stunning run of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians want the credit for this performance. Central  
bankers sometimes get it. But the real credit lies with each of us, 
and with a system whose incentives unleash our skills and 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite government paternalism, competition is the norm in most  
industries. To thrive in the marketplace, products must continually 
improve. Faster, better, cheaper or simply more beautiful is the 
marketplace's mantra. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, economic growth has been led by the technology  
and information sectors fueled by venture capital. The venture 
capital market is a microcosm of the competitive nature of the 
system with its risks and rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrepreneurs compete with each other to get access to capital.  
Investors compete with each other to get at the best deals. 
</P>
<P>
	When deals are struck and products or services emerge, investors  
and entrepreneurs are allowed to get filthy rich or lose all their 
money. These incentives mix with the human passion to transform the 
world and give birth to entire industries: e-commerce, 
biotechnology, new types of information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Our venture capital market has no equal anywhere in the world.  
That market, and the stock market at the end of the start-up 
pipeline, creates a dream machine. America is the place of the 
possible, the place where class and background can still be dwarfed 
by a great idea and hours of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the early '80s and even through this decade, the  
Cassandras complained that the economy was in crisis. They 
complained that the debt was too large. They complained that we 
didn't make anything. They complained that we were becoming a 
nation of minimum-wage-earning hamburger-flippers. 
</P>
<P>
	They urged us to emulate Japan with its business-government  
partnership. They urged us to emulate Europe with its 
``progressive'' social services and safety net for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	We ignored the worriers and the hand-wringers. We went our own  
way. Our manufacturers got lean and increased productivity. We 
created millions of new jobs. Almost all are classified as service 
jobs. But few are in fast food. They are webmasters and software 
designers, editors and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Japan is in the throes of an economic malaise with an  
uncertain punch line. Europe struggles with double-digit 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	America leads the knowledge economy. We have only scratched the  
surface in biotechnology and computing. Does the power of Bill 
Gates make you nervous? Rest easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Computing will change in the next five to 10 years, in ways that  
even Gates can't imagine. If Gates sleeps poorly, it's because he 
knows that someone, somewhere, is out there dreaming of an idea 
that will make his technology obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosperity doesn't lift all boats. And because our public  
education betrays our poorest children, not all have the same 
chance to rise on their dreams. But even the industry of education 
may be transformed by the innovation of publicly and privately 
funded vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Our cultural and spiritual challenges remain formidable. But our  
economic future is brighter than ever. The uncontrolled evolution 
of the Internet helps people see that what is unplanned can blossom 
in ways that the controlled cannot. Under free markets, our economy 
is like a rainforest of wild verdant growth alongside the 
occasional failure and extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a remarkably resilient system that is organized --  
yet no one is in charge. If we have the courage to stick with the 
principles that have taken us this far, the talents and creativity 
of our people will take us further still.

<HEADLINE> Selig Unfazed by Steinbrenner Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Baseball commissioner Bud Selig wasn't bothered  
by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's criticism of his refusal to 
let New York add an infielder to their roster for the first two 
games of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Sojo's father died Thursday, and the Yankees wanted to add  
a player because the backup infielder is missing at least the first 
two games of the Series to return to with his father's body to 
Venezuela. Steinbrenner was angry with Selig's refusal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows what the rules are,'' Selig said Saturday before the  
World Series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	While teams may replace injured players, they may not replace  
players in Sojo's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	New York wanted to add D'Angelo Jimenez, who wasn't on the  
Yankees' active roster or disabled list on Aug. 31, the deadline 
for postseason eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees used a loophole in baseball's rules to add Darryl  
Strawberry and Clay Bellinger to their postseason roster, putting 
catcher Vidal Candelaria and Casey Degroote on the 60-day disabled 
list on Aug. 1. Because the two were on the DL, baseball rules 
allowed the Yankees to substitute any two players from their 
organization, even if they weren't on the 40-man roster on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees were told by the commissioner's office that they  
couldn't activate Jimenez unless they cut either Strawberry or 
Bellinger. New York then decided to leave Sojo on the roster for 
the World Series, going a player short for at least the first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems like a rather harsh ruling, as Luis will be  
accompanying the body of his father, Ambrosio, to bring him home to 
Venezuela,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement Friday. ``We feel 
very strongly that this young man's place at this time is with his 
family.''

<HEADLINE> Online Prowler Targets Mass. Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Officials say a 19-year-old quadriplegic from  
Missouri used an Internet chat room to make ``Columbine-like'' 
threats to hurt students and teachers at a Massachusetts middle 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said Saturday that the  
paralyzed teen -- whose name and hometown were not released -- made 
the threats using an America Online chat room frequented by dozens 
of eighth-graders from Townsend's Hawthorne Brook Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities confiscated the Missouri teen-ager's computer on  
Friday and plan to charge him with making threats and possibly 
other charges on Monday, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the teen-ager had been chatting online with the Townsend  
students since September, but midweek, the cyber-relationship 
turned terrifying. Reilly said the man told several students he was 
in their community and he threatened to hurt them, their teachers 
and their school. 
</P>
<P>
	The threats -- which included a list of teachers and students to  
be targeted -- was an act of ``cyberterrorism'' that left the school 
shaken. It may have been a hoax, but ``the fear that was expressed 
by students, parents and teachers in this community was very 
real,'' Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said the students had thought the Missouri teen-ager was  
a peer and included him in their conversations, revealing 
information about their town, their school and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	When the man allegedly directed some students to child  
pornography Web sites a few days ago, some of the children told 
their parents, who then called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend Superintendent of Schools James McCormick said someone  
from the community also received a suspicious phone call that made 
references to the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo., where two students shot and killed 12 students, a 
teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb-sniffing dogs searched the middle school on Thursday, and  
students' bags and backpacks were checked, but nothing suspicious 
was found and school was declared safe, McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, authorities converged on the suspect's home, where he  
lives with his parents, and confiscated his computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said the teen-ager -- paralyzed from the neck down by a  
high school car crash -- admitted communicating with the 
Massachusetts students.

<HEADLINE> McKeon Mulls Reds' Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Manager Jack McKeon was undecided Saturday  
about accepting a one-year contract extension from the Cincinnati 
Reds that didn't meet his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon returned to his home in North Carolina after meeting with  
Reds managing executive John Allen on Friday. The Reds offered a 
one-year extension with a minimal raise, McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll decide in the next few days whether to accept it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got an offer. There was no negotiating,'' McKeon said in a  
telephone interview. ``They said it was a firm offer. There was no 
movement at all on their part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the way you look at it is: It's take it or leave it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Allen has declined to talk about the talks with McKeon. A phone  
message left at his office Saturday was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon, who turns 69 next month, is a leading candidate for the  
NL Manager of the Year award. He led the Reds to 96 victories -- 
their best total since 1976 -- despite a $35 million payroll last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds missed out on the playoffs by losing a one-game  
tiebreaker for the wild-card berth to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon's one-year contract expired at the end of the season, and  
the front office had to wait until a new ownership group took over 
for Marge Schott before talking to McKeon about an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, McKeon made it clear he wanted at least a  
two-year contract and a raise that would put him on par with other 
managers. McKeon made a little more than $500,000 last season in 
base salary and incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' offer reportedly contained a pay increase of about  
$50,000 over last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching other recent manager hires, McKeon expected a  
much better offer. Buddy Bell recently got a three-year contract 
from Colorado reportedly worth $2.25 million, and the Detroit 
Tigers gave Phil Garner a four-year deal reportedly worth $1.2 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' McKeon said of the Reds' offer. ``I thought  
they'd have a better figure than they gave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he got the feeling that the Reds don't want him back,  
McKeon said, ``I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon said no more talks are scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll digest it and think about it over the weekend and see  
what direction we want to go,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-S. Baptist Leader Chides Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Southern Baptist Convention's targeting of  
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims for conversion on their holiest days is 
deliberately aggressive and runs counter to the spirit of the 
Gospel, a former convention official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to cultivate personal relationships rather than launch  
a new crusade that's confrontative and abrasive,'' said Keith 
Parks, who spent 13 years as president of the convention's 
International Mission Board. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the International Mission Board released a booklet  
urging members to pray for Hindus on their major festival, Divali. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the board enraged Jewish leaders by releasing a  
booklet aimed at Jews during the High Holy Days. Earlier, it 
targeted Muslims on Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks compared the efforts to Muslims trying to convert  
Christians to Islam at Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that we do not caricature other religions,'' he  
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention representatives say they don't want to offend, but to  
answer a divine calling -- even in the face of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks makes no apologies for spreading his faith as a missionary  
in Indonesia, but he objects to condemning other religions and 
singling out any group for conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's not sure Hindus, Jews, and Muslims would like his  
claim that he has access to the true God through Jesus Christ, but 
he said it's essential that a Christian's descriptions of other 
faiths be acceptable to members of those faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks said that many Baptists may also disagree with the  
confrontational outreach strategy, but few have said so publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks left the Southern Baptist Convention to join the more  
moderate Cooperative Baptist Fellowship after, he said, he was ``no 
longer acceptable'' to convention leaders who came into power in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were pushing a fundamentalist agenda,'' he said. ``Recent  
convention actions are an expression of that agenda. They emphasize 
more a confrontative kind of evangelism with less emphasis on 
living out the gospel.''

<HEADLINE> Knoblauch Can't Chuck it Anymore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Heads up, Ted!  
</P>
<P>
	When Chuck Knoblauch cuts loose, no telling where the ball might  
end up. Maybe even in the front-row box where Braves owner Ted 
Turner sits, just to the home plate side of the Atlanta dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Knoblauch nearly beaned a fan behind first base  
during warmups at Fenway Park during the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret I've had a problem with my defense,'' the New  
York Yankees second baseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Make that throws, mostly. Sidearm, overhand, underhand. It  
doesn't seem to matter. Somehow, the 1997 Gold Glove winner can't 
chuck it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The throws skip. They sail wide. And those lollipop tosses, the  
ones where he grips the ball with all five fingers like a 
grapefruit -- yikes! 
</P>
<P>
	And now that he's in the World Series, they will be magnified.  
</P>
<P>
	``The attention is the annoyance,'' Knoblauch said before Game  
1. ``When you throw one ball away, it's like your life is coming to 
an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise, Knoblauch spent part of Friday's workout at Turner  
Field looking for Steve Sax. Now a commentator for Fox Sports Net, 
Sax went through a similar spell while playing for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get a chance to talk to him,'' Knoblauch said. ``I  
don't know if he could offer anything or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When approached by a writer in the Atlanta clubhouse, Sax did  
not even wait for the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chuck Knoblauch, right?'' Sax said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of eliminating all possibility of error as far  
as mechanics go,'' said Sax, a former All-Star second baseman like 
Knoblauch. ``Get that down pat, make good throws and get your 
confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other top players have struggled, too. Two-time MVP Dale Murphy  
was forced to move from catcher to the outfield because he couldn't 
get the ball back to the mound. Pitchers Mark Wohlers and Steve 
Blass also suddenly lost their control. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's the perplexing part: In practice and on plays in  
which Knoblauch has to hurry, he usually does all right. It's when 
he has time that the trouble often occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can just get the mental part out of this thing, we'll be  
OK,'' manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees watched in horror in the ALCS as Knoblauch took his  
eye off the target and instead stared at his own right hand as he 
made a throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chuck and I talked again today,'' Torre said Friday. ``We  
talked about that. He probably wasn't realizing he was doing it 
because he knows it's not the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 5, he was pulled in the eighth inning for defensive  
replacement Luis Sojo. But Sojo's father died Thursday, likely 
leaving Knoblauch without any late help in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves certainly are aware of the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how that happens to someone,'' said Atlanta  
advance scout Bobby Wine, a former major league infielder. ``All I 
can tell our guys is to run it out hard if you hit it that way 
because you might get on base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch hit a career-high 18 home runs, and batted .292 with  
28 stolen bases this year. But those are not the numbers that 
caused so much commotion for New York's leadoff man. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch made 26 errors, most by a second baseman this year and  
most by a Yankees player since third baseman Graig Nettles had 26 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	He made 14 throwing errors -- little more than one every two  
weeks -- but that does not count all the poor ones first baseman 
Tino Martinez was able to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time he makes a bad throw, he's like, `I'm sorry,' ''  
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch made only eight errors in 1996, then won the Gold  
Glove with Minnesota in 1997, a season that included a 47-game 
errorless streak. He made 13 errors in 1998 with the Yankees and 
started to show signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch made two errors -- one on a throw -- in 33 chances  
during the first two rounds of this postseason. Another bad throw 
was credited as a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was involved in two key plays that resulted in blown  
calls going against Boston in the ALCS -- he failed to catch a throw 
on a force and missed a tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Knoblauch insists he is fine, Torre said, ``I think  
there's a little something going on in the shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch has a friend who is a sports psychologist, though it's  
not known whether they've talked in detail about this problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have millions of people watching and so many things going  
on in your mind, there's some embarrassment,'' Knoblauch said. 
``I'm open to anything to work it out because it gets 
frustrating.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Republicans on  
Saturday to improve upon their pledges that they would avoid using 
Social Security surpluses to pay for other budget needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can do better,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio  
address, adding that he will submit legislation this week that 
would enact part of a Social Security rescue plan he outlined early 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits  
any government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay 
off the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first big step toward truly saving Social  
Security. It will take the trust fund out beyond the life span of 
the baby boom generation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans previously have rejected the proposal -- first  
mentioned in the president's State of the Union Address -- and 
proclaimed any further discussion of it dead for the year. But John 
Feehrey, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said 
GOP leaders would have another look at Clinton's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, both political parties have used Social Security's  
surpluses to cover spending without diminishing the system's 
benefits. In return, the program gets Treasury bonds to save for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next year's elections, each party is eager to  
cast itself as a defender of the massive pension program for the 
elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have pledged that henceforth,  
they will only spend Social Security surpluses to reduce government 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., used the weekly Republican radio  
address to reiterate the GOP's position on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``surplus must be off limits,'' he said. ``This money must  
not be used to pay for other government spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sparing between Republican lawmakers and the White House over  
fiscal 2000 budget priorities, however, has sparked accusations 
from each side that the other is cheating on that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent television ads and news conferences, Republicans have  
touted their support for a Social Security ``lockbox'' that would 
wall off the program's surpluses. At the same time, they accuse 
Democrats of supporting spending proposals that would eat up the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it happens, neither claim is true,'' Clinton said Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that while the Republican lockbox designates Social  
Security surpluses for debt reduction, it does not specify what 
would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their plan doesn't extend the solvency of Social Security by a  
single day,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying down the debt presumably would allow the government to  
save billions it would otherwise have to pay in interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants use those savings -- $544 billion that  
would accrue between 2011 and 2015 in the form of income tax 
surpluses, according to White House estimates -- to help pay Social 
Security benefits after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that would forestall the date, from 2034 to 2050, that  
the retirement program, burdened by that massive generation, is 
expected to run short of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who want to see tax cuts in coming years, have  
objected to the fact that Clinton's plan would give Social 
Security, which has traditionally been financed with a separate 
payroll tax, a claim on other tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Many GOP lawmakers would prefer to try to raise extra money for  
retirement benefits by letting Americans invest some Social 
Security taxes in individual stock market accounts.

<HEADLINE> 84 Injured in Austria Disco Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Fire swept through two discos packed with  
teen-agers after plastic foam packaging material that had been 
spread out on the dance floors caught on fire, Austrian media 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 84 people injured in the fires were treated for  
minor burns and smoke inhalation and sent home. Three people were 
expected to be hospitalized for several weeks, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger blaze broke out shortly before midnight Friday at the  
Joy Disco in St. Agatha village near Bad Goisern, 120 miles 
southwest of Vienna, during a party in which pieces of plastic foam 
were strewn ankle-deep on the dance floor, the Austria Press Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian radio said the blaze was apparently caused by a burning  
cigarette tossed onto the plastic foam, which the disco management 
had been told was fireproof. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire at the Joy Disco broke out about two hours after a  
blaze had erupted at the Tobago nightspot in Oberndorf, 10 miles 
north of Salzburg on the German border. APA reported that 10 people 
were injured at that disco, where the dance floor was also covered 
with plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries at the Tobago fire were serious, the  
Austrian agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Joy Disco, some 200 people stormed to the emergency exit,  
only to find it blocked by slot machines, Austrian radio reported. 
The crowd jammed the main door, trampling several people, according 
to an Austrian radio reporter at the scene, 
</P>
<P>
	``There was panic. People crawled on top of each other,'' one of  
the rescuers told Austrian radio without giving his name. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 rescuers rushed to the scene. Austrian radio said it  
took firefighters about two hours to bring the blaze under control. 
Fifteen physicians helped those suffering from burns and smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was organized to mark the takeover of the disco by a  
new manager, Austrian radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of the 700 discos and pubs surveyed last  
summer by the Austrian Ministry for Social Affairs were found to 
contain emergency exits that lacked adequate lighting and easy 
access, Austria Press Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Thrive With Hasek on Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Maybe the Buffalo Sabres should bench Dominik Hasek more often.  
</P>
<P>
	With the two-time league MVP and five-time Vezina Trophy winner  
sitting out Friday night, the Buffalo Sabres won for the first time 
since Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals, 7-3 over the Carolina 
Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Sanderson and Erik Rasmussen each scored twice and Michael  
Peca got his first goal of the season for the Sabres (1-5-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were playing with a Stanley Cup hangover, that must have  
been one hell of a party we had,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Biron made 17 saves in place of Hasek.  
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is that we won the game,'' Hasek said.  
``I'm glad for Marty; he did a very good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was benched for the second time following Buffalo's loss  
to Nashville on Wednesday, but will start tonight in Ottawa. Hasek 
was pulled twice from games this season after allowing soft goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom's taken such a beating over the last few days for having a  
couple of bad games,'' Sanderson said. ``His taking all this heat 
deflected a lot of pressure off the rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NHL games, it was Calgary 3, Florida 2 in overtime;  
Dallas 2, New Jersey 1 in OT; Philadelphia 2, N.Y. Rangers 0; and 
Phoenix 6, Los Angeles 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Brown and Miroslav Satan also scored for Buffalo, while  
Sami Kapanen scored twice and Gary Roberts added a goal for 
Carolina (3-2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	``The forwards did as much work in the other team's end as we've  
done in maybe two or three games combined,'' said Ruff, whose team 
scored its most goals since a 7-1 win over Calgary on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's Arturs Irbe was yanked after allowing three goals on  
13 shots in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 *Flames 3, Panthers 2, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	In Sunrise, Fla., Derek Morris scored 20 seconds into overtime  
as Calgary's Grant Fuhr became the sixth NHL goaltender to win 400 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Valeri Bure scored twice for Calgary, giving him eight goals  
this season. His brother, Florida right wing Pavel Bure, missed his 
fourth consecutive game with a strained groin. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Economist Says Growth Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the American economy, it is the best of times. Incomes are  
up, poverty is down. Our skies and waters are getting cleaner, and 
we are at peace. As the 20th century comes to a close, it's going 
out with a bang in America, at least economically. 
</P>
<P>
	The future ride will not be bump-free. Alan Greenspan can't live  
forever. He could be replaced by a buffoon or the wrong kind of 
intellectual. The Internet will eventually be fully integrated into 
the American economy, and some of those dotcoms without profits 
will ultimately disappear. We could have a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But barring wars or political upheaval, the bumps will be  
modest. Since 1982 we have had one bad year, 1991, and even then 
output was down less than one percent. 
</P>
<P>
	You can argue that the rate of growth in the good times doesn't  
match up to past expansions. But it is still a stunning run of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians want the credit for this performance. Central  
bankers sometimes get it. But the real credit lies with each of us, 
and with a system whose incentives unleash our skills and 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite government paternalism, competition is the norm in most  
industries. To thrive in the marketplace, products must continually 
improve. Faster, better, cheaper or simply more beautiful is the 
marketplace's mantra. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, economic growth has been led by the technology  
and information sectors fueled by venture capital. The venture 
capital market is a microcosm of the competitive nature of the 
system with its risks and rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrepreneurs compete with each other to get access to capital.  
Investors compete with each other to get at the best deals. 
</P>
<P>
	When deals are struck and products or services emerge, investors  
and entrepreneurs are allowed to get filthy rich or lose all their 
money. These incentives mix with the human passion to transform the 
world and give birth to entire industries: e-commerce, 
biotechnology, new types of information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Our venture capital market has no equal anywhere in the world.  
That market, and the stock market at the end of the start-up 
pipeline, creates a dream machine. America is the place of the 
possible, the place where class and background can still be dwarfed 
by a great idea and hours of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the early '80s and even through this decade, the  
Cassandras complained that the economy was in crisis. They 
complained that the debt was too large. They complained that we 
didn't make anything. They complained that we were becoming a 
nation of minimum-wage-earning hamburger-flippers. 
</P>
<P>
	They urged us to emulate Japan with its business-government  
partnership. They urged us to emulate Europe with its 
``progressive'' social services and safety net for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	We ignored the worriers and the hand-wringers. We went our own  
way. Our manufacturers got lean and increased productivity. We 
created millions of new jobs. Almost all are classified as service 
jobs. But few are in fast food. They are webmasters and software 
designers, editors and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Japan is in the throes of an economic malaise with an  
uncertain punch line. Europe struggles with double-digit 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	America leads the knowledge economy. We have only scratched the  
surface in biotechnology and computing. Does the power of Bill 
Gates make you nervous? Rest easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Computing will change in the next five to 10 years, in ways that  
even Gates can't imagine. If Gates sleeps poorly, it's because he 
knows that someone, somewhere, is out there dreaming of an idea 
that will make his technology obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosperity doesn't lift all boats. And because our public  
education betrays our poorest children, not all have the same 
chance to rise on their dreams. But even the industry of education 
may be transformed by the innovation of publicly and privately 
funded vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Our cultural and spiritual challenges remain formidable. But our  
economic future is brighter than ever. The uncontrolled evolution 
of the Internet helps people see that what is unplanned can blossom 
in ways that the controlled cannot. Under free markets, our economy 
is like a rainforest of wild verdant growth alongside the 
occasional failure and extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a remarkably resilient system that is organized --  
yet no one is in charge. If we have the courage to stick with the 
principles that have taken us this far, the talents and creativity 
of our people will take us further still.

<HEADLINE> Howard Stern and His Wife Separate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Howard Stern, who bragged of his marital  
fidelity while entertaining scores of strippers and porn stars on 
his radio show, has split with his wife of 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and wife Alison, whose romance was the basis of his film  
``Private Parts,'' are parting as friends, said Dan Klores, a 
spokesman for the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following mediation, both Alison and Howard, who care for each  
other very much, have amicably separated,'' Klores said Friday. 
``They have come to an agreement and settled all of their 
concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement made no mention of a divorce. The couple has three  
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, 45, often complained to his 10 million daily listeners  
about his lack of sex life at home. It wasn't unusual for Alison to 
call in to the raunchy show and rebut his complaints, although she 
hasn't appeared on the air in several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Stern's preoccupation with sex, he repeatedly insisted  
on his syndicated show that he was faithful to his wife.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is  
contributing $20 million to step up the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation's search for new drugs to battle the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the largest gift in the foundation's 44 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``The CF Foundation is a proven leader because of their vision  
and determination to identify the resources and people needed to 
cure this disease,'' said William H. Gates Sr., who is Gates' 
father and co-chairman of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic disease, which affects 30,000 American children and  
young adults, attacks patients' lungs with a thick mucus and most 
die from lung damage or infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant will be used to help researchers develop technology to  
design and screen chemical compounds that offer potential 
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Gehrig Tops All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lou Gehrig narrowly topped Babe Ruth to finish  
first in voting for baseball's All-Century team, with Hank Aaron 
third followed by Ted Williams and Willie Mays. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most controversial selection on the 30-man team announced  
Saturday, banned outfielder Pete Rose was elected to the ninth and 
final outfield spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Four active players were among the 25 elected by fans: New York  
Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, scheduled to start Game 4 of the 
World Series; St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire; Seattle 
outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., and Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr. at 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Five players bypassed by fans were added to the team by a panel  
of experts: shortstop Honus Wagner, outfielder Stan Musial and 
pitchers Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting, sponsored by MasterCard International, was conducted by  
fans from July 13-Sept. 19, and all 18 living members of the team 
are expected to attend on-field ceremonies Sunday night prior to 
Game 2 of the World Series. Fans were asked to pick two players at 
each infield position, two catchers, six pitchers and nine 
outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was invited to the ceremonies, even though he accepted a  
lifetime ban from baseball in 1989 following an investigation of 
his gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it detracts from it at all,'' Braves manager  
Bobby Cox said Friday. ``I know that's going to be a big deal. 
That's fine. I've always liked Pete Rose. I feel bad under the 
circumstances which he stands today. But the rules are the rules. 
If he's allowed to come here, that's great. And I will be the first 
to shake his hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig didn't invite Rose to the  
All-Star game, when the living members among the 100 on the ballot 
were honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attendance at any function like that was forbidden,'' Selig  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's former teammate, Johnny Bench (1,010,403), finished first  
at catcher, easily ahead of Yogi Berra (704,208) and Carlton Fisk 
(322,384). 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig (1,207,992) was tops among first basemen, followed by  
McGwire (517,181) and Jimmie Foxx (351,488). Jackie Robinson 
(788,116) led second basemen, followed by Rogers Hornsby (630,761) 
and Joe Morgan (608,660). 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken (669,033), who switched to third base in recent years,  
topped the voting for shortstops. Ernie Banks (598,168) beat out 
Ozzie Smith (589,025) for second in the closest voting for a spot 
on the team. Wagner was fourth at 526,740. 
</P>
<P>
	In a spot dominated by players from late in the century, Mike  
Schmidt (855,654) led at third base, followed by Brooks Robinson 
(761,700) and George Brett (656,511), with Eddie Mathews (174,529) 
far behind in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth (11,58,044) led the outfielders, followed by Aaron  
(1,156,782), Williams (1,125,583), Mays (1,115,896), Joe DiMaggio 
(1,054,423), Mickey Mantle (988,168), Ty Cobb (777,056), Griffey 
(645,389) and Rose (629,742). 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente (582,937) was 10th, followed by Musial  
(571,279), Shoeless Joe Jackson (326,415) and Reggie Jackson 
(296,039). 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Ryan (992,040) topped pitchers, followed by Sandy Koufax  
(970,434), Cy Young (867,523), Clemens (601,244), Bob Gibson 
(582,031) and Walter Johnson (479,279). 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (431,751), who starts Game 2 of the World Series,  
was seventh, followed by Steve Carlton (405,365), Satchel Paige 
(399,657), Spahn (337,215) and Tom Seaver (330,219). 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson (249,747) was 14th in fan voting and Grove (142,169)  
finished 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Five fans who won a sweepstakes will sit with living members of  
the All-Century team during Game 2.

<HEADLINE> Group Aims To Change College Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In a time when ``student-athletes''  
graduate from college unable to read and when a university athletic 
department rocked by an academic fraud scandal can still post a 
$4.2 million profit, some professors and administrators are through 
suffering in silence. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-day conference, ``Corruption in College Sports: The Way  
Out,'' wrapped up Friday at Drake University with deep feelings 
among the participants that drastic measures must be taken to save 
academics from the poison of big-time sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here because of fraud,'' former LSU basketball coach  
Dale Brown told the nearly four dozen attendees from across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``fraud,'' according to those who attended, ranges from  
adding games to an already overlong schedule, to academic 
counselors who must answer to the athletic department, to coaches 
pocketing money from shoe and apparel contracts without giving a 
cent back to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Ericson, a rhetoric and communications professor at Drake,  
set up the conference to establish radical changes in how 
universities treat athletes and intercollegiate sports. The goal is 
to develop proposals to school presidents and faculty senates 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericson said a permanent group established at the conference,  
the National Association of Faculty Committed to Athletic Reform, 
will meet in three or four months to nail down a final version of 
the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ideas considered are appointing an independent faculty  
committee to review the academic performance of athletes, and 
linking athletes' academic success to the number of athletic 
scholarships an institution may award annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the debate during the conference focused on where the  
blame should lie for the current state of big-time sports on 
campus. The NCAA was a prime target for attack for allegedly 
selling out students and schools in the blind pursuit of money. 
</P>
<P>
	But some professors and administrators saw the fault as lying  
not within the NCAA, but within themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't run fast enough to bring in as much money as we can  
from any source. It has nothing to do with the NCAA,'' said 
Christine Grant, women's director of athletics at Iowa. ``You only 
need to go to our stadium, our arenas to see the effect of 
corporate sponsorship. Believe me, we are concentrating on that 
more and more and more because expenditures are going up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant compared the situation to an ``arms race,'' with no school  
willing to cede the competition the slightest advantage. The result 
is colleges' athletic department budgets are spiraling out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part about it is, it only takes one institution to  
move in a given direction and appear to have a competitive 
advantage and the rest of us run to catch up and, if possible, 
surpass that institution,'' she said. ``You never win. The race is 
never, never over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many conference attendees noted that reforming college athletics  
would seem to be impossible, given the powerful -- and rich -- forces 
which would oppose any threat to the status quo. More than one 
person mentioned CBS' eight-year, $1.73 billion contract for 
television rights to the NCAA basketball tournament 
</P>
<P>
	``In many historical instances, it seemed that social change  
would be virtually impossible: the abolition of slavery, the 
abolition of apartheid, tearing down the Berlin Wall, removing the 
Jim Crow Laws from the South,'' said Rob Benford, a sociology 
professor at Nebraska. ``All these things were thought in their 
time to be virtually impossible to overcome because they were so 
fundamental to the economic interest of their time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we take the attitude that this is impossible because they  
are so powerful and we are so relatively weak, it becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophesy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benford added he'd heard some criticism that those attending the  
conference were against sports. He declared that wasn't the case at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we weren't sports fans, we wouldn't be here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Meets With Gay Christians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who has denounced  
homosexuals for years, held an unprecedented meeting with gay 
Christians on Saturday in an attempt to reduce violent acts against 
gays and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the gathering was productive.  
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of anti-homosexual protesters demonstrated outside,  
yelling at gay supporters as they entered the church parking lot. 
The Rev. Fred Phelps of Topeka, Kan., whose congregation also 
taunted gays at the funeral of slain gay college student Matthew 
Shepard, said Falwell is a hypocrite for meeting with the Rev. Mel 
White, a gay minister, and his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Falwell used to teach the Bible word for word, now he's going  
off and meeting with these fags and going against everything he's 
ever taught,'' Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always says 'hate the sin, but love the sinner,' but it's  
impossible to separate the two. Does a judge send the crime or the 
criminal to jail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell, who has long believed that homosexuality is a sin,  
insists he will not change his views, but has agreed to tone down 
his anti-gay language that gay rights activists say encourages 
hatred and violence toward homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here because innocent people of various faiths, racial  
and ethnic groups, and sexual preferences have increasingly had 
their lives abruptly and violently ended by people with opposing 
views,'' Falwell told the group of 400 delegates in welcoming them 
to the anti-violence forum Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	White brought 200 gays and lesbians from 30 states to  
participate in the forum. They were joined by 200 evangelical 
Christians who support Falwell's stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in our journey towards  
reconciliation,'' said White, who held a prayer vigil Friday night 
for 20 gay men or transgendered people killed because of their 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of each group were paired together at the tables and  
encouraged to get to know each other. The original plan called for 
the delegates to have dinner together, but organizers decided not 
to eat mainly because Bible instructs Christians not to eat with 
sinners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it was not worth distracting from the purpose of  
this meeting to hold a debate over whether it was appropriate to 
serve food or not to serve food,'' said Falwell's spokesman, Mark 
DeMoss. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting, the groups agreed to disagree on whether  
gays can be Christians and focus on ways to deter violence against 
gays and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell cited the September shootings at a Texas church and  
recent school shootings in which Christians were targeted. The 
meeting room was filled with pictures of 100 people who have died 
as a result of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference following the meeting, Falwell and White  
apologized to each other for harsh words they've said about the 
other's groups over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a preacher for 47 years, a preacher of the gospel  
... but in the end homosexuality is wrong,'' Falwell said. ``It is 
my hope that evangelicals might build a bridge of friendship to 
gays and lesbians as we have to alcoholics and unwed mothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, an author and minister with the Metropolitan Community  
Churches, ghost wrote Falwell's autobiography before White admitted 
being gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates from both groups thought the meeting was good.  
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that we could come together and we could agree to  
love each other no matter what our stance is on certain issues,'' 
said Wesley Lewis, a 20-year-old graduate of Falwell's Liberty 
University. ``I understand Mel White and his group a lot better.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Stone Hebron City Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Demanding the mayor's resignation over  
a fatal factory fire, dozens of Palestinians hurled stones at City 
Hall on Saturday before being repelled by guards who shot in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters also stoned city-owned cars and broke windows in  
the building. Eventually, riot police arrived, clashed with 
protesters and took over the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators said Mayor Mustafa Natche must be held  
accountable for Thursday's fire in an unlicensed lighter factory in 
which 14 women workers perished. 
</P>
<P>
	Natche and the city council have been accused of not doing  
enough to close down sweatshops in town that operate without 
permits and lack basic safety features. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Saturday's protests erupted, Palestinian leader  
Yasser Arafat paid a condolence visit to families of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat promised the families that those responsible for the fire  
would be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to investigate,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A committee of four Palestinian Cabinet ministers will  
investigate the fire, and Arafat said he would personally oversee 
the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	According to initial findings, some of the doors were locked  
when the fire broke out in the factory, located on the ground floor 
of a three-story apartment building. Natche has said the owner of 
the building had a permit to sell fruits and vegetables on the 
ground floor, but not to produce cigarette lighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's protest was the second in two days.  
</P>
<P>
	It began when more than 400 Palestinians marched toward City  
Hall. About 60 protesters threw stones at the building, as Natche 
and other employees were inside. Municipal security guards fired in 
the air to disperse the protesters. Some employees threw stones 
from the roof, injuring two protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian riot police armed with clubs and semiautomatic  
weapons scuffled with protesters before taking control of the 
building.

<HEADLINE> KKK Rallies in NYC Amid Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After days of legal maneuvering about their  
rights to rally, Ku Klux Klan members stood silently inside a pen 
fashioned from police barricades on Saturday and literally faced 
the jeers of hundreds of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City succeeded in unmasking the Klan when a federal  
appeals court ruled Friday that the city could refuse to permit the 
event if participants insisted on wearing their traditional hoods. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief scuffle as the 16 Klan members entered the  
police pen set up for their safety outside a courthouse in lower 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	James Sheeley of the New York and New Jersey KKK suffered a  
scrape on his cheek when three men who had posed as Klansmen jumped 
the real Klan members as they walked into the pen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death to the Klan!'' shouted one of the men. All three were  
taken away by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Denied a city permit to use a sound system, the Klan stood  
silently inside the pen, surrounded by police officers in riot 
helmets. The Klan members -- including two women -- were joined by 
two skinheads, one sporting a ``White Power'' patch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get our message out,'' complained Jeffrey Berry, the  
national Imperial Wizard of the American Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan. ``We are silenced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Klan had predicted that up to 80 of its members would  
turn out, barely more than a dozen appeared. Berry said it was the 
ban on masks, not the protesters, that kept attendance down. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally ended after 75 minutes, with the Klan members flashing  
a Nazi salute to the crowd and shouting, ``White pride!'' Police 
escorted the Klan inside the courthouse as the demonstrators 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
	A single person was arrested, though not a Klan member. It  
wasn't immediately clear what the person would be charged with. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of anti-Klan protesters, estimated at about 800  
people, jeered and shouted as the Klan members walked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fired up! No more talk! Klan crawl back under your  
rock!'' they chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those demonstrating against the Klan were several people  
who had argued for their right to rally -- including Rep. Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y., and civil rights lawyer Ron Kuby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We protect the right of free speech even if it is stupid and  
hate speech,'' said Nadler. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Klan rally in New York City since 1990, when  
Klansmen protested the removal of a picture of Jesus Christ from a 
Queens public school, said Laurie Wood of the watchdog group 
Klanwatch. The city has only 35 to 40 KKK members, according to 
Klanwatch. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally followed a legal battle that eventually reached the  
U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani initially 
tried to deny the group a rally permit, but was overruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The city then argued that under an obscure 1845 law, the Klan  
could not gather if they wore hoods that covered their faces. On 
Friday, a federal appeals court upheld the city's position. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan appealed Saturday to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader  
Ginsberg to keep their masks, but Ginsberg turned down the request.

<HEADLINE> 'El Duque' Steps Up Againn for Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez got away with his one mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	He struck out 10 and allowed only one hit in seven innings,  
Chipper Jones' solo homer in the fourth, as the New York Yankees 
beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 in Game 1 of the World Series on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the eighth inning, it looked like Hernandez's bad fastball  
to Jones would overshadow his most dominating postseason start, 
because the Yankees couldn't score off Greg Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sharp right from the get-go tonight,'' manager Joe  
Torre said. ``I really didn't know what to expect. He's still in 
there shaking his head: `Mistake, mistake, mistake.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But after Hernandez was lifted for pinch-hitter Darryl  
Strawberry in the eighth, the Yankees scored four runs to give him 
yet another big playoff win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had enough respect and confidence in my team that I knew if  
I kept it close and I kept us in the game, we'd eventually win,'' 
Hernandez said through a translator. ``With no great disrespect to 
the great pitcher that is Greg Maddux, I just felt that one run 
wasn't going to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In just his second season since defecting from Cuba, ``El  
Duque'' has replaced last year's postseason ace David Wells for the 
Yankees and put his name up there with other great October pitchers 
like Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez is 5-0 in six career playoff starts with a 1.02 ERA,  
trailing only Koufax and teammate Mariano Rivera for the best 
postseason ERA among players with at least 40 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won some big postseason games for us last year, but this  
year he has really become the main man,'' teammate David Cone said. 
``He thinks of himself as one of the best pitchers and we have 
confidence that he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting hammered in two career starts (9.34 ERA) against  
Atlanta, Hernandez showed how different he is in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming from an assortment of arm angles and hiding the ball  
behind his high leg kick, Hernandez kept the Braves off balance. 
Against a team known for its aggressiveness, Hernandez teased the 
Braves with sliders and changeups off the plate and mixed in a 
deceptive fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a lot of funny swings off him,'' Cone said. ``I know  
they faced him in July, but the way they swung they looked like 
they had never seen him before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez's strikeouts were the most for a Yankee in the World  
Series since Bob Turley also had 10 in Game 5 of the 1958 Series 
against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez struck out the side in the first inning, getting  
Gerald Williams and Bret Boone to swing through third strikes and 
Chipper Jones to look at one. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting Eddie Perez to wave at a slider out of the strike  
zone to end the second, Hernandez struck out the side again in the 
third. He made it five in a row when Boone whiffed again to open 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Hernandez made his only mistake. Jones turned on an inside  
fastball and hit a shot halfway up the lower deck in the right 
field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jones rounded the bases, Hernandez stomped his foot on the  
mound and catcher Jorge Posada came out to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see that he was frustrated,'' Cone said. ``But he  
regrouped and held the score at 1-0. Against Maddux, if it had 
gotten to 2-0 or 3-0 it would have been a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posada and Hernandez appear to bicker constantly about pitch  
selection, location and how to approach the hitters. The banter is 
less a sign of disagreement than strategy Posada uses to focus 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pitches better when he's mad, so I try to make him that  
way,'' Posada said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Posada did worked. Hernandez retired the next 10 of he  
next 11 batters after the homer, allowing only a four-pitch walk to 
Jones to open the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, with Hernandez on the mound in October, what else  
could be expected?

<HEADLINE> Rivera: Quiet, Unassuming and Deadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Don't expect Mariano Rivera to insult Atlanta  
fans this week. He surely won't show up the Braves' players after 
striking them out. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're looking for controversy, Rivera's not your man at the  
World Series. If you want reliability, step right up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play an eight-inning game with him, he's that  
dominating,'' Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson said. ``It's a shock if 
he gives up a run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering Game 1 of the World Series against Atlanta tonight,  
Rivera hasn't allowed a run since July 21 -- throwing 38 1-3 
consecutive scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Metallica's ``Enter Sandman'' blares through Yankee Stadium when  
he enters the game, but it is a song Rivera did not choose and does 
not fit his unassuming personality. He's such a sure bet that the 
song incites fans to pack up instead of scream along. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win it unless you finish it,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``He has basically done all of the high-wire stuff 
without the net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a role often filled with loud-talking characters who draw  
attention to themselves, Rivera is something of an oddity. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect him to call opposing fans ``stupid,'' like  
Atlanta's John Rocker. He's not going to point at batters after 
striking them out, the way Dennis Eckersley did. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if Rivera and Rocker were to walk down Manhattan's  
Fifth Avenue, more New Yorkers would probably recognize the Braves' 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not cocky,'' Rivera said. ``I don't have a big head.  
That's not me. I just love to help the team in the best way I can 
do it. And that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup between Rivera and Rocker, two opposites who have  
led their teams this postseason, will be one of the keys to the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	With two teams that have nearly equal starting pitching and  
powerful lineups, the bullpens -- especially the closers -- could be 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``He means everything,'' teammate David Cone said of Rivera.  
``He's why we've won two World Series, why we're here right now. 
Our starting pitching has put us into position to win games. But we 
haven't gone nine innings very often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	October has been the month to shine for Rivera, who has gone  
from throwing coconuts in his native Panama to becoming the best 
closer in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He has allowed two earned runs in 42 2-3 innings in the  
playoffs. His 0.42 ERA is the lowest of anyone with at least 30 
innings and he joins Babe Ruth, Sandy Koufax and teammate Orlando 
Hernandez as pitchers with sub-1.00 ERAs in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera has grown from an unknown rookie who blew fastballs by  
the Mariners in 1995, to an overpowering set-up man in 1996, to a 
closer who failed in 1997, to an efficient machine the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his ability to come back from a devastating blown  
save -- New York's only one in the last four postseasons -- that 
might be most impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera won't talk about Sandy Alomar's eighth-inning homer in  
Game 4 in the first round in 1997 that gave the Indians the 
momentum and eventually the series. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also has never let it affect him either, unlike Mitch  
Williams and Donnie Moore, who never recovered from postseason 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees weren't sure Rivera had put Alomar's homer behind  
him until last year's playoffs, when he pitched 13 1-3 scoreless 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key might have come earlier that season, when he started  
using a cut fastball, as well as his high heater. 
</P>
<P>
	``He found he had the movement on the fastball, instead of just  
rearing back and throwing the four-seamer and thinking strikeout, 
strikeout, strikeout,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera still throws that 97 mph fastball when he needs it. But  
he has started relying more on the cutter that is nearly as hard 
and bores in on left-handers, shattering their bats to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cutter is unhittable, especially for lefties,'' Atlanta's  
Brian Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	So what's the trick to beating Rivera?  
</P>
<P>
	``The only trick against him is not letting him get into the  
game,'' Atlanta's Bret Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Braves might have more than that. They're the last  
team to really hit him, scoring four runs in one inning on July 16 
for Rivera's last blown save. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that midseason slump, when he blew three saves in five  
chances, Rivera has converted 26 straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable,'' Rivera said. ``I'm not saying I feel  
unhittable, but I feel comfortable. When you're feeling 
comfortable, that gives you confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when's he confident, so are the Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Hamed Defeats Soto on Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- They called the referee names. They called each  
other names. Too bad their bout didn't match the post-fight debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamboyant WBO featherweight champion Prince Naseem Hamed and  
WBC titleholder Cesar Soto did more wrestling than boxing in their 
unification match Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamed won by unanimous decision, and as a result, almost no one  
went home happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a paper champion,'' Soto, from Mexico, said through an  
interpreter. ``I know in my heart that I'm the real champion 
because I came to fight. He came to wrestle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I was fighting a fighter or Hulk Hogan.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Arum, who runs Top Rank Boxing and promotes Soto, called it  
the worst fight he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me puke,'' Arum said. ``That wasn't boxing. That was  
wrestling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamed said it was Soto, who has never been knocked out, who  
started the rough stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Arum was watching a totally different fight,'' Hamed said.  
``He just didn't want his guy to get beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamed, an Englishman of Yemeni descent, was clearly the favorite  
of the Joe Louis Arena crowd, announced at 12,500. There are an 
estimated 250,000 to 300,000 people of Arab heritage in the Detroit 
area and chants of ``Naseem, Naseem'' echoed around the arena as 
the fight wore on. 
</P>
<P>
	With celebrities like retired Detroit Lions running back Barry  
Sanders, local boxing favorite Thomas Hearns and heavyweight Lennox 
Lewis looking on, Hamed cut his entrance -- which can last up to 10 
minutes -- to just four. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it looked like he was still playing for entertainment  
alone as the fight started slowly with few punches thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamed used his quickness to dance out of harm's way most of the  
night, to the chagrin of the crowd which had been primed by an 
exciting fight during which Mexican Erik Morales won a 12-round 
decision over Irishman Wayne McCullough in the preceding bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hamed is a very difficult fighter,'' said Morales, who stayed  
to watch the main event. ``But he doesn't come to fight. He doesn't 
want to get hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Dale Grable took one point away from Hamed for holding  
Soto in the fourth round. In the fifth, Hamed flipped Soto over his 
shoulder and body-slammed him to the mat -- and lost another point 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``The referee was inept,'' Soto said. ``A real referee would  
have disqualified Hamed when he threw me in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Steward, the trainer for Hamed and founder of Detroit's  
famed Kronk Gym, rushed across the ring between rounds and yelled 
at Soto's trainer that the Mexican was fighting dirty, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a beautiful fight,'' Steward said. ``But, a lot of  
fights are different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soto was pushed to the mat coming out of a clinch during the  
eighth round, and lost a point later in the round for a head butt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he got away with what he did,'' said Hamed,  
heavily bankrolled by HBO, which televised the bout. ``I 
body-slammed him. I'm not going to say I didn't. But he brought it 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 12th successful defense for Hamed (33-0), his 14th  
in world championship fights. It was the first attempt at a title 
defense for Soto (53-8-2), who took the crown from Luisito Espinosa 
in May.

<HEADLINE> Models' Eggs To Be Auctioned On-Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A fashion photographer, hoping to cash  
in on would-be parents' wishes for a beautiful baby, is offering 
the eggs of eight models in an on-line auction set to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility groups have expressed disgust at the offer, saying  
it turns human life into a commodity. But photographer Ron Harris 
says his offer is a reflection of American society, where beauty 
can be purchased by the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, www.ronsangels.com, has pictures of eight models  
offering their eggs for sale. The bids start at $15,000 and can go 
as high as $150,000. Harris told The New York Times in a story 
published Saturday that the Web site had already received a serious 
bid of $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The models receive the full amount offered; bidders must pay  
Harris' organization an additional 20 percent service fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unethical and it's distasteful,'' Sean Tipton, spokesman  
for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility specialists are increasingly concerned about putting  
a price tag on human eggs. This spring, for example, a couple 
advertised that they would pay $50,000 for eggs donated from an 
athletic student from a top college. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law forbids the purchase and sale of human organs, but  
trafficking in sperm and eggs is legal, infertility experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is a Malibu, Calif., photographer whose work includes  
fashion photos, television directing for Playboy and exercise 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site boasts that the models are ``beautiful and  
healthy'' and subject to rigorous health examinations. In a letter 
on the site, Harris describes the egg auction as ``Darwin's Natural 
Selection at its very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says society's obsession with appearance has made us stronger  
and healthier, and he pitches the egg auction as a chance for 
parents to give their children an advantage in society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every organism is evolving to its most perfect state,'' Harris  
writes. ``Finding traits that 'repair' your genetic flaws is what 
we are all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The models could not be reached for comment Saturday, but on the  
Web site, each gives reasons for selling her eggs, ranging from 
``to not be dependent on a man,'' to ``I want to help others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Etcoff, the Cambridge-based author of ``Survival of the  
Prettiest: The Science of Beauty,'' says it's natural to consider 
how your mate's attractiveness will be reflected in your children. 
But she said such direct marketing of beauty is a false promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way that we inherit features is sort of a genetic roll of  
the dice,'' Etcoff said. ``This really is buying beauty for our 
offspring. Clearly, these offspring might not be beautiful at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the egg auction, the Web site says an auction of  
male models' sperm is being planned, with bids from $10,000 to 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg donation has been largely an act of altruism until now,  
Tipton said. He said eggs donors typically are paid $2,500 to 
$5,000 for their time and inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the medical community rejected the idea of  
selling human body parts, eBay, the world's leading Internet 
auction site, has banned the sale of eggs, sperm and human organs 
on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as a society seem to have come to the conclusion that it's  
not appropriate to traffic in body parts,'' Tipton said.

<HEADLINE> Bullish Economist Awaits Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The U.S. economy continues to defy what most economists  
previously believed to be well-established laws. This has prompted 
optimists among us to declare that the soul of the economy has 
escaped the earthly constraints of past business cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	I doubt that this is the case.  
</P>
<P>
	There is certainly some evidence to support the claim that we  
have entered a new era: declining and then stable inflation since 
1990, steadily increasing investment in growth-producing capital, a 
long-awaited surge in productivity, a passage from federal 
government deficits to surpluses, an impressive and continuing 
growth in jobs at a time of low unemployment and, last but not 
least, an unprecedented rise in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it is the role of the stock market that is probably least  
understood, least appreciated, and therefore, most worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	We know that as apparent wealth in the form of stocks and real  
estate increases, consumption increases. Since consumption is the 
largest component of our economy's total demand, increases in stock 
prices, and more recently real estate prices, have contributed to 
steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But since investors are reluctant to cash in their shares, the  
increased spending must come from additional borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The private savings rate has now turned negative. For the first  
time in recent history, households as a whole are spending more 
than their incomes. There is nothing inherently wrong with this -- 
if the wealth is real. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, as a society we may believe we are borrowing to  
invest in assets that will pay off handsomely in the future, 
allowing us to repay the loans and still consume more now and 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the individual investor, U.S. corporations play a  
key role in this process. Firms make decisions to invest in 
growth-producing real assets with funds we leave in the stock 
market. They also borrow some of the money, contributing to the 
need for higher future payoffs before cash in the form of dividends 
can find its way back to the stockholders and into consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the firms' investment decisions produce payoffs that  
are less than those anticipated by the stockholders? This could 
very well be the situation today. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, stockholders have demanded returns well in excess  
of those available on government bonds. A recent survey of 
individual investors indicates that they expect returns of about 15 
percent over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the current price-earnings' ratios on stocks  
indicate that investors are naively expecting firms to earn totally 
unrealistic returns on their plowed-back earnings. When it becomes 
evident that this isn't in the cards, the stock market could be in 
for a rough time. 
</P>
<P>
	The most optimistic argue that as long as investors have a long  
horizon, they no longer should demand significantly higher returns, 
and that this fact alone accounts for the high level of stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	While this may be theoretically correct, anecdotal evidence  
suggests the opposite. Investing in the stock market seems to have 
become almost a fad, and it is doubtful that stockholders are 
expecting future returns as low as this argument requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the problem is the fact that firms appear to be taking  
the high level of stock prices as evidence that investors have 
lowered their requirements. Corporations are re-investing an 
all-time high percentage of their earnings in new capital assets 
(or buying back their own stock). 
</P>
<P>
	In the short-run, this has the effect of sustaining the  
appearance of being in a ``New World'' of unlimited growth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the most pessimistic argue that current stock  
market prices reflect a bubble. Investors are unconcerned with 
future corporate earnings, but they believe that prices will 
continue to rise because the market expects them to. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas fads can be sustained for longer periods, bubbles burst  
suddenly, as in the United States in 1929 and in Japan at the end 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the rising market is due to a bubble or a fad is not the  
most important point. In either case, a correction is inevitable, 
and it is the unwinding of the process now generating the apparent 
wealth that will have serious economic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	As market forces destroy the perceived wealth, consumption and  
investment will fall at the same time that the debt taken on by 
individuals and firms remains as a huge overhang. A subsequent 
recovery will eventually come, but most likely will be distant and 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, this process has been called the business cycle.  
When we consider the role the stock market has played in the recent 
prolonged period of economic expansion, there is little reason to 
believe nirvana has been achieved -- at least this time around.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Wisc. 40, No. 11 Mic. St. 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Ron Dayne ran Michigan State into the  
ground while running back into the Heisman Trophy race. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne rushed for 214 yards and two touchdowns as No. 17  
Wisconsin shredded the nation's best run defense and routed No. 11 
Michigan State 40-10 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez became the winningest coach in school  
history with his 67th victory, which he got while sitting in the 
press box to rest a sore knee. Alvarez passed Phil King, who won 66 
games near the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State allowed 279 rushing yards in its first seven  
games. The Badgers racked up 301, including touchdowns runs of 51 
and 15 yards by Dayne, who had just one of his 34 carries in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After a string of mediocre performances that put his season  
goals in jeopardy, Dayne was in top form during Wisconsin's last 
two home victories. The Spartans' front seven was thought to be one 
of the best in the country, but Michigan State had almost no 
success in containing Dayne. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne passed Charles White for third place on the major-college  
career rushing list, and moved within 483 yards of Ricky Williams' 
record. Dayne must average 161 yards in Wisconsin's final three 
games against Northwestern, Purdue and Iowa to set the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Jamar Fletcher intercepted two passes for the Badgers  
(6-2, 4-1 Big Ten), who got their fourth straight conference 
victory with a second straight overwhelming performance. Wisconsin 
beat Indiana 59-0 last week and led the Spartans 33-3 early in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the trash-talking, high-fiving Spartans  
(6-2, 3-2) were undefeated and talking about a national 
championship run. But consecutive humbling losses to Purdue and 
Wisconsin have knocked Michigan State all but out of the national 
and conference title hunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne broke free for a 51-yard touchdown run on the Badgers'  
opening possession of the game and, after two field goals by Vitaly 
Pisetsky, Bobby Myers intercepted Bill Burke's pass deep in 
Michigan State territory. That set up Dayne's second TD run early 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin jumped to a 23-0 halftime lead and put the game away  
with two clock-eating drives in the third quarter. The Badgers held 
the ball for 13:56 in the third, making scoring drives of 14 and 13 
plays around a three-and-out series by the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	Pisetsky tied a Wisconsin record with four field goals,  
including a 23-yarder on the first play of the fourth quarter that 
made it 33-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans' offense was woeful, as Burke threw three  
first-half interceptions and Michigan State rushed for just 42 
yards in the first three quarters before finishing with 110. 
Freshman tailback T.J. Duckett's 53-yard TD run midway through the 
fourth quarter was Michigan State's only bright spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke's efforts to find his favorite receiver, Plaxico Burress,  
were also disastrous. The Badgers intercepted three passes intended 
for the 6-foot-6 Burress in the first half, when Fletcher had as 
many catches (two) as Burress, who finished with five catches for 
58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman quarterback Brooks Bollinger had a 1-yard touchdown run  
and threw for 59 yards, although Wisconsin's ground game was so 
successful the Badgers rarely needed to throw. Badgers punter Kevin 
Stemke uncorked an 86-yard punt in the fourth quarter, the longest 
at Wisconsin since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State's first points came on a 55-yard field goal by  
Paul Edinger late in the first half. The kick, aided by a strong 
tailwind, was the longest in Camp Randall Stadium history.

<HEADLINE> Possible Hepatitis At SeaWorld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- As many as 250 people who dined at a SeaWorld  
restaurant earlier this month may have been exposed to hepatitis A 
from an infected employee, county health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	People who ate Caesar salad, watermelon, dinner salad or  
strawberries at Mama Stella's Italian restaurant on either Thursday 
or Oct. 11 may have been exposed, said Michele Ginsberg, an 
epidemiologist in the county's Health and Human Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests confirmed Friday that a 40-year-old restaurant employee  
contracted the virus. The worker is now on medical leave, SeaWorld 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	No other employee or visitor has been diagnosed with hepatitis  
A. Symptoms of the viral infection of the liver include abdominal 
discomfort, diarrhea, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, fatigue 
and dark urine. 
</P>
<P>
	SeaWorld planned to offer free shots of gamma globulin at a San  
Diego clinic to customers who believe they may have been exposed.

<HEADLINE> Sides Try To Avoid Strike in Hawaii </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Contract talks resumed Saturday between four  
island shipping companies and unionized dockworkers, the first 
formal negotiating session in more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii Employers Council and International Longshore and  
Warehouse Union Local 142 were back at the bargaining table one day 
after all 507 of the union's members completed voting to authorize 
a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii gets 90 percent of all its goods via ship, and fears of a  
strike have led to some people hoarding food, toilet paper and 
other necessities. Hawaii's docks were shut down for five months in 
1949, and for 100 days in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Before talks began at union headquarters, both sides expressed  
hope a deal could be reached and a strike avoided, and pledged to 
talk as long as it takes to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're far apart,'' union president Eusebio Lapenia said. ``But  
hopefully we can settle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After four months of negotiating, ``both sides know what the  
issues are,'' Lapenia said. ``It's either we get it done or we 
don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management wanted talks to resume earlier this week, said Tim Ho  
of the Hawaii Employers Council, which negotiates for Matson 
Terminals Inc., Hawaii Stevedores Inc., HT&AMP;T Co. and McCabe 
Hamilton and Renny Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's really key here is both parties are back to the table.  
If we don't get back to the table, it's hard for us to reach a 
settlement,'' Ho said. ``I can't predict if it will be quick or 
not, but we will stay with it until we are done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers are seeking 8 percent pay raises over three years,  
saying that's what their West Coast counterparts received in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last three negotiations, we gave some concessions,'' said  
Nate Lum, chairman of the union negotiating committee. ``Our 
members weren't too happy ... but we did what was right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they need to do something for the little guy.''  
</P>
<P>
	The last contract expired June 30. Both sides extended the deal  
until Monday, when the union terminated the agreement after giving 
72 hours notice. The move allowed the union to avoid following a 
federal judge's order to stop a work slowdown that caused delays in 
unloading ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side will discuss specific salary figures, but published  
reports said Hawaii dockworkers received anywhere from $55,000 to 
$150,000, depending on their job, hours and overtime.

<HEADLINE> Co. Gives Same-Sex Partners Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. has joined the growing number of  
major corporations that extends health-care benefits to the 
same-sex domestic partners of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the need to maintain a quality work force and the  
benefits of diversity, Boeing announced late Friday plans to offer 
the benefits next year to the domestic partners of salaried 
nonunion employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced to company managers by e-mail, was  
praised by gay rights advocates. But it was criticized by union 
leaders for leaving out their members and unmarried heterosexual 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Annetta Small, director of the West Coast office of Kerusso  
Ministries, which seeks to persuade gays and lesbians to become 
heterosexual through Christianity, also was critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are giving benefits to a behavior that I believe is wrong  
and that I believe is immoral,'' she said. ``I don't believe that 
we should extend these benefits to people who are not married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not say how many employees would be  
affected. Roughly half of Boeing's 202,000 employees worldwide are 
salaried and nonunion. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Forbes Magazine survey indicated unmarried partners are  
covered by health benefits in 10 percent of the businesses with at 
least 200 employees. Companies that provide same-sex partner 
benefits include Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., IBM, 
Walt Disney Co., Honeywell and Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, United Airlines agreed to extend some benefits to  
domestic partners, just hours after an appeals court refused to 
grant the company an exemption to a San Francisco ordinance 
mandating certain benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two weeks of United's decision, American Airlines and US  
Airways also adopted the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's decision was long overdue, said Charles Fay, chairman  
of Hands-Off Washington in Snohomish County, and Dennis Rybicki, a 
spokesman for the Snohomish County Elections Committee, which ranks 
political candidates on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should send a signal to other employers, large and small,  
that it's good business to recognize the value of all families,'' 
Fay said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Society of Professional  
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, Charles Bofferding, said his 
union would like the benefits, but the move seemed to be designed 
to sabotage his group's contract negotiations, which begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	SPEEA is the second-largest union at Boeing, representing 23,000  
scientists, engineers and technical workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bofferding said by leaving out union members, Boeing may be  
trying to get the union to give up other potential bargaining 
demands in exchange for obtaining health-care benefits for same-sex 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Conte said the benefits will not be offered to unmarried  
heterosexual partners because they can get married, an option not 
legally available to same-sex partners.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Ready To Discuss bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- In a surprise announcement,  
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army said Saturday it would be willing 
to talk with the United States, saying the agenda was open-ended 
and could include suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government says bin Laden masterminded the twin  
bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year and wants 
him deported to the United States to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to solve all the issues with America, including  
that of Osama bin Laden,'' the Taliban's Information Minister Amir 
Khan Muttaqi said in a statement. He did not elaborate or promise 
to hand over bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban had refused to hand over bin Laden, saying they have  
no extradition treaty with the United States and Washington has not 
proven bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttaqi said the Taliban wanted good relations with the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. State Department had no immediate response to the  
Taliban offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has imposed economic sanctions on the Taliban,  
who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan. The United Nations is 
threatening limited sanctions against the Taliban if they do not 
hand over bin Laden by Nov. 14, a deadline the Taliban has already 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our policy to have good relations with all the countries  
of the world, especially with the United States,'' said Muttaqi. 
``We want to solve the issue of bin Laden with America, but that 
has to be in line with our Islamic law and the Afghan culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban say they have tried bin Laden in an Islamic court  
and have found him innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	They also say bin Laden is not allowed to use Afghan soil for  
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready for talks to remove all the concerns of the  
United States,'' Muttaqi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and mostly Pashtun, the country's  
majority ethnic group. They are fighting northern-based opposition 
for complete control of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Tainted Milk Kills 28 Peruvian Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- At least 28 children collapsed and died in a  
remote Andean village in Peru, apparently after being served 
insecticide-tainted milk at school. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, ranging in age from 5 to 15 years old, received  
the powdered milk Friday in the school of their rural village, said 
Dr. Holguer Lovon, director of the regional hospital in Cuzco, 350 
miles southeast of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	The milk apparently had been prepared in a pot that had earlier  
been used to mix insecticide for fumigating crops, he told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 20 children were being treated for poisoning. Two  
children were listed in critical condition, Lovon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, from Taucamarca, 40 miles southeast of Cuzco, were  
fed their breakfast of bread and milk at midday. They began showing 
symptoms of the poisoning on their way home from school. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Russia Planes Said Shot Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechen fighters claimed they shot down  
two Russian warplanes in separate incidents Saturday, and 
government forces bombed and fired rockets on rebel positions in 
the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes come amid growing foreign criticism of the Russian  
offensive. Russian officials defended the Chechnya operation, 
saying it was a war against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen Health Ministry said that 163 people had been killed  
and 380 injured by Russian air and artillery bombardment on Friday 
and Saturday, the Interfax news agency reported. The toll could not 
be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Chechen fighters dug trenches in Grozny, the  
capital. Commanders have said they expected an assault by Russian 
troops that were massed less than eight miles from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media reported that some 10,000 more soldiers were being  
sent to Chechnya to bring the total troop strength to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some official Chechen agencies including the traffic police have  
been evacuated from their Grozny headquarters. Civilians continued 
to leave Grozny on Saturday, fearing an attack by Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen command said its troops shot down one fighter-bomber  
north of Grozny, and a second jet was downed southwest of the 
Chechen capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's air force said its planes had bombed rebel bases  
Saturday, but denied it had lost any planes. Chechen fighters have 
shot down three Russian warplanes in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the first plane was seen bailing out and appeared  
to have landed behind Russian lines, while the fate of the crew of 
the second jet was unknown, the Chechen command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia sent troops into Chechnya at the end of September,  
following weeks of airstrikes, with the declared aim of eliminating 
militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer and were 
blamed for a series of apartment explosions in Russia that killed 
some 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But increasingly, the Russian offensive appears aimed at  
restoring control over Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, on a visit to Kenya,  
said the Russian attacks were ``deplorable and ominous.'' She said 
the events of the past two days -- including the Thursday night 
bombing of a Grozny market that killed at least 143 people -- were 
of ``grave concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder condemned the  
``massacre on the Grozny marketplace'' and German politicians urged 
sanctions against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, in an interview with the  
Bild am Sonntag newspaper, called for freezing Western loans to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials reacted angrily to the foreign criticism.  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told European and Mideast policy 
makers in Mallorca that the only way to protect Russian security 
was through ``war against the terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of parliament,  
said neither the United States nor any other NATO country has ``the 
moral right to tell Russia how to settle the acute conflict in the 
North Caucasus,'' since they had bombed Yugoslav forces during the 
Kosovo crisis this spring, Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, bombs were heard exploding north of Grozny, and a  
spokesman at Chechnya's operational press service said that Russian 
artillery had targeted the city of Argun, 10 miles east of Grozny, 
in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces had taken control  
of the entire border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, to the 
northwest, to prevent incursions of Chechen guerrillas to carry out 
terrorist acts in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Goalie Signs $8.4M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Panthers goaltender Trevor Kidd  
took a short-term pay cut, signing a long-term contract Saturday 
that will keep him with the team through the 2002-03 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd signed a four-year, $8.4 million deal, which includes a  
base salary of $1.5 million this season and $2.3 million each of 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd agreed to the new deal before training camp in August.  
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Kidd would have made $2 million in base salary  
this season, but the contract was only a two-year deal, which he 
signed with Carolina last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They approached me, and I took a little cut from what I was  
supposed to make this year in order to do it,'' Kidd said. ``But it 
was a good thing for me and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd, who is 4-1-1 with a 1.96 goals-against average this  
season, was traded to the Panthers from Atlanta on the day of the 
expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> 100 Years on a Plastic Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This is a story about billiard balls, false teeth and a triumph  
of failed research. In short, it's about how plastics came to be. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, it's about chemistry.  
</P>
<P>
	What makes plastic plastic is the molecules -- made from atoms of  
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other stuff. The molecules are 
immense, often resembling chains, sometimes with side-chains or 
ring structures sticking out like legs on a centipede. These side 
structures can prevent the main chains from packing close together 
in an orderly way. That makes plastic flexible and often 
transparent. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes certain plastics hard is letting the molecule chains  
snarl together like a pile of spaghetti -- very stiff spaghetti. If 
these strands slip when heated, the plastic can be remolded. But if 
they won't budge, the plastic keeps its original shape. 
</P>
<P>
	We think of plastic -- its name from the Greek plastikos, meaning  
shapeable -- as the ultimate synthetic material, a landmark in the 
striving to outdo nature. But the earliest manmade plastics owe a 
lot to nature, specifically cellulose, the main stuff of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1862, British chemist Alexander Parkes announced he had  
modified a cellulose-based mixture called collodian that doctors 
used to cover cuts. The new stuff, Parkesine, could be warmed and 
then molded into shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkes' company went broke, but American inventor John Wesley  
Hyatt struck gold through his own tinkering with collodian. Going 
after a $10,000 prize offered for a substitute for ivory to use in 
billiard balls, he created celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
	It quickly became a material for combs, shirt collars, movie  
film and more. Still, it had some big problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, people who used celluloid plates to hold their  
false teeth found that when they drank hot tea, the plates warped. 
The good news was that the stuff wouldn't blow up, as the New York 
Times felt compelled to assure its readers in an 1875 editorial 
titled, ``Explosive Teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But celluloid presented a very real hazard. Early movie film  
could burst into flames in projectors. It was succeeded by ``safety 
film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until this century did inventors began to make plastics  
completely from synthetic materials. The first, announced in 1909, 
was Bakelite. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakelite was an accident, the result of a failed quest. Its  
inventor, American chemist Leo Baekeland, was trying to find a 
substitute for shellac. The sticky, amber-colored stuff he got by 
mixing phenol and formaldehyde didn't work for that. But he came to 
realize it was great plastic: It was cheaper than celluloid and 
could be quickly molded into hard shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, as Baekeland's company proclaimed, ``The Material of a  
Thousand Uses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It found its way into radios, light sockets, jewelry,  
telephones, washing machines, fishing reels, guns. Bakelite ``set 
the mold for the modern plastic industry,'' says the American 
Chemical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	More plastics followed in the early 20th century, like  
Cellophane, the invention of a Swiss textile engineer, Jacques 
Brandenberger, who wanted to keep wine spills from spoiling 
tablecloths. The 1930s brought nylon, Teflon, the clingy wrap 
material Saran and polyethylene, widely used in things like milk 
jugs and grocery bags. By 1940, Henry Ford could swing an ax 
against a prototype plastic car to show how tough it was. 
</P>
<P>
	As for that ancestral stuff, celluloid -- you can still use it.  
Every time you whack a pingpong ball.

	The plastic seat-back tray was returned to an upright position.  
The plastic airsickness bag was properly stowed. The plastic 
``FASTEN SEAT BELT'' light turned off. The 767 -- with its two tons 
of plastic components -- was at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Up went the plastic shade. Sunlight passed through the plastic  
window. 
</P>
<P>
	A ground crewman, with plastic windslicker and earphones, rode a  
cart beneath the plastic-coated wing-flaps. The turbines, their 
plastic nacelle components cooling, stopped spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	As passengers stood, a man wrestled with the plastic zipper on  
his jacket. A woman removed plastic earplugs. A baby sucked from a 
plastic bottle. A teen-ager passed plastic bristles through her 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	From the plastic overhead compartments, passengers retrieved  
plastic laptops, plastic suit bags, plastic duty-free bags -- some 
of the 225 billion pounds of plastic stuff the world consumes each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone filed between rows of plastic floor lights and out into  
the plastic jetway. The joints of a plastic baby carriage creaked 
as it rolled over a plastic ramp and into the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	A voice buzzed through a plastic overhead speaker. On a counter  
gleamed one of the 10 billion plastic Coke bottles made this year. 
A girl holding a plastic doll reached for plastic-wrapped candy. 
Taking her mother's bills, the clerk clacked plastic cash-register 
keys and scooped coins from a plastic tray. 
</P>
<P>
	A flight attendant standing at a pay phone swiped a plastic card  
through a slot, pressed 7 plastic buttons and spoke into a plastic 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	At the men's room sink, one man put in his plastic contact  
lenses (33.2 million made annually). Another adjusted his plastic 
teeth. A janitor swept with a plastic broom. 
</P>
<P>
	At a concourse hotdog stand, a vendor pulled plastic wrap from a  
package of buns, an ounce or less of the yearly 13.8-billion-pound 
output of flexible plastic packaging, and tossed it in a plastic 
trashcan lined with a plastic bag. A customer undid a plastic 
button at his cuff, rolled up his sleeves and squeezed mustard from 
a plastic bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic suitcases, some with plastic wheels, some wrapped in  
plastic sheeting, appeared on a plastic belt.

<P>
	A plastic EXIT sign showed the way out. Plastic doors slid open.

<P>
	``Cabs to Manhattan?''

<P>
	A man cupped his hands around a plastic lighter, lit a  
cigarette, pointed to a plastic dispatcher's booth. Something 
yellow, plastic, poked out from behind it -- a bumper (value of the 
automotive plastics industry: $3 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	The cab's plastic seat was hot. The plastic air conditioning  
vent was closed. From the plastic divider stared a plasticized 
photo of the driver. He pushed a plastic button on a meter. The

	Scott Reilly's life is plastic. His Atlanta store,  
Retromodern.com, is stuffed with things artificial and exuberant 
and, always, polymer-based. The man occupies a plastic cosmos -- 
fiery oranges, fierce greens, passionate purples. A lemon in a 
shiny Melamine bowl. ``That's sexy!'' Reilly enthuses. 
</P>
<P>
	He's right, of course. Extruding our way to a better tomorrow,  
we shape plastic and it shapes us, making our world as curved and 
bendable as we'd like. This stuff does everything: It's modular! 
Stackable! Bendable! Malleable! Slippery! 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say cotton is the fabric of our lives. But I don't  
think so. I think it's plastic,'' Reilly says. ``A world without 
plastic is a world I wouldn't want to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just try to imagine, or recall, such a world. Here -- for better  
and for far, far worse -- is a bit of what we wouldn't have without 
plastic: 
</P>
<P>
	Fried eggs that don't stick to the pan. Kraft Singles. An  
aerodynamic Pringles holder for the on-the-go chip scarfer. TV 
dinners that don't ignite in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware parties.  
</P>
<P>
	Batters hit in the head and trotting to first uninjured.  
Astroturf -- and indoor arenas. High-tech fishing lures. Inflatable 
rafts, so much lighter and more portable than wood or aluminum. 
Brawling hockey players' grimaces mashed against Plexiglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboys and Penthouses sealed in polyethylene bags on the  
newsstand. Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
	World War II airplane radar. Modern parachutes.  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Potato Head.  
</P>
<P>
	Silly Putty. Legos. Barbie and GI Joe. Hula hoops. Stretch  
Armstrong. Silly string. The see-through eggs in gumball machines 
that hold spider web tattoos and fake diamond rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shampoo bottles that don't break and cut your feet when you drop  
them in the shower. Toothbrushes for the masses. Throwaway lighters 
and ball-point pens. Cheap digital watches. Half the inventory at 
the Kmart down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Disposable diapers.  
</P>
<P>
	Band-Aids. Unbreakable eyeglasses. Featherweight prosthetic  
limbs. Replacement joints. The Jarvik-7 artificial heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The bubble boy.  
</P>
<P>
	The powder-blue Dacron zip-up jacket worn by the barber named  
Lou who used to cut your father's hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap explosives for terrorists. Bulletproof vests for cops.  
</P>
<P>
	Spandex. Press-on nails. Pink flamingoes on the next-door  
neighbor's lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-ivory piano keys -- and plastic laptop pianos. Naugahyde.  
Lunchbox carrot sticks in a Baggie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Pilot instead of an appointment book in your shirt  
pocket. Floppy diskettes. The iMac. Compact discs. Cassettes. 
Videotapes. ``Frampton Comes Alive'' on vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Movies.  
</P>
<P>
	Foam peanuts for packing -- annoyingly clingy, but lighter and  
cleaner than old newspapers. Six-pack holders -- a beer guzzler's 
convenience, a pelican's peril. Fiberglass insulation. 
Stress-relieving bubble wrap. The wonderful aroma of ``rubber'' 
cement. Self-serve supermarket meat departments. In the checkout 
line: ``Paper or plastic?'' On the dry-cleaning bag: ``NOT A TOY.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gleaming Evian bottles carried by gleaming yuppies from  
Stairmaster to Nordic Track. Those really ugly polyester leisure

Control-top panty hose. Jelly shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	How many garbage bags in how many landfills? How many

 *IV: PLASTIC -- HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT IT?

 *Plastic flowers and coffins will outlast critics

</P>
<P>
	``When you die,'' says Jim Kieszkowski, ``it's kind of like  
forever'' -- and in that way, it's kind of like plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieszkowski is an expert on plastic and death.  
</P>
<P>
	His company, Oak Grove International of Manistee, Mich., has  
made fiberglass coffins since 1992. Some of them look like wood, 
some of them look like brass. Some of them are emblazoned with the 
logos of the University of Kentucky or Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieszkowski is a true believer. Wood decays, metal rusts, but  
plastic is eternal. It will seal out worms and water and whatever; 
it will seal in the decaying dearly departed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kieszkowski knows that he's up against some powerful  
prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go back,'' he says, ``to that plastic pop bottle'' -- to the  
lingering conviction that plastic is disposable, flimsy, cheap and 
fake, an inferior version of the real thing, whatever the real 
thing might be. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always that way. Earlier in the century, plastic was  
considered one of the great wonders of the modern age. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakelite, invented in 1909, was electrically resistant,  
chemically stable, shatterproof. It wouldn't crack, fade, crease or 
discolor. Cellophane was the first clear, flexible, waterproof 
wrap. Nylon almost instantly transformed women's legs and lives. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1945 through the 1970s, the plastic industry grew by 15  
percent a year. All of that material found many uses, not all of 
them prudent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plastic and there's plastic,'' says pop historian Alex  
Shear. He admires the hardy toy trucks and doll furniture made by 
Renwal, and the molded chairs designed by Charles Eames. He 
shudders at the stuff that wound up on the sale table at 
Woolworth's. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things were downright ugly,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	The list of worrisome things from science, wrote Lewis Thomas,  
includes ``behavior control, genetic engineering, transplanted 
heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic 
flowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic became a metaphor -- for wastefulness (under pressure,  
McDonald's dropped its plastic packaging, though paper's half-life 
in a landfill is not much less than polystyrene's) and for the 
falseness of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben, I just want to say one word to you,'' the phony neighbor  
intones in ``The Graduate,'' pulling the title character aside for 
a heart-to-heart. ``Just one word --'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you listening?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I am.''  
</P>
<P>
	(Pause...) ``Plastics.''  
</P>
<P>
	Norman Mailer once called plastic ``a malign force loose in the  
universe that is the social equivalent of cancer.'' Plastic is 
sickening us, killing us, he said, and others agree. Though the 
industry calls such claims nonsense, scientists continue to probe 
the dark side of polystyrene. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember: Plastic is forever and outlasts even its critics.  
</P>
<P>
	``Praise the falseness that is true. Praise the lie that  
lasts,'' writes the poet John Stone in ``In Praise of Even 
Plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic has become the stuff of our lives. We recycle it in ever  
greater amounts (1.45 billion pounds last year), and use it in 
Happy Meal toys, hip replacements, keyboards like the one on which 
this story was written -- and, yes, in coffins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieszkowski's company makes more than 2,000 fiberglass caskets  
each year. Business is good and attitudes are changing. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, he says, ``I hear people saying, `If that fiberglass  
boat was good enough for Dad to take the kids out fishing on the 
lake, it's good enough to bury him in.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He foresees a day when plastic will be as common six feet down  
as it is everywhere else.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Remember Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Military pomp and private and  
national grief accompanied former President Julius Nyerere to his 
grave Saturday in a rocky hillside in the village where he was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the burial ceremony was meant to be private, Nyerere  
relative Moses Machege estimated that half a million people from 
across the East African nation flocked to Butiama, 870 miles 
northwest of the capital, Dar es Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
	President Benjamin Mkapa and his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri  
Museveni, who first met Nyerere while a student at the University 
of Dar es Salaam in the 1970s, also joined the ceremony, as did 
former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, Nyerere's comrade in the 
struggle for liberation in southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The burial was preceded by a mass at the small Roman Catholic  
church where Nyerere worshipped when he was in Butiama, a village 
of about 50 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	He was buried near the grave of his parents in a ceremony  
broadcast nationwide on radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	As eight army generals lowered the coffin, a trumpet played the  
Last Retreat. Mkapa joined Nyerere's family and close friends in 
tossing fistfuls of soil onto the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lord has chosen to recall our beloved Julius Nyerere. We  
hand over to the Lord this member of our family,'' said Cardinal 
Polycarp Pengo, the head of the Catholic Church in Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	After soldiers sealed the grave, Nyerere's widow, Maria Magie,  
knelt and laid her hand on the concrete slab on which she then 
placed a floral wreath. 
</P>
<P>
	Graca Machel, wife of South Africa President Nelson Mandela, was  
at Mrs. Nyerere's side. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere led the drive for independence from Britain in 1961 of

unity that he said ``did not come out of the blue but were products 
of Nyerere's hard work.''

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Although New York Yankees infielder Luis Sojo  
will miss the first two games of the World Series in Atlanta 
because of his father's death, manager Joe Torre chose to keep the 
utility player on the roster instead of outfielder Shane Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing against Spencer,'' Torre said Saturday before  
Game 1. ``I just think keeping a second infielder is more 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other backup utility infielder is rookie Clay Bellinger.  
</P>
<P>
	Sojo's father died of a heart aneurism in a New Jersey hospital  
on Thursday. He was taken there during the first game of the 
American League Championship Series against Boston last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``His father had emergency surgery and everything seemed to be  
going well,'' Torre said. ``I understand, they were basically just 
changing rooms in the hospital and he passed away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said he spoke with Sojo earlier Saturday before the  
infielder left for his native Venezuela with his mother to help 
with funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Sojo plans to be back Tuesday for Game 3 in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	Sojo played in two postseason games, being used primarily as a  
late-inning defensive replacement for second baseman Chuck 
Knoblauch. During the regular season he hit .252 with two home runs 
and 16 RBIs in 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAYLOR MEETING:* Atlanta hitting coach Don Baylor, who managed  
the Colorado Rockies until he was fired after last season, may meet 
with Cleveland general manager John Hart about the Indians 
managerial opening. Hart is looking to interview both Baylor and 
Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who has interviewed with the Anaheim Angels, Chicago  
Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers, turned down Hart's original suggestion 
to meet Friday. He did say he may get together with Hart on Sunday, 
but preferred to wait until the World Series was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Sunday, if I can do it,'' said Baylor, who said he would  
seriously consider the Indians. ``I didn't make any promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart has already interviewed Indians hitting coach Charlie  
Manuel, who is considered the frontrunner, fired Cubs manager Jim 
Riggleman and former Toronto manager Cito Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YOGI MEETS:* Former New York Yankees great and Hall of Famer  
Yogi Berra spoke with Atlanta manager Bobby Cox for about 20 
minutes in the Braves dugout before the game. While they were 
talking, Game 1 starter Greg Maddux strolled by and was introduced 
to Berra, shaking hands with the former catcher. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG SLEEP:* Asked whether baseball should start postseason  
games a little earlier due to their length, Atlanta Braves manager 
Bobby Cox agreed that changes may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very true our games are ending extremely late,'' he said,  
adding the 8 p.m. starts are all right with the players but ``the 
fans, the young kids, obviously are going to fall asleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I myself fell asleep when Boston was rallying in the eighth  
inning in Boston against the Yankees,'' he said of Game 5 of the 
ALCS, the clinching 6-1 victory by New York, which lasted 4 hours 
and 9 minutes and wasn't over until 12:27 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up, they were wrapping up the ball game, and it's hard  
to stay up,'' said Cox, adding he understood the other side, too. 
``The television rights to it, they pay a lot of money to broadcast 
these, and, you know, huge sums of that money goes to players' 
salaries, so it's kind of a Catch-22 there.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LINEUP CHANGE:* New York Yankees manager Joe Torre made only  
one change in his starting lineup when it was announced that 
scheduled Atlanta starter Tom Glavine, a left-hander, had the flu 
and would be replaced by right-hander Greg Maddux in Saturday 
night's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just left field. That's the only change. Ricky Ledee  
instead of Chad Curtis,'' Torre said. ``I understand those things 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WORLD SERIES DEBUT:* Kevin Millwood, who will start Game 2 for  
the Braves, was asked his thoughts on pitching in his first World 
Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's a headache, signing balls and all that stuff.  
But, it's exciting,'' said the 24-year-old who won 18 games during 
the regular season and pitched a one-hitter in the NL division 
series against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to a couple of the guys and they said to approach it  
like it's just another ball game and try not to get too worked up 
about it. That's what I'm going to do,'' Millwood said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCARED CHAMP:* Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, an  
Atlanta resident and avid Braves fan, was on the field before the 
game, discussing his baseball career as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played baseball as a kid -- right field. I wasn't too good a  
hitter. I had a good glove and had a good arm, but I was afraid of 
the ball,'' said the man who twice beat Mike Tyson, including an 
11th-round knockout in their first fight. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ETC:* The Yankees have an 8-game winning streak in the World  
Series, winning the final four games against the Braves in 1996 to 
win the series 4-2 and sweeping the San Diego Padres last season. 
... The Braves and Yankees are the two winningest teams in the 
1990s during the regular season. Atlanta has a 925-629 record. New 
York is 851-704. The Braves have won eight consecutive NL division 
titles, the Yankees have made five straight postseason appearances. 
This is Atlanta's fifth World Series in the 90s', winning once -- in 
1995. This is the Yankees third World Series appearance, winning in 
1996 and 1998. ... The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by 
former Braves left-hander Warren Spahn. ... The Yankees had the 
highest opening-day payroll in baseball, $85,054,360. The Braves 
were fifth at $73,485,000.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Finally Feels Appreciated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway and Jason Kidd. All-around  
brilliance matched with never-ending energy and guile. It could be 
one of the most dynamic backcourts ever in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the question persists: Will this be the all-pro Penny of his  
early years, or the injury-plagued, complaining, some would say 
disruptive, Penny of his last two seasons in Orlando? 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway insists he's relishing a fresh start in Phoenix with a  
Suns organization that he appreciates and appreciates him. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Kidd rebuilt his image in Phoenix after a rough start  
in Dallas, why can't Hardaway do the same? 
</P>
<P>
	``A new outlook, new scenery is always good for a professional  
athlete when he comes from a bad situation,'' Kidd said. ``I think 
the best of a person comes out, because they're out to prove that 
they can play, and they have the opportunity to shine. It's a 
once-in-a-lifetime second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway burst into the NBA as one of its brightest young stars.  
By his second season, he had teamed with Shaquille O'Neal to take 
the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals. Hardaway was first-team 
all-NBA in 1995 and '96. With his ``Little Penny'' Nike ads, he was 
a media darling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then everything began to unravel. Shaq left for Los Angeles and  
Hardaway was sidelined for 23 games in 1996-97 and 63 games in 
1997-98 following a knee injury and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final season in Orlando, Hardaway averaged a career-low  
15.8 points and was severely criticized as the Philadelphia 76ers 
swept the Magic in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of engineering the mutiny that led to the firing  
of his first coach, Brian Hill, and helping to hasten the 
retirement of his next coach, Chuck Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway said he had unbearable pressure and no support from the  
Magic, coaches included. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put pressure on me to be `the' guy, and when I didn't  
perform, they killed me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway responded to critics with nasty remarks of his own.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the coaching staff to defend me. I didn't have  
the organization to defend me, and that's weird being `the guy' 
down in Orlando,'' he said. ``I had to defend myself, so I ended up 
saying some crazy things and making myself look bad, and that's 
where everything went downhill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were almost desperate for an infusion of talent after a  
mediocre 1999 season. So they pulled off a trade that brought 
Hardaway to Phoenix along with his new seven-year, $86 million 
contract -- and considerable baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, under the ownership of Jerry Colangelo, have a  
reputation of being good to their players. Hardaway said he noticed 
the difference right away in a meeting with team president Bryan 
Colangelo, coach Danny Ainge and other members of the team's 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about things here that I never talked about  
before with the coach or organization in Orlando, so I'm feeling 
good about everything that's gone on here,'' Hardaway said. ``Just 
as far as they're in my corner, that they're backing me, they're 
never going to embarrass me in the paper. They're never going to 
point the finger at me. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're never going to put so much pressure on me like I'm the  
only guy on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ainge praises Hardaway's all-around talent -- outside shooting,  
inside scoring, passing and defense -- but said no one should expect 
him to mesh perfectly with Kidd right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are special players, but it's going to take some  
time,'' Ainge said. ``I think you're going to see a lot of great 
games out of them, and some games that aren't what people are 
expecting maybe initially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway believes he would have been one of the league's best  
players again no matter where he wound up, but ``to play in the 
backcourt with a guy like Jason makes it so much easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a guy who plays hard at the defensive end,  
has very good hands, pushes the ball up the floor extremely fast 
and finds all the guys he needs to find,'' Hardaway said. ``He has 
a lot of wind, can run all day and do a lot of great things. He'll 
get to balls that you don't even think he can get to. It makes it 
so much easier for me because I feed off of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Kidd at 6-feet-4, and Hardaway 6-7, the backcourt creates a  
matchup nightmare. Teams will no longer be able to switch their 
off-guard to defend Kidd, and the smaller point guards will have a 
tough time guarding him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway will be able to defend the bigger shooting guards,  
allowing the Suns to avoid the mismatches that sometimes occurred 
last season with Rex Chapman as the off-guard. Hardaway also has 
experience as a playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two ball-handlers,'' Kidd said. ``We've got two guys  
who know how to pass the ball. Points aren't everything to our 
games. We're very unselfish. We rely on our teammates to make us 
look good. It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of touches. A lot 
of guys are going to get a lot of wide-open shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the trade, Kidd brashly predicted that he and  
Hardaway would become the best backcourt in NBA history. Kidd isn't 
backing off, but he knows they have to prove it on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not say it if you truly believe it?'' he said. ``First,  
we've got to win a championship to be considered the best. If you 
look at Michael and Magic and Larry Bird and those teams, they've 
got the rings. That's why they're considered the best in the 
world.''

<HEADLINE> Barkley To Announce Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It's official, says Sir Charles.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston Rockets forward Charles Barkley will announce his  
retirement Sunday, effective at the end of the NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, 36, has threatened to retire several times in recent  
years, but the 6-foot-6 power forward insists it'll be the real 
thing when he announces it during halftime of the preseason 
Houston-Rockets-Detroit Pistons game in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just time,'' said Barkley, who has been upgraded to  
questionable for Sunday's game after missing the last four 
preseason games with tendinitis in his right elbow. ``It's time. 
That's it. I'm not going to answer any more questions about it. 
It's just time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Birmingham is a short drive from Barkley's hometown of Leeds,  
Ala., and he wants his family to be there for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley is not sure what he'll do after completing his 16th  
season in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might just take some time off. This is my last year, period.  
I don't care how well I'm playing -- this is it,'' he said. ``I want 
to get it over with, and that's it. I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley has long been one of the league's top draws, especially  
internationally. He was on the original Dream Team, playing with 
Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson on the juggernaut that 
won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Barkley, then with the Phoenix Suns, teamed with  
current Rockets teammate Hakeem Olajuwon on the Olympic team that 
won a gold medal in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Charles has decided that this is his last season, then we  
should all relish one more chance to be entertained by one of the 
most spectacular players in NBA history,'' NBA deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik told the Houston Chronicle. ``Charles is certainly a 
one-of-a-kind personality, but first and foremost, he is a truly 
great talent on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets owner Leslie Alexander agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is a great player, but he also made the game fun,''  
Alexander said. ``People love to be around Charles, and an attitude 
like that is rare in any sport. His routine will be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley averaged less than 10 rebounds only once, when he had  
8.6 as a rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984-85. Entering 
this season, Barkley is 13th on the career scoring list with 23,468 
points and has pulled down 12,337 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the league by averaging 14.6 boards in 1986-87, and  
grabbed a career-high 33 in his first game as a Rocket in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the NBA's second-leading rebounder last season with 12.3  
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who said he is not surprised by the decision, is  
happy to have Barkley play his last game as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have a great one retire in your uniform. And he's  
one of the greatest of all,'' Alexander said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush, Gore Leading Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just over a year before the election, Democrat  
Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush hold strong leads nationally 
in the races for their parties' nomination, a poll released 
Saturday finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Newsweek poll suggested former Sen. Bill Bradley  
would receive 26 percent of the votes of registered Democrats and 
those who lean toward voting for a Democrat, while the vice 
president would get 49 percent. Those numbers are statistically 
unchanged from a similar Newsweek poll in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said Bush, the Texas governor, would win 57 percent  
of the votes of registered Republicans and those who lean toward 
voting for a Republican. Next was Sen. John McCain of Arizona, with 
12 percent, publisher Steve Forbes with 6 percent, Pat Buchanan and 
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah each with 4 percent, and Gary Bauer with 3 
percent. Buchanan has indicated he will leave the Republican Party 
to run as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gore were to face Bush in the general election next year,  
Bush would defeat Gore by a 49-40 margin, the poll said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Bradley were to face Bush, Bush would win 47 percent and  
Bradley 42 percent, a slight edge for Bush, according to the 
survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted by Princeton Research Associates, who  
interviewed 755 adults on Thursday and Friday, after Elizabeth 
Dole's withdrawal Wednesday from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a new poll in New Hampshire said registered  
Republicans in the state favor Bush 39 percent to 27 percent over 
McCain. That was an improvement for McCain compared with a similar 
poll in August that had Bush in the lead 45 percent to 10 percent. 
The New Hampshire poll put other Republican presidential candidates 
in single digits in the critical primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted for the Concord Monitor by polling firm  
Research 2000 on Wednesday and Thursday. The poll questioned 602 
registered voters were by telephone. The poll had a margin of error 
of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Runner Osoro Making Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ronaldo da Costa has the world record and Khalid  
Khannouchi has the hot streak. And Ondoro Osoro? All he's got is 
the No. 1 bib. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's the defending champion of the LaSalle Banks Chicago  
Marathon, Osoro isn't an overwhelming favorite to repeat Sunday. 
While Khannouchi has won five of seven races since June -- he 
finished second in the other two -- Osoro hasn't raced since Chicago 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried,'' said Osoro, who's been hampered by back and  
hip injuries. ``When you train, you do speed work and it is exactly 
as fast as if you were going to run a race. I have been training 
well, almost the same speed as last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone can come back from injuries, it's Osoro. The former  
cross-country runner planned to move up to the marathon in 1996. 
But as he and his wife were returning from a visit to his mother's 
in May 1995, he saw a 12-ton truck coming toward him on the wrong 
side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Osoro pulled off the road, but the truck still sideswiped the  
front of his car. He was unconscious for almost an hour before a 
passerby took him to a hospital. He had a broken arm, facial cuts, 
several broken ribs and a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The broken ribs turned out to be the worst injury, keeping him  
from training and making even the lightest of exercises painful. At 
one point, he asked the doctors to take new X-rays, sure something 
else was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I would sit down and think, `Maybe this is the end  
of my career,' '' he said. ``But I told myself, `I will never give 
up.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after two years, the injuries healed enough to allow  
Osoro to resume training full-time. He was invited to the Chicago 
Marathon, but almost didn't come because he wasn't given an 
appearance fee. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent convinced him to run, and the results were better than  
anyone expected. Osoro, running his first marathon, won in 2:06:54, 
a world debut best and then the third-fastest time ever. He beat 
Khannouchi, who had set a world debut best at Chicago in 1997 in 
2:07:10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must be a lucky man today,'' Osoro said after winning last  
year, ``running for the first time and running very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Osoro's luck didn't last long. His hip started bothering him  
in February, and he had to drop out of the Boston Marathon in 
April. He went to Ireland for treatment by Gerard Hartmann, a 
physiotherapist who specializes in deep-tissue massage. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he started training for Chicago in August, Osoro hasn't  
run any other races. That's why Khannouchi, da Costa and even 
Hendrik Ramaala, who is making his marathon debut, are given better 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Osoro is training well, said Carey Pinkowski, Chicago's race  
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did two 30-kilometer runs at 7,000 feet faster than he had  
before last year's race, and he's had some better interval workouts 
on the track,'' Pinkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osoro doesn't care whether he's favored or not. After what he's  
endured in the past 4 1/2 years, he's just glad to be running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to thank you for inviting me to Chicago again,'' he  
said, smiling. ``Last year, I said that if you invited me, I'd come 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Sycamore Networks Soar After IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of a little-known company whose  
fiber-optic technology may turbocharge the Internet nearly 
quintupled Friday, the first day of trading after an initial public 
offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Sycamore Networks sold 7.5 million shares of its new stock for  
$38 a piece in Thursday's IPO, raising $285 million. By the end of 
Friday's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the stock had surged 
to $184.75 and the company was suddenly worth $1.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in the Boston suburb of Chelmsford, Mass., Sycamore is at  
the cutting edge of a technology that makes it faster, easier and 
cheaper for network operators to handle floods of Internet traffic 
from e-commerce, Web surfing, telephone calls and cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excitement is twofold,'' said Matt Barzowskas, a  
networking specialist at FAC Equities in Boston. ``You have a 
product that's focused on the hot, new area of network technologies 
and it has a management team with a history of doing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fundamentals of optical technology have been around since  
the 1970s, when engineers developed a way to code sounds and 
pictures in wavelengths of light and beam them through glass fibers 
over long distances. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that information often gets clogged at the  
intersections between the speedy fiber-optic ``backbones'' that 
make up most of the Internet and the older, slower phone cables 
made of copper that are connected to most buildings and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sycamore and a small group of rivals are developing new hardware  
to better bridge the gap between metal and fiber. They are also 
writing new software to switch and route the coded flashes of 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, people should notice an increase in Internet speed  
as early as February as big communications companies and Internet 
service providers switch to the new equipment, said Sycamore 
chairman and founder Gururaj Deshpande. 
</P>
<P>
	Deshpande made a name for himself by founding Cascade  
Communications Corp., which made a number of breakthroughs in 
networking technology before the company was bought in 1997 for 
$2.9 billion by Ascend Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Sycamore's chief executive, Daniel Smith, also served as chief  
executive at Cascade. 
</P>
<P>
	Deshpande founded Sycamore last year in a booming field rife  
with competitors, including network technology leaders Lucent 
Technologies, Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems, as well as smaller 
players like Ciena and Tellium. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, which today controls roughly 85 percent of the world's  
market for network routers and switches, agreed to pay $7.4 billion 
in August to buy two small companies with fiber-optic expertise -- 
Cerent and Monterey Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Barzowskas said deals such as that paved the way for Friday's  
frenzy over Sycamore, and may continue to drive the stock higher as 
the new networking technology comes to the forefront.
