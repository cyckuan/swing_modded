<HEADLINE> GOP Eyeing 2000 Budget Jump Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to end a standoff that killed their  
budget plans last year, House and Senate Republicans are seeking an 
early, unified front on a fiscal 2000 budget that could include 
$500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, their efforts have included a meeting Tuesday between  
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. 
John Kasich, R-Ohio, who heads the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men found common ground in their desire to write a  
budget that would include buttressing Social Security, cutting 
taxes, and bolstering education and the Pentagon, participants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged,'' Kasich said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	They plan to meet again later this month.  
</P>
<P>
	With the capital focused on the Senate impeachment trial of  
President Clinton, a GOP budget accord would help the party counter 
Democratic arguments that Republicans are obsessed with removing 
Clinton from office. It would also please the GOP's core 
conservative and business constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement would also be a plum for the new House speaker, Rep.  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who wants Congress to approve a budget 
resolution by April. That resolution is a nonbinding map of 
spending and tax plans that guides lawmakers' fiscal work for the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, House and Senate Republicans were so divided over the  
size and type of tax reductions that Congress approved no major tax 
cuts, and passed no budget resolution for the first time since the 
current budget process began 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans from both chambers say an agreement will be tough to  
achieve and is at least weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	They still must decide which taxes they would cut and how  
deeply, and whether the reduction would be paid for entirely out of 
budget surpluses or with some savings from spending cuts. One 
Senate GOP aide said a $500 billion, 10-year cut was ``in the 
ballpark'' of what was being considered, but said it was too early 
for decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without congressional approval of a budget resolution for fiscal  
2000, which begins Oct. 1, Senate opponents of a tax cut can 
filibuster. That would force tax cut supporters to win the votes of 
60 of the 100 senators to prevail, a tough margin to achieve in a 
chamber Republicans dominate by 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican budget analysts say they expect help from new  
projections of federal surpluses due at the end of the month from 
the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' official budget analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the budget office is likely to project a surplus for  
the next decade surpassing the $1.55 trillion it projected in July. 
That could make it easier for some moderate Republicans to break 
with Clinton's call to prepare Social Security for retiring baby 
boomers before the surplus is used to pay for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Clinton announced that the fiscal 1999 surplus is  
expected to be at least $76 billion, well above the $54 billion the 
administration projected in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to unveil his own $1.8 trillion spending plan for  
2000 on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a budget last spring calling for $101 billion  
in tax cuts over five years, while the more moderate Senate's 
version would have allowed $30 billion in reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Kasich, a potential 2000 presidential contender, has  
called for a 10 percent across-the-board income tax cut, which 
would cost the government more than $700 billion over 10 years. He 
acknowledged Thursday that a reduction of that size would be 
``difficult to maneuver'' through the House, where Republicans 
start this year with a narrow 11-seat majority.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Children Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. JOHN, Fla. (AP) -- Two young siblings plotted to kill  
their father's live-in girlfriend because they thought he was 
spending too much time with her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen-year-old Cathy Jones and 12-year-old Curtis Fairchild  
Jones allegedly confessed to shooting Sonya Nicole Speights, a 
29-year-old teaching assistant at a junior high school. She was 
found dead Wednesday in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last week or two weeks they had planned to kill the  
victim and make it look like a burglary or an accident,'' said 
sheriff's Sgt. Glenn Evers. 
</P>
<P>
	The children used their father's gun, Evers said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will decide what degree of murder the children will  
be charged with and whether they can be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amazed,'' Evers said. ``I can't imagine a 12- and a  
13-year-old making such a heinous plot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children's attorney, Tony Hernandez III, said the children  
were ``extremely remorseful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in total shock,'' Hernandez said. ``They could not  
understand what had happened, especially the younger boy -- constant 
tears, shaking, crying incredibly.''

<HEADLINE> Old Chamber To House Senate Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican and Democratic senators seeking an  
agreement on how to conduct President Clinton's impeachment trial 
chose to deliberate in the place where the idea of compromise was 
woven into the American fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	When the doors of the Old Senate Chamber close behind them  
today, the 100 senators eligible to attend will be alone in a space 
small enough that their voices need no amplifiers to be easily 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the point was  
to thrash out in private an agreement on just how to proceed with 
President Clinton's trial on counts of perjury and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``History oozes from these walls,'' said former Sen. John Glenn,  
D-Ohio, when the Senate met as a body in the old chamber a decade 
ago to mark its 200th year. Many speeches that day held that the 
legacy of all that history is the art of political compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many senators past and present have rejected compromise  
as morally wrong, it is in fact politically essential, said former 
Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without it we screech to a halt, paralyzed by intransigence,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Old Senate Chamber is the emblem of Senate tradition. An  
early portrait of George Washington hangs high on the wall. A gilt 
eagle and shield surmounts the presiding officer's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The heroes and historic ghosts of this place are Daniel Webster  
of Massachusetts, Henry Clay of Kentucky and John C. Calhoun of 
South Carolina. The echoes are from the debates they conducted and 
the compromises they made in the titanic clash between states' 
rights and the future of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately the old chamber is a place where compromise delayed  
but did not prevent the Civil War. But it is also a place where 
compromise retains its hope that progress can be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the intimate atmosphere of the Old Senate Chamber  
would make it easier to make the decisions needed to conduct the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reasons is simple size.  
</P>
<P>
	The windy cavern the Senate has occupied since the Capitol was  
expanded 140 years ago is 113 feet long, 80 feet wide and more than 
42 feet high. The old chamber, just steps down the tiled corridor, 
is far smaller in scale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate met there for 40 years, beginning in 1819. It was  
always a place of good acoustics and unstrained speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	History continued to be made in the old chamber even after the  
Senate marched into its new and larger quarters in 1859. In 1860 
the Supreme Court moved in, staying until 1935, when it moved into 
its marble temple across the Capitol lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate moved back briefly in the 1950s while its present  
chamber was reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then the Old Senate Chamber, restored to its 19th century  
appearance, has been mostly a museum room, visited daily by 
hundreds of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	But it remains ready for the Senate to use when it needs a  
private space of just the right size.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Teens' Romance Ends in Biolence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- A high school where an apparent  
double-suicide attempt left a teen-age girl dead and her boyfriend 
seriously wounded invited grief counselors to campus today to help 
their shocked classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings in a Central High School bathroom Friday killed  
15-year-old Andrea Garrett and wounded Jeff Miller, 17. Parents and 
fellow students were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said all the color went out of me; I got weak in the  
knees,'' said Joani Osteen, a parent who rushed to the school after 
word of the violence spread through the west Georgia town of 
17,000. ``You see it on TV all the time, but not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow students said the young couple had been having problems,  
and that Ms. Garrett was under pressure from her parents to end the 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller recently had said that he ``wouldn't be here much  
longer,'' said Tiffany Osteen, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was just all talk,'' said Ms. Smith, who was in  
the marching band with Andrea. ``Young love, you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after school started Friday, a janitor found the  
couple shot in a girls' bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garrett died at Tanner Medical Center. Miller was airlifted  
in critical condition to Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, about 
40 miles to the east. At the family's request, hospital officials 
declined to give updates on the boy's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This apparently was something that was agreed upon by the two  
kids,'' said Carroll County Sheriff Tony Reeves. ``They chose to do 
this for whatever reason at the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weapon was a .22-caliber pistol that was taken from a locked  
safe belonging to the girl's parents. Investigators were trying to 
determine who fired the shots.

<HEADLINE> Thompson To Quit As Georgetown Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At preseason practices in November, John  
Thompson bubbled with the enthusiasm of a first-year coach, telling 
anyone who would listen that Georgetown was just one season away 
from a return to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it seems, someone else will be in charge courtside when the  
Hoyas turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, whose tough-love emphasis of academics as well as  
athletics turned Georgetown into a respected national basketball 
powerhouse over the past quarter century, planned to announce his 
resignation today, according to the father of one of his recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The university called a ``major'' news conference for 10 a.m.  
EST. Bill Shapland, spokesman for the men's basketball team, 
wouldn't release any details, but Charles Freeman, father of 
recruit Courtland Freeman, said Thompson called on Thursday to say 
he was resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just decided he was going to step down from the coaching  
position,'' Charles Freeman said. ``I think he was going to be in 
the head office. He wasn't leaving the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said Thompson told him he was stepping down for  
``personal reasons'' and that the coach didn't elaborate. Freeman 
said Craig Esherick, an assistant under Thompson for the last 16 
years, would take over as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtland Freeman, a 17-year-old forward from Socastee High  
School in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said he received the news via a phone 
call from Ronny Thompson, the coach's son and an assistant with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' Courtland Freeman said. ``From my  
understanding, he's still going to be in the head office, so it 
looks like nothing's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman is one of four major recruits Thompson was touting when  
he proclaimed ``Help is coming'' during the preseason. 
Unfortunately, next year's class can do nothing to help this year's 
team, which appears headed for Georgetown's first losing campaign 
since Thompson's first season as coach in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas are off to their worst start ever in the Big East  
(0-4), including an 11-point loss at Seton Hall on Monday night. 
Georgetown's winning record (7-6) is mainly due to victories over 
perennial non-conference patsies Thompson schedules every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this season's struggles, and despite some off-the-court  
incidents the last few years that have taken some of the shine off 
the school's carefully cultivated sports reputation, Thompson's 
achievements are memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown was barely a blip on the national basketball radar  
screen when Thompson arrived 27 years ago. His first team went 
12-14, the second was 13-13. Every team since has been invited to 
postseason tournament play -- 20 NCAAs and four NITs. He won the 
national championship with Patrick Ewing in 1984, and his Hoyas 
were runners-up in 1982 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's record is 596-239, a .713 winning percentage, and he  
is 10th among active coaches in victories. Furthermore, Thompson's 
players almost always graduated on time -- 97 percent of his players 
who stayed four years left with a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dynasty has faded over the last few years, starting in  
1996 when Allen Iverson became Thompson's first player to declare 
early for the NBA draft. Victor Page, Ed Sheffey and Kenny Brunner 
also left early, for various reasons, and all four -- especially 
Iverson -- have made ugly headlines that clearly embarrassed and 
hurt their former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Thompson last year allegedly received threatening phone  
calls from a former player, Kevin Millen, who in November ignored 
an order to stay off campus. Millen is being held in a halfway 
house and is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Georgetown had a 15-14 regular-season record and was  
invited to the NIT on reputation alone. The Hoyas defeated Florida 
before losing to Georgia Tech in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson knew this year would be a challenge, but any hopes of  
the Hoyas being competitive in the Big East were dashed when junior 
guard Shernard Long, the team's leading scorer last season, was 
suspended for the season for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are playing better,'' Thompson said after the Seton  
Hall defeat, ``but it is getting to the point where we have to win 
some games.''

<HEADLINE> Dog Bite Insurance Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's how life is supposed to go: Get married, buy  
a house, have children, get a dog. But many homeowners are finding 
themselves having to choose between their pooches and their 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some insurance companies say they're feeling the bite of dogs  
just as much as the people who wind up at the doctor's office. And 
they're tired of paying out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Stanwood of Newbury learned the hard truth firsthand.  
</P>
<P>
	She had wanted to adopt a German shepherd like the one she grew  
up with. But her insurer, Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Co., said 
no; the breed had made the company's pooch-non-grata list because 
of the risk it might sink its teeth into someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Meskell, senior vice president at Quincy Mutual, said the  
cost of dog bites makes his company hesitant to write homeowner 
policies for people who own aggressive dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you own a dog on our list doesn't mean you don't  
have coverage,'' he said. ``But it may be a hard sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dog bites, according to industry officials, cost insurers as  
much as $250 million a year in medical and liability costs, and 
account for one-third of all liability claims against homeowner 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the National Center for Injury Prevention and  
Control showed that the number of dog bites that required medical 
care rose 37 percent between 1986 and 1996, from 585,000 to 
800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During that same period, the number of dogs kept as pets went up  
only 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals most likely to be involved in an injury-causing or  
fatal attack include pit bulls, Rottweilers, German shepherds, 
huskies, Alaskan malamutes, Doberman pinschers, chows, Great Danes, 
Saint Bernards and Akitas, according to a study by the Centers for 
Disease Control and the Humane Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of dog bites don't end in death, but still  
cost homeowners and insurers a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
	Most companies don't have a blanket policy of denying insurance  
to dog owners, but acknowledge that more questions are triggered 
when homeowners list certain breeds on their insurance 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states mandate that insurers offer coverage for any dog,  
while others allow insurers to write policies that exclude dog bite 
liability from coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh Floyd, a spokesman for Allstate Insurance, said: ``We go  
anywhere from insuring homes with dogs who are not identified as 
biters ... to not insuring a home if they have a dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Berstein, vice president and general counsel of Met Life  
Property and Casualty, said his company prefers not to write 
homeowners policies for people who own dog breeds with a track 
record of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reasonable about this,'' he said. ``If the person can  
demonstrate that the dog is not inherently aggressive then we'll 
consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a letter from a veterinarian could serve as that type of  
assurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Allmerica Financial, parent  
company to Hanover Insurance Co. and Citizens Insurance Co. of 
America, said a dangerous dog can often be identified by looking at 
previous claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly if you're a pet owner and the dog has bitten 24 people  
in the past then you know that your dog is a vicious dog,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm does not have a policy that treats dog owners  
differently from other policy holders, said Joe Johnson, a 
spokesman for the Bloomington, Ill.-based company.

<HEADLINE> Chris Nelloms Found Guilty of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Former Ohio State track star Chris Nelloms  
was found guilty by a jury today of raping a 12-year-old girl and 
could face life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of seven counts of rape of a child less than 13  
and one count of felonious sexual penetration of a child less than 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	He was found innocent of attempted rape of a child less than 13.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms dropped his head as the verdict was read.  
</P>
<P>
	The Montgomery County Common Pleas Court jury reached a verdict  
after about five hours of deliberations over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	When the verdict was read, Nelloms' fiancee, Tina Smith, began  
sobbing from the second row of the courtroom. She was escorted out 
by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jon Paul Rion said he planned to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 26, of suburban Trotwood, set school records at Ohio  
State but failed to qualify for the 1996 Olympics in the 200-meter 
dash. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified Thursday that the girl lied about the allegations,  
perhaps because she is troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Kevin Lennen had said the prosecution's case  
was ``unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen said there supposedly were people in the area when the  
alleged rapes occurred, but no one saw or heard anything. He also 
said the doctor who testified for the prosecution could say only 
that he believed the girl had sexual intercourse at least once, 
even though Nelloms is accused of raping the child several times 
from 1995 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She has accused Nelloms of raping her at homes in Dayton and  
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen also said that police concluded the child had been abused  
before completing their investigation and that the girl showed no 
emotion during her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a 12-year-old child who told a lie. Why? I don't  
know,'' Lennen said. ``It's an unbelievable story that could only 
be told by a 12-year-old child.''

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Riot in Indonesian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of people rampaged through  
an Indonesian town today, hurling stones at police stations and 
looting shops. Police fired plastic bullets at the mobs, killing at 
least one person and injuring nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rioters in Karawang, on the main island of Java, banged drums,  
burned a motorcycle, taunted security forces and threw bricks. They 
smashed the windows of a bank, a hotel, two Protestant churches and 
attacked the home of an ethnic Chinese businessman. 
</P>

	KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of people rampaged through  
an Indonesian town today, hurling stones at police stations and 
looting shops. Police fired plastic bullets at the mobs, killing at 
least one person and injuring nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rioters in Karawang, on the main island of Java, banged drums,  
burned a motorcycle, taunted security forces and threw bricks. They 
smashed the windows of a bank, a hotel, two Protestant churches and

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with share prices falling in Tokyo and Jakarta, but rising 
in Hong Kong and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 144.75  
points, or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 13,391.81 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares fell on concern over earnings among Japanese exporters  
amid continued volatility in global foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worried that the dollar's rapid fall below 110.00  
yen on Thursday in overseas market for the first time in 27 months 
would affect on the outlook for profits of Japanese exporters, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In late Friday afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 111.42 yen,  
up 0.44 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New 
York level of 111.04 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly moved as high as 112.40 yen in the afternoon  
on rumors that a U.S. rating agency might downgrade Japanese 
government bonds, but it quickly retreated to the low-111-yen 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian share prices closed sharply lower as investors took  
profits following Thursday's massive gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 18.446 points,  
or 4 percent, to 439.494 points after a 7.2 percent rise on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said concern over social instability in Indonesia also  
discouraged investors from investing long-term in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of rioters rampaged through an Indonesian town Friday,  
hurling stones at police stations and looting shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for the fourth  
consecutive session, boosted by expectations of a cut in local 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 29.13 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 
10,722.70. On Thursday, the index had surged 597.77 points, or 4.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the market closed, The Hong Kong Association of  
Banks decided to cut deposit rates by a quarter percentage point to 
4.00 percent. It was the fourth cut in interest rates in less than 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading Hong Kong banks also cut their prime lending rate -- the  
interest on loans to their best customers -- by a quarter percentage 
point to 8.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, shares closed mostly higher on continued bullish  
sentiment. The Straits Times Index rose 27.30 points, or 1.8 
percent, to 1,545.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as the government continues  
to support the market by buying through its stock market 
stabilization fund. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 17.44 points, or 0.27 percent, to 6,421.75. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mostly weaker on mild  
profit-taking, but a slew of resilient blue-chip stocks continued 
to drive up the market's main index. The Philippine Stock Exchange 
index of 30 selected companies rose 5.73 points to 2,140.64. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as local  
investors locked in profits made after three straight days of solid 
gains. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 10.37 points, or 
0.4 percent, to 2,160.29. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed lower in light  
trading. The All Ordinaries Index fell 41.0 points, or 1.4 percent, 
to 2,856.3. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed lower, with the index falling 1.7  
percent on profit-taking. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index 
fell 11.26 points to 626.33. 
</P>

	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on buying by  
both local institutional and foreign investors. The benchmark 
Composite Index rose 5.81 points, or 0.9 percent, to 591.70. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share closed slightly higher. The Stock Exchange  
of Thailand index gained 1.71 points, or 0.4 percent, to 399.43.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Lift Most Kosovo Road Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb villagers dismantled barricades  
today on three main roads to Kosovo's capital but kept blocking a 
fourth highway to protest the killing of a Serb security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The government-run Serb Media Center said armed villagers still  
blocked the road connecting Pristina to Prizren, the second largest 
city in Kosovo, a Serbian province that is overwhelmingly ethnic 
Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadblocks were dismantled on the three other roads -- including  
the highway north to Belgrade, capital both of Yugoslavia and 
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of angry villagers threw up the barricades Thursday, a  
day after a Serb security guard was killed in an ethnic Albanian 
attack on a power plant outside the capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between Serbian government troops and ethnic Albanian  
rebels has claimed hundreds of lives since February and sent 
hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes. Ethnic Albanians make up 
about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people, and most want 
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The villagers had originally demanded that Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic or Serbian President Milan Milutinovic come to 
the area and personally guarantee their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if those at the last barricade, around Preoce, a  
village about five miles south of Pristina, were still demanding 
such guarantees. The slain security guard came from Preoce. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Foreign Office in Bonn said today that a car with  
Wilfried Gruber, Germany's ambassador to Yugoslavia, and several 
observers for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe was stopped southeast of Pristina. It was allowed to proceed 
after a two-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released late Thursday, the OSCE called on  
Yugoslav authorities to ``guarantee the security and freedom of 
movement in all Kosovo, especially for international personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's main Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, urged Serbs to  
show ``restraint,'' but also indirectly criticized those who shot 
the security guard by saying that such killings add to tensions in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova, who has the backing of most foreign countries as  
Kosovo's Albanian leader, is a pacifist and at odds with the Kosovo 
Liberation Army leading the armed struggle for the province's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo has been relatively quiet since four days of fighting  
broke out in the north on Dec. 24. Those clashes were the most 
extensive since Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke reached 
an agreement Oct. 12 to end seven months of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a spate of clashes and killings have continued to keep  
tensions high, leading to fears of an increase of violence with the 
onset of spring.

<HEADLINE> Retail Chain Gets Funds, Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Three weeks after missing an interest  
payment, Service Merchandise Co. announced it had received $750 
million in new financing and that its chief executive had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement for CEO Gary Witkin was to be named shortly.  
Meanwhile, the struggling retailer appointed former CEO Raymond 
Zimmerman, the non-executive chairman of its board Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new funding, from Citibank, will help Service Merchandise  
make a $13.5 million interest payment on its bonds and pay down its 
$900 million credit facility from Chase Manhattan Bank. The 
interest payment had been due Dec. 15 and carried a 30-day grace 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can meet our operational and financial challenges -- and  
we're off to a great start with the new financing commitment -- we 
think we can return the company to profitability,'' Zimmerman said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Witkin, a former vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, joined the  
company as president in 1994 and became CEO in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Company profits and stock prices continued to tumble last year,  
despite a massive restructuring that included narrowing its product 
offerings to jewelry, housewares and furnishings and shifting from 
warehouse distribution to off-the-shelf sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's catalog showroom thrived into the 1980s but it was  
hurt by the rise of discounters like Wal-Mart and by other changes 
in the retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail analysts said Friday they were not surprised that Service  
Merchandise is making radical changes to survive in an increasingly 
competitive retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are terrific pressures out there right now for  
conventional retailers with the entry of new retail formats like 
the Internet and direct marketing,'' said Clark Murray, a partner 
with Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise operates 347 stores in 34 states with about  
25,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Service Merchandise jumped 53 1/8 cents to 93 3/4 cents on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Officially, NBA Lockout Isn't Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout isn't over yet.  
</P>
<P>
	It won't officially end until the lawyers are finished with the  
paperwork, which is why the league emphasizes that it hopes to open 
training camps by Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the league and the union worked at putting their  
interpretations of Wednesday's agreement into writing, and the 
sides plan to exchange those documents Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll have the weekend to compare notes, and a conference  
among all parties -- lawyers for the league, the union, and from 
both of their outside firms -- is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is Day 1 of them being holed up around the clock, trying  
to get to hammer this out,'' NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	History shows that getting the agreement into writing can  
sometimes be easy and sometimes can drag on. 
</P>
<P>
	When the salary cap was agreed to in 1983, deputy commissioner  
Russ Granik and NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey Mishkin were among 
the attorneys who wrote up the agreement in less than a day. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the last collective bargaining agreement was reached in  
September 1995, it took another nine months before it was finalized 
on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995-96 season was played under a temporary agreement, and a  
brief lockout was imposed in July 1996 (it lasted only a couple of 
hours) before the deal as finally signed. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners and players reached an agreement in principle to end  
the current lockout during all-night talks that began Tuesday. A 
few tidbits of information regarding that session have emerged, 
including the fact that the discussions were ongoing when Stern 
left to appear on the ``Larry King'' show on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during that broadcast that Stern said there was a better  
than 50-50 chance that the lockout would be settled -- his first 
remotely positive comments in months. Less than 10 hours later, the 
deal was done.

<HEADLINE> One Dead at Georgia High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- A student was shot to death and her  
boyfriend was seriously wounded at a high school this morning in 
what might have been a suicide pact or murder-suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher found the students, Andrea Garrett and Jeff Miller, in  
a girls' bathroom shortly after classes began at Central High 
School in Carrollton. No other students witnessed the shootings, 
Carroll County Sheriff Tony Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Garrett, 15, died at Tanner Medical Center and Miller, 17,  
was in critical condition after being airlifted to Crawford Long 
Hospital in Atlanta, about 40 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said the two students had been dating, but he would not  
say whether there was evidence of a suicide pact or a 
murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a boyfriend-girlfriend situation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Crews, 14, said she didn't know the couple personally  
but had seen them in the halls together. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not hear any gunshots in her class, but a guidance  
counselor came to the room and told students that ``a boy and girl 
had tried to commit suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was scared and shocked,'' Michelle said. ``A lot of  
people were crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students were allowed to go home, but classes were continuing  
for those who didn't immediately have a way home, said Scott 
Cowart, principal of the 1,050-student school. Therapists and 
guidance counselors were going from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing with all the things that have happened around  
the nation is the safety of our students,'' he said. ``It's hard to 
allay all fears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When she heard about the shooting, Angela Orr raced from her job  
at a grocery store and was relieved to find that her son and 
daughter weren't involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it my heart just stopped,'' she said. ``You  
never know who might get caught up in the crossfire.''

<HEADLINE> Coaches Downplay Tennessee-UConn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, CONN. (AP) -- It's time to play The Game: No. 1 vs. No.  
2. 
</P>
<P>
	However, listening to coach Pat Summitt of No. 2 Tennessee, it  
would be difficult to tell that Sunday's game against top-ranked 
Connecticut is a crucial matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one game in a regular season and I think we have to keep  
that in perspective,'' said Summitt, who has led the Lady 
Volunteers to six NCAA titles. ``While we have tremendous respect 
for Connecticut, we realize we have to come back home and play (No. 
4) Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Geno Auriemma, whose Huskies are 13-0, sees the game  
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It illustrates how you are at this point in the season,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some yardstick.  
</P>
<P>
	This game isn't tucked away in the late hours on some cable  
network or, in UConn's case, on the public broadcasting station for 
local viewership only. The game will be shown on national 
television (CBS). 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Kellie Jolly is more excited about the game than her  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the big one,'' Jolly said. ``The nation will be  
watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UConn leads the series between the perennial powerhouses 4-3.  
There's been something significant -- a national title, a top 
ranking or a winning streak -- on the line each game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols (12-1) are returning to Storrs and the 10,027-seat  
Gampel Pavilion where the rivalry started in January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies' 77-66 win that year earned them the No. 1 ranking.  
They met again a second time that season for the national title. 
The Huskies won 70-64 to cap a 35-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn won the next regular season game, 59-53, at Knoxville,  
snapping Tennessee's 69-game homecourt winning streak in January 
1996. Two months later, they met in the Final Four and Tennessee 
won 88-83 in overtime en route to the first of three consecutive 
national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies last beat Tennessee in January 1997 at the Hartford  
Civic Center, but lost the next two meetings -- a regional final in 
the NCAA tournament and a regular season game at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I anticipated that it would have quite the level  
of interest nationally,'' Summitt said. ``It's probably exceeded my 
expectations. It's been good for both programs. Certainly, it's 
been good for women's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is led by All-America Chamique Holdsclaw, who is  
averaging 20.6 points, and is a scoring threat both inside and out. 
The Lady Vols also have a sophomore class that was considered the 
best group of recruits in the nation last season. Sophomore forward 
Tamika Catchings is their No. 2 scorer, averaging 15.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn pulled a similar recruiting coup with this season's  
freshman class, led by high school player of the year Tamika 
Williams. She scored a season-high 21 in a 106-52 victory over 
Pittsburgh Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much has been said and written about those two classes,''  
Summitt said. ``Our sophomores take it as a challenge -- a 
compliment obviously -- but also a challenge how they will stack up 
and if they continue to be a dominant class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies are led by sophomore guard Svetlana Abrosimova, who  
is averaging 17.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams play an uptempo, pressure defense and have a  
quick-striking offense. The Huskies have scored at least 100 points 
in nine games and could challenge the NCAA women's record for 
100-point games of 15 by Long Beach State in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about handling their pressure,'' Auriemma said. ``If  
we get shots at the basket every time down the floor, we're going 
to win because we're going to make most of our shots. The same is 
true of them. How well they play will be a function of how well 
they handle our pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee lost to Purdue on the road early in the season. The  
Lady Vols beat South Carolina 87-58 Thursday in a game that left 
Summitt less than pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played in spurts, but this team has played in spurts all  
year,'' she said. ``We played hard but we didn't always play 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both coaches agree they have to play their best games Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll either have the national championship wrapped up or  
we'll be runners-up, even though there has been a lot of good 
basketball before the game and a lot to come after,'' Auriemma 
said.

<HEADLINE> Hoyas Coach Thompson Leaves Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Thompson always kept a deflated  
basketball on his desk in his Georgetown office, a reminder to his 
recruits of the fragility of life playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's useless without 9 pounds of air,'' Thompson said. ``Now,  
do you want to pin your future on 9 pounds of air? Make sure when 
you no longer have basketball, you have a future. Get an 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a credo Thompson practiced for 27 years at Georgetown in  
a remarkable career that ended when he resigned Friday. His legacy: 
He won games -- and he made his players go to class, demonstrating 
that academics and athletics can co-exist in an era when big money 
rules major college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud that John Thompson's players are students  
first,'' Georgetown president Leo O'Donovan said. ``We have won the 
right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first person Thompson hired when he became coach in 1972 was  
Mary Fenlon, an academic advisor. Fenlon has been going with 
Thompson on recruiting trips ever since, making sure the 
student-athletes will concentrate on their studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the hard-study didn't deter scores of blue-chip high  
schoolers from heading to Georgetown. Thompson coached as hard as 
Fenlon tutored, turning a team that was 3-23 the year before he 
arrived into a perennial powerhouse. His teams made 24 consecutive 
postseason appearances, won a national championship in 1984, and 
posted a 596-239 record -- a .713 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one -- and I mean no one -- could have made Georgetown a  
national power better than John Thompson did when he became 
coach,'' said former North Carolina coach Dean Smith, who had 
Thompson on his staff at the 1976 Olympics. ``Every team he ever 
coached played hard and together and did what he wanted them to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For players, the deflated basketball is as much a trademark as  
the white towel Thompson always draped on his shoulders during 
games. Other unforgettable pictures from Thompson's career include 
his bear hug of Freddie Brown, whose errant pass cost the Hoyas a 
chance to win the 1982 final, and in the final moments of the 1984 
title victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Thompson's walkout in 1989, when he missed two  
games to protest NCAA Proposition 42, which limited the amount of 
financial aid for which athletes could qualify. Thompson felt the 
proposition hurt minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you agreed with his stance on issues, I always  
respected the fact that he stepped forward and expressed his 
opinion,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``His opinion opened up 
dialogue about issues that maybe would not have been discussed. As 
a result, action was taken. We need more people like that. He is 
not afraid to tell you what he thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who left because of personal reasons, made his  
resignation announcement in the gym where students taunted him with 
racial slurs when he fielded a predominantly black team in his 
first year at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``What am I most proud of?'' Thompson said. ``Probably when  
somebody walked up to me and told me I wore my blackness well. I 
thought that was the greatest compliment I've ever received in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new coach is Craig Esherick, who has been an assistant under  
Thompson since 1982. Esherick doesn't plan to change anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thing I would be an absolute fool if I did anything  
differently basketball-wise,'' Esherick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't feel that way as an assistant coach,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Life for Giving Son HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) -- A man who injected his son with the AIDS  
virus to avoid paying child support was sentenced to life in prison 
Friday by a judge who warned he is going to ``burn in hell from 
here to eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Stewart, 32, of Columbia, Ill., stared straight ahead as  
Judge Ellsworth Cundiff handed down the maximum sentence for 
first-degree assault. The judge said he wished the sentence could 
have been stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thought is injecting a child with the HIV virus really puts  
you in the same category as the worst war criminal,'' Cundiff said. 
``I believe when God finally calls you, you are going to burn in 
hell from here to eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was convicted Dec. 6 of injecting AIDS-tainted blood  
into the boy, who was then 11 months old, during a hospital visit 
in 1992. The child, now 7, was diagnosed with AIDS in 1996. If the 
boy dies, Stewart could be tried for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Stewart was trying to avoid child-support  
payments. Stewart, who worked as a hospital technician at the time, 
stole the blood from his workplace, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the sentencing, the boy's mother, identified only as  
Jennifer, tearfully read a statement from the boy in which he said: 
``I feel mad. I think he shouldn't ever be out of jail. He 
shouldn't have done this. Why did he do such a bad thing to me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's attorney Joseph Murphy, said he has already filed an  
appeal. ``He's innocent,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contended the boy could have contracted the virus a  
number of other ways. However, the boy had never had a blood 
transfusion, and a medical exam found no evidence of sexual abuse.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Pilot Charged in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An Air Force pilot who allegedly started an  
affair after his wife asked for a divorce faces more than 20 years 
in military prison if convicted of fraternization and other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Hodson, who represents 12-year veteran Capt.  
Joseph A. Belli, said Friday the Air Force intends to destroy his 
client's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything he holds dear is essentially gone,'' Hodson said.  
``I don't know that you have a lot of control over who you fall in 
love with in life. But it's a hell of a price to pay, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formal charges were filed last week against the Travis Air Force  
Base captain and father of five. The military version of a grand 
jury proceeding is expected to begin within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, who flew Secretary of Defense William Cohen's entourage  
to the Mideast last spring, was charged with fraternization, 
conspiracy and disobeying a direct order to end the relationship 
with Airman Susan Redo. 
</P>
<P>
	He allegedly began the affair when he was stationed at Diego  
Garcia Air Base in the Indian Ocean in November 1997, several 
months after his wife requested a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, 35, told his estranged wife about the affair when he  
returned to Travis last year, military officials said. She became 
angry and notified his commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt very much if that lady had any inkling of the ton of  
bricks she was about to bring down on her children's father,'' 
Hodson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials have accused Belli of asking his wife and  
Ms. Redo, who is in her early 20s, to lie about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Redo will not be prosecuted because the military assumes an  
officer is in control in such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel became a  
national issue in 1997 when Lt. Kelly Flinn, the first female B-52 
bomber pilot, was charged with adultery for having an affair with 
the husband of a female airman in North Dakota. She eventually was 
allowed to resign and was not prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Outline of Senate Trial Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The plan approved unanimously Friday by the  
Senate for President Clinton's impeachment trial, and the earlier 
Democratic and Republican proposals. 

</P>
<P>
	THE BIPARTISAN PLAN: Approved by Senate, 100-0.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's legal team and House prosecutors have until 5 p.m. EST  
Monday to file any pretrial motions. The trial resumes Wednesday 
with arguments and rulings on any motions. Opening presentations 
begin at 1 p.m. Thursday, and both sides will be limited to the 
evidence made public during the House impeachment proceeding. House 
prosecutors will have the first 24 hours -- to be spread over 
several days -- to present their arguments. The president's legal 
team then will have 24 hours -- also over several days -- to present 
its arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators then will be permitted to pose questions to both sides  
through Chief Justice William Rehnquist for up to 16 hours. When 
the Senate completes questions, motions to dismiss the case or 
motions to call witnesses or request evidence not in the record 
will be heard and debated. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on any motion to dismiss will be given priority. If it  
fails, the Senate will vote on any motions to present witnesses. If 
the Senate agrees to allow either the House prosecutors or the 
president's legal team to call witnesses, the witnesses will first 
be questioned in private. The Senate would decide after depositions 
which witnesses could testify in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After any witness testimony, the Senate would deliberate and  
then vote on the articles of impeachment. 

</P>
<P>
	EARLIER REPUBLICAN PLAN:   	
</P>
<P>
	GOP senators originally proposed allowing each side a total of  
24 hours to present its case, beginning next Thursday. Senators 
could then submit questions to Rehnquist to ask of the lawyers. 
Senators would decide whether to call witnesses, with a majority 
vote required. After testimony of any witnesses, the House 
prosecutors and Clinton's lawyers would have had eight hours each 
for closing arguments. 

</P>
<P>
	EARLIER DEMOCRATIC PLAN:   	
</P>
<P>
	Democratic senators originally proposed that House prosecutors  
present their case next Tuesday and Wednesday. The president's 
lawyers would present their defense the next two days. On Jan. 19 
and 20, senators could question both sides. No witnesses would be 
allowed. Each side would have three hours for closing arguments on 
Jan. 21 and then House managers would get an additional hour for 
rebuttal. The Senate would hold deliberations between Jan. 22 and 
Jan. 25, followed by a vote on the articles.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Still a Mess After Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With hundreds of miles of streets clogged with  
snow, Motown remained a mess six days after the Blizzard of '99. 
And today it started snowing again, with 3 to 5 inches expected by 
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	With hundreds of reporters in town to cover the North American  
International Auto Show and today's visit by President Clinton, the 
city's image -- as well as its residents -- were taking a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we have the same mayor in Bucharest and Detroit,''  
said Edouard Darvaviu, a Romanian television reporter covering the 
auto show who likened the snow-clogged chaos to conditions in his 
impoverished homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Dennis Archer defended himself Thursday against charges he  
dropped the ball when a foot of snow began falling Saturday on this 
city of 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that people are inconvenienced,'' he said. ``I  
believe they will see that ... we can turn it around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that snow remains piled on city streets. Unlike in other  
major cities, Detroit does not plow residential streets and cold 
temperatures and overcast skies have kept the snow from melting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrible,'' said 61-year-old Juanita Wright. ``If you're  
going north and someone's going south, you panic. ... You don't 
dare get out of the rut you're in, and neither do they.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the city was unprepared and responded slowly once  
the snow started falling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ain't California, this is Michigan,'' City Councilman  
Kenneth Cockrel Jr. said. ``There was a certain amount of 
complacency. They just didn't take the warnings seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comerica Bank economist William T. Wilson said a conservative  
estimate of business losses due to the snow would be $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The snow definitely highlights the city's deficiencies,'' he  
said. ``There's no reason why a winter storm should shut down your 
public schools and disrupt commerce six days after the storm hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city's 180,000 schoolchildren returned to class this  
morning, but they missed four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Many travelers are still fuming over the time it took Detroit  
Metropolitan Airport and its dominant air carrier, Northwest 
Airlines, to restore regular service. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands slept at the suburban airport Monday and Tuesday, and  
some incoming passengers said they spent up to eight hours waiting 
to get off planes because of a shortage of ground crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place gets 13 inches of snow and shuts down for three  
days,'' Northwest passenger Chuck Hilbert said. ``There's no excuse 
for that. None.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit isn't the only city still struggling to cope with the  
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Chicago's 433,000 public school students were  
absent Thursday, and school buses remained out of service. The 
city's rail and bus transit systems were running slow, and many 
streets were barely passable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chicago's schools reopened Wednesday. And Chicago got 20  
inches of snow to Detroit's 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago budgets about $12 million each year for snow and ice  
removal and employs about 700 trucks to scrape the nearly 3,800 
miles of roads in the city, said John Camper, spokesman for Mayor 
Richard Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, by contrast, has a $1.5 million snow-removal budget --  
no larger than that of smaller, warmer Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer on Thursday declared a snow emergency and told residents  
to move their cars off streets where snowplows were working; if 
they didn't they risked having the cars ticketed and towed. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit would like to be known as the ``Renaissance City,'' and  
Archer would like to be known as a can-do mayor. But visitors and 
residents alike say the storm revealed the distance between the 
slogans and reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to now I have been impressed,'' Chicago autowriter James  
Flammang said of the progress Archer has made since taking office 
five years ago. ``Now I'm not so sure.''

<HEADLINE> Snow Throws Capital Into Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Snow! In January, no less!  
</P>
<P>
	As predicted, up to 3 inches of snow fell in the nation's  
capital Friday. The reaction among many of the locals: something 
close to panic, predictably. 
</P>
<P>
	``People down here don't react appropriately at all,'' said Leon  
Locke, a radiation therapist originally from snowy western 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not take much snow to throw the Washington area into  
weather overdrive. Schools and offices close. Commuters make 
elaborate arrangements or simply stay home. Otherwise sensible 
suburbanites clean out the grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Locke watched with some amazement Friday as cars slid through  
slushy downtown streets. He, for the record, got to work on time 
despite the light but steady snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at that. No winter tires,'' he said as a car lumbered  
through a couple inches of wet, brown crud. 
</P>
<P>
	For transplants such as Locke, and probably for much of the rest  
of the country, Washington's helplessness in the face of a little 
winter weather is unfathomable. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, neither northern nor southern, typically gets a  
handful of snowstorms each winter. Most of the time, a few inches 
accumulate and then melt within a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are few snow plows, and the trucks that pour sand  
and salt on the roads can take hours or days to treat smaller 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents caused by the slippery roads mounted through the day  
Friday, and both police and road crews were scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're urging people to stay home if they don't have to go out.  
These roads are very, very slick,'' said Maryland State trooper 
Robert Moroney, who was on patrol in suburban Montgomery County. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow canceled a meeting Friday between U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky and the Japanese trade minister, who was unable 
to fly into Washington from New York. Federal government offices 
remained open, but most local school systems shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people outside the (Capital) Beltway understand  
how awful the commute here can be, even on the best day,'' said 
Bruce Milhans, spokesman for the federal Office of Personnel 
Management. ``Snow absolutely affects people's commutes and their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milhans, whose agency decides whether the approximately 270,000  
federal workers in the Washington area get a snow day, also 
chuckles at the local fascination with weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A child of Rapid City, S.D., who came to Washington via a stint  
in Alaska, Milhans said he was amazed by the intense news coverage 
that a fairly ordinary storm can generate. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow got equal billing with the unfolding impeachment trial in  
some Washington media Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this kind of prophesying of doom when you hear that  
it's going to snow an inch. We understand very well what the 
concern is ... but an inch of snow in January is not really 
something to get worked up about.''

	Senators Meet on Trial Procedure  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are working feverishly to keep the  
first presidential impeachment trial this century from becoming a 
model of partisan discord. Majority Leader Trent Lott and his 
Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle, invited their rank-and-file 
members to an informal meeting today. The senators will try to 
reach a bipartisan agreement on procedures for the trial. Clinton 
is charged with perjury and obstructing justice. 

</P>
<P>
	Tripp Talks of Missing Records  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp says she may have seen billing  
records from Hillary Rodham Clinton's law firm in a safe in Vincent 
Foster's office. The White House had said the records were lost for 
a few years, but they mysteriously turned up later in the White

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, who  
unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 
1996, is moving ahead with a possible bid to lead the GOP ticket in 
2000. He planned to form a presidential exploratory committee 
today. Alexander, 59, was governor from 1979 to 1987. He also was 
president of the University of Tennessee and was secretary of

<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II -- an ardent foe of  
communism -- welcomed former communist Massimo D'Alema, Italy's new 
prime minister, to talks at the Vatican today. For many Italians, 
the pontiff's meeting with D'Alema, the first former communist to 
head a West European government, is a sign of acceptance for 
Italians loyal to the nation's ``other church'' -- the Italian 
Communist Party.

	KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of people rampaged through  
an Indonesian town today, hurling stones at police stations and 
looting shops. Police fired plastic bullets at the mobs, killing at 
least one person and injuring nine. Rioters here banged drums, 
burned a motorcycle, taunted security forces and threw bricks. 
Civil unrest borne out of economic woes, has plagued the Southeast

	Israel Cult Members To Be Deported  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli authorities say members of a  
Denver-based Christian doomsday cult would be deported this 
weekend. Police suspect the cult members planned a violent incident 
at one of Jerusalem's holy sites to bring about the second coming 
of Christ as the millennium approaches. No charges have been filed. 
There has been concern that cult members were planning a mass 
suicide.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of year-end hiring returned the  
nation's unemployment rate to 4.3 percent in December and helped 
produce in 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four 
decades. The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.4 percent in 
November, returned to the level reached in April and May and, 
before that, in 1970, the Labor Department said today.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Info Fuels Ovarian Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is called the killer that whispers. That  
subtlety is why it is so deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovarian cancer is not a disease that gets lots of attention -- no  
marches or TV ads or ``get tested'' campaigns. Few women know it is 
the most lethal type of reproductive cancer. Few even can name the 
symptoms, so insidious that women may pass off the problem as 
indigestion until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are ways women can protect themselves -- and new  
discoveries are giving cancer researchers and doctors fresh hope of 
finding better treatments, or even a test that might catch budding 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 27,000 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer  
this year, and 14,500 will die. 
</P>
<P>
	While it mostly strikes women over 40, it can hit 20- and  
30-somethings, too. Roughly 40 percent of ovarian cancer patients 
survive five years. Contrast that with breast cancer, where 
early-detection and treatment improvements are letting more than 70 
percent of patients live that long. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Ovarian cancer usually is detected only after it has spread  
out of the ovaries and throughout the abdomen, making it much 
harder to treat. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms are subtle -- just ``whispers,'' Dr. Gordon Mills of  
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston calls them: mild pelvic or 
abdominal pain; abdominal bloating; gas, nausea or similar stomach 
complaints that persist over a week; fatigue; increased urination 
or changes in bowel habits. 
</P>
<P>
	While women can get mammograms to spot early breast cancer or  
Pap smears to catch cervical cancer, there is no screening test for 
early detection of ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Fishman of Northwestern University is out to change  
that. He heads a research team that has created a small device to 
let doctors pluck a few cells from a woman's ovary and evaluate 
them for early cancer -- much like a Pap smear tests cervical cells 
for cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishman is seeking government money to begin clinical trials  
needed to prove the device works. If it does, women one day could 
have diseased ovaries removed before the cancer endangers their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists also are experimenting with blood tests to detect  
early ovarian cancer, including one called LPA that M.D. Anderson 
is studying in 1,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills and colleague Dr. Robert Bast Jr. just identified two  
genes that propel ovarian cancer, letting them hunt for novel 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Such work offers long-awaited new optimism. But until it pans  
out, Fishman and the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition offer women 
protective advice: 
</P>
<P>
	--Talk with your doctor to discover your personal risk. Family  
medical history is key -- look not just for relatives with ovarian 
cancer, but clusters of breast, colon or prostate cancers. Your own 
medical history plays a role. Breast cancer survivors, for example, 
have a fourfold higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishman urges high-risk women to see a board-certified  
gynecologic oncologist. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get a rectovaginal exam every year, where the doctor inserts  
fingers inside the pelvis to feel whether ovaries are enlarged or 
tender. Relax so the doctor can reach deep enough, and pay 
attention to how thorough the exam is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expect it to be uncomfortable,'' said coalition founder Gail  
Hayward, who has battled ovarian cancer for nine years. ``You want 
it to be, because you want to know that physician is probing deep 
down into that cavity where the ovaries can be palpated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Large women whose ovaries cannot be reached manually, high-risk  
women or those with symptoms can get a transvaginal ultrasound, a 
painless test done by inserting a small probe into the vagina. 
Women with symptoms also often get a blood test called CA125, but 
it is not reliable enough for a definitive diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Consider birth control pills, which cut ovarian cancer risk up  
to 60 percent in women who use them for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Childbearing and breast-feeding also reduce the risk. The more  
times a woman ovulates during her lifetime, the more chances there 
are to trigger ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptives, pregnancy and 
nursing inhibit ovulation. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jury Reportedly Probing Alaska Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is being investigated by a  
federal grand jury over alleged irregularities in maintenance and 
repair records for some jetliners, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal investigation involving the federal Department of  
Transportation is centered around allegations that maintenance and 
repair work was recorded as having been done when it was not, 
according to the copyright story, which cites unidentified sources 
close the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury, which is meeting in the Northern District of  
California, also is looking into allegations that unauthorized 
employees signed off on maintenance work, the sources said. It was 
not clear where the jury was seated within the district. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based airline, which has 500 daily departures from  
40 cities in the Western United States and Mexico, has never had a 
crash or passenger fatality related to its operations since its 
founding in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal investigations of airline practices are rare, and it is  
has not been established what prompted the investigation of Alaska 
Airlines, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Corrigan in Oakland, Calif., who  
is heading the investigation, declined to comment, citing grand 
jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the airline say that they have not been given  
specifics of the inquiry, but the Federal Aviation Administration 
has assured them that it is not related to air safety or 
airworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply do not know what the Department of Transportation is  
alleging,'' spokesman Lou Cancelmi said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be understood that the federal government has  
unlimited access to all of our maintenance and flight operations 
records, on demand, and at all times,'' he told the newspaper. 
``Alaska Airlines always has been forthcoming regarding any request 
from the government, just as we have been in this investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No formal charges have been brought against the airline or its  
employees, and Cancelmi said he wasn't aware of any employees 
subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents searched company facilities in Oakland and  
Seattle late last month, seizing maintenance records relating to 
three of the airline's MD-80 jetliners. The airline has 40 of the 
planes, or nearly half of its 85-plane fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Eastern Airlines pleaded guilty to conspiracy and  
falsifying maintenance records in a plea agreement and paid $3.5 
million in fines. None of the violations caused accidents or 
injuries. Eastern has since gone bankrupt.

<HEADLINE> Electra: I'm Still Married to Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Baywatch'' actress Carmen Electra says she  
and Dennis Rodman still are married and have no plans on getting an 
annulment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks we got the annulment,'' she said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had considered dissolving their marriage after they  
exchanged vows at a quick ceremony in Las Vegas on Nov. 14 but then 
decided to stick together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love each other,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls star known for his outrageous outfits, tattoos  
and dyed hair ``really does have a good heart,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's what I love about him. His kind generous heart and  
his way of trying to make everyone around him feel comfortable and 
happy and have a good time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Electra, 26, said she doesn't mind living in separate homes. She  
lives in a house in Beverly Hills while he lives in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us time to miss each other,'' she said. ``I think if  
we were together every day we would get on each other's nerves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a public appearance in New York last month, Rodman insisted  
that he and Electra were still married despite the annulment papers 
he filed nine days after their ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very classy woman,'' Rodman said. ``The decision I  
made was my decision and hopefully it stays.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Coach Awaits Jordan's Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Tim Floyd has coached hundreds of games,  
wooed just as many recruits and won over some of the toughest fans. 
Ask him about Michael Jordan, though, and the man who'll one day 
coach the NBA's premier team of the '90s turns into Every Fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I'm) just as anxious as all of you are,'' the Chicago Bulls'  
coach-in-waiting said Friday. ``And really looking forward to 
hearing what his intentions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the NBA lockout is all but settled, Floyd and the  
Bulls are in limbo until His Airness announces whether he's coming 
back or going on a permanent golf trip. If Jordan returns, Scottie 
Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the rest of the gang are more likely to, 
too, and challenge for a seventh championship. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jordan decides to hang up his shorts, however, Chicago will  
undergo one of the biggest rebuilding efforts in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I could see it being a very delightful situation if  
all of the players come back,'' Floyd said. ``I can see it being a 
very difficult situation if they're not back, but the same plan 
will be in place. And that plan will be to try to win a 
championship at some point, but there may be a process involved if 
those guys aren't here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf will get in touch with Jordan soon,  
either personally or through his agent, David Falk, Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Friday that Jordan was out of the country. ``I hope  
Michael makes a decision he's comfortable with,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jordan says he still wants to play, Floyd can't wait to talk  
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Jordan has backed off his stance that he won't play for  
anyone but former coach Phil Jackson -- Reinsdorf asked Jackson back 
one more time earlier this week but Jackson turned him down -- 
Reinsdorf wants to talk to Jordan before he officially makes Floyd 
the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought a great deal about it, but I really wouldn't want  
to share that prior to talking to Michael,'' Floyd said of what 
he'd say to Jordan. ``I'd prefer to visit with him about all of 
those things. And hopefully I'll get that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until someone tells him differently, though, Floyd is moving  
ahead as if Jordan and Co. are coming back. Call him an eternal 
optimist, but that's his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	As for those other, less-pleasant scenarios, he'll let general  
manager Jerry Krause worry about those for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we're doing right now is trying to make all of  
our plans with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Luc (Longley) and 
Dennis in mind,'' he said. ``But Jerry Krause is busy working on 
plan A, B and C. ... I think he'll know more about what direction 
he wants to go in on Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the demise of the Bulls seemed certain when Jackson left  
last summer, keeping the team together might not be that farfetched 
an idea. Pippen, who could be the key to Jordan's return, is still 
interested in staying in Chicago, his agent, Jimmy Sexton, told 
ESPN Radio 1000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who made $2.7 million last year, has long felt  
undervalued and underappreciated by the Bulls, who refused to 
renegotiate the longterm contract he signed early in his career. 
But past animosity is irrelevant, Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Chicago, Scottie Pippen will be theirs to lose at  
this point,'' he said. ``Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team and 
so, if we can work a deal out that works for Scottie, I think he 
would like to stay there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Pippen is still considered one of the top free agents  
available, some teams might shy away from him because of the back 
surgery he had this summer. But Pippen's back is fine, Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last six weeks, he's been playing in Chicago, playing  
full-court, full-speed and has been cleared by the doctors to 
play,'' Sexton said. ``So he's ready to play a game tonight if he 
has to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is eager to get on the court, too. Players can begin  
working out at team facilities beginning Monday, but coaches are 
barred from any contact until the labor agreement is finalized. 
Training camps are scheduled to open Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week's going to be very difficult for me from the  
standpoint that there'll be balls bouncing out there and we can't 
watch them,'' he said. ``I'd like to be out there with them.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Weighs Charge Against Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials are studying  
whether former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet could be tried in 
this country for a 1976 car bombing that killed one of his leading 
opponents here. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno acknowledged the review Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Previously, she had said U.S. officials were trying to help  
Spain obtain secret U.S. documents about Chile during Pinochet's 
17-year rule that began with a 1973 coup. Spanish prosecutors are 
trying to get the 83-year-old general extradited from Britain and 
want the U.S. data for use in trying him on charges of genocide, 
terrorism and torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also has said the U.S. investigation of the 1976 car  
bombing at a traffic circle on Embassy Row here ``was never 
closed'' and is being reviewed ``to see just where we stand with 
respect to the status of the investigation and the circumstances 
that apply now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference Thursday, Reno was asked if the  
reviewers were looking at ``whether Mr. Pinochet could ever be 
tried in the United States, if it should ever come to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno replied: ``That's what we have under review.''  
</P>
<P>
	The bombing killed former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier, a  
prominent Pinochet critic, and Letelier's colleague, Ronni Moffitt, 
who was a U.S. citizen. A Chilean intelligence operative, Michael 
Townley, was convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Moffitt's relatives have been pressing for a U.S. prosecution of  
Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remains cautiously neutral about Spain's  
pending prosecution of Pinochet and about a British court's denial 
of immunity for the general, who remains in custody in Britain. A 
recently announced U.S. effort to declassify the papers Spain wants 
has added momentum to the prosecution effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish also are requesting blacked-out portions in U.S.  
documents that already have been partially declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	Among these are:  
</P>
<P>
	--An FBI cable, dated Sept. 28, 1976, about Operation Condor, a  
joint effort by Chile, Argentina and Uruguay to stamp out leftist 
opposition in exile. The cable notes that the ``most secret phase 
of `Operation Condor' involves the formation of special teams from 
member countries who are to travel anywhere in the world to 
nonmember countries to carry out sanctions up to assassination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable was written a week after the Letelier assassination in  
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI official, writing from Buenos Aires, Argentina, says it  
is ``not beyond the realm of possibility'' that the assassination 
was part of Operation Condor. U.S. prosecutors quickly linked the 
killings to Pinochet's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
	--An April 15, 1975, U.S. defense attache intelligence report  
from Chile identifies Pinochet as sole authority over the 
much-feared DINA, or Chilean internal security apparatus. The 
document was heavily edited by U.S. censors before its release.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Far from the political chill of Washington,  
President Clinton basked Friday in the statistical sunshine of a 
historic economic boom and vowed to press ahead with an agenda to 
expand trade, improve schools and reform Social Security and 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again,'' he declared in a speech to the  
Economic Club of Detroit in which he touted his administration's 
economic record but cautioned against assuming prosperity will 
persist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced that his Council of Economic Advisers has  
calculated the economy's continued growth over the last 93 months 
as the nation's longest peacetime expansion. The previous record 
was 92 months for the economic expansion that followed the 1982 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department presented Clinton with more cheery news: a  
national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in December -- the lowest 
since it stood at 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. It is 
the lowest peacetime jobless rate since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gather today at a time of American economic renaissance,''  
he told an audience of nearly 2,000 at the Cobo Center in downtown 
Detroit. No mention was made of the Senate impeachment trial, 
either in his speech or in audience questions to which he responded 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks introducing Clinton, Detroit's Democratic Mayor  
Dennis Archer said it was no mystery in Michigan why Clinton's poll 
ratings have remained high despite his political trouble: ``We 
respect and appreciate a president whose policies put people 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside on the snowy streets, protesters for and against  
Clinton's impeachment rallied. Ollie Williams, 64, of Detroit held 
two signs: ``Stop the Insanity'' and ``We love Bill.'' Signs held 
by others took the opposite view: ``Fire the Liar'' and ``Clinton 
Must Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before delivering his speech, Clinton toured the North American  
International Auto Show in the cavernous Cobo Center. He peeked 
under the hood of a silver Jeep Commander, listened intently to a 
General Motors executive's explanation of an experimental fuel-cell 
technology and tugged gently at a seat belt in Ford's exhibit of 
its latest passenger safety system. 
</P>
<P>
	In warming up his audience at the Economic Club, Clinton said  
gawking at the shiny new cars ``made me feel like a kid again -- I 
wanted to leave with 10 of the cars myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing themes he intends to feature in his State of the  
Union address Jan. 19, Clinton said the key to the economic 
progress recorded during his six years in office is a combination 
of balancing the federal budget, investing in education and worker 
training and expanding trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has enabled the United States, the businesses and the  
people working here, to create a truly new, global, high-tech 
economy,'' Clinton said. Yet more must be done, he said, to prepare 
America's younger generation for a lifetime of job competition in 
the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my upcoming State of the Union address, I will propose  
further reforms and improvements in our public schools, and I will 
also advance a new training agenda'' for workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cautioned against a return to what he called the ``drift  
into a low-growth, hard-work, low-wage future'' that marked the 
American economy before he took office in 1993, when ``foreign 
competitors actually described America as another great power in a 
state of inevitable decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, he criticized Japan and Russia for exporting  
hot-rolled steel to the United States at prices below their 
production costs. He said the Commerce Department had not yet 
formally determined that this amounted to ``dumping,'' but he 
warned that if Japan's steel exports don't slow down soon, he will 
``look at anti-dumping action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said a ``major focus'' of his foreign policy in 1999  
would be to push for a modernization of the international financial 
system, which was shaken in 1998 by the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with share prices falling in Tokyo and Jakarta, but rising 
in Hong Kong and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 144.75  
points, or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 13,391.81 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares fell on concern over earnings among Japanese exporters  
amid continued volatility in global foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worried that the dollar's rapid fall below 110.00  
yen on Thursday in overseas market for the first time in 27 months 
would affect on the outlook for profits of Japanese exporters, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In late Friday afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 111.42 yen,  
up 0.44 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New 
York level of 111.04 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly moved as high as 112.40 yen in the afternoon  
on rumors that a U.S. rating agency might downgrade Japanese 
government bonds, but it quickly retreated to the low-111-yen 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian share prices closed sharply lower as investors took  
profits following Thursday's massive gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 18.446 points,  
or 4 percent, to 439.494 points after a 7.2 percent rise on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said concern over social instability in Indonesia also  
discouraged investors from investing long-term in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of rioters rampaged through an Indonesian town Friday,  
hurling stones at police stations and looting shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for the fourth  
consecutive session, boosted by expectations of a cut in local 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 29.13 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 
10,722.70. On Thursday, the index had surged 597.77 points, or 4.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the market closed, The Hong Kong Association of  
Banks decided to cut deposit rates by a quarter percentage point to 
4.00 percent. It was the fourth cut in interest rates in less than 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading Hong Kong banks also cut their prime lending rate -- the  
interest on loans to their best customers -- by a quarter percentage 
point to 8.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, shares closed mostly higher on continued bullish  
sentiment. The Straits Times Index rose 27.30 points, or 1.8 
percent, to 1,545.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as the government continues  
to support the market by buying through its stock market 
stabilization fund. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 17.44 points, or 0.27 percent, to 6,421.75. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mostly weaker on mild  
profit-taking, but a slew of resilient blue-chip stocks continued 
to drive up the market's main index. The Philippine Stock Exchange 
index of 30 selected companies rose 5.73 points to 2,140.64. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as local  
investors locked in profits made after three straight days of solid 
gains. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 10.37 points, or 
0.4 percent, to 2,160.29. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Alexander May Make Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, who  
unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 
1996, is moving ahead with a possible bid to lead the GOP ticket in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who planned to form a presidential exploratory  
committee today, went on the offensive against a potential 
Republican rival for the White House, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
and Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said in a telephone interview Thursday that he has a  
problem with Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are weasel words,'' he said. ``Compassionate  
conservative is just like Al Gore talking about `practical 
idealism.' They're designed to mean nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say `compassionate conservative,' it sounds like  
you're saying, `I'm not like the rest of those politicians who are 
not compassionate,''' Alexander said. ``I think we need to say in 
plain words, `I am a conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for Bush, responded: ``When Governor  
Bush says `compassionate conservative,' he is saying a conservative 
philosophy is a compassionate philosophy. Teaching people to read 
is both compassionate and conservative. Moving people from welfare 
to work is both compassionate and conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for the vice president, Chris Lehane, said it was  
``unfortunate'' that Alexander ``has joined the Republican attack 
pack by engaging in this politics of personal destruction'' rather 
than focusing on ``the best way to prepare America for the 21st 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 59, was Tennessee governor from 1979 to 1987. He also  
was president of the University of Tennessee and was secretary of 
education under President George Bush, the Texas governor's father.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Propose Steel Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is pledging to seek tax  
breaks for steel companies and aggressively pursue U.S. trade laws 
in an effort to protect the jobs of American steelworkers 
threatened by a flood of cheap foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report ordered by Congress, Clinton held out a threat of  
action against Japan if that country does not live up to promises, 
made during Clinton's recent visit, to cut steel exports to the 
United States. Those imports to America have surged by 480 percent 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry and lawmakers from steel-producing states were  
quick to reject the president's approach as offering too little 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a steel industry hemorrhaging with the flooding of  
our markets with foreign dumped steel, causing the loss of 
thousands of jobs, and the administration is applying a small 
Band-Aid to that massive hemorrhage,'' complained Sen. Arlen 
Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 20-page action plan issued Thursday night, Clinton pledged  
to seek $300 million in tax breaks for steel companies that contend 
they are losing millions of dollars in sales because foreign 
nations are dumping excess steel in this country at unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he would appoint a high-level White  
House coordinator to make sure government benefits flow quickly to 
the thousands of steelworkers laid off because of cutbacks in U.S. 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan did not give the industry its most cherished goals  
-- either quotas on steel imports or broad negotiations to force 
other nations to accept ``voluntary'' restraints on their shipments 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration missed by two days the deadline set by  
Congress to produce the plan, reflecting an intense internal 
debate. One group of advisers, led by Commerce Secretary William 
Daley, argued the political merits of helping a key U.S. industry 
and its union workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposing camp, led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,  
carried the day with arguments that the United States could not 
risk setting back chances for recovery from the worst global 
economic crisis in a half-century by erecting protectionist 
barriers that would close off the big U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the president seems more concerned about the  
global economic effect of taking action on steel than protecting 
American steelworkers who are suffering,'' complained Sen. Jay 
Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
	When the administration missed the Tuesday deadline, it gave as  
one reason Clinton's desire to talk personally about the issue with 
Rockefeller. But the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement 
late Thursday that he was ``deeply disappointed'' in the plan and 
would work to make sure Congress crafts a tougher response. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration insisted it was ``deeply concerned '' about  
the record steel imports to the United States in 1998, up 30 
percent in the first 10 months of the year, and was committed to 
protecting American companies and their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said it would seek $300 million in new tax  
breaks for steel companies in Clinton's new budget, which he is 
scheduled to submit on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new relief would allow steel companies to spread out over  
five years, instead of just two, losses incurred from the import 
surge. A similar ``carryback'' provision for farmers was approved 
last year, providing tax relief to another sector hard hit by trade 
losses from the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry and its unions have already filed cases  
against Japan, Russia and Brazil, accusing those nations of 
``dumping'' steel in this country at unfairly low prices and asking 
the government to impose penalty tariffs of up to 200 percent on 
certain types of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's report pledged those cases would be handled  
on an expedited basis and noted that the Commerce Department has 
agreed to apply the punitive tariffs retroactively to mid-November. 
But members of Congress said those cases will require months before 
tariffs can be imposed, meaning thousands more layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Thursday, Bethlehem Steel announced plans to eliminate 540  
jobs in Washington, Pa., and Massillon, Ohio, citing sustained 
losses and the impact of ``unfairly traded'' steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has clearly turned his back on the  
steelworkers,'' said Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, said the administration was making a  
mistake in not pushing for voluntary restraint agreements with 
foreign steel producers similar to those negotiated during the 
Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	While the White House had considered such an approach, Rubin and  
other officials argued that it would violate rules of the World 
Trade Organization, created in 1995 to police world trade.

<HEADLINE> Cold-Weather Engine Checks Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Operators of 120 U.S. commercial and business  
jets were ordered Friday to perform cold-weather engine tests after 
the government received reports of three in-flight engine shutdowns 
during this week's cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected engines, Allison 3007A and 3007C models, are on  
Embraer 145 and Cessna 750 series aircraft. The Embraer is a 
commuter airliner flown by Continental Express, American Eagle and 
Trans States airlines. The Cessna is a corporate jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration learned that starting the  
engines in below-freezing weather can cause the starter shaft 
O-ring seal to allow oil to leak from the engine's accessory gear 
box. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of oil can lead to an engine shutdown.  
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, the aircraft operators must perform  
engine checks when the oil temperature falls below 32 degrees. The 
Embraer operators must run the engines for three minutes and then 
check for leaks, and the Cessna operators must run the engine at 
maximum continuous power for 10 minutes and then check for leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	If an airplane fails the tests, it cannot be flown, the FAA said  
in its emergency airworthiness directive.

<HEADLINE> Jays Reliever Admits Injury's Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays reliever Paul Quantrill  
admitted Friday that the toboggan accident in which he broke his 
right leg actually was a snowmobile accident in the woods just 
north of his home in Port Hope, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old right-hander had surgery Tuesday to insert a  
stainless steel rod in his right leg and is expected to need at 
least three months to recover. He and his wife, Alyson, spoke to 
the media at the hospital where he had the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash confirmed snowmobiling is one  
of the excluded sports written into a standard player's contract. 
So is tobogganing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the implications may be, we just don't want to be  
dishonest about it,'' Quantrill said. ``We don't feel good as 
people, so we said, `Let's get this out in the open and deal with 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said it would be a few days before he knew what action, if  
any, the team would take. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked with our lawyers and the insurance people, but we  
probably won't hear back from them for a couple of days,'' Ash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carney Lansford blew out his knee in a snowmobile accident in  
1990 and missed the entire 1991 season. The Oakland Athletics had 
the option of withholding his salary because snowmobiling was 
prohibited by his contract, but the club opted to pay him because 
Lansford was a key part of the franchise's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal point of view, I think Paul is a great Blue  
Jay,'' Ash said. ``He's a guy I have a personal relationship with. 
That's one side of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other side is business is business. We'll obviously take a  
long look at this. There will be no snap decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill led Toronto pitchers with 82 appearances last season.  
He was 3-4 with seven saves and a 2.59 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a two-year contract last season and was to make $1.4  
million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill said the only reason he originally said it was a  
tobogganing accident was because he was worried about the public's 
perception of a well-paid baseball player recklessly endangering 
his career on a snowmobile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I made the wrong decision here, but it was a scary time  
and in some ways embarrassing,'' Quantrill said. ``We panicked. We 
didn't come up with a wild scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was simply, `I fell on the toboggan,' which I've done a  
million times. It just seemed more presentable,'' he said. ``At 
this point, I would rather forfeit the entire contract than have to 
feel poorly about myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This marked the second time in the offseason the Blue Jays have  
had to deal with a story involving lies. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Toronto manager Tim Johnson apologized for falsely  
claiming he served in the U.S. military in Vietnam and was a high 
school All-American basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	While Quantrill is hopeful he can be back in three months, most  
of the medical opinions he has received suggest a longer layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Stephen, who performed the surgery, suggested he would  
be happy if the bone healed in three months. Quantrill then would 
require extensive rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stephen said it's ``not impossible'' for Quantrill to be  
back in three months, he said it's also possible the pitcher could 
miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill admitted he's got some tough decisions to make  
regarding his off-field activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said I'm going to live my life,'' he said.  
``Baseball means the world to me and I enjoy it, but I don't want 
to not go tobogganing or four-wheeling with my little boy who is 
already on a four-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to give up my whole life for baseball. I'm  
willing to make a lot of adjustments, but we'll have to to wait and 
see. I would imagine that maybe I'm going to burn that snowmobile 
when I get home.''

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Leader Names New Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's prime minister  
announced a new deputy premier and a new finance minister today, 
filling posts left vacant when he fired top reformer Anwar Ibrahim 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments were part of an effort to calm Malaysia's  
political arena, in turmoil since Anwar's firing and subsequent 
arrest set off protests marking the biggest challenge to Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's in 17 years in power. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deputy premier is Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, 59, who will  
relinquish his job as foreign minister. Daim Zainuddin, Mahathir's 
chief economics aide, will become finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, foreign minister since 1991, was also named home  
minister, responsible for the Royal Malaysia Police. Mahathir 
himself had held the post until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deputy premier is often called ``Mr. Clean,'' with a  
reputation of being a somewhat staid, but honest politician. 
</P>
<P>
	``A chap who is well-liked by different groups and factions,''  
said political science professor Chandra Muzaffar. ``A chap who is 
also seen as relatively clean compared to many other politicians. I 
think he will be a sort of obedient No. 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir announced the changes after an emergency session of the  
Supreme Council of the ruling United Malays National Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves were part of a huge reshuffle. Mahathir announced that  
he had made 12 ministerial appointments and that his UMNO party 
elections scheduled for June would be postponed for at least 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The job announcements came a day after Malaysia's top law  
enforcement official resigned to take responsibility for the 
beating of Anwar in police custody. Accused of illegal sex acts and 
abuse of power, Anwar says the charges are politically motivated to 
undermine his challenge to Mahathir. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Anwar's attorneys filing a lawsuit today against Mahathir  
and Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor, who resigned 
Thursday. Anwar is suing them for damages over his police beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar's defense attorneys failed yet again today to get their  
client released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous attempts to get Anwar out of jail, the courts ruled  
that he might attempt to tamper with prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution, however, rested its case last week.  
</P>
<P>
	``That reason for not granting bail no longer exists,'' said  
defense attorney Raja Aziz Addruse. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution quickly objected and said that prosecution  
witnesses could still be tampered with during defense 
cross-examination of government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Judge Augustine Paul agreed and denied bail.  
</P>
<P>
	``In any other case, bail would have been granted,'' snapped  
Raja Aziz. ``This seems to be an exceptional case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, dozens of Anwar supporters kept up their daily vigil,  
shouting ``Reformasi!'' and ``long live Anwar!''

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Disability Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Friday it will use  
cases involving two very nearsighted pilots, a truck driver blind 
in one eye and a mechanic with high blood pressure to clarify the 
scope of a federal law that bans discrimination against the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, in three separate orders, said they will hear  
those cases sometime in the spring, setting the stage for one or 
more significant decisions on the Americans with Disabilities Act 
by July. 
</P>
<P>
	The three cases are from Colorado, Oregon and Kansas.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 anti-bias law, best known for requiring handicap access  
to public buildings, has spawned hundreds of lawsuits nationwide -- 
forcing judges to interpret just how far Congress intended the law 
to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings have been conflicting and confusing.  
</P>
<P>
	The law bars employers from discriminating against a ``qualified  
individual with a disability'' because of that disability. A 
qualified individual is one who can perform a job's essential 
functions when given reasonable accommodation, and disability is 
defined as a condition that substantially limits a major life 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case from Colorado, twin sisters who want to be pilots for  
United Airlines say their extreme nearsightedness should be 
considered a disability protected against employment bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts had ruled that Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton are  
not protected by the ADA because their poor vision is fully 
correctable when they use glasses or contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sisters, now pilots for regional commuter airlines,  
unsuccessfully applied in Denver for jobs with United in 1992. Each 
sister has uncorrected vision of 20-200 in her right eye and 20-400 
in her left. A person with 20-200 vision can see an object from 20 
feet away only as well as a person with 20-20 vision can see it 
from 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sisters have corrected vision of 20-20 in both eyes but  
United refused to consider either because it requires all pilot 
applicants to have uncorrected vision of 20-100. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
against the women, concluding that although their poor eyesight was 
a disability it did not substantially limit a major life activity, 
and therefore was not protected by the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Oregon case, truck driver Hallie Kirkingburg says a  
supermarket chain violated the anti-bias law when it fired him 
after he flunked a vision test. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkingburg had been a commercial truck driver since 1979 with a  
good driving record when he was hired in 1990 by Albertson's 
supermarkets in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	He performed well on a road test. Although he is almost blind in  
one eye, medical examiners twice certified that he met federal 
Department of Transportation vision standards. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991 Kirkingburg suffered a non-driving injury and was off  
the job for almost a year. When he returned to work and took a new 
vision test, a doctor refused to certify that he met the vision 
standard. Albertson's fired him in 1992 for failing the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkingburg sued Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, saying it  
violated the ADA by refusing to let him return to work after he got 
a waiver from the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for Albertson's, saying the company did  
not have to accept a vision waiver. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals reversed that ruling and said Kirkingburg must be given 
a chance to prove his discrimination claim in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Murphy was a mechanic for United Parcel Service in  
Topeka, Kan., when fired because of the high blood pressure he's 
had since age 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Because UPS mechanics conduct road tests on trucks, the company  
requires them to have commercial drivers' licenses as well as 
health certification from the federal Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy got DOT approval, but shortly after he was hired a  
company nurse reviewed his file and determined his blood pressure 
exceeded the federal standard. UPS decided his health approval was 
issued in error and fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts ruled against Murphy's lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Friday, Murphy said health conditions  
should be evaluated as possibility disabilities covered by the 1990 
law without taking into account the effects of medication. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS lawyers said Murphy's view would expand the disability law's  
coverage to millions of Americans with conditions that can be 
effectively treated, such as asthma, diabetes and even poor 
eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Sutton vs. United Air Lines, 97-1943, Murphy vs.  
United Parcel Service, 97-1992, and Albertsons vs. Kirkingburg, 
98-591.

	Senate Agrees on Impeachment Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans and Democrats reached  
agreement in an extraordinary meeting today to resume President 
Clinton's impeachment trial next week while leaving open the 
question of witnesses. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that 
under the emerging plan the trial would begin with opening 
presentations. Two senators from each party would begin working on 
the difficult issue of witnesses. Little further was known of the 
timetable, although Sen. Connie Mack., R-Fla., said there would be 
no call of witnesses before Jan. 26 and no restrictions placed on 
the ability of senators to offer a motion to adjourn the trial.

	Clinton Touts Economic Success  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton braced the snowy Midwest  
weather today to celebrate the roaring economy during his 
now-imperiled administration. Addressing a luncheon of the Detroit 
Economic Club, Clinton reveled in new economic data marking a 
41-year peacetime low in the unemployment rate and ``the longest 
peacetime expansion in history.'' ``Most things are going right for 
our country,'' he said. The Labor Department presented Clinton with 
more good news today: a national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent 
in December, giving 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in 
four decades.

	U.S. Doubles Iraq Damage Estimates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon doubled its damage estimate from  
the airstrikes on Iraq, saying today the attack set back Saddam 
Hussein's weapons program two years and killed 600 to 2,000 
Republican Guard members, including key leaders. Gen. Henry H. 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that ``several 
key individuals'' from Republican Guard leadership that Saddam 
relied upon to control the Iraqi military were killed in the Dec. 
16-19 attacks. Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni said that U.S. and British 
forces hit 85 percent of the 100 targets selected.

</P>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African police fired  
birdshot and rubber bullets at Muslim protesters today just minutes 
before British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived for a ceremonial 
event. Three people were injured, none seriously. The demonstrators 
were protesting the recent U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq. 
Unruffled, Blair proceeded with the scheduled event -- the awarding 
of medals to British soldiers who are assisting the South African 
military -- and he made no mention of the incident.

	Clinton Seeks More Money for FDA  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is seeking to  
infuse more cash into the agency that monitors the safety of food 
and drugs because of worries it's losing the ability to fully 
safeguard Americans' health. The Food and Drug Administration says 
it's $165 million in the hole because of six years of budgets that 
didn't keep up with inflation. It's short 500 employees, and needs 
more specialized scientists to evaluate increasingly complex 
therapies.

	Anti-Abortion Web Site Goes on Trial  
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A multimillion-dollar lawsuit began today  
against an anti-abortion Web site that plaintiffs say violates a 
federal law barring activists from inciting violence against 
abortion doctors and their patients. Several doctors and Planned 
Parenthood are suing the American Coalition of Life Advocates and 
Advocates for Life Ministries alleging that the site called the 
Nuremberg Files is an ivitation to murder. The site records the 
names of hundreds of doctors who perform abortions, and catalogs 
such personal information as addresses, license numbers and even 
the names of their children.

<HEADLINE> Berra Museum To Show Yanks Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- The end of Yogi Berra's 14-year  
feud with George Steinbrenner is producing a dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum that bears Berra's name will get to exhibit the New  
York Yankees' 1998 World Series trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, three days after the Yankees owner and their Hall of  
Fame catcher announced a reconciliation, Berra told a news 
conference the trophy would be put on display at Yogi Berra Museum 
on the campus of Montclair State. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're loaning the trophy to us,'' said Berra. ``It was  
George's idea and I think it's a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy has been at the New York City Hall since Steinbrenner  
donated it to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``But (New York mayor) Rudy Giuliani has been a longtime admirer  
of Yogi,'' said museum executive director Dave Kaplan. ``All the 
details haven't been worked out yet but the trophy is going to be 
loaned to the museum so it can be put on display here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra again said he was glad the feud, which started when  
Steinbrenner sent an underling to fire him just two weeks into the 
1985 season, is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy. It makes me feel good,'' said Berra. ``and I  
think George feels good too. A lot of mistakes had been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bad feeling began when the Yankees owner sent Clyde King to  
fire Berra after a 6-10 start. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a mistake and he knew it. The problem was he didn't do  
it himself,'' said Berra. ``Managers are hired to be fired. I was 
fired two other times but you don't send someone else to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's all in the past now, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was fantastic,'' Berra said of Steinbrenner's museum visit  
and apology on Tuesday. ``He was very good. The way he apologized 
to me and my wife was great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Yankees. I've always rooted for them. They have a  
great team and a great manager. I'm a real New York sports fan. I'd 
love to see a Yankees-Mets World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, now that peace has been declared, Berra said he will again  
visit Yankee Stadium for a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made any plans yet but it's January; it's still  
early,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> A Cop and a Cook Fight for Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Sometimes while walking a beat as a New  
York City policeman, Rick Frazier must have thought about fighting 
for a world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	And while scrambling eggs and flipping burgers as a short-order  
cook, Golden Johnson had to have sometimes dreamed of throwing 
punches in a world title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, title shots are what the 39-year-old Frazier and  
the 24-year-old Johnson will get at the Pensacola Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier will challenge hometown hero Roy Jones Jr. for the  
WBC-WBA light heavyweight titles. Johnson will challenge Shane 
Mosley for the IBF lightweight championship in the first half of an 
HBO doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier is not bothered by fighting in Jones' hometown nor by  
criticism that his 18-3-2 record, with 17 knockouts, isn't worthy 
of the No. 1 ranking that has made him a mandatory challenger to 
Jones (38-1, 32 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
	``Look I'm a cop -- most hated profession in the world,'' the  
17-year police officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his big chance, Frazier, a pro boxer since 1992, said,  
``Sooner or later I knew it would happen. That's why I kept 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is a prohibitive favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has a good boxing style,'' Alton Merkerson, Jones' trainer,  
said Friday of the left-handed Frazier. ``But he's not a big 
puncher, so I think Roy won't be defensive. Rick is going to be 
under the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who will be 30 Jan. 16, however, did not sound like he  
was in an attacking mode. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he's not a banger he'll box, and you've got to pace  
yourself so he doesn't get you tired,'' the champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (15-2-2), of Killeen, Texas, didn't know he was going to  
fight Mosley until about a week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just gotten back in the gym, getting ready to redeem  
myself, when we got the call,'' said Johnson, loser of his last 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson got the call to fight Mosley (30-0, 28 knockouts), of  
Pomona, Calif., because Justin Rowsell of Australia, scheduled to 
challenge the champion, took a fight he didn't need and got knocked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Johnson lost a 12-round decision to Israel  
Cardona in a non-title fight Oct. 16 at Miami. Johnson thought he 
won the fight. So did Jack Mosley, the champion's father, manager 
and trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who won seven of eight fights in 1998, was inactive  
from July 19, 1995 until Oct. 5, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took two years off and was a short-order cook in Wichita  
Falls, Texas,'' he said. ``I took off because I had manager 
problems and I wasn't focused. I had to get focused on boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens Saturday night, the former cook is young enough  
to earn another chance at a title if he's good enough. That's not 
the case for the cop, who will turn 40 July 29.

<HEADLINE> Allegro Cookie Recall Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More Allegro brand cookies are being recalled  
because hazelnuts were omitted in an English-language ingredient 
list on the imported products. 
</P>
<P>
	People allergic to hazelnuts run the risk of a serious or  
life-threatening reaction if they consume the products. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Dangold Inc. of New York City recalled Allegro butter  
cookies filled with eclair because of the problem. On Friday, the 
company expanded the recall to include Allegro butter cookies 
filled with chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	The cookies are in 7-ounce boxes sold before November and bear  
the UPC numbers 0927 1936 1831 or 0927 1936 1817. They have no 
expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may return recalled cookies to the place of purchase  
for a refund, or call Dangold at 718-591-5286.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise Gets Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Co., the struggling  
jewelry and home products retailer, said today it has obtained a 
$750 million financing commitment to revive its operations and 
return to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said its chief executive officer and president  
Gary M. Witkin has resigned, and that a replacement will be named 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new funding, which is coming from Citibank, will help  
Service Merchandise make a three-week-late $13.5 million interest 
payment on its bonds, and pay down its $900 million credit facility 
from Chase Manhattan Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Zimmerman, the former CEO whose parents founded Service  
Merchandise in 1934 in Nashville, has been named non-executive 
chairman of the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can meet our operational and financial challenges -- and  
we're off to a great start with the new financing commitment -- we 
think we can return the company to profitability,'' Zimmerman said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Service Merchandise doubled in morning trading, up 40 1/8  
cents to 81 1/4 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. Last February, 
the company's stock hit a one-year high of $2.56 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise flourished into the 1980s, but the emergence  
of mega-discounters like Wal-Mart and other changes in the retail 
industry caused profits and stock prices to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	The company restructured its operations last year, narrowing its  
product offerings to jewelry, housewares and furnishings and 
shifting from warehouse distribution to off-the-shelf sales. 
Service Merchandise operates 347 stores in 34 states.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Web Site Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An abortion doctor testified today that  
she began wearing disguises and a bulletproof vest after she was 
put on a Web listing of ``baby butchers'' where the names of those 
slain are crossed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sharon Newhall, one of a group of doctors accusing the site  
called the Nuremberg Files of being an invitation to murder, said 
she took a clear message from being placed on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were saying to me that if I didn't stop doing abortions,  
my life was at risk,'' she told the eight-member federal jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It affirmed I could not let up my protection,'' she said.  
``Until the list I felt diluted,'' one of many doctors who perform 
abortions. ``Suddenly I feel real visible to individuals who might 
not be quite balanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newhall, who performs abortions along with her husband at a  
Portland clinic, said she now wears the bulletproof vest in public 
and carries wigs with her to change her appearance. Steel doors and 
bulletproof glass have been installed at her clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Several doctors and Planned Parenthood are plaintiffs in the  
multimillion-dollar civil suit claiming the site violates a federal 
law that bars activists from inciting violence against abortion 
doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include the American Coalition of Life Advocates, an  
umbrella group for several anti-abortion groups nationwide, and 
Advocates for Life Ministries, a Portland-based group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the defendants maintain the site and a set of  
posters distributed by the its backers are part of a political 
debate, and therefore protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The site records the names of hundreds of doctors who perform  
abortions, and catalogs such personal information as addresses, 
license numbers and even the names of their children. Defense 
lawyers said it does not make outright threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case about the threat to kill or injure, which is  
simply not there,'' attorney Chris Ferrara said Thursday during 
opening statements. ``Opinions? Yes, sometimes harsh. But no 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff's attorney Maria Vullo said in her opening statement  
that the site appears at a time when anti-abortion bombings and 
shootings have claimed seven lives since 1993, and is enough to 
constitute a real threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The site drew attention in October, when the name of Dr. Barnett  
Slepian was crossed off the list shortly after he was killed at his 
suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like bounty hunters of the Old West, the defendants want  
to stop the doctors by any means -- dead in their tracks,'' Vullo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants have just gone too far, beyond the realm of  
protected speech,'' she said. ``It's terrorism, ladies and 
gentlemen, against people that do something the defendants disagree 
with.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	A storm system was causing snow to fall in the Ohio Valley and  
northern Plains this morning. That system is expected to push 
eastward later tonight, causing snow and rainfall down the Atlantic 
seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regions were still struggling to cope after last weekend's  
storm. Schools were closed again in Detroit on Thursday, with many 
of the city's streets still unplowed and more snow predicted today. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is expected to continue to develop over the Ohio  
Valley and push towards the Northeast today and tonight, causing a 
wide variety of precipitation over the eastern half of the nation. 
The northern edge of the precipitation is predicted be in the form 
of snow, from the southern Great Lakes into northern New England. 
Accumulations of 3 to 8 inches are possible from southern Wisconsin 
to Vermont and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south of the snow, a large area of freezing rain and  
sleet is forecast from southern Illinois, along the Ohio River and 
into the central Appalachians. Some locations across the area may 
receive up to a half of an inch of ice through tonight, sufficient 
enough to down trees and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain is expected to fall over the Tennessee Valley and the  
Southeast. The storm system may be strong enough to produce some 
severe storms along the Gulf Coast accompanied by powerful winds, 
large hail, and even isolated tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered snow showers and flurries are expected o extend from  
the northern Plains through the northern Rockies. Areas of the 
Northwest coast may also see precipitation in the form of light 
rain. High pressure may cause regions along the Canadian border to 
clear out. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas from the central and southern Plains to the Pacific Coast  
are expected to see quiet weather for the end of the work week, 
with most places expected to be dry and sunny. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the teens were forecast for the northern Plains;  
from the 20s to 40s along the Pacific coast, the Northwest, the 
mid-Plains, the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic; and in the 50s and 
60s in the Southwest and Southeast. Most of Florida, southern 
California and southern Texas may have highs in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's high temperature in the mainland was 80 in Key West,  
Fla., while the low was minus 27 in Bismark, N.D.

<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Floridian Jennifer Rodriguez is hoping  
to continue her winning ways when the women's 1,500-meter race is 
contested at the North American Regional speedskating trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who lives in Miami, won both women's events held  
Friday, while KC Boutiette of Tacoma, Wash., and Derek Parra of San 
Bernardino, Calif., won the two men's events staged on the first 
day of the three-day competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 12 Allround skaters from the United States and Canada --  
six men and six women -- will qualify for the World Allround 
Championships which will be held Feb. 5-7 in Hamar, Norway. 
Qualifiers will be determined Sunday by overall standings after 
four races. 
</P>
<P>
	The region also includes skaters from New Zealand and Australia,  
but neither country sent competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty pleased,'' said U.S. Allround coach Bart Schouten.  
``It was kind of what we expected, especially the men, and of 
course Jennifer was great. That was nice. We skated well but they 
(Canada) have some good skaters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither country can win more than four spots on either team or  
less than two. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who finished fourth in the 3,000 meters at the Nagano  
Olympics last year, won the 500 meter race in 40.81. seconds and 
the 3,000 in 4:21.78. Boutiette won the men's 500 in 37.11 seconds 
and Parra the 5,000 in 6:47.84. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I skated well,'' said Rodriguez. ``I'm looking  
forward to the next two races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Marshall of Canada finished second in the 500 in 37.32,  
and the next four spots were won by Americans, with Parra third in 
38.05. Cynthia Overland of Canada finished second in the 500 in 
41.21 and Shana Sundstrom of Glen Ellyn, Ill., was third at 41.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Overland finished second in the 3,000 at 4:24.23. Elm was second  
in the 5,000 at 6:49.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Men and women will both skate 1,500 meter races today. On  
Sunday, the women compete at 5,000 meters and the men at 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Bipartisan Plan Emerges for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After days of differences, Senate Republicans  
and Democrats reached general agreement today on a format for 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. The agreement combined 
elements of the plans the two parties had developed separately. The 
details of all three plans: 

</P>
<P>
	BIPARTISAN PLAN: The trial would resume next week, possibly  
Wednesday or Thursday, with opening presentations by House 
prosecutors and the president's legal team. That phase would be 
ended by Jan. 26. In the interim, two senators from each party 
would meet to discuss the details of calling witnesses in case they 
are called. After opening presentations, the full Senate would 
decide whether to call witnesses. Senators could make a motion at 
any time to adjourn the trial. 

</P>
<P>
	THE REPUBLICAN PLAN: GOP senators propose allowing each side a  
total of 24 hours to present its case, beginning next Thursday, 
after which senators could submit questions to Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist to ask of the lawyers. Senators would decide 
whether to call witnesses, with a majority vote required. After 
testimony of any witnesses, including questions from senators, the 
House prosecutors and President Clinton's lawyers would have eight 
hours each for closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also would require both sides to submit their  
written trial arguments by 5 p.m. EST Monday. The Senate would act 
on the motions on Thursday and then hear opening arguments, first 
from the House and then from the president's lawyers. GOP House 
prosecutors are pressing to call several witnesses, including 
Monica Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty Currie and Clinton 
confidant Vernon Jordan. 

</P>
<P>
	THE DEMOCRATIC PLAN: Democratic senators are backing a proposal  
under which the House managers would present their case on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. The president's lawyers would present their defense 
the next two days. On Jan. 19 and 20, senators could question both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side would have three hours for closing arguments on Jan.  
21 and then House managers get an additional hour for rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate would begin its deliberations on Jan. 22 and conclude  
on Jan. 25. It would vote on the articles of impeachment on Jan. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan has no provision for calling witnesses.  
Instead, Democrats propose an up-or-down vote on the articles of 
impeachment after the cases are presented or, at the very least, a 
vote to set aside the trial and move to censure.

<HEADLINE> Disney Recalls 'The Rescuers' Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is recalling 3.4 million  
copies of the animated video ``The Rescuers'' after employees 
discovered the photographic image of a nude woman embedded in the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney recalled the cartoon on Friday, advising customers to  
mail in their tainted tapes for a new copies. The recall applies 
only to videos purchased since Jan. 5, when the film was 
re-released. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman declined to characterize the image other than to  
say it was objectionable. However, sources familiar with the video 
told The Associated Press it showed a woman's nude torso. 
</P>
<P>
	The image cannot be seen when the tape is viewed at normal  
speed, spokeswoman Claudia Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney recalled the video ``to keep our promise to families that  
we can trust and rely on the Disney brand to provide the finest in 
family entertainment,'' Ms. Peters said. She would not say how much 
the recall would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rescuers'' follows the exploits of a group of courageous  
mice who try to rescue a little girl from kidnappers. 
</P>
<P>
	The offending picture was inserted into the film after the  
cartoon was drawn and was on prints distributed to theaters in 
1977, 1982 and 1989, Ms. Peters said. As with the video, the 
picture was not visible on the film prints when shown at normal 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The image was not on copies of the video released in 1992  
because it was made from a different print, Ms. Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Disney knew who tampered with the film, Ms. Peters  
would only say it was an internal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that was done more than 20 years ago,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is a first for Disney, although conservative  
religious groups claim other animated features have included risque 
words or images. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 the Virginia-based American Life League urged a recall  
of ``The Lion King,'' arguing that in one scene rising clouds of 
dust spelled the word ``sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group also wanted Disney to excise portions of ``Aladdin''  
and ``The Little Mermaid.'' In ``Mermaid,'' the group said, a 
minister becomes aroused during a wedding ceremony and in 
``Aladdin'' the title character purportedly mumbles a phrase urging 
teen-agers to remove their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has denied the allegations in each case, calling  
them misperceptions.

<HEADLINE> Plummer Leads Cards From NFL Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Bill Walsh calls him the next Joe Montana.  
Deion Sanders says he's a young Fran Tarkenton. The Arizona 
Cardinals see him as their savior. 
</P>
<P>
	No rocket arm. No imposing physique. Absolutely no flamboyant  
personality. Yet no young quarterback comes close to the 
heart-thumping excitement Jake Plummer has created in just two NFL 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can be a great quarterback in this league for years to  
come,'' fullback Larry Centers said. ``Kind of like Larry Bird used 
to do, he makes everybody a part of the situation and elevates our 
level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barely 24, Plummer has led the Cardinals into the playoffs for  
the first time in 16 years and to their first playoff victory in 
more than a half-century. Suddenly, a desert metropolis is enjoying 
Cardinal-mania after dismissing the team as a loser for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just that Plummer helped put the Cardinals in the NFC  
semifinals against the mighty Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, it's the 
way he did it. Nine times in his 26 starts -- seven times this 
season -- Plummer has brought Arizona back from a tie or deficit in 
the fourth quarter to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals had to win the last three games of the regular  
season to make the playoffs, and they won all three on last-second 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has anything to do with magic. I don't have a  
wand out there with me or anything,'' said Plummer, who was also a 
star at Arizona State. ``I'm just out there trying to win a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals expect to win plenty in the years to come.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard for us to screw this up,'' said Bob  
Ferguson, vice president for player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona has eight picks in this year's draft, and probably will  
have a couple more as compensation for players who move elsewhere. 
Two of them are in the first round, Nos. 8 and 21, thanks to the 
trade with San Diego last season that gave the Chargers Ryan Leaf 
and left Arizona with Andre Wadsworth and a pile of draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals must sign new contracts with linebacker Jamir  
Miller and wide receiver Rob Moore. But considering the four-year, 
$29.7 million deal Plummer just got, including an NFL record $15 
million signing bonus, money no longer seems to be a problem for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Bill Bidwill, long considered a grumpy tightwad, is now a  
lovable, ice cream-eating eccentric. He has even been spotted 
smiling on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	And the undisputed star of it all is the guy Ferguson calls  
``the skinny kid from Idaho who played at Arizona State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer shrugs it all off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be a laid-back guy who has fun out here, who  
acts like a kid who's 24 years old but has a pretty important 
position,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have placed their future on the shoulders of the  
6-foot-2, 197-pound Plummer, and not just on the field. The team's 
success this season could have a big impact on the vote, 
tentatively set for May, on whether to build a domed stadium in 
suburban Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did Joe Montana mean to the San Francisco franchise when  
they were turning it around in the early '80s?'' Ferguson asked. 
``What's Brett Favre meant for Green Bay?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, Plummer fades into the background.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wears jeans and T-shirts and has a backpack,'' Ferguson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But his easygoing personality masks a confidence that has  
infected everyone around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quiet, soft-spoken,'' coach Vince Tobin said, ``but you  
can feel an inner strength within him that he knows he's capable of 
making plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was a hero in Arizona long before he put on a Cardinals  
uniform. He was the star quarterback for an Arizona State team that 
went 11-0 before losing to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals took him in the second round of the 1997 draft.  
</P>
<P>
	``People questioned his arm strength. I did, too, at one time,''  
Ferguson said. ``He's just so skinny. But I really loved the way he 
played -- the flair, the heart, things you can't measure. There was 
a special quality about him. What he has as a quarterback is 
something only the great ones have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer didn't play until seven games into his rookie season.  
With the Cardinals at their own 2 in Philadelphia, he trotted into 
the huddle and told his teammates they were going to score. Then he 
took them 98 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer started the last nine games in 1997, and big things were  
predicted for his sophomore year. His teammates even elected him 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	But he struggled with the West Coast offense installed by Marc  
Trestman, the new offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	After Plummer had two interceptions returned for touchdowns in a  
blowout loss in Seattle, then had three picked off in a home loss 
to Oakland, columnists and callers to radio talk shows wanted him 
benched. At 3-4, the Cardinals had a welcome week off. 
</P>
<P>
	When play resumed, Jake the Snake was his old scrambling self,  
especially thriving when the Cardinals went to a no-huddle offense 
that created the kind of football anarchy that brings out his best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really learned to just go out and play,'' he said. ``It was  
just a matter of staying patient and not getting uptight and not 
getting down, going through the little bit of growing pains I had 
to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team finished 9-7, then pulled off the stunning playoff win  
in Dallas last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In leading the Cardinals to their first winning season since  
they moved from St. Louis in 1988, Plummer threw for 3,737 yards, 
more than Favre, Troy Aikman, John Elway and, yes, Montana, in 
their second NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer threw 17 touchdown passes but was intercepted 20 times,  
often on passes when he should have thrown it away or taken a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still 24 years old in the second year of his career and  
the first year of a new offense,'' Trestman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he marvels at how his quarterback affects everybody around  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very special guy. I'm very lucky to be around him,  
believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Cardinals agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's surprising a lot of guys and surprising his  
teammates and his fans, but he has the potential to be all-world,'' 
wide receiver Frank Sanders said. ``Jake's hungry, and he's 
receiving good instruction at a young age, so the sky's the 
limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *End Adv for Jan. 9-10

<HEADLINE> Holmgren To Coach Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren was hired  
by Seattle today to turn around a team that hasn't been in the 
playoffs for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren was given an eight-year contract by the Seahawks,  
reportedly for $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who replaces the fired Dennis Erickson, guided the  
Packers to six straight postseason berths, two Super Bowls and one 
NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he enjoyed his years at Green Bay, but the key factor in  
his decision was the opportunity to run an entire football 
operation. He also was given the position as Seahawks' executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our time in Green Bay was wonderful,'' Holmgren said.  
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's ownership knew and appreciated that, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a real honest relationship the whole way,'' Holmgren  
said. ``They knew at some point in my career I would like to have 
the job I'm privileged to have now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's my job to come in here and do everything in my power  
to get the Seahawks to the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Green Bay eliminated by the San Francisco 49ers in the  
first round of the playoffs this season, the Packers coach was at 
the Seahawks' headquarters Thursday, interviewing for the Seattle 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning today, Holmgren arrived at Seahawks headquarters  
in this Seattle suburb in a limousine, accompanied by his wife and 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren coached the Packers to victory two years ago in the  
Super Bowl. He had one more year left on his contract in Green Bay, 
where he earned $2 million this season, but had a clause which 
allowed to talk to other teams if the offer also included the post 
as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren has said he would like a position in which he would be  
general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked for hours Thursday with team president Bob Whitsitt  
before going to dinner at the Mercer Island home of Microsoft 
co-founder Paul Allen, owner of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, coach of the Packers for seven seasons, was  
accompanied by his agent, Bob LaMonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt and Holmgren also met for several hours earlier  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt said last week that Allen would only become involved in  
the latter stages of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle fired Erickson Dec. 28 after the Seahawks missed making  
the playoffs for the 10th year in a row, the longest drought among 
NFL teams.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Touting Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton traded Washington's storms for  
Midwest snow today to celebrate the roaring economy during his 
now-imperiled administration. ``Most things are going right for our 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reveling in new economic data marking a 41-year peacetime low in  
the unemployment rate and ``the longest peacetime expansion in 
history,'' Clinton addressed a luncheon of the Detroit Economic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gather today at a time of American economic renaissance,''  
he said in a speech before taking questions on trade, international 
finance and defense spending from some of the club's 2,000 members 
and guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's political predicament was not raised in the audience's  
written questions fielded by the city's Democratic mayor, Dennis 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton heralded a new report by his Council of Economic  
Advisers charting the economy's continued growth over the past 93 
months as the nation's longest peacetime expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion following the 1982 recession lasted 92 months,  
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which 
determines changes in the business cycle using a combination of 
measures of gross domestic product, income, employment and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department presented with Clinton more good news  
today: a national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in December, 
giving 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again. It's working -- not just the economy.  
The crime rate's the lowest in 25 years. A lot of our social 
problems are receding. It's working again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His address, set against the backdrop of the turmoil in  
Washington, read like a defense of his six years in office. He took 
credit for the fiscal discipline and investments that he said drive 
the current economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he broadly traced his agenda for his remaining two years.  
``We will never have -- in all probability in the lifetime of people 
in this room -- to take the long view, to imagine how our children 
will live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While senators on Capitol Hill moved closer to working out  
details for the impeachment trial determining his fate, Clinton 
leisurely browsed the North American International Auto Show and 
watched a demonstration of futuristic fuel technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the future,'' Clinton told reporters at the  
show. ``It made me feel like a kid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech, sketching themes he will underscore in  
his upcoming State of the Union address and new budget, was planned 
before anyone knew it would fall on the day after the Senate opened 
trial proceedings on the impeachment charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let Bill alone! Let Bill alone!'' was the chant at a rally  
today organized by Detroit's Democratic Rep. John Conyers and union 
activists outside the Cobo Center, site of the auto show and 
Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits of escaping Washington -- the impeachment drama and  
a couple inches of snow -- were not lost on White House aides eager 
to show that Clinton was above the fray and focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foot of snow that left many Detroit streets  
unplowed, Clinton was lingering here even as another 2 to 4 inches 
of snow was forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his hourlong tour of the auto show, he was to  
tape his weekly radio address from the United Auto Workers union 
hall and participate in other private events there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has expanded from one to two days his trip to New York  
on Thursday for a conference of Wall Street executives trying to 
increase minority participation in the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's always looking for opportunities to travel  
around the country to see the American people,'' White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv said Thursday. ``And the auto show is a symbol 
of our economic future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is expected to  
draw 800,000 visitors to see the retro new editions of the 
Volkswagen Beetle, Ford T-Bird and Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a repressed hot-rodder confined to presidential  
limousines, owns a 1967 Mustang convertible that he and his 
brother, Roger, helped restore. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of today's CEA report have become familiar fodder for  
Clinton speeches in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
	--Median family income rose $3,500 from 1993 to 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	--New jobs totaled 18.8 million from March 1991 to December 1998  
with 17.7 million of those created since January 1993, when Clinton 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the State of the Union coming up, it's a good time for  
the president to reiterate economic themes that have been part of 
every State of the Union address because he's had a consistent 
policy,'' Toiv said.

<HEADLINE> A Small-Stock Comeback in 1999? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you're the sort of investor who insists on  
getting a bargain when you buy mutual fund shares, small-cap and 
mid-cap stock funds are bound to catch your eye right now. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when most types of stock investments carry high price  
tags, the small- to mid-cap sector of the stock market stands out 
as a notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless they put their money on Internet stocks, funds that  
specialize in stocks of newer and smaller companies made little 
progress in 1998, while the bull market for blue chips continued at 
full force. Big stocks have been hogging the spotlight throughout 
the latter half of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no predicting when this trend might reverse -- and no  
guarantee, for that matter, that it ever will. But measured on the 
basis of relative value, small and medium-sized stocks look 
unusually attractive to many people who follow them regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm highly bullish on the investment prospects for small- and  
mid-cap growth stocks,'' says Keith Mullins, an analyst who 
specializes in emerging growth companies at the investment firm of 
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. ``My optimistic outlook reflects three 
fundamental factors which, collectively, should allow the group to 
substantially outperform the broader market averages throughout 
1999 and into the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins argues, in sum, that prices of small stocks are  
unusually cheap, that their earnings prospects are brighter than 
those for larger companies, and that many investment managers are 
under-committed to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, managers of quite a few small-cap funds share  
Mullins' views. ``We believe our small-cap portfolios are chock 
full of bargains -- solid businesses selling at low prices to 
earnings,'' say Bill Nasgovitz and Eric Miller at the fund firm of 
Heartland Advisors in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Michael Mufson, manager of Putnam Investments' OTC &AMP;  
Emerging Growth Fund in Boston, ``Strong fundamentals and 
attractive valuations among aggressive-growth small-cap stocks 
point toward improving performance in coming months. Investor 
sentiment, dampened by recent market volatility, is currently the 
only thing blocking these stocks from rising strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Valuations in the sector are the lowest they have been in a  
decade, down to a 1:1 ratio to the Standard &AMP; Poor's index from a 
typical ratio of 1.5:1. These levels indicate a strong buying 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, any investor who keeps a close watch on the markets  
has heard all these arguments before. ``The current trends have 
been in place for two years,'' acknowledges Mullins. ``They are 
only more dramatic today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, the underperformance by small- and mid-cap growth  
stocks over the past two years has left many investors 
disillusioned. Despite discounted valuations and strong earnings, 
emerging growth portfolios failed to match the returns realized by 
the popular large-cap indexes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big problem for small stocks, many of their partisans  
believe, has been investors' increasing emphasis on top quality and 
maximum liquidity in the stocks they own, as the markets face 
repeated headlines about worldwide currency and debt problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And as long as blue-chip stocks keep performing so well, why  
bother even thinking about the lesser names? 
</P>
<P>
	But small-cap partisans say this psychology cannot prevail  
forever. Sooner or later, they say, the markets will have to go 
back to recognizing smaller companies' special ability to deliver 
earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mufson's words, ``Investor sentiment has leaned toward  
large-cap index funds as a 'flight to quality' strategy. But strong 
fundamentals and attractive valuations may make the argument for a 
shift as concerns about the global economy dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trigger for this shift in investor sentiments is twofold:  
Lower interest rates increase investor confidence, encouraging more 
aggressive positions, and decreased market volatility may lead 
investors away from large caps and make them willing to invest more 
aggressively again.''

<HEADLINE> Lawn-Boy Power Mowers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toro Co. is recalling 78,000 Lawn-Boy power  
mowers because the lower blade can break off and possibly injure 
the operator, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The mowers have a mulching fan that sits on top of the blade.  
Because there is nothing to hold the fan and blade together, the 
fan creates vibrations that can cause the lower blade to crack and 
break off, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toro, based in Bloomington, Minn., has received one report of a  
consumer who was struck on the ankle by a piece of a broken blade 
while operating the mower. The consumer suffered a bruised tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawn-Boy Silver Series, Four Cycle, walk-behind, 21-inch  
power mowers were sold at Lawn-Boy dealers and retail outlets, 
including Sear's, Lowe's and the Home Depot. The mowers were sold 
from January 1997 through November 1998 for $280 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall includes: power mowers with model numbers 10200,  
10202, 10212, 10236, 10302, 10307 and serial numbers ranging from 
7900001-7999999; power mowers with model numbers 10313, 10321 and 
serial numbers ranging from 7900001-8999999; and powers mowers with 
the model number 10249 and serial numbers ranging from 
8900001-8999999. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using the recalled mowers immediately. The  
company is mailing consumers free repair kits. Consumers who sent 
in their registration card will automatically receive a kit. They 
can have the repair performed for free at a local Lawn-Boy service 
dealer after receiving the kit. 
</P>
<P>
	To contact the nearest Lawn-Boy service dealer, consumers should  
call Lawn-Boy at 1-800-444-8676 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST 
Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Shoving Ends China Rights Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rival Chinese dissident groups exchanged  
shoves and shouts Friday after one group of exiles told a 
congressional panel that conditions have worsened dramatically in 
the seven months since President Clinton's visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before the House International Relations Committee  
demonstrated the fractious nature of the Chinese dissident 
community. Protesters complained that they hadn't been given a 
chance to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance, Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing,  
criticized those who testified, insisting that China punishes only 
those who break its laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei Jingsheng, who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons, told the  
committee that there had been ``a constant stream of arrests'' 
since Clinton's visit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not act swiftly, there will soon be more and more  
mothers who have lost their sons, wives who have lost their mothers 
and children who have lost their parents,'' Wei said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other dissidents called on Congress to consider imposing  
economic sanctions on China, 20 years after the two nations 
formally established diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members of both parties seized on the testimony to  
appeal to administration officials to maintain a hard line next 
Tuesday in talks in Washington with China's assistant foreign 
minister, Wang Guangya. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration policy toward China is ``a pathetic  
failure,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee released a recent report by Amnesty International  
concluding that ``while there has been minor, and mostly symbolic, 
progress in a few areas, in most areas the situation has actually 
gotten worse in the last three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not one Tiananmen Square prisoner has been released since  
Clinton's visit, China has taken no steps to undertake a review of 
political prisoners and continues the use of torture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing ended in melee between rival dissident groups,  
provoked by those who complained they hadn't been given a chance to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee staff members sought to keep shoving and shirt-pulling  
antagonists apart until police were summoned to restore order and 
clear the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The fracas began after shouting in Chinese broke out. Looking  
perplexed, chairman Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., asked if anyone 
could translate. But without waiting for an answer, he gaveled the 
hearing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman quickly ducked out of the room as the shouting  
intensified and chairs were knocked over. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, in particular, criticized the committee's  
decision to invite Wei and three other former political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are outraged with the placement of the wrong persons on the  
panel,'' said a statement issued by a group of Washington-based 
Chinese dissidents who oppose what they view as Wei's 
self-proclaimed leadership of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Washington leaders of the Chinese Democracy Movement had  
broken with Wei late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Lipson, a spokesman for the committee, said that Gilman  
was not aware of the rivalries among the dissidents or that a 
protest had been planned, and was glad no one was hurt or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at the National Press Club, Ambassador Li scoffed at  
Wei, calling him a criminal who was allowed to come to the United 
States in 1997 for medical treatment and ended up testifying on 
Capitol Hill. Wei spent most of 18 years in Chinese prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``In China, we practice the rule of law,'' Li said. ``If you  
don't violate the criminal code, you don't get arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Li said those who talk most loudly about human rights ``didn't  
say one word about victims of flooding last year and didn't take 
any action at all.'' He said Americans should respect China's 
system as different from that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are differences among people and we have to get used to  
that,'' he said

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Riot in Indonesian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of people rampaged through  
an Indonesian town today, hurling stones at police stations and 
looting shops. Police fired plastic bullets at the mobs, killing at 
least one person and injuring nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rioters in Karawang, on the main island of Java, banged drums,  
burned a motorcycle, taunted security forces and threw bricks. They 
smashed the windows of a bank, a hotel, two Protestant churches and 
attacked the home of an ethnic Chinese businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is because of the government,'' one man said, reflecting  
the deep public mistrust of the state that has emerged in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the violence lacked any political motive, with  
looters cheering and grabbing shoes, candles and umbrellas from 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of rioters were arrested, including one soldier dressed  
in civilian clothing, said police chief Col. Ahmad Hidayat. He did 
not say why the soldier was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil unrest plagued the Southeast Asian nation of 210 million  
last year and shows no signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, deadly riots and student protests helped oust President  
Suharto after 32 years of iron-handed rule, and authorities fear an 
escalation of violence ahead of national elections in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Riots broke out early today in Karawang, 40 miles east of the  
capital, Jakarta, after rumors spread that police had mistreated 
motorcycle drivers who ferry passengers for a living. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobs broke down the door of a department store and looted goods,  
Hidayat told the private Sonora radio news station. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd swelled and attacked the police headquarters and other  
posts, forcing police to fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-year-old high school student was shot and killed, said  
Rosid, a medic in the emergency room at the main town hospital. 
Nine people were wounded by gunfire and mobs beat two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The city center was quiet by late afternoon, but police fired  
warning shots and chased small bands of rioters after dark. 
Officers patrolled with megaphones, urging people to stay in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said looters did not single out shops owned by ethnic  
Chinese entrepreneurs. However, some rioters threw stones at a 
house owned by a Chinese businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the violence in Indonesia has been directed at the  
Chinese minority, which is resented partly because of its relative 
wealth. Many Chinese in predominately Muslim Indonesia are 
Christian or Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's persistent riots have been linked to economic  
hardship, ethnic and religious tensions and political turmoil. Many 
people also are suspicious of the armed forces, which have 
acknowledged human rights abuses during the Suharto era. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, is implementing  
political reforms but student activists say his measures fall far 
short of real democracy. One of their key complaints is that the 
military retains a prominent role in politics.

<HEADLINE> Sides Seal Deal in Private Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Quoting from Chaucer and his own deep  
knowledge of history, Sen. Robert C. Byrd urged Democrats and 
Republicans to remember that great Senate statesmen were not 
revered for being partisans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I implore us all to endeavor to lift our eyes to higher  
things,'' Byrd, D-W.Va., told colleagues in a closed session 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set the tenor for what we have achieved,'' Sen. Phil Gramm,  
R-Texas, said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than two hours, two senators of widely disparate  
philosophy -- conservative Gramm and liberal Democrat Edward M. 
Kennedy of Massachusetts -- suggested a way to resolve the knotty 
problem of how to run the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
Cries of ``hear, hear!'' greeted the compromise plan fashioned in 
secret in the Old Senate Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorn of microphones, sitting on folding chairs and with no  
television cameras watching, the 100 senators and a few senior 
staffers met in a last-ditch effort to avoid highly partisan votes 
on competing trial plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not having the modern conveniences reminded us of where we  
were,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The intimate room, rarely used by the Senate since 1859, is  
where such giants of the Senate as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and 
John C. Calhoun conducted titanic debates over slavery and states' 
rights in an attempt to avert the Civil War. A large portrait of 
George Washington gazes down from the wall; a gilt eagle and a 
shield adorn the Senate president's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a palpable sense in that room of the magnitude of  
these events and their importance to the nation,'' said Sen. Kent 
Conrad, D-N.D. ``You had the feeling there of the weight of 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a prayer focused on ``love of country, love of the  
institution'' by Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Byrd spent 
about 20 minutes reminding senators of the dignity of their jobs, 
discussed the meaning of the Federalist papers that serve as a 
bedrock of American democracy and recounted events of the 1868 
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said the White House had ``sullied itself'' and that the  
House had fallen into ``the black pit of partisan 
self-indulgence,'' according to a transcript issued later by Byrd's 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask everyone here who might harbor such feelings to abandon  
any thought of mean-spirited, destructive, vengeful, partisan 
warfare,'' Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Byrd laid a foundation ... to approach this issue with  
an open and temperate mind,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's speech was followed by descriptions of the competing  
plans. Participants said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., recounted 
a parable to illustrate the damage partisan politics can do. 
</P>
<P>
	In the story, a scorpion asks a frog for a ride across a river.  
The frog refuses. ``You'll just sting me,'' the frog says. ``No, I 
won't,'' the scorpion responds. 
</P>
<P>
	So the frog agrees. But halfway across, the scorpion does sting  
the frog, and they both begin to sink. ``Why did you sting me?'' 
the frog cries. ``It's in my nature,'' says the scorpion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point was, it's in our nature to be partisan, but we have  
to rise above that,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., conveyed a similar message by  
telling colleagues they could take one of two paths with roots in 
the historic chamber: the high road marked by great pre-Civil War 
compromises or the low road illustrated by the vicious 1856 caning 
of Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by South Carolina Rep. 
Preston Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Gramm stood and noted that the biggest sticking point  
between the two sides -- the question of calling witnesses -- was 
already addressed by Senate rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``His point was that if someone wanted to insist on a witness,  
they could, and we'd have to vote,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy quickly seconded Gramm's idea. ``I decided it was a way  
to get to first base and second base,'' he said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, as Dodd put it, ``The spirits of compromise were in  
the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested the deal be  
labeled the Gramm-Kennedy plan and sought to quell any further 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Let's not talk ourselves out of something,'''  
Brownback said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cries of ``hear, hear'' and ``seal the deal'' quickly ensued,  
``even some old-fashioned thumping of desks,'' Warner said. ``That 
was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators said they learned some valuable lessons in this  
rare secret session. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're speaking to each other and not to the television  
cameras, there's less of a hard edge,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, 
R-Utah.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Touting Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton traded Washington's storms for  
Midwest snow today to celebrate the roaring economy during his 
now-imperiled administration. ``Most things are going right for our 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reveling in new economic data marking a 41-year peacetime low in  
the unemployment rate and ``the longest peacetime expansion in 
history,'' Clinton addressed a luncheon of the Detroit Economic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gather today at a time of American economic renaissance,''  
he said in a speech before taking questions on trade, international 
finance and defense spending from some of the club's 2,000 members 
and guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's political predicament was not raised in the audience's  
written questions fielded by the city's Democratic mayor, Dennis 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton heralded a new report by his Council of Economic  
Advisers charting the economy's continued growth over the past 93 
months as the nation's longest peacetime expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion following the 1982 recession lasted 92 months,  
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which 
determines changes in the business cycle using a combination of 
measures of gross domestic product, income, employment and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department presented with Clinton more good news  
today: a national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in December, 
giving 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again. It's working -- not just the economy.  
The crime rate's the lowest in 25 years. A lot of our social 
problems are receding. It's working again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His address, set against the backdrop of the turmoil in  
Washington, read like a defense of his six years in office. He took 
credit for the fiscal discipline and investments that he said drive 
the current economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he broadly traced his agenda for his remaining two years.  
``We will never have -- in all probability in the lifetime of people 
in this room -- to take the long view, to imagine how our children 
will live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While senators on Capitol Hill moved closer to working out  
details for the impeachment trial determining his fate, Clinton 
leisurely browsed the North American International Auto Show and 
watched a demonstration of futuristic fuel technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the future,'' Clinton told reporters at the  
show. ``It made me feel like a kid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech, sketching themes he will underscore in  
his upcoming State of the Union address and new budget, was planned 
before anyone knew it would fall on the day after the Senate opened 
trial proceedings on the impeachment charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let Bill alone! Let Bill alone!'' was the chant at a rally  
today organized by Detroit's Democratic Rep. John Conyers and union 
activists outside the Cobo Center, site of the auto show and 
Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits of escaping Washington -- the impeachment drama and  
a couple inches of snow -- were not lost on White House aides eager 
to show that Clinton was above the fray and focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foot of snow that left many Detroit streets  
unplowed, Clinton was lingering here even as another 2 to 4 inches 
of snow was forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his hourlong tour of the auto show, he was to  
tape his weekly radio address from the United Auto Workers union 
hall and participate in other private events there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has expanded from one to two days his trip to New York  
on Thursday for a conference of Wall Street executives trying to 
increase minority participation in the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's always looking for opportunities to travel  
around the country to see the American people,'' White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv said Thursday. ``And the auto show is a symbol 
of our economic future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is expected to  
draw 800,000 visitors to see the retro new editions of the 
Volkswagen Beetle, Ford T-Bird and Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a repressed hot-rodder confined to presidential  
limousines, owns a 1967 Mustang convertible that he and his 
brother, Roger, helped restore. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of today's CEA report have become familiar fodder for  
Clinton speeches in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
	--Median family income rose $3,500 from 1993 to 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	--New jobs totaled 18.8 million from March 1991 to December 1998  
with 17.7 million of those created since January 1993, when Clinton 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the State of the Union coming up, it's a good time for  
the president to reiterate economic themes that have been part of 
every State of the Union address because he's had a consistent 
policy,'' Toiv said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged To Deny Spy Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee's two top  
members, concerned President Clinton may grant clemency to Jonathan 
Pollard, want fellow senators to demand the former U.S. Navy 
analyst remain in prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the committee chairman, said he is  
encouraging Clinton ``to rethink what I understand may be his 
expected course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby and his vice chairman, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., were  
seeking support from colleagues on a letter they planned to send 
the president pressing him to keep Pollard imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard was convicted as a spy for handing over thousands of  
top-secret documents to Israel in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing him, Shelby said in a statement accompanying the  
letter, ``would set a dangerous and unwise precedent that crimes 
against the United States are not serious. It would also undermine 
our country's ability to act as an honest broker throughout the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart denied Clinton  
has made a decision on Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process is ongoing, and any suggestion that he's made a  
decision based on that is wrong,'' Lockhart said. Clinton will 
receive a recommendation from White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff 
later this month, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton confirmed last month that he promised Israeli Prime  
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at U.S.-sponsored negotiations with the 
Palestinians in October that he would look into Netanyahu's request 
for leniency for Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff was directed to solicit views of U.S. intelligence and  
security agencies. Several former U.S. intelligence officials hotly 
opposed clemency and alleged that Pollard attempted to provide 
classified information to other countries before striking a deal 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	At FBI headquarters Thursday, spokesman Frank Scafidi said,  
``Justice has been done to this point. To release Pollard now would 
undo everything that law enforcement and prosecutors worked 
tirelessly to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's criminal division adamantly opposes  
clemency, senior officials said Thursday, requesting anonymity. 
Justice and FBI officials believe Pollard has never fully 
cooperated in assessing what secrets he sold the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said she would send Ruff a  
recommendation by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon refused to say what  
Defense Secretary William Cohen was telling Ruff. But Bacon, asked 
about the Pentagon's position, said: ``The Pentagon has been 
strongly opposed to the release of Jonathan Pollard in the past, 
and I don't expect any change from that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CIA director George Tenet, who attended the Israeli-Palestinian  
negotiations in rural Maryland, vehemently opposed Pollard's 
release and threatened to resign if it happened, an administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday what was Tenet's position on clemency for  
Pollard, CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher said the agency's 
recommendations are for the White House, and ``we are not going to 
state it publicly.''

<HEADLINE> Dogs Put Bite on Insurance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's how life is supposed to go: Get married, buy  
a house, have children, get a dog. But many homeowners are finding 
themselves having to choose between their pooches and their 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies say they're feeling the bite of dogs just as  
much as the people who wind up at the doctor's office. And they're 
tired of paying out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Stanwood of Newbury learned the hard truth firsthand.  
</P>
<P>
	She had wanted to adopt a German shepherd like the one she grew  
up with. But her insurer, Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Co., said 
no; the breed had made the company's pooch-non-grata list because 
of the risk it might sink its teeth into someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Meskell, senior vice president at Quincy Mutual, said the  
cost of dog bites makes his company hesitant to write homeowner 
policies for people who own aggressive dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you own a dog on our list doesn't mean you don't  
have coverage,'' he said. ``But it may be a hard sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dog bites, according to industry officials, cost insurers as  
much as $250 million a year in medical and liability costs, and 
account for one-third of all liability claims against homeowner 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the National Center for Injury Prevention and  
Control showed that the number of dog bites that required medical 
care rose 37 percent between 1986 and 1996, from 585,000 to 
800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During that same period, the number of dogs kept as pets went up  
only 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals most likely to be involved in an injury-causing or  
fatal attack include pit bulls, Rottweilers, German shepherds, 
huskies, Alaskan malamutes, Doberman pinschers, chows, Great Danes, 
Saint Bernards and Akitas, according to a study by the Centers for 
Disease Control and the Humane Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of dog bites don't end in death, but still  
cost homeowners and insurers a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
	Most companies don't have a blanket policy of denying insurance  
to dog owners, but acknowledge that more questions are triggered 
when homeowners list certain breeds on their insurance 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states mandate that insurers offer coverage for any dog,  
while others allow insurers to write policies that exclude dog bite 
liability from coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh Floyd, a spokesman for Allstate Insurance, said: ``We go  
anywhere from insuring homes with dogs who are not identified as 
biters ... to not insuring a home if they have a dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Berstein, vice president and general counsel of Met Life  
Property and Casualty, said his company prefers not to write 
homeowners policies for people who own dog breeds with a track 
record of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reasonable about this,'' he said. ``If the person can  
demonstrate that the dog is not inherently aggressive then we'll 
consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a letter from a veterinarian could serve as that type of  
assurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Allmerica Financial, parent  
company to Hanover Insurance Co. and Citizens Insurance Co. of 
America, said a dangerous dog can often be identified by looking at 
previous claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly if you're a pet owner and the dog has bitten 24 people  
in the past then you know that your dog is a vicious dog,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Georgetown Coach Thompson Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Thompson always told his players that if  
basketball gets in the way of more important things, it's time to 
put basketball aside. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he tearfully took his own advice.  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's startling resignation as Georgetown basketball coach  
came in a way no one would have predicted. He isn't leaving for the 
NBA. It isn't because his team appears headed for a losing season. 
It isn't because he's fed up with NCAA academic rules -- or with a 
'90s generation of players whose behavior has tarnished his 
program's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Thompson quit to deal with marriage problems, bringing  
a sudden and sad end to a storied college coaching career that 
helped set a standard for academic and athletic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going through a problem with marriage right now,''  
Thompson said. ``And I owe it to my family to address that, not 
just to myself and to my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't deal with that as a distraction.''  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and his wife, Gwen, who have been married for 32 years,  
separated after a fire damaged their home three years ago. Thompson 
filed for divorce in October 1997, and the hurt was evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' Thompson said. ``I can't give all the  
attention right now to my job that I need to give, and that burns 
the hell out of me. I don't mind losing, that goes with the 
territory, but I want to make sure I give my best effort if I lose. 
I can't do things halfheartedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Esherick, an assistant under Thompson since 1982, will  
debut as Georgetown's new coach Saturday at home against 
Providence. Georgetown president Leo J. O'Donovan said Esherick 
will shortly be signed to a new, long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Thompson, he will stay at Georgetown, doing ``whatever  
Father O'Donovan wants me to do.'' O'Donovan called Thompson the 
school's ``coach emeritus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson broke the news to his players Friday morning. He cried  
when he walked out of the room. Some of the players were already in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock,'' senior guard Joe Touomou said. ``Some guys  
were crying and stuff. He's like a father, so the reaction was 
obvious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Thompson's former stars, including Patrick Ewing, Alonzo  
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, also attended the news conference at 
McDonough Gymnasium, a small facility almost overwhelmed by all the 
banners the team has earned over Thompson's 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Esherick also was tearful, saying he tried to talk Thompson out  
of resigning. The 42-year-old former Georgetown player said he 
would have been content to remain an assistant for another 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is not happy,'' Esherick said. ``I'm not happy for  
myself, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I consider it an 
honor, and I also consider myself a complete fool to follow in his 
footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown was not a major basketball program when Thompson  
arrived in 1972. His first team went 12-14, the second 13-13. Every 
team since has been invited to postseason tournament play -- 20 
NCAAs and four NITs. He won the national championship with Ewing in 
1984, and his Hoyas were runners-up in 1982 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's record is 596-239, a .713 winning percentage, and he  
is 10th among active coaches in victories. Furthermore, Thompson's 
players almost always graduated on time -- 97 percent of his players 
who stayed four years left with a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last decade or so hasn't been the same. Thompson led the  
U.S. Olympic team to a disappointing bronze medal in the 1988 
Olympics, and the Hoyas haven't been to a Final Four in 14 years. 
Players began to leave Georgetown before graduating, and several 
made ugly off-the-court headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas now have the lowest graduation rate for men's  
basketball players among D.C.-area Division I schools, according to 
the latest NCAA statistics. This year's team (7-6, 0-4 Big East) is 
struggling in part because Shernard Long, last year's leading 
scorer, was suspended for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been afraid of the challenges of young people  
today,'' Thompson said. ``In fact, that has always stimulated me. 
... This is not something that was planned. This is not something 
that was plotted. It has nothing to do with our record. It's 
personal.''

<HEADLINE> Weekly Rig Count Down By 21 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of oil and gas rigs operating  
nationwide dropped by 21 to 600 this week, Baker Hughes Inc. 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy company officials said 990 rigs were operating in the  
United States during the same week last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running this week, 466 were exploring for natural  
gas and 133 for oil. One was listed as miscellaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since  
1940. The tally peaked at 4,500 in December of 1981 during the oil 
boom. It dropped to a record low of 596 in the summer of 1993, 
exceeding the previous low of 663 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The rig count represents the number of rigs actively exploring  
for oil and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, New Mexico and Texas  
dropped by six each, Oklahoma fell by three, Louisiana lost two and 
Alaska and Wyoming lost one rig each.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Info Fuels Ovarian Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is called the killer that whispers. That  
subtlety is why it is so deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovarian cancer is not a disease that gets lots of attention -- no  
marches or TV ads or ``get tested'' campaigns. Few women know it is 
the most lethal type of reproductive cancer. Few even can name the 
symptoms, so insidious that women may pass off the problem as 
indigestion until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are ways women can protect themselves -- and new  
discoveries are giving cancer researchers and doctors fresh hope of 
finding better treatments, or even a test that might catch budding 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 27,000 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer  
this year, and 14,500 will die. 
</P>
<P>
	While it mostly strikes women over 40, it can hit 20- and  
30-somethings, too. Roughly 40 percent of ovarian cancer patients 
survive five years. Contrast that with breast cancer, where 
early-detection and treatment improvements are letting more than 70 
percent of patients live that long. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Ovarian cancer usually is detected only after it has spread  
out of the ovaries and throughout the abdomen, making it much 
harder to treat. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms are subtle -- just ``whispers,'' Dr. Gordon Mills of  
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston calls them: mild pelvic or 
abdominal pain; abdominal bloating; gas, nausea or similar stomach 
complaints that persist over a week; fatigue; increased urination 
or changes in bowel habits. 
</P>
<P>
	While women can get mammograms to spot early breast cancer or  
Pap smears to catch cervical cancer, there is no screening test for 
early detection of ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Fishman of Northwestern University is out to change  
that. He heads a research team that has created a small device to 
let doctors pluck a few cells from a woman's ovary and evaluate 
them for early cancer -- much like a Pap smear tests cervical cells 
for cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishman is seeking government money to begin clinical trials  
needed to prove the device works. If it does, women one day could 
have diseased ovaries removed before the cancer endangers their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists also are experimenting with blood tests to detect  
early ovarian cancer, including one called LPA that M.D. Anderson 
is studying in 1,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills and colleague Dr. Robert Bast Jr. just identified two  
genes that propel ovarian cancer, letting them hunt for novel 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Such work offers long-awaited new optimism. But until it pans  
out, Fishman and the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition offer women 
protective advice: 
</P>
<P>
	--Talk with your doctor to discover your personal risk. Family  
medical history is key -- look not just for relatives with ovarian 
cancer, but clusters of breast, colon or prostate cancers. Your own 
medical history plays a role. Breast cancer survivors, for example, 
have a fourfold higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishman urges high-risk women to see a board-certified  
gynecologic oncologist. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get a rectovaginal exam every year, where the doctor inserts  
fingers inside the pelvis to feel whether ovaries are enlarged or 
tender. Relax so the doctor can reach deep enough, and pay 
attention to how thorough the exam is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expect it to be uncomfortable,'' said coalition founder Gail  
Hayward, who has battled ovarian cancer for nine years. ``You want 
it to be, because you want to know that physician is probing deep 
down into that cavity where the ovaries can be palpated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Large women whose ovaries cannot be reached manually, high-risk  
women or those with symptoms can get a transvaginal ultrasound, a 
painless test done by inserting a small probe into the vagina. 
Women with symptoms also often get a blood test called CA125, but 
it is not reliable enough for a definitive diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Consider birth control pills, which cut ovarian cancer risk up  
to 60 percent in women who use them for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Childbearing and breast-feeding also reduce the risk. The more  
times a woman ovulates during her lifetime, the more chances there 
are to trigger ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptives, pregnancy and 
nursing inhibit ovulation. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Questions Gov't Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During contentious questioning of the  
government's final witness in the Microsoft antitrust case, an 
economist warned of living ``in a Microsoft world'' unless the 
judge intervenes to restrain the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft battled with the economist over the company's promise  
to make its Internet software ``forever free.'' Its lawyer even 
offered to pause Thursday so the witness -- economist Franklin 
Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- could control 
his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The most contentious moments came during questions about  
Microsoft bundling its browser free into newer versions of Windows 
to undercut rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be driving black  
cars,'' Fisher said, his voice rising. ``That's not what 
competition is about. That's not what helping consumers is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you seem agitated, sir,'' Microsoft lawyer Michael  
Lacovara responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am agitated. I feel very strongly about this,'' Fisher said.  
``We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It might be a nice 
world, but it's not a competitive world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara offered to take a short break, but Fisher said his  
blood pressure was not cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, Fisher paused after Lacovara asked about his  
previous testimony that Microsoft ``studied and tried to implement 
ways to disable Netscape and reduce total browser sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara began to speak again when Fisher replied: ``I'm just  
dumbfounded by the question. It's not that I can't answer it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher then recounted government allegations that Microsoft  
bundled its own browser into Windows, promised the browser would 
remain free and used its influence to discourage others from 
distributing Netscape's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal antitrust law, a claim of predatory pricing  
includes the expectation that Microsoft eventually would raise its 
prices once it dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier testimony, Fisher told the judge that Microsoft spent  
``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to develop its browser and set 
its pricing ``for the explicit purpose of depriving rivals of 
revenues needed to be viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that it never planned to earn money selling  
its browser, but did plan to profit from advertising fees. The 
company's chairman, Bill Gates, previously said in an interview 
that advertising fees from a browser and from the search page and 
the home page far exceed the cost of development. ``So, clearly, 
the browser should be free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara, for example, said companies with tools to search for  
specific information on the Internet -- such as Lycos and AltaVista 
-- pay Microsoft $15 million annually for prominent placement on its 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher said: ``That (explanation) appears to have been  
invented in the middle of this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, a Microsoft spokesman cited a single line  
in a May 1995 e-mail from Gates discussing what he called ``a very 
powerful deal of some kind we can do with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates suggested in the e-mail that Netscape be told that  
browsers ``make no money.'' Netscape earned roughly $8.2 million 
selling its browser during the second fiscal quarter that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher acknowledged to Lacovara that many software companies  
distribute products free in order to sell related products or 
services, or to gain a foothold in a market. But Microsoft went 
further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with MIT  
economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week.

<HEADLINE> INS Probes Immigration Services Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents are investigating a Greenbelt,  
Md., company suspected of fraudulently enticing wealthy foreign 
investors to a program that grants them legal immigrant status 
through so-called ``investment visas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, formerly called American Immigrations Services and  
now known as AIS Inc., is being probed by the Baltimore district 
office of the Immigration and Naturalization Services, The 
Washington Post reported in its Friday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The newpaper quoted an internal INS memo as saying that ``most,  
if not all,'' of the investment visa petitions prepared by the 
company are based on ``paper companies'' that have not created the 
jobs required for such visas. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows legal permanent resident status for foreigners  
who create at least 10 full-time U.S. jobs by investing $1 million 
to establish a new business or rescue failing ones. The foreigners 
can qualify by investing as little as $500,000 if the jobs are in 
certain high-unemployment areas. 
</P>
<P>
	AIS advertises a risk-free process in which investors put up  
about $135,000 and arrange to borrow the remainder of the funds, 
the Post said. About $35,000 goes for AIS fees and $100,000 is put 
in escrow. The company then guarantees an eventual return of 
investment costs. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for AIS, William Cook, said the problems have arisen  
because INS keeps changing its interpretation of the investor visa 
law's requirement. The agency ``is simply trying to kill the 
program,'' Cook told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	AIS is directed by several former top government officials and  
other prominent people. Among them are former President Bush's 
brother, Prescott S. Bush Jr., former Democratic Rep. John W. 
Bryant of Texas, former assistant secretaries of state William 
Clark Jr. and Richard W. Murphy and retired ambassadors Stephen W. 
Bosworth and Jack F. Matlock Jr., the Post said.

<HEADLINE> Helmets Recommended for Skiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of skiers and snowboarders should  
wear helmets, the government says in a new report intended to help 
prevent the kind of accidents that killed Rep. Sonny Bono and 
Michael Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The protective headgear can reduce and avoid thousands of head  
injuries each year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission finds in 
a study being released today. It also could cut by nearly half the 
number of deaths related to skiing and snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving people the best safety information we have: That  
when they do ski, they should decide to wear helmets,'' Ann Brown, 
the commission's chairwoman, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concludes that helmet use by skiers and snowboarders  
could prevent or reduce the severity of 44 percent of head injuries 
to adults. The protective headgear could do the same for 53 percent 
of head injuries to children under age 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPSC study estimates that 7,700 injuries -- including 2,600  
head injuries to children -- could be prevented or reduced in 
severity each year with the use of snowboarding and skiing helmets. 
There were 17,500 head injuries associated with skiing and 
snowboarding in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmet use also could prevent about 11 of the 24 deaths from  
skiing and snowboarding each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting more skiers and snowboarders voluntarily to wear helmets  
may not be easy. Among the possible obstacles are fears that 
helmets will reduce speed on the slopes, the price of the helmets 
and just plain vanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that people don't think is cool,'' said Gary  
Taylor, manager of racing events at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in 
Mammoth Lakes, Calif. Those trying to avoid ``helmet head'' or 
trying to show off their hair on the slopes might resist wearing 
the headgear, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Good models of helmets for skiing and snowboarding can start at  
$100, said Taylor, although lesser quality helmets are available 
for as little as $30. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown warned that skiers and snowboarders shouldn't try to  
substitute bicycle helmets, because they do not offer the right 
kind of protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Taylor said encouraging skiers and snowboarders at  
Mammoth Mountain to wear helmets has met with some success. ``We're 
trying to get more of the athletes to wear helmets. It's actually 
been taken better than expected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of head injuries among skiers decreased from 13,600  
in 1993 to 12,700 in 1997. But snowboarding injuries nearly tripled 
and the number of head injuries caused by snowboarding increased 
fivefold during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission hopes the same efforts that have led to increased  
use of helmets by in-line skaters and bicyclists will prompt those 
heading to the slopes to take a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	The skiing deaths of Bono on Jan. 5, 1998, and of Kennedy the  
week before also have helped attract attention to the importance of 
the safety gear.

<HEADLINE> Luc Robitaille Joins 500-Goal Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Luc Robitaille was an afterthought for  
the Los Angeles Kings in the 1984 NHL draft. They made a guy named 
Tom Glavine their fourth pick, five spots ahead of Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine never did anything on the ice, but he turned into a  
decent pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, winning two Cy Young awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Robitaille, 32, became better than anyone predicted for someone  
drafted 171st overall. The player once criticized for skating 
slower than the Zamboni joined an exclusive club Thursday night by 
scoring his 500th NHL goal. He became the 27th NHL player to reach 
the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a spectacular feat,'' Buffalo's Michael Peca said. ``You  
look back at the years you've got to have to accumulate 500 goals. 
That's 30-40 goals-plus per year, and to keep that kind of pace 
over a career at this level is phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robitaille's 500th goal came when he skated past the left side  
of the net, flipped the puck in off a pass from rookie Pavel Rosa 
to beat Buffalo goalie Dwayne Roloson with 1:46 remaining in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 10,821 at the Forum erupted with a standing ovation  
and cries of ``Luuuuuc'' for one of the most popular players in 
Kings' history. Robitaille pumped his arms and rushed into an 
embrace with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	His two goals helped the Kings beat the Sabres 4-2 for their  
fifth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to keep going, can't stop there,'' said Robitaille,  
in his second stint with the Kings during a 13-year career. ``Until 
I get my hand on the Stanley Cup, nothing will be accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robitaille, like his team, is experiencing a resurgence this  
season. He has 22 goals and points in five consecutive games, with 
six goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He had only 16 goals last season when he returned to the Kings  
after a three-year absence. He missed 25 games with an abdominal 
injury, but came back in time for the team's first playoff 
appearance in five years. The Kings were swept by St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole comeback here has been great,'' he said. ``Now we're  
starting to play again the way we want to play. When you play to 
win, good things happen. I had a dream just to make the NHL. I 
never thought I'd get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kings coach Larry Robinson applauded his former teammate. He and  
Robitaille played together for three seasons before Robinson 
retired in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't give him enough credit for how much he's  
worked on his skating,'' Robinson said. ``That was the knock on 
him. But he's worked hard on it and he's taken lessons from 
instructors. So he's made a concerted effort. You don't get 500 
goals by being lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a 12-year-old in the Czech Republic, Rosa had a picture of  
Robitaille on his wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was my hero when I was growing up,'' Rosa said. ``Everybody  
talked about him as a scorer and a guy with great hands. I wish I 
could go as far as him. He has lots of passion for the sport ...''

<HEADLINE> Senate Faces Second Day of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After swearing to judge President Clinton  
fairly and impartially, senators are working feverishly to keep the 
first presidential impeachment trial this century from becoming a 
model of partisan discord. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott and his Democratic counterpart, Tom  
Daschle, are combining a heavy dose of symbolism with intense 
closed-door negotiations to forge agreements on how to conduct the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	They invited their rank-and-file members to an extraordinary  
informal meeting today in an ornate room that was the Senate's 
chamber, and scene of great debates, in the first half of the 19th 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to hold the same meeting in the Old Senate Chamber  
collapsed Thursday, after partisan rancor broke out only moments 
after President Clinton was formally made a defendant in the first 
presidential impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 
1868. The primary cause of the rupture was a dispute over the need 
for witnesses, which Republicans favor and Democrats oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Thursday had scheduled votes on their proposed  
ground rules and also on a Democratic alternative. With a 55-45 
advantage, the GOP would have won the fight, but at the price of 
setting a partisan tone that might never be overcome in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott pulled back from the brink and kept negotiating, deciding  
senators should ``keep calm and cool and dignified.'' His move 
prompted Daschle to proclaim: ``I think there is some common 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the first vote to be a partisan vote, and it  
came very close to being one,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such hopeful statements, the two parties were unable to  
bridge the gap during the day -- especially over the prospect that 
witnesses such as former White House intern Monica Lewinsky would 
testify about sex in the tradition-bound Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment, both  
related to his attempts to conceal his extramarital affair Ms. 
Lewinsky. One article charges the president with perjury before a 
federal grand jury, the second with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican serving since December  
1968, echoed the thoughts of many Democratic senators, commenting 
he had ``serious questions'' about calling Ms. Lewinsky to testify 
about her sexual escapades with the president at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have failed to allay such concerns, despite  
expressing a willingness to avoid questions to witnesses on 
explicit sexual material. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers were ``ready to go'' and  
ready to accept Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's evidence in the 
Lewinsky matter in exchange for a ban on witnesses. But, he added, 
if the House insisted on calling witnesses it would cause a delay, 
``because bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record 
opens up a whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And 
that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Clinton were brought in the name of the  
House of Representatives and ``of the people of the United States 
of America.'' But as every senator was aware as the trial opened, 
the articles were approved by a House that voted along mostly 
partisan lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now jurors,'' Stevens said. ``We don't want chaos.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, ``We've had a couple of rough  
moments,'' but he nonetheless saw a willingness ``to come 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators insisted it was solely their prerogative to  
run the trial, Lott and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., nonetheless met 
for several hours Thursday evening with the House prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good discussion on some of the options,'' said Paul  
McNulty, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee. ``The 
senators listened to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and other Republicans  
have prepared a list of potential witnesses, including Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Clinton secretary 
Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan Republicans crafted Thursday would give first the House  
and then the White House up to 24 hours each -- three eight-hour 
days, for example -- to present evidence, after which senators would 
have 16 hours for questions to lawyers. After that, the Democrats 
would be permitted to seek the adjournment of the trial, and the 
House or White House would be free to seek permission to call 
witnesses. Each side would have to justify any witness they planned 
to call. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote would occur early in February.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats responded with a timetable that called for the trial  
to end on Jan. 26, without the possibility of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Touts Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Far from the political chill of Washington,  
President Clinton basked Friday in the statistical sunshine of a 
historic economic boom and vowed to press ahead with an agenda to 
expand trade, improve schools and reform Social Security and 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again,'' he declared in a speech to the  
Economic Club of Detroit in which he touted his administration's 
economic record but cautioned against assuming prosperity will 
persist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced that his Council of Economic Advisers has  
calculated the economy's continued growth over the last 93 months 
as the nation's longest peacetime expansion. The previous record 
was 92 months for the economic expansion that followed the 1982 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department presented Clinton with more cheery news: a  
national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in December -- the lowest 
since it stood at 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. It is 
the lowest peacetime jobless rate since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gather today at a time of American economic renaissance,''  
he told an audience of nearly 2,000 at the Cobo Center in downtown 
Detroit. No mention was made of the Senate impeachment trial, 
either in his speech or in audience questions to which he responded 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks introducing Clinton, Detroit's Democratic Mayor  
Dennis Archer said it was no mystery in Michigan why Clinton's poll 
ratings have remained high despite his political trouble: ``We 
respect and appreciate a president whose policies put people 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside on the snowy streets, protesters for and against  
Clinton's impeachment rallied. Ollie Williams, 64, of Detroit held 
two signs: ``Stop the Insanity'' and ``We love Bill.'' Signs held 
by others took the opposite view: ``Fire the Liar'' and ``Clinton 
Must Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before delivering his speech, Clinton toured the North American  
International Auto Show in the cavernous Cobo Center. He peeked 
under the hood of a silver Jeep Commander, listened intently to a 
General Motors executive's explanation of an experimental fuel-cell 
technology and tugged gently at a seat belt in Ford's exhibit of 
its latest passenger safety system. 
</P>
<P>
	In warming up his audience at the Economic Club, Clinton said  
gawking at the shiny new cars ``made me feel like a kid again -- I 
wanted to leave with 10 of the cars myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing themes he intends to feature in his State of the  
Union address Jan. 19, Clinton said the key to the economic 
progress recorded during his six years in office is a combination 
of balancing the federal budget, investing in education and worker 
training and expanding trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has enabled the United States, the businesses and the  
people working here, to create a truly new, global, high-tech 
economy,'' Clinton said. Yet more must be done, he said, to prepare 
America's younger generation for a lifetime of job competition in 
the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my upcoming State of the Union address, I will propose  
further reforms and improvements in our public schools, and I will 
also advance a new training agenda'' for workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cautioned against a return to what he called the ``drift  
into a low-growth, hard-work, low-wage future'' that marked the 
American economy before he took office in 1993, when ``foreign 
competitors actually described America as another great power in a 
state of inevitable decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, he criticized Japan and Russia for exporting  
hot-rolled steel to the United States at prices below their 
production costs. He said the Commerce Department had not yet 
formally determined that this amounted to ``dumping,'' but he 
warned that if Japan's steel exports don't slow down soon, he will 
``look at anti-dumping action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said a ``major focus'' of his foreign policy in 1999  
would be to push for a modernization of the international financial 
system, which was shaken in 1998 by the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Web Site Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Attorneys defending an anti-abortion Web  
site that checks off slain abortion doctors like items on a grocery 
list say it is merely a form of political protest, not a blueprint 
for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The site records the names of hundreds of doctors who perform  
abortions, and catalogs such personal information as addresses, 
license numbers and even the names of their children. Defense 
lawyers said it does not make outright threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case about the threat to kill or injure, which is  
simply not there,'' attorney Chris Ferrara said Thursday during 
opening statements. ``Opinions? Yes, sometimes harsh. But no 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs, including Planned Parenthood and a women's health  
center, filed a civil suit claiming the site violates a federal law 
that bars activists from inciting violence against abortion doctors 
and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include the American Coalition of Life Advocates, an  
umbrella group for several anti-abortion groups nationwide, and 
Advocates for Life Ministries, a Portland-based group. 
</P>
<P>
	On the site, called ``The Nuremburg Files,'' the names of  
doctors killed are crossed off. The wounded are shaded in gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like bounty hunters of the Old West, the defendants want  
to stop the doctors by any means -- dead in their tracks,'' said 
Maria Vullo, an attorney for a group of doctors who also sued to 
shut down the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the defendants maintain the site and a set of  
posters distributed by the its backers are part of a political 
debate, and therefore protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Vullo said the site appears at a time when anti-abortion  
bombings and shootings have claimed seven lives since 1993, and is 
enough to constitute a real threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants have just gone too far, beyond the realm of  
protected speech,'' she said. ``It's terrorism, ladies and 
gentlemen, against people that do something the defendants disagree 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said some of the doctors on the list wear bulletproof vests  
to and from work, vary the cars they drive, change the route they 
take to the office and have even installed bulletproof glass in 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said their clients may have strong political  
and moral views but have never crossed the line and resorted to 
violence, such as firebombing clinics or taking shots at doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is being attempted here is guilt by association,''  
Ferrara said. ``They are outrageous opinions protected by the First 
Amendment.''

<HEADLINE> Star Ohio State LB Said To Go Pro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Andy Katzenmoyer, the first freshman to  
start at linebacker for Ohio State, will skip his senior season to 
be available for the NFL draft, the school said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's athletics department confirmed Katzenmoyer's  
decision with a release Friday night. The release said Katzenmoyer 
was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Fred Pagac said Katzenmoyer told him that  
he notified the NFL of his decision. Friday was the deadline for 
underclassmen to declare their intentions of being included in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, a 6-foot-4, 255-pounder known for his jarring hits,  
is the second Buckeye this week to jump to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ohio State's record-setting wide receiver, David  
Boston, announced he would give up his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	The decisions by Katzenmoyer and Boston raised to 12 the number  
of underclassmen who have given up at least one year of eligibility 
to throw their names into the NFL draft since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer didn't tell Pagac why he would not return for his  
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't elaborate on his decision. He and his parents talked  
it over,'' Pagac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer has complained of media coverage and has not spoken  
to reporters for months. A telephone number for him could not be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, dubbed ``The Big Kat,'' became one of the most  
recognizable Buckeyes after he was selected as the first defensive 
player to earn Associated Press Mr. Football honors as a senior at 
suburban Westerville South High School. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked for and received jersey No. 45. No Buckeye player had  
worn that number since Archie Griffin wore it to become the only 
two-time Heisman Trophy winner in 1974 and 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer started all 12 games as a freshman for the Buckeyes,  
recording 23 tackles for negative yardage, including 12 sacks. He 
also intercepted four passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his numbers fell off somewhat the next two seasons, he  
was still a first-team All-America selection in 1997 and became the 
first sophomore to receive the Butkus Award, given annually to the 
nation's top linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	As a junior this past fall, he was dropped to second-team  
All-Big Ten by the conference coaches behind teammate Na'il Diggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagac said Katzenmoyer will be tough to replace.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great football player. He's a great young man,'' Pagac  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer also has been a lightning rod for critics.  
</P>
<P>
	He was charged and convicted of underage drinking after a  
policeman saw him with a beer at a bar on his official Ohio State 
recruiting visit. He paid a $193 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, he was arrested on charges of speeding and drunken  
driving and pleaded no contest. He paid a $300 fine, his license 
was suspended for 180 days and he attended three days of alcohol 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Ohio State's first game last September, he was able  
to maintain his eligibility only after passing three summer-session 
courses: AIDS awareness, music and golf.

<HEADLINE>  4 Tied After 1st Round at Mercedes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- No experience was necessary on the  
Kapalua Plantation course in the first round of the Mercedes 
Championship when trade winds disappeared off the northeast coast 
of Maui. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Durant was proof of that on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	A first-time winner on the PGA Tour last year, Durant had not  
played a round of tournament golf since before Thanksgiving and had 
never played in Hawaii. But there he was, rolling in one birdie 
putt after another in a round of 7-under 66 that gave him a share 
of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by Steve Pate, Fred Funk and Billy Mayfair, who  
all have played Kapalua before, but rarely in these conditions -- 
relative calm, relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course was probably the most vulnerable it could play  
without any wind out there,'' Mayfair said. ``The scores are 
obviously an indication of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of the 30 players in the winners-only field failed to  
break par on a resort course with generous fairways and equally 
spacious greens -- Steve Jones, who played the par 5s in 2-over; 
Steve Elkington; and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course played strange without the wind,'' said Pate, who  
lost in a playoff in the Kapalua International in 1989. ``Dead calm 
and the course in good shape? You can go ahead and make some 
birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I wasn't the only one who did.''  
</P>
<P>
	Right behind the leaders was David Duval, a four-time winner on  
the PGA Tour who might not waste any time getting started in the 
new year. Duval birdied four of the last seven holes for a 66 and 
was tied with Billy Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Another stroke back Justin Leonard, despite two bogeys on par  
5s, and Jim Furyk, while the group at 69 included Tiger Woods, 
Davis Love III and Fred Couples. Love and Couples have each won 
twice at Kapalua. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions they are used to might not be far away. With a  
big storm system approaching, tee times today were moved up nearly 
three hours with hope of beating the rain. One night after the PGA 
Tour made its debut on prime-time television, ESPN agreed to show 
the second round on tape delay. 
</P>
<P>
	If the first round was any indication, there will be some wild  
and wacky developments to go along with the stunning view from the 
sloping Plantation course. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate made the first birdie of 1999 in a rather bizarre fashion.  
He argued with his caddie over club selection, insisting on a 
3-iron on the 470-yard, par-4 opening hole, and pulled the club 
from the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit it to the back fringe, I looked down at it,'' Pate  
said. ``It wasn't a 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-iron left him 45 feet away, but he knocked that in for  
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good start to the year,'' Pate mused.  
</P>
<P>
	It got even better. On the 17th, Pate had a 70-foot birdie putt  
that he tried to lag close, but instead saw it disappear into the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be close,'' he said. ``I was kind of  
shocked when it went in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Durant had never played the Plantation course, but it helped to  
have a partner like Lee Janzen. All day long, their putts were on 
the same line and Janzen was usually away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me great reads,'' Durant said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of those was on the 203-yard eighth hole, when Durant left  
his 6-iron 50 feet short of the hole with a huge hump in between 
and the green sloping hard to the left. After watching Janzen miss 
his putt way left, Durant played twice as much break and made it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thanked him for that,'' Durant said. ``I fixed his ball  
marks the rest of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods had a first round that summed up his 1998 season -- lots of  
opportunities, not much to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	He three-putted from about 20 feet on the first hole, then  
responded with a 60-foot birdie putt on the next hole. He drove the 
305-yard, par-4 14th but three-putted from the fringe for par, 
missed one green by about 60 yards to the right for bogey and then 
two-putted for birdie from about 8 feet on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're more nervous over some putts from 4 feet than you are  
over others from 60 feet,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes moved this year from La Costa Resort in Carlsbad,  
Calif., to the Kapalua Resort renowned for winds that turn club 
selection into guesswork and keep scores from getting very low. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you don't have the trades, I think it brings everybody in  
a little bit and becomes more of a putting match,'' Andrade said. 
``It's kind of cool when the winds are whipping. Makes it kind of 
interesting.''

<HEADLINE> S. African Cops Fire at Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African police fired tear  
gas and bird shot at a handful of Muslim protesters today, minutes 
before British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived for a scheduled 
event, witnesses said. One journalist was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair was not hurt and proceeded with the event in downtown Cape  
Town -- the awarding of medals to British soldiers who are assisting 
the South African military. The shootings occurred outside the 
Castle, a monument in downtown Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had ordered the demonstrators to disperse, then opened  
fire with shotguns loaded with birdshot and tear gas on those who 
did not leave, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	One South African journalist working for the South African  
Broadcasting Corp. was wounded in the legs and was taken to a 
hospital. There were unconfirmed reports some protesters were also 
hit, but those reports could not immediately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a Cape Town group called Muslims Against Global  
Oppression began protesting last month's U.S.-British attack on 
Iraq on Thursday. The protesters burned U.S., British and Israeli 
flags and clashed with police. They vowed to dog Blair during his 
stay in Cape Town, where he arrived today on the third day of his 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 men and women, some wearing Islamic scarves, waved  
placards at the airport condemning Blair's visit. ``Death to 
Blair'' read one, while another said: ``Tony go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair, arriving from Johannesburg, managed to bypass that  
peaceful demonstration by taking another route. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Blair and his wife, Cherie, visited a group of  
children living at Nazareth House, a care center run by Roman 
Catholic nuns, where he played with HIV-infected children. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair told reporters that tackling AIDS was vital not only for  
Africa's future, but also the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, Blair was scheduled to give a speech to members of  
parliament before departing for Britain via Kuwait, where he will 
visit British airmen who participated in the attacks on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's visit is aimed at cementing political and economic ties  
between Britain and its former African colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain plans to increase spending on aid and development in  
South Africa by 40 percent over the next three years, for a total 
of $148 million over the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair has also said his government will try to push through a  
European Union-South African free-trade pact, which has stalled 
over Spanish and Portuguese demands that South Africa refrain from 
marketing locally produced fortified wines as port and sherry.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen today in  
Tokyo amid rumors that a U.S. ratings agency may downgrade Japan's 
sovereign debt. Tokyo share prices fell after a two-day advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 144.75 points,  
or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 13,391.81 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. It had a gain 
of 235.72 points, or 1.78 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 111.42 yen, up 0.44 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 111.04 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly moved as high as 112.40 yen in the afternoon  
on rumors that a U.S. rating agency might downgrade Japanese 
government bonds, but it quickly retreated to the low-111-yen 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's both said they  
were not planning to release ratings updates on Japan for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewed concern about the U.S. and Brazilian economies weighed  
on the dollar for much of today's trading in Asia, despite rounds 
of position-adjustment buying of dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 110.52 yen and 112.40 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at $1.1676, up from $1.1642 in  
Tokyo late Thursday but below $1.1713 late Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks finished lower today on concern over  
earnings among Japanese exporters amid continued volatility in 
global foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worried that the dollar's rapid fall below 110.00  
yen on Thursday in overseas market for the first time in 27 months 
would affect on the outlook for profits of Japanese exporters, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't make money at these levels,'' said Robert Sasaki,  
head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among losers were major exporters, including Sony and Toyota  
Motor. Sony's stocks fell for a seventh straight session, finishing 
at $68.20 per share, down $1.17. Toyota Motor closed at $25.67, 
down $1.03. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen cuts into profits made overseas by Japanese  
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was moderate with about 358 million shares changing  
hands on the first section, compared with Thursday's turnover of 
383 million shares. Declines outnumbered advances 843 to 293, with 
154 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 11.20 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,058.40. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.84 points, or 1.02 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.670 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.710 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.05 yen from 100.73 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Senators Reach Agreement for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans and Democrats reached  
agreement in an extraordinary meeting today to begin arguments in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial next week with lawyers 
limited to the official House record. Senators would decide later 
whether to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-page agreement, hammered out in an informal meeting of  
all senators in the Old Senate Chamber, was drafted into a formal 
document and a vote was planned for late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote that will occur shortly should be unanimous,'' Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said that under the emerging plan the trial would begin  
next Wednesday with motions by the two sides, followed the next day 
by opening presentations. At the same time, two senators from each 
party would begin working on the difficult issue of witnesses. GOP 
House prosecutors are pressing for witnesses, while many Democrats 
oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of the driving forces in the  
agreement, said the plan called for giving House prosecutors and 
Clinton's legal team 24 hours each to make their presentations. 
Senators would then have 16 hours to ask questions through Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, senators would be free to make motions -- either to  
adjourn the trial and move to censure or to call witnesses and 
produce evidence not in the House record. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle told reporters he expected  
an ``overwhelming, bipartisan'' vote in favor of the package, once 
it is drafted and submitted to the Senate for a vote, most likely 
within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of a session, Chief Justice William Rehnquist,  
who presides over the trial, arrived at the Capitol a short while 
after noon. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one top White House aide was also in the Capitol as  
discussions over the president's trial neared a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said that ``ultimately, there will be a  
vote on witnesses,'' indicating that it would be up to the full 
Senate to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A partisan disagreement over rules had clouded the opening of  
the trial on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were sworn in as jurors, in an oath administered by  
Rehnquist. But moments later, the trial was recessed so senators 
could attempt to fashion a bipartisan accord that both parties said 
they wanted to serve as a contrast to the highly partisan 
impeachment proceedings in the House last year. The two sides 
agreed to a meeting this morning in the Old Senate Chamber, the 
site of great debates in the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful, called the  
meeting ``an extraordinary event'' and said its most important 
byproduct was ``we did not begin this process with a partisan 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott indicated that the breakthrough came when two senators of  
vastly different political persuasions, Massachusetts liberal 
Democrat Edward M. Kennedy and Texas conservative Republican Phil 
Gramm made back-to-back suggestions. Lott did not offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle, each with his own plans for a trial, invited  
rank-and-file members to the room that was the Senate's chamber 
between 1810 and 1859. Security officers guarded the doors to the 
chamber, and extra chairs had to be brought in -- there weren't a 
hundred senators back in the 19th century when the chamber was in 
use. Outside, the Capitol was blanketed by a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators gathered, members of the House prosecution  
team also met and considered adding Kathleen Willey, the woman who 
alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in the White House, 
to the list of witnesses they would like to call, GOP sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey would not be questioned about the alleged sexual  
advance but about any possible attempts to intimidate her, one 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and House GOP  
colleagues have prepared a list of potential witnesses, including 
Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Clinton 
secretary Betty Currie. Today, Hyde issued a statement renewing his 
plea for witnesses but sidestepping any mention of the emerging 
Senate plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in any court proceeding, witnesses are necessary during a  
trial so that evidence may be thoroughly weighed and tested before 
a conviction,'' Hyde said 
</P>
<P>
	Away from Washington, the president visited Detroit to make a  
speech giving a rosy assessment of the economy. ``I feel good about 
the future,'' Clinton said after attending an auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to hold the senators' meeting in the chamber  
collapsed Thursday, after partisan rancor broke out only moments 
after Clinton was formally made a defendant in the first 
presidential impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 
1868. The primary cause of the rupture was a dispute over the need 
for witnesses, which Republicans favor and Democrats oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Thursday had scheduled votes on their proposed  
ground rules and also on a Democratic alternative. With a 55-45 
advantage, the GOP would have won the fight, but at the price of 
setting a partisan tone that might never be overcome in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment, both  
related to his attempts to conceal his extramarital affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. One article charges the president with perjury before a 
federal grand jury, the second with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers were ``ready to go'' and  
ready to accept Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's evidence in the 
Lewinsky matter in exchange for a ban on witnesses. But, he added, 
if the House insisted on calling witnesses it would cause a delay, 
``because bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record 
opens up a whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And 
that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Officials Quit in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The top two executives of Salt Lake's  
Olympic committee quit Friday, the first victims of a bribery 
scandal involving scholarships, gifts and cash payments ranging up 
to $70,000 to win the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's governor called the wrongdoing ``revolting,'' and one of  
those who resigned, Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Frank 
Joklik, said the actions ``break my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both they and the head of the International Olympic Committee,  
which is investigating who among its members might have accepted 
the improper gifts and payments, said they were certain Utah's 
capital can still be a successful Olympic host. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Gov. Mike Leavitt's spokeswoman, Vickie Varela,  
acknowledged that an SLOC ethics panel also is looking into 
possible use of bid committee credit cards to pay for female 
escorts for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik said he knew nothing of gifts and payments to IOC members  
while he was volunteer chairman of the bid panel but was stepping 
down because ``changes must be made for the games to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old retired copper-company executive will stay on  
the job until a replacement is found. SLOC said it planned an 
international search for its next leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone immediately was David Johnson, 40, senior vice president  
and a bid committee official who was the point man in wooing the 
votes of IOC members. He resigned from the No. 2 job in SLOC at 
Joklik's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal, which surfaced in November, is the subject  
of separate investigations by the Justice Department, the IOC, the 
U.S. Olympic Committee and a SLOC ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	At a highly charged news conference, Joklik described a list of  
misdeeds by bid officials: cash payments to IOC members; payments 
for housing, travel, and education expenses for IOC member 
relatives; expensive gifts and free health care to IOC members and 
their families; and assistance in making a Utah land deal that left 
an influential IOC member from Africa with a $60,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to provide details, and said there may be legitimate  
explanations for some of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that these disturbing actions were taken in an  
effort to win friends for the bid,'' Joklik said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not refer to the payments as bribes, however, and said he  
didn't believe bid votes were promised in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	While Joklik said he believes Salt Lake would have won the bid  
without the gifts, ``A handful of IOC members seem to have 
seriously abused our generous impulses and expected -- and received 
-- more than they should have been given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the committee disclosed it paid $400,000 for 13  
scholarships, six of which went to relatives of IOC members. 
Leavitt said ``these so-called scholarships were not 
scholarships,'' since some recipients didn't attend college. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee also will stop paying a $10,000-a-month  
consulting fee to Tom Welch, who resigned as SLOC president in 1997 
in the wake of spouse-abuse allegations. Welch was the prime mover 
in Salt Lake's 1998 and 2002 Olympic bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other senior SLOC employees who were part of Salt Lake's  
winning bid -- senior vice president of marketing and legal affairs 
Kelly Flint and licensing director Rod Hamson -- were placed on paid 
leave pending the outcome of the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik said the committee has hired the law firm of Latham &AMP;  
Watkins to help Justice Department investigators and to conduct its 
own inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the initial work of those attorneys that persuaded Joklik  
a dramatic housecleaning was needed to ensure the success of the 
Winter Games, which are set to open Feb. 8, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acts during the Olympic bidding process that besmirch our  
reputation break my heart,'' Joklik said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Barcelona, Spain, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
expressed regret about the resignations, but was confident Salt 
Lake will be able to stage a successful games. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Salt Lake committee, meantime, called on  
Samaranch to resign because bribery apparently occurred ``on his 
watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Until President Samaranch follows Frank's example, the Olympic  
movement will not be able to move forward,'' said Ken Bullock, a 
member of the SLOC executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard told Swiss TV Friday the  
scandal will force scrutiny of the IOC voting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had heard rumors of corruption for years, but had not  
been able to get hard proof until now, Carrard said. ``We have to 
clean up our act,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chairman Robert Garff said the board, at later meetings,  
will have to root out any of its own who may have participated in 
bid misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one board member, Bennie Smith, helped an IOC member  
from the Republic of Congo line up a land investment that resulted 
in a $60,000 profit. Smith was in charge of courting IOC members 
from Africa during Salt Lake's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he did  
not expect the 2002 Games to lose sponsors, but the scandal would 
make it hard for organizers to recruit additional sponsors it needs 
to adequately fund the games. That could cause a shortfall 
requiring budget cuts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations came as little comfort to one Olympic sponsor,  
U S West, which fears more damaging revelations. Spokesman Michael 
Frandsen said the phone company is worried about the diminishing 
value of its $50 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the company has delayed sending a $5 million payment to  
the SLOC. Frandsen refused to say if it would drop sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt called Joklik's resignation ``a selfless act of  
statesmanship,'' but nonetheless necessary for Salt Lake to recover 
from the worst ethics scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be made absolutely clear that the actions of a few do  
not reflect the values, moral expectations or standards of behavior 
of this community and state,'' Leavitt said. ``We deplore it and we 
revolt at being associated with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said he spoke with Samaranch Friday morning and received  
assurances Samaranch will ``root out wrongdoing and purge it 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I call upon the Olympic family to form an agenda of reform and  
carry it out with deliberation and speed,'' Leavitt said. ``This 
corner of Olympic corruption did not begin in Salt Lake City. But 
let it end here.''

<HEADLINE> Warrick To Stay at Florida State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's Peter Warrick waited  
until nearly the last minute before deciding pass up an early shot 
at the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	After days on indecision, the 6-foot, 190-pound junior All  
America wide receiver said Friday he would return to Florida State 
for his final season of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of goals left I want to accomplish,'' Warrick  
said. ``We've got a lot of guys coming back and I care about those 
guys. The NFL will still be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, all the news wasn't good for the Seminoles.  
</P>
<P>
	Junior defensive tackle Larry Smith, who missed the Fiesta Bowl  
with a sprained knee, said he would skip his final year of 
eligibility to enter the draft. The 6-5, 288-pound Smith made 47 
tackles this past season, including 10 for losses as part of a 
tackle triumvirate with Jerry Johnson and All American Corey Simon 
that comprised one of the nation's best defensive interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick said he'd continually gone back-and-forth about his  
decision since Monday's 23-16 loss to Tennessee in the national 
championship game at the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., where he 
caught just one pass for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy in my heart,'' Warrick said. ``That's all that  
matters right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was the last day college players could notify the NFL of  
their intentions to enter the April draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick caught 61 passes for 1,232 yards and 11 touchdowns last  
season. His 136 catches for 2,583 yards rank him fourth in each 
category on Florida State's career charts. Warrick's 24 touchdown 
catches put him in a third place tie with Andre Cooper, just one 
behind Barry Smith and five behind career-leader E.G. Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all about me,'' Warrick said. ``There are a lot of  
great guys around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick has also returned 54 punts for 710 yards, averaging  
nearly 13 yards a return. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he just did will give everybody on this team more  
confidence about our future offensively,'' Florida State offensive 
coordinator Mark Richt said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Trim Medicare Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials are warning  
health care providers that the president's proposed budget may 
further trim Medicare payments, despite their complaints that 
reimbursements for elderly Americans' health care are already too 
small. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping for some relief, but ... we were told that they  
were in fact considering some additional reductions,'' Richard J. 
Pollack of the American Hospital Association said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent discussions, administration officials have revealed no  
specifics about how deep the new cuts might be or which types of 
health care services would be affected, Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget office and Health and Human Services  
officials declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration warning, however, is one of the first clues  
about where Clinton may look for possible savings after a recent 
string of announcements of new spending proposals for his fiscal 
2000 budget, due Feb. 1. So far, Clinton has proposed new spending 
on defense, after school child care and tax credits for families 
caring for a disabled relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he plans to pay for some of the initiatives by  
closing tax loopholes, but so far it is unclear where the rest of 
the money would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	The task is complicated by Clinton's call for government  
surpluses to be set aside for Social Security, which like Medicare 
faces financial jeopardy as the nation's huge baby boom generation 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, any new Medicare cuts would directly benefit the  
nation's health insurance program for the elderly and disabled by 
slowing the flow of money out of its fast-dwindling trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Clinton and Congress have been looking for ways  
to save Medicare money in the short term to buy time to work on a 
more longterm solution. 
</P>
<P>
	But because Medicare's reserves are invested in Treasury bonds,  
any money saved also stays available -- in the short term, at least 
-- for general government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent studies indicate that health care providers --  
such as hospitals -- have been overpaid by Medicare in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Improper payments to health plans for administrative expenses  
could be costing Medicare as much as $1 billion a year, the HHS 
inspector general said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another inspector general's report estimated that Medicare may  
be losing 11 cents of every dollar to fraud and payment errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, last month a panel of private experts that advises  
Congress on Medicare payment rates reported that hospital profit 
margins for inpatient care averaged 16 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the panel's chairwoman, Gail Wilensky, notes that those  
numbers don't reflect $115 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years 
that Congress and Clinton agreed in their 1997 balanced budget 
deal. Most of that money will be subtracted from future payment 
increases that hospitals, health plans and doctors had been 
expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be reticent to recommend additional reductions now,''  
Wilensky said. ``I think you ought to look to see what you've done 
before you do yet more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, medical groups, along with some patients, are  
pressuring lawmakers to reverse some of the 1997 cuts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, health plans that enroll Medicare beneficiaries say  
inadequate government payments forced them to drop more than 
400,000 elderly and disabled patients this year. The American 
Association of Health Plans is in the midst of a 50-city tour, 
telling senior citizens' groups to contact members of Congress to 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings are planned to look into the disputes,  
but AAHP spokeswoman Susan Pisano said providers are girding to 
fight for every Medicare dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has been made very clear to us is that there will be a  
lot of discussion this year on Capitol Hill about payments, and 
every group will be expected to make its case,'' Pisano said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Consider Trial Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After swearing to judge President Clinton  
fairly and impartially, senators from both parties gathered today 
for an extraordinary private meeting aimed at working out a 
framework for the impeachment trial. ``We're close,'' Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said as he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats walked together into the Old Senate  
Chamber, the scene of many great debates in the first half of the 
19th century, in a show of bipartisanship as both sides tried to 
keep the proceedings from dissolving into partisan sniping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that we're meeting -- I'm always optimistic,''  
Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott and Daschle, each with his own plans  
for a trial, invited rank-and-file members to the room that was the 
Senate's chamber between 1810 and 1859. Security officers guarded 
the doors to the chamber, and extra chairs had to be brought in -- 
there weren't a hundred senators back in the 19th century when the 
chamber was in use. Outside, the Capitol was blanketed by a 
snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators gathered, members of the House prosecution  
team also met and considered adding Kathleen Willey, the woman who 
alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in the White House, 
to the list of witnesses they would like to call, GOP sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey would not be questioned about the alleged sexual  
advance but about any possible attempts to intimidate her, one 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from Washington, the president visited Detroit to make a  
speech giving a rosy assessment of the economy. ``I feel good about 
the future,'' Clinton said after attending an auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to hold the senators' meeting in the chamber  
collapsed Thursday, after partisan rancor broke out only moments 
after Clinton was formally made a defendant in the first 
presidential impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 
1868. The primary cause of the rupture was a dispute over the need 
for witnesses, which Republicans favor and Democrats oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Thursday had scheduled votes on their proposed  
ground rules and also on a Democratic alternative. With a 55-45 
advantage, the GOP would have won the fight, but at the price of 
setting a partisan tone that might never be overcome in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott pulled back from the brink and kept negotiating, deciding  
senators should ``keep calm and cool and dignified.'' His move 
prompted Daschle to proclaim: ``I think there is some common 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment, both  
related to his attempts to conceal his extramarital affair with 
Monica Lewinsky. One article charges the president with perjury 
before a federal grand jury, the second with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican serving since December  
1968, echoed the thoughts of many Democratic senators, commenting 
he had ``serious questions'' about calling Ms. Lewinsky to testify 
about her sexual escapades with the president at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have failed to allay such concerns, despite  
expressing a willingness to avoid questions to witnesses on 
explicit sexual material. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers were ``ready to go'' and  
ready to accept Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's evidence in the 
Lewinsky matter in exchange for a ban on witnesses. But, he added, 
if the House insisted on calling witnesses it would cause a delay, 
``because bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record 
opens up a whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And 
that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators insisted it was solely their prerogative to  
run the trial, Lott and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., nonetheless met 
for several hours Thursday evening with the House prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good discussion on some of the options,'' said Paul  
McNulty, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee. ``The 
senators listened to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and other Republicans  
have prepared a list of potential witnesses, including Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Clinton secretary 
Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan Republicans crafted Thursday would give first the House  
and then the White House up to 24 hours each -- three eight-hour 
days, for example -- to present evidence, after which senators would 
have 16 hours for questions to lawyers. After that, the Democrats 
would be permitted to seek the adjournment of the trial, and the 
House or White House would be free to seek permission to call 
witnesses. Each side would have to justify any witness they planned 
to call. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote would occur early in February.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats responded with a timetable that called for the trial  
to end on Jan. 26, without the possibility of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Upholds Plea Bargaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a decision prosecutors describe as vital for  
criminal justice in America, a federal appeals court has ruled that 
plea bargains can be offered in exchange for testimony, reversing a 
decision that had declared the practice illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The full 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that  
immunity deals and lesser sentences offered for the testimony of 
witnesses did not violate federal laws against bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for federal prosecutors across this nation,''  
said Linda McMahan, U.S. Attorney for Colorado. ``We are delighted 
with the 10th Circuit's opinion ... prosecutors are not violating 
the law or acting unethically when they engage in such a 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit shocked the  
Justice Department when it declared plea-bargained testimony to be 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe deals offering leniency to witnesses who  
testify in criminal cases are essential in bringing down organized 
crime leaders, drug lords and other high-profile criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers contend the deals are tantamount to buying  
testimony and argue that there are other ways witnesses can help 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's ruling was put on hold until the full Denver-based  
appeals court could review the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In its opinion Friday, the majority wrote that Congress has long  
known of the widespread practice. Had Congress intended to forbid 
such plea bargains, the court reasoned, ``it would have done so in 
clear, unmistakable and unarguable language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges who made the earlier ruling dissented from  
Friday's majority ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the (three-judge) panel issued its opinion in this case,  
prosecutors from coast to coast have attempted to portray it as the 
death knell for the criminal justice system as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But experience has proven that the government, just like the  
private citizens it regulates and prosecutes, can live within the 
rules,'' wrote judge Paul J. Kelly Jr. in his dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on the Kansas conviction of Sonya Singleton on  
charges of cocaine trafficking and money laundering. The three 
judges said the chief prosecution witness illegally received 
leniency in exchange for his testimony, violating the law against 
bribing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In his original ruling, Kelly said prosecutors had to abide by  
the same rules that apply to others. 
</P>
<P>
	``If justice is perverted when a criminal defendant seeks to buy  
testimony from a witness, it is no less perverted when the 
government does so,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the practice was common, noting that  
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were convicted in the Oklahoma 
City bombing based on testimony from a former friend who struck a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges had ordered a new trial for Singleton and said  
Congress should rewrite anti-bribery laws if legislators believe 
prosecutors should be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers scrambled to delay other cases affected by the ruling,  
but most did not expect it to stand. If the full 10th Circuit did 
not overturn it, they said Congress would likely have amended the 
law.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Far From Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was braving the Midwest snow  
emergency to tout his accomplishments directly to the public while 
senators at his impeachment trial worked to determine his future. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lunchtime speech planned for the Detroit Economic Club  
today, the president was heralding a new report by his Council of 
Economic Advisers proclaiming the past 93 months ``the longest 
peacetime expansion in history,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the economic expansion following the 1982 recession  
lasted 92 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic 
Research, which determines changes in the business cycle using a 
combination of measures of gross domestic product, income, 
employment and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech, meant to sketch themes he will  
underscore in his upcoming State of the Union address and new 
budget, was planned before anyone knew it would fall on the day 
after the Senate opened trial proceedings on the impeachment 
charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidental or not, the benefits of escaping Washington's  
turmoil were not lost on White House aides eager to show that 
Clinton was above the fray and focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foot of snow that caused Detroit's snow emergency  
and left many of the city's streets unplowed, Clinton planned to 
linger there even as another 2 inches to 4 inches of snow was 
forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	He was to check out the annual auto show, tape his weekly radio  
address from the autoworkers' union hall and participate in other 
private events there. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Clinton expanded from one to two days his trip  
to New York next Thursday for a conference of Wall Street 
executives trying to increase minority participation in the stock 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's always looking for opportunities to travel  
around the country to see the American people,'' Toiv said 
Thursday. ``And the auto show is a symbol of our economic future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is expected to  
draw 800,000 visitors to see the retro new editions of the 
Volkswagen Beetle, Ford T-Bird and Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a repressed hot-rodder since he has been confined to  
presidential limousines, owns a 1967 Mustang convertible that he 
and his brother, Roger, helped restore. 
</P>
<P>
	In an education speech on Thursday, the president sounded  
nostalgic for those heady, I-can-do-anything days of his youth. He 
saluted Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., who preceded the president 
with a fiery call for help in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at Congressman Ford thinking, you know, I was 28  
once. And when I ran for Congress at that age, I got beat. I see 
why he got elected,'' Clinton said. ``There's a 28-year-old young 
guy with his whole life before him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of today's CEA report have become familiar fodder for  
Clinton speeches in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
	--Average family income rose $3,500 from March 1991 to December  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--New jobs totaled 18.6 million in the same period, with 17.5  
million of them created since January 1993 when Clinton took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the State of the Union coming up, it's a good time for  
the president to reiterate economic themes that have been part of 
every State of the Union address because he's had a consistent 
policy,'' Toiv said.

<HEADLINE> Girl Killed at Georgia High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- Fifteen-year-old Andrea Garrett was  
crying in the hallway again before class Friday, and friends 
assumed it was the usual problem -- young love. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 17-year-old boyfriend, Jeff Miller, had talked darkly in  
recent days, telling other students he probably wouldn't be around 
much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	No one had taken the talk seriously. But soon after school  
started Friday at Central High, Miss Garrett was shot to death and 
Miller seriously wounded in what appeared to be a suicide pact, 
said Sheriff Tony Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	``This apparently was something that was agreed upon by the two  
kids,'' Reeves said. ``They chose to do this for whatever reason at 
the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said the weapon was a .22-caliber pistol taken from a  
locked safe belonging to the girl's parents. No immediate charges 
were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	A custodian discovered the couple in the girls' bathroom during  
first-period classes at the 1,050-student school. School officials 
kept students calm by sending guidance counselors room to room to 
say that there was a shooting but that it was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of school, word of the shooting triggered panic among  
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said all the color went out of me. I got weak in the  
knees,'' said Joani Osteen. ``You see it on TV all the time, but 
not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was among parents who raced to the school as word spread  
quickly around this western Georgia town of 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know who might get caught up in the crossfire,''  
said Angela Orr, who picked up her teen-age son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends described Miss Garrett, who played clarinet in the  
marching band, as smart and friendly, while her boyfriend was more 
of a loner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was funny, but he didn't really have any friends,'' said  
Tiffany Osteen, 17. ``He was strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had told other students ``he probably wouldn't be here  
much longer,'' Miss Osteen recalled, adding: ``He likes to get 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was in an algebra class last semester with Miss Garrett, who  
had come to class crying several times. So when Miss Garrett was 
crying on Friday, friends assumed it had something to do with the 
troubled romance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young love, you know,'' said Aleksis Smith, 16.  
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they had heard that her parents didn't  
approve of her relationship and had pressured her to stop seeing 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Group counseling, weekend counseling and a 24-hour hot line were  
offered to students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was scared and shocked,'' said Michelle Crews, 14.  
``A lot of people were crying.''

<HEADLINE> Chris Nelloms Found Guilty of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Former Ohio State track star Chris Nelloms  
was found guilty today by a jury of raping a 12-year-old girl and 
faces a mandatory life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of seven counts of rape of a child younger than  
13 and one count of felonious sexual penetration. The jury found 
him innocent of attempted rape of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms dropped his head as the verdict was read, and his  
fiancee, Tina Smith, began sobbing from the second row of the 
courtroom. She was escorted out by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say a life sentence is mandatory, but Nelloms would  
be eligible for parole. A sentencing date was not set. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montgomery County Common Pleas Court jury reached a verdict  
after about five hours of deliberations over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jon Paul Rion said he planned to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Angela Frydman, an assistant county prosecutor, said the jury's  
decision was a ``true and just verdict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can ever be happy in a situation like this,'' she said.  
``It's very sad and tragic for all of the parties involved. But I 
believe from the bottom of my heart that it was the only true 
verdict that could be returned based on the facts and the 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 26, of suburban Trotwood, set school records at Ohio  
State but failed to qualify for the 1996 Olympics in the 200-meter 
dash. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified Thursday that the girl lied about the allegations,  
perhaps because she is troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Kevin Lennen had said the prosecution's case  
was ``unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen said there supposedly were people in the area when the  
alleged rapes occurred, but no one saw or heard anything. He also 
said the doctor who testified for the prosecution could say only 
that he believed the girl had sexual intercourse at least once, 
even though Nelloms is accused of raping the child several times 
from 1995, when she was 9, until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She accused Nelloms of raping her at homes in Dayton and  
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen also said that police concluded the child had been abused  
before completing their investigation and that the girl showed no 
emotion during her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a 12-year-old child who told a lie. Why? I don't  
know,'' Lennen said. ``It's an unbelievable story that could only 
be told by a 12-year-old child.''

<HEADLINE> Alcoa's 4Q Profits Jump 23 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. reported Friday that  
its earnings soared 23 percent in the fourth quarter thanks to cost 
reductions and increased sales. The company's stock jumped 10 
percent on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa earned $218.3 million, or $1.19 per share, compared to  
$177.6 million, or $1.23 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings topped analysts' expectations of $1.06 per share,  
as reported by First Call Corp. The company's stock lept 10 
percent, or $7.75, to $85 in afternoon trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three months ending Dec. 31 were $4.2 billion,  
compared to $3.3 billion during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Alcoa announced a 50 percent increase in the  
company's quarterly stock dividend to 37.5 cents per share on a 
pre-split basis, a 10 million share repurchase program and a 
two-for-one stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	After the split, Alcoa will have about 367 million common shares  
outstanding. The new stock will be distributed on Feb. 25 to 
shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes reflect our conviction that we have achieved a  
new base level of operating performance and that further major 
improvements will be realized this year,'' said Alcoa chairman and 
chief executive officer Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, the world's largest producer of aluminum, shipped nearly  
1.2 million metric tons of aluminum products in the last quarter of 
1998, compared with 734,000 metric tons in the same quarter of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income in the 1998 fourth quarter included after-tax losses  
of $900,000 for marking to market some aluminum commodity 
contracts. In 1997, the same losses amounted to $11.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarter included an after-tax gain of $32.7 million from the  
sale of Alcoa's Brazilian cable business and a land sale in Japan. 
The net income increase excludes that special item. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Alcoa had a profit of $853 million, or $4.87  
per share, up 12 percent from 1997, when profits totaled $761.2 
million, or $4.66 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The attributed its improved performance for the year in part to  
the acquisition of two companies: Inespal, Spain's state-held 
aluminum business, and Alumax of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors helped the company overcome a 20 percent decline  
in aluminum prices since the beginning of the year, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for all of 1998 were $15.3 billion versus $13.3 billion  
for 1997.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 105.56 at 9,643.32 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A two-week buying party continued on Wall Street  
Friday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to its second 
record of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 105.56 to 9,643.32, beating Wednesday's closing  
record of 9,544.97 and marking its first close above 9,600. So far 
this year, the Dow has gained 461.89 points, or 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume came to 1.13 billion, up from 850.84 million on Thursday,  
raising confidence that investors were serious about buying. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the rally didn't go far below the blue chips. Advancing  
issues barely edged out decliners by 1,525 to 1,523 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, fueling concerns that not enough issues are 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's up 100 points, but there are probably as many red  
numbers on my screen as there are green,'' said James Meyers, 
market strategist at Janney, Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
``The market continues to be focused exactly where it's been 
focused, which is technology, drugs, and telephony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are concentrating in these areas because they expect  
them to grow faster than the rest of the economy, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	But they are paying high prices to participate, he said. ``I  
think investors are focusing on growth prospects, and probably not 
as much as they should on valuation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes lost a little steam in the afternoon and  
threatened to close lower, but then rallied to finish at record 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 5.36 to 1,275.09, its third  
record this week. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 
18.32 to 2,344.41, its ninth record since Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.87 to 611.06, edging out its  
previous closing record of 611.01 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa led the Dow higher, up 7 7/8 to 85 1/8, after reporting  
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. Alcoa was the first 
Dow company to release earnings for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component AT&AMP;T rose 2 13/16 to 85 1/16. The company said  
1999 earnings should top Wall Street's expectations, and that it 
plans a 3-for-2 stock split and a $4 billion stock buyback once its 
deal to acquire cable television company Tele-Communications is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks were still flying high. In Nasdaq  
trading, Amazon.com rose 1 3/8 to 160 1/4, Lycos advanced 20 1/2 to 91 3/4, and 
Yahoo! added 23 5/8 to 343 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were encouraged by a government report that the  
unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in December and averaged 4.5 
percent for 1998, the lowest since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the 
Vietnam War. Employers added 378,000 jobs to their payrolls -- the 
most in 15 months and nearly double what analysts anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other indexes, the American Stock Exchange composite rose  
3.78 to 707.76, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies 
rose 3.40 to 431.23. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo fell 1.07  
percent. But the DAX index in Frankfurt rose 1.31 percent, the 
FT-SE 100 in London rose 0.75 percent, the CAC in Paris added 0.35 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Investment Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man claiming to be allied with such blue-chip  
companies as Marriott and Fidelity investments was accused of 
duping more than 100 investors out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur F. Good even had a co-conspirator pose as Marriott heir  
Bill Marriott to lull the suspicions of one investor, prosecutors 
said in announcing the charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 43-count criminal information -- similar to an indictment --  
charges Good with fraud and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Good, head of the Boston Investment Group, allegedly cheated at  
least 100 investors out of at least $7 million by telling them he 
would invest their money safely with very high return rates by 
investing alongside Fidelity and the Marriott Foundation. In fact, 
the companies were not working with Good, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims, including dentists, lawyers and retirees, lost from  
$10,000 to almost $1 million, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	He used some to pay off previous investors and divided the rest  
between his partners and himself, U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern 
said in announcing the charges on Thursday. Scams in which early 
investors are paid off by money from later investors are called 
Ponzi schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, one of the investors told Good he  
wanted to meet Marriott, head of the Marriott Foundation, to make 
sure the investments were legitimate. Good arranged for the 
investor to travel to New York City, where he dined with a man he 
believed to be Marriott. The man, in fact, was one of Good's 
alleged coconspirators, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the investigation was continuing.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither Good nor his attorney returned telephone messages for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Loren Slows Down After Heart Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sophia Loren says her health is much better now,  
but she was worried about dying several months ago when she was 
hospitalized for heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to die,'' the Academy-award winning  
actress says in an interview with ``Dateline NBC.'' But she's doing 
better now and at 64, she's just published her first cookbook, 
scoffs at retirement and says she still loves to love. 
</P>
<P>
	After feeling ill on an Aug. 10 flight from Geneva to New York,  
the Italian-born actress was hospitalized with an irregular 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I have to be careful, because I want to enjoy my family  
for a long time. I want to enjoy my life for a long time,'' she 
said in the interview to be broadcast Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she says her health problems were due to stress from  
overworking, Loren says retirement is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retire? No, never ... I'll go on and on,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She's just published ``Recipes and Memories,'' a collection of  
Italian recipes accompanied by her personal recollections. 
</P>
<P>
	And what is it about her that captivates so many men?  
</P>
<P>
	``I always liked to seduce and to be seduced.''

<HEADLINE>  Berra Museum To Show Yanks Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- The end of Yogi Berra's 14-year  
feud with George Steinbrenner is producing a dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum that bears Berra's name will get to exhibit the New  
York Yankees' 1998 World Series trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, three days after the Yankees owner and their Hall of  
Fame catcher announced a reconciliation, Berra told a news 
conference the trophy would be put on display at Yogi Berra Museum 
on the campus of Montclair State. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're loaning the trophy to us,'' said Berra. ``It was  
George's idea and I think it's a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy has been at the New York City Hall since Steinbrenner  
donated it to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``But (New York mayor) Rudy Giuliani has been a longtime admirer  
of Yogi,'' said museum executive director Dave Kaplan. ``All the 
details haven't been worked out yet but the trophy is going to be 
loaned to the museum so it can be put on display here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra again said he was glad the feud, which started when  
Steinbrenner sent an underling to fire him just two weeks into the 
1985 season, is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy. It makes me feel good,'' said Berra. ``and I  
think George feels good too. A lot of mistakes had been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bad feeling began when the Yankees owner sent Clyde King to  
fire Berra after a 6-10 start. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a mistake and he knew it. The problem was he didn't do  
it himself,'' said Berra. ``Managers are hired to be fired. I was 
fired two other times but you don't send someone else to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's all in the past now, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was fantastic,'' Berra said of Steinbrenner's museum visit  
and apology on Tuesday. ``He was very good. The way he apologized 
to me and my wife was great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Yankees. I've always rooted for them. They have a  
great team and a great manager. I'm a real New York sports fan. I'd 
love to see a Yankees-Mets World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, now that peace has been declared, Berra said he will again  
visit Yankee Stadium for a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made any plans yet but it's January; it's still  
early,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Chat Program Doubles Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An Internet chat program owned by America Online  
has almost doubled its membership in six months, helping AOL beef 
up its presence in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirabilis, an AOL-owned company that produced ICQ --  
Internet-speak for ``I Seek You'' -- announced Friday that it had 25 
million registered users, 11 million active, daily users and up to 
800,000 simultaneous users chatting away at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICQ software allows users to chat privately with other  
members over the Internet in real time, much as AOL's members can 
do using the service's Instant Message function. 
</P>
<P>
	It has proven wildly popular with young, computer-savvy people  
who aren't members of America Online. Also, ICQ is free and can be 
downloaded by anyone, while AOL charges its online service members 
$22.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, at its heart, is a communication portal for people who  
don't have AOL,'' said Ted Leonsis, president of AOL Studios. ``The 
Web is a lonely place and this gives you a lot of intimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, America Online bought Mirabilis and access to the  
12.8 million registered users it then had. Today, AOL has more than 
15 million members, making it the largest online provider in the 
world. Leonsis said only about 6 percent of the members use both 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	With its varied holdings of ICQ, Digital Cities, CompuServe, its  
online service and its own separate instant messaging software, 
America Online Inc. has access to about 41 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S. Justice Department approves AOL's purchase of  
Netscape Communications Corp. and its popular Web portal Netcenter, 
which has 10 million registered users, AOL will own services used 
by more than 50 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about a third of the world's wired population -- 150  
million -- according to NUA Limited, an Internet research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a big footprint in the online world,'' said Leonsis.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Interview Shaw for Coach Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Oakland Raiders defensive coordinator Willie  
Shaw interviewed for the Philadelphia Eagles' vacant coaching job 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, the fourth candidate to be interviewed since Ray Rhodes'  
departure Dec. 28, thinks he knows what it takes to be a good NFL 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need good coordinators and you need to delegate and let  
them do their job,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also have interviewed Pittsburgh Steelers defensive  
coordinator Jim Haslett, former Carolina Panthers coach Dom Capers 
and Green Bay quarterbacks coach Andy Reid. The team hoped Mike 
Holmgren would be in for a visit Sunday, but he agreed Friday to 
become coach of the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	In his year at Oakland, Shaw improved the Raiders' defensive  
ranking from 30th in 1997 to first through early December, when 
injuries decimated their ranks and dropped them to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a matter of getting away from the losing attitude,''  
Shaw said. ``We did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, who also has coached at New Orleans, St. Louis, Minnesota,  
San Diego and Detroit, said he would not be disappointed if he 
didn't snag a head-coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't happen for every coach,'' he said. ``It may not  
happen with me. But I'm preparing myself all the time. I think when 
you stop moving forward in your profession, you move backwards, and 
I don't want to move backwards.''

<HEADLINE> Three Tenors Coming to Motown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Three Tenors are coming to Motown.  
</P>
<P>
	Opera superstars Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose  
Carreras will perform July 17 in Detroit at a concert sponsored by 
Ford Motor Co., the Detroit Free Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details -- including the site and ticket prices -- were not  
available, said Kathi Kammerdiener, assistant to the vice president 
of operations for the trio's production company, the Rudas 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Three Tenors first performed together in 1990. Other  
appearances scheduled this year are Saturday in Tokyo and April 18 
in Pretoria, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	All three singers have performed separately in Detroit.  
Pavarotti, 63, participated in the grand opening celebration of the 
opera house in April 1996. Carreras, 52, performed there 11 months 
later. Domingo, 57, performed in June 1994 at the Masonic Temple.

<HEADLINE> Without Holmgren, Pack Faces Void </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The next coach of the Green Bay Packers will be someone who's  
won championships, just as did outgoing coach Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Packers general manager Ron Wolf offered no names of  
front-runners for the job that opened Friday when Holmgren accepted 
a $32 million deal to become Seattle's coach and GM. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are enormous shoes to fill, make no mistake about  
that,'' Wolf said of Holmgren, the Packers' coach for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said he had no timetable for hiring a coach and hinted that  
the results of playoffs games this weekend were a factor in the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going to be like one of these little high school  
prom things, where you are picking the best looking or the most 
compatible,'' Wolf said. ``This is a situation where you have to 
get somebody that is of championship caliber and championship 
quality and that is what we are going to try and do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly don't have a list of names. I have some names running  
around in my head. ... Some of the best coaches happen to be in 
college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Holmgren's assistantss, except quarterback coach Andy Reid,  
are expected to be replaced, Wolf said. Some could be on a list of 
prospects to replace Holmgren, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered no names, but the ones most often mentioned are Reid  
and offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top candidates being mentioned in published reports  
for Holmgren's job are Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick 
Jauron, former Philadelphia coach Ray Rhodes, Atlanta offensive 
line coach Art Shell, New York Jets defensive coordinator Bill 
Belichick, Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and Minnesota 
offensive coordinator Brian Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf was asked whether San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, once  
a quarterback coach for the Packers and a native of the Upper 
Peninsula of Michigan, was interested in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the coach at San Francisco. He is under contract to  
them,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said he was confident the Packers could continue their  
winning ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope people look back on the time there and say, `Yeah, they  
got it going again,''' Holmgren said. ``And now, they'll keep it 
going, I'm sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very good football team,'' Wolf said. ``It is a  
veteran football team. It is a team that needs jarring. It needs a 
little electrical shock. The nucleus is here. Any time you start 
with Brett Favre, you've got an edge up on just about everybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre, the Packers' 29-year-old quarterback, won the NFL most  
valuable player award three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf, who came to the Packers in late 1991, hired Holmgren, then  
a coach in San Francisco, and the pair were credited with reviving 
the small-market franchise and bringing back the glory days last 
seen during the 1960s era of Vince Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf praised Holmgren and his coaches for the job they did in  
leading Green Bay to the last two Super Bowls, including one Super 
Bowl championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy they left behind is going to be tough to follow,''  
Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's decision to leave Green Bay ends an era for the  
Packers, Favre's agent said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett came in with Mike. I am sure Brett hates to see him go  
and at the same time is proud and happy for Mike,'' agent Bus Cook 
said. ``Brett will continue to work hard, whoever is the coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was flying from Green Bay to Mississippi when Holmgren  
announced he was leaving Green Bay for Seattle, Cook said.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy Estimates Have Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A long look deep into space by the Hubble  
Space Telescope has led astronomers to increase their estimate of 
the total number of galaxies in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an experiment called the Hubble Deep Field South, the space  
telescope was focused on a small portion of the sky above the 
Southern Hemisphere for 10 days, taking images of galaxies out to 
about 11 billion light-years. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the number of objects detected by the telescope,  
astronomers estimated that the universe contains about 125 billion 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier study, called the Hubble Deep Field North, the  
total number of galaxies was estimated at 80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry C. Ferguson of the Space Telescope Institute in Baltimore  
said the new estimate is higher because the space telescope has new 
instruments that allowed it to look farther than was possible in 
the first deep field study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it could look deeper, he said, the telescope detected a  
greater density of galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said the new study focused on an ordinary part of the  
sky over the Southern Hemisphere. The target was incredibly small, 
about the apparent size of a grain of sand held at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
	But the telescope looked through some 11 billion light-years of  
space, exploiting the absolute limit of the telescope's keen 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of the study was to capture a narrow beam sample of  
what the universe is like. It is rather like a core sample of the 
heavens. The images now will be studied by hundreds of astronomers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The first deep field study by the Hubble resulted in dozens of  
new discoveries and increased a general understanding about the 
nature of the most distant part of the universe.

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's inflation rate slowed to 3.9  
percent last month -- its lowest point in 26 1/2 years -- bringing the 
country one step closer to its dream of membership in the European 
single currency club. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer price index slowed to 3.9 percent on the year in  
December, compared with 4.2 percent in November, the National 
Statistics Service said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the lowest year-on-year rate since July 1972, when it was  
running at 3.8 percent. It was also below a previous year-end 
estimate of 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece was the only country in the 15-member European Union that  
did not qualify for the ``euro-zone'' at the beginning of the year. 
Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted out for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Costas Simitis has made joining the euro currency by  
2001 the cornerstone of his Socialist government's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou warned there is still a  
long way to go before meeting a target to slash inflation to 2 
percent at the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very close to our target and it would be a pity to  
stumble in the final straight of this marathon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	EU single currency criteria set an inflation ceiling based on  
the top performing countries, expected to be about 2.5 percent next 
year. The 1999 Greek budget seeks to reduce the general deficit to 
1.9 percent of gross domestic product from an expected 2.2 percent 
at the end of this year -- well below the qualification mark of 3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece must meet all criteria by the end of 1999 to qualify by  
Jan. 1, 2001.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons, Jets: Rare in Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons and New York Jets, unaccustomed to  
postseason pressure, will be among four NFL division champions at 
home for playoff games this weekend against wild-card round 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Atlanta will face the San Francisco 49ers, the team  
the Falcons beat for the NFC West championship. In Saturday's other 
game, defending Super Bowl champion Denver plays Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, who became the last team to win a division  
championship when they captured the AFC East, play AFC Central 
champion Jacksonville Sunday. Then Arizona, another infrequent 
playoff team, is at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
                        	 *Saturday's Games    	
</P>
<P>
                        	 *49ers at Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third meeting of the year between these NFC  
West teams. They split the first two, each winning at home and both 
are 10-1 against common opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco has the league's top offense, although running  
back Garrison Hearst reinjured a hamstring while rushing for 128 
yards during last week's dramatic victory over Green Bay and is 
listed as questionable. Atlanta, on the other hand, has a healthy 
Jamal Anderson, who led the NFC with 1,846 yards rushing, ready to 
roll against a beat-up 49ers defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have only two playoff victories in their history but  
have won 20 of their last 24 games over two seasons, the best 
record in the NFL during that span. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers come in riding the momentum of a dramatic victory last  
week against Green Bay when Steve Young's 25-yard pass to Terrell 
Owens with three seconds to play eliminated the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
                       	 *Dolphins at Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Denver 31-21 three weeks ago as Dan Marino threw four  
touchdown passes. So how come the Broncos are 11 1/2-point favorites? 
Well, the fact that Denver has won 17 straight home games might 
have something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is within reach of some formidable playoff records. He  
needs 24 yards to reach 4,000 for his playoff career and one TD 
pass for 31 to move past Terry Bradshaw for second place on the 
career postseason list. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got the right defense to pick on. Denver allowed 228.8  
yards passing per game and 28 touchdown passes during the regular 
season -- 26th in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Terrell Davis, who led the league in rushing with 2,008  
yards and 23 TDs, managed only 29 yards against the Dolphins last 
month. John Elway finished second in the AFC with a 93.0 
quarterback rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos lost two of their final three games after winning  
the first 13. 
</P>
<P>
                         	 *Sunday's Games    	
</P>
<P>
                         	 *Jaguars at Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	This is the first home playoff game for the Jets since 1986.  
That was also the last time the team won a postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde, signed as a backup quarterback, became New  
York's starter early and posted a 12-1 record. He led the AFC with 
a 101.6 rating and team-record 29 TD passes. The Jets had a pair of 
1,000-yard receivers in Keyshawn Johnson (1,131) and Wayne Chrebet 
(1,083) and a 1,000-yard rusher in Curtis Martin (1,287). 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Fred Taylor rushed for 162 yards in Jacksonville's  
first-round victory over New England. Mark Brunell returned at 
quarterback and was 14-for-34 for 161 yards and 1 TD after missing 
three weeks with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a matchup of old coaching buddies. Jacksonville's Tom  
Coughlin was an assistant on Bill Parcells' staff with the New York 
Giants from 1988-90, when the team won its second Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
                      	 *Cardinals at Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, coming off the franchise's first playoff victory in  
more than half a century, faces a huge challenge at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings have won eight straight, are undefeated at home, had  
the league's best record (15-1) and scored an NFL-record 556 
points. Quarterback Randall Cunningham led the NFL with a 106.0 
rating and was second in the league with a career-high 34 TD 
passes. Robert Smith ran for 1,187 yards and Randy Moss led the NFC 
with a rookie-record 17 TDs and was second in the conference with 
1,313 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there's the defense.  
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle John Randle posted 10 1/2 sacks, his seventh  
straight 10-sack season, and cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock was second 
in the NFC with a career-high seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals eliminated Dallas last week after squeezing into  
the playoffs as a wild-card on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Frank Sanders led the NFC with 90 receptions and had  
three catches for 72 yards in the victory over Dallas. Quarterback 
Jake Plummer, who has become the sparkplug of the Cardinals, was 
19-for-36 for 213 yards and two TDs.

<HEADLINE> New Georgia Oil Pipeline Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Oil company executives smeared black oil  
on their faces Friday to celebrate the opening of a new pipeline 
bringing crude from Azerbaijan's rich Caspian Sea fields across 
Georgia and on to world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The new pipeline is relatively small but is another key marker  
in the development of the Caspian fields, which hold reserves 
thought second only to the Persian Gulf but have lacked an adequate 
pipeline system for exporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The line begins in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, on the Caspian  
Sea and heads west across the country to neighboring Georgia, 
culminating at Georgia's Black Sea port of Supsa. 
</P>
<P>
	The first oil in the pipeline crossed Azerbaijan's border into  
eastern Georgia on Friday, and will reach the Black Sea coast by 
late March or early April. From there, tankers will haul it to 
world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a historic day,'' Giye Chanturiya, president of the  
Georgian International Oil Company, said in a ceremony near the 
Azerbaijan-Georgia border. ``The people who did not believe in this 
project can see it with their own eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chanturiya dabbed his fingers in a glass of oil and smeared it  
on his face and the faces of others at the ceremony, including 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The new pipeline is expected to handle the relatively modest  
amount of 2.5 million tons of oil in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second pipeline running from the Caspian fields to the  
Black Sea coast. The other terminates farther north at the Russian 
port of Novorossiisk. 
</P>
<P>
	A much larger pipeline is planned, but the United States, Russia  
and Iran are vying over its route in what has become a major battle 
for influence over the Caspian reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and its NATO ally Turkey want the line to run through  
Georgia to Turkey's Mediterranean coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is adamantly against having the line take the  
shorter, far cheaper route through its perennial rival, Iran, or 
north through Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	American diplomats want multiple pipelines out of the Caspian so  
no one nation will have a stranglehold over the flow of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	As all the countries involved jockey for position over the  
lucrative pipeline routes, the construction of the lines has been 
delayed. Oil companies, faced with low oil prices on a glutted 
market, have also shied away from the major investment of building 
pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Azerbaijan and Kazakstan have the largest Caspian oil reserves,  
while Turkmenistan can claim a smaller amount. The two other 
Caspian nations, Russia and Iran, have little or no Caspian oil off 
their coastlines but hope to profit from the pipelines that cross 
their territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia has no significant oil reserves of its own, but will  
receive money for allowing the crude to travel across its land.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials To Quit in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The two top officials of the Salt Lake  
City Olympic committee will leave their posts and other 
lower-ranking employees will be placed on administrative leave amid 
a bribery scandal, The Associated Press learned today. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the president of the city's Olympic organizing  
committee will voluntarily step aside at least temporarily, and 
vice president Dave Johnson will resign, according to sources close 
to the Salt Lake and U.S. Olympic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves were expected to be announced today following a joint  
session of the two committees, although it was not certain when 
they would take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of ``lower-ranked employees'' of the SLOC will be  
placed on administrative leave, acccording to the sources, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and Johnson were involved in Salt Lake's successful bid  
to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. That effort has become the target 
of four investigations into hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
went into scholarships and gifts for International Olympic 
Committee members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, Joklik, who was chairman of the bid committee,  
said, ``There's not a heck of a lot to say. The final decisions 
have not been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings follow Gov. Mike Leavitt's call earlier this week  
for SLOC staffers embroiled in the gifts investigations to take 
leaves of absence. Leavitt did not identify specific staffers in 
his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune and KTVX-TV reported earlier today that  
Joklik and Johnson were expected to leave their organizing 
committee jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Associated Press has learned that three months after the  
IOC awarded Salt Lake the Winter Games, an IOC member bought three 
luxury-home sites about 20 miles from the Olympic downhill course. 
The member earned $60,000 on the land deal that was arranged 
through a member of the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times quoted unidentified investigators as saying  
Salt Lake Olympic officials made individual cash payments ranging 
from $5,000 to $70,000 to IOC members from Africa and Latin 
America. It said investigators still were trying to determine the 
number of payments, the amounts and the recipients, and that some 
of the payments may have been legitimate reimbursement for 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former USOC member Howard Peterson told USA Today that Salt  
Lake's gift-giving began in the 1980s in the competition with 
Anchorage, Alaska; Reno-Tahoe, Nev.; and Denver to become the U.S. 
bidder for the 1998 Winter Games. Peterson, a member of the 1989 
USOC site selection committee, said at least three USOC board 
members received expense-paid trips to the area, visits he called 
``ski vacations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Tribune reported that at least three relatives of IOC  
members were hired by Salt Lake companies during the bid, with the 
bid committee largely paying the salary of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Olympics sponsor US West announced it has decided to withhold a  
$5 million payment to SLOC until it answers questions about the 
scandal. The phone company demanded an explanation last month and 
sought assurances there will be no more surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Pound, the International Olympic Committee vice president  
who is heading that organization's inquiry into the scandal, said 
it has the bulk of the evidence it needs, and he is confident the 
panel could complete its investigation by the Jan. 23-24 target 
date. ``I'm quite pleased with what (SLOC officials have) given us 
and with the level of cooperation,'' he said from Montreal. Pound's 
committee will focus on wrongdoing by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound spent two days in Salt Lake City late last month  
interviewing officials and reviewing documents connected with the 
Utah capital's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the land deal, The Associated Press learned that  
Jean-Claude Ganga's purchase and sale of three residential lots 
were being investigated by the SLOC's ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, from the Republic of Congo, bought the three luxury home  
parcels in Pleasant View in September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was introduced to the seller, a home builder, by Bennie  
Smith, a bid committee and SLOC member who spent eight years wooing 
African IOC members whose votes were considered crucial for Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics panel is trying to determine the source of the  
cash for Ganga's investment, but lacks subpoena power necessary to 
obtain bank records, a source close to the investigation said 
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Ganga in Paris, Brazzaville and Cameroon were  
unsuccessful. Smith did not return telephone messages left at his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has been identified as one of three African IOC members  
who received free medical care from Salt Lake-based Intermountain 
Health Care. He reportedly was treated for hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Brent Keller, a Weber County home builder, said that Smith  
was helping Ganga look for promising land investments when the two 
first visited Pleasant View in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga bought three half-acre, undeveloped lots on the hillside  
overlooking Ogden and the Great Salt Lake for $25,000 each. Keller 
then built a road to the lots, put in utilities and a storm basin, 
and Ganga sold the lots for $45,000 each, one in 1997 and the other 
two in August, for a profit of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically played bank for me,'' Keller said. Without  
Ganga's purchase at essentially a wholesale price, Keller didn't 
have the cash to improve the lots for eventual sale to home buyers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said Ganga wrote a check when he bought the land in 1995,  
and as far as Keller knows, he used his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said that after Ganga bought the land, Smith was no  
longer involved.

<HEADLINE> Reinsdorf: No Clue About Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf is on the  
long list of players, officials, agents and fans who don't know 
what Michael Jordan will do now that the NBA lockout has been 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I talked to Michael, he was frazzled and worn  
out after the playoffs and at that time, he didn't think he was 
going to play,'' Reinsdorf said Thursday after owners unanimously 
ratified a new collective bargaining agreement in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now he's had a whole summer of golf and enjoying himself.  
Maybe he's energized again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls need to know quickly what Jordan will do. His decision  
will affect their plans and determine if they will reload or 
rebuild during what promises to be a short and hectic few weeks 
before a 50-game season begins Feb. 5. Training camps open Jan. 18 
and players will be allowed to start working out at NBA facilities 
next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start with Michael. If Michael decides to retire,  
that changes a lot of things,'' Reinsdorf said, adding he hadn't 
spoken with Jordan since just before the lockout began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract doesn't hurt at all or help bring Michael back.  
He's grandfathered. He can make 5-percent more than last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be about $34.7 million, a figure that would be  
prorated for what will probably be a 50-game schedule starting 
around Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf said his first phone call once the lockout was settled  
went to Phil Jackson, offering him another chance to return as 
coach. But Jackson, who left the Bulls after they won the 
championship last June, declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kind of chuckled. He said he had the next few months  
planned out,'' Reinsdorf said. ``He appreciated the call, but said 
he hadn't changed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd, still not sure if he will get to  
coach Jordan, said he wasn't aware of Jackson's response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about that, although that doesn't surprise me  
because that's what Phil said on several occasions,'' Floyd said as 
he headed out of the Berto Center with assistants Tex Winter and 
Frank Hamblen 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who must construct a team that  
currently has only four players under contract -- Toni Kukoc, Ron 
Harper, Keith Booth and Randy Brown -- declined comment from his 
suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Jordan's situation is settled, the rest of the Bulls' free  
agents remain in limbo. Mark Bartelstein, a Chicago-based agent who 
represents Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler, said he's talked briefly 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a little bit paralyzed,'' said Bartelstein, who also  
represents Brown. ``They haven't even been able to talk to Michael. 
``I'm sure when they do, they'll get a better understanding of 
where they're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when the season does begin in early February, the Bulls may  
have to wait for their home opener and ring ceremony. They'll 
likely start the season on the road because a mouse will be in 
their house. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Disney On Ice'' ice show runs Jan. 26-Feb. 7 at the United  
Center, and it takes a day to set up and take down the arena for 
the production. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the earliest the Bulls could play at home is Feb. 9 --  
which, under the prelockout schedule, was to be Chicago's first 
home game after a three-week West Coast road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitting in an exhibition game at the United Center could be  
tricky, too. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA commissioner David Stern said Thursday that each team will  
play two exhibition games, one at home and one away. But the ice 
show will begin setting up on Jan. 25, just one week after training 
camps are supposed to open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, also, was in the dark about Jordan, whose presence will  
be a buffer against fans bitter over the lockout and whose return 
will undoubtedly influence TV ratings and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not polite or appropriate for commissioners to beg, but  
Michael, please come back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Voted To Impeach for Jury Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is lying to a grand jury an impeachable  
offense? Vice President Al Gore thought so in 1989. So did Defense 
Secretary William Cohen, as well as Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, now 
the Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	They were all senators when Walter Nixon, then a federal judge,  
was removed from the bench after being convicted and imprisoned for 
giving false testimony to a grand jury investigating his dealings 
with a business associate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, Cohen and 48 senators still in office -- including Lott,  
R-Miss., and Daschle, D-S.D. -- voted for at least one of the three 
impeachment articles lodged against Nixon. Two of the articles were 
approved, on votes of 89-8 and 78-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every case is different,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd, a Connecticut  
Democrat who voted to convict Nixon but opposes removing President 
Clinton from office. ``You've got a different case, a different set 
of facts, a different standard,'' agreed Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., 
another of the 27 Democrats now in the Senate who voted to convict 
Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two impeachment articles the House passed Dec. 19  
alleges Clinton lied to the federal grand jury investigating his 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The second article accuses him 
of obstructing justice in the Paula Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's case ``is quite analogous'' to Clinton's, said  
Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who 
is writing a law journal article on the history of the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Other legal experts disagree, saying presidents and judges are  
held to different standards under the Constitution. They cite a 
section of the Constitution that says federal judges, who are 
appointed for life, ``shall hold their offices during good 
behavior.'' There is no similar language concerning the president, 
elected by the whole country for a limited term. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a judge has committed perjury ... it was absolutely  
untenable that he could stay on the bench in a life-tenured 
position,'' said Alan I. Baron, who was the House's impeachment 
counsel in Judge Nixon's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, appointed by President Lyndon Johnson, was serving a  
five-year prison term at the time. His perjury conviction stemmed 
from his denial that he had talked to a prosecutor about helping 
his business associate's son, who had been indicted on drug 
charges. Nixon claimed the questions put to him before the grand 
jury were confusing. He was acquitted on a separate charge that he 
took an illegal gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got a judge who's had a criminal conviction, he  
flunks the good behavior provision,'' said Conrad. ``That's an 
absolute no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the view of many Democrats, Conrad said a president  
should be impeached only for offenses that threaten the functions 
of government. Lying about the national security would be 
impeachable; lying about a sexual affair is not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate traditionally deliberates on impeachments in private,  
but remarks that senators made elsewhere could come back to haunt 
them. Last week, Republicans circulated comments Gore made in the 
1986 impeachment case of Harry Claiborne, a judge imprisoned for 
tax fraud. Claiborne, like Clinton, said he was a victim of 
overzealous prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said that should ``in no way abrogate the finding that  
Claiborne has engaged in impeachable conduct.'' Claiborne lost his 
judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
	Another judge, Alcee Hastings, was ousted in 1989, the same year  
as Nixon, on charges that he conspired to obtain a bribe and lied 
to gain acquittal in an earlier trial. Hastings is now a Democratic 
House member from Florida. The Senate votes against Hastings barely 
reached the two-thirds majority necessary for removal. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has voted articles of impeachment against 15 people,  
11 of them federal judges. All seven officials convicted by the 
Senate were judges.

<HEADLINE> Airline To Install Cardiac Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Airways says it will become the first  
international airline to install heart monitors and cardiac 
resuscitation devices on all its aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year, the airline plans to fit cardiac monitors which  
will transmit medical data via satellite to medical experts on the 
ground, who will make a diagnosis and advise cabin staff about 
treatment, the company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways also will install defibrillators, which check a  
patient's heart rhythm and, if necessary, apply an appropriate 
electric shock to re-establish the heart rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The equipment ``will ensure we can provide the very best care  
in-flight for all our passengers,'' said Dr. Sandra Mooney, the 
airline's health services director. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, the airline will begin training 14,500 cabin crew to  
use the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first machines will be installed on long-haul jets in April.

<HEADLINE>  Senators Reach Agreement for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans and Democrats reached  
agreement in an extraordinary meeting today to resume President 
Clinton's impeachment trial next week while leaving open the 
question of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, hammered out in an informal meeting of all  
senators in the Old Senate Chamber, was drafted into a formal 
document and a vote was planned for late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that under the emerging  
plan the trial would begin next week with opening presentations. At 
the same time, two senators from each party would beginning working 
on the difficult issue of calling witnesses. GOP House prosecutors 
are pressing for witnesses, while many Democrats oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Little further was known of the timetable, although Sen. Connie  
Mack., R-Fla., said there would be no call of witnesses before Jan. 
26 and no restrictions placed on the ability of senators to offer a 
motion to adjourn the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle told reporters he expected  
an ``overwhelming, bipartisan'' vote in favor of the package, once 
it is drafted and submitted to the Senate for a vote, most likely 
within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of a session, Chief Justice William Rehnquist,  
who presides over the trial, arrived at the Capitol a short while 
after noon. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one top White House aide was also in the Capitol as  
discussions over the president's trial neared a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said that ``ultimately, there will be a  
vote on witnesses,'' indicating that it would be up to the full 
Senate to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A partisan disagreement over rules had clouded the opening of  
the trial on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were sworn in as jurors, in an oath administered by  
Rehnquist. But moments later, the trial was recessed so senators 
could attempt to fashion a bipartisan accord that both parties said 
they wanted to serve as a contrast to the highly partisan 
impeachment proceedings in the House last year. The two sides 
agreed to a meeting this morning in the Old Senate Chamber, the 
site of great debates in the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful, called the  
meeting ``an extraordinary event'' and said its most important 
byproduct was ``we did not begin this process with a partisan 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott indicated that the breakthrough came when two senators of  
vastly different political persuasions, Massachusetts liberal 
Democrat Edward M. Kennedy and Texas conservative Republican Phil 
Gramm made back-to-back suggestions. Lott did not offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle, each with his own plans for a trial, invited  
rank-and-file members to the room that was the Senate's chamber 
between 1810 and 1859. Security officers guarded the doors to the 
chamber, and extra chairs had to be brought in -- there weren't a 
hundred senators back in the 19th century when the chamber was in 
use. Outside, the Capitol was blanketed by a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators gathered, members of the House prosecution  
team also met and considered adding Kathleen Willey, the woman who 
alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in the White House, 
to the list of witnesses they would like to call, GOP sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey would not be questioned about the alleged sexual  
advance but about any possible attempts to intimidate her, one 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and House GOP  
colleagues have prepared a list of potential witnesses, including 
Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Clinton 
secretary Betty Currie. Today, Hyde issued a statement renewing his 
plea for witnesses but sidestepping any mention of the emerging 
Senate plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in any court proceeding, witnesses are necessary during a  
trial so that evidence may be thoroughly weighed and tested before 
a conviction,'' Hyde said 
</P>
<P>
	Away from Washington, the president visited Detroit to make a  
speech giving a rosy assessment of the economy. ``I feel good about 
the future,'' Clinton said after attending an auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to hold the senators' meeting in the chamber  
collapsed Thursday, after partisan rancor broke out only moments 
after Clinton was formally made a defendant in the first 
presidential impeachment trial since the Andrew Johnson case in 
1868. The primary cause of the rupture was a dispute over the need 
for witnesses, which Republicans favor and Democrats oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Thursday had scheduled votes on their proposed  
ground rules and also on a Democratic alternative. With a 55-45 
advantage, the GOP would have won the fight, but at the price of 
setting a partisan tone that might never be overcome in the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott pulled back from the brink and kept negotiating, deciding  
senators should ``keep calm and cool and dignified.'' His move 
prompted Daschle to proclaim: ``I think there is some common 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment, both  
related to his attempts to conceal his extramarital affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. One article charges the president with perjury before a 
federal grand jury, the second with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers were ``ready to go'' and  
ready to accept Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's evidence in the 
Lewinsky matter in exchange for a ban on witnesses. But, he added, 
if the House insisted on calling witnesses it would cause a delay, 
``because bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record 
opens up a whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And 
that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him.

<HEADLINE> Three Tenors Coming to Motown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Three Tenors are coming to Motown.  
</P>
<P>
	Opera superstars Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose  
Carreras will perform July 17 in Detroit at a concert sponsored by 
Ford Motor Co., the Detroit Free Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details -- including the site and ticket prices -- were not  
available, said Kathi Kammerdiener, assistant to the vice president 
of operations for the trio's production company, the Rudas 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Three Tenors first performed together in 1990. Other  
appearances scheduled this year are Saturday in Tokyo and April 18 
in Pretoria, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	All three singers have performed separately in Detroit.  
Pavarotti, 63, participated in the grand opening celebration of the 
opera house in April 1996. Carreras, 52, performed there 11 months 
later. Domingo, 57, performed in June 1994 at the Masonic Temple.

<HEADLINE> Moms Like `Mike' for Newborns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Moms like Mike in most of the country, but  
Jose leads the way in California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the name Jose showed up on more birth certificates than  
any other boy's name in those two heavily Hispanic states, 
according to the Social Security Administration. Michael was No. 1 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose's popularity isn't just the result of growing Hispanic  
populations, said Edward Callary, editor of the American Name 
Society's journal. It also reflects a new comfort with ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty years ago, most people would not have given their child  
an ethnic name,'' Callary said. ``A lot of folks tried to blend in 
and fold into American society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Jose led the list for boys in California, the rest of the  
state's top five were more traditional. In descending order: 
Daniel, Michael, Anthony and Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls' list lacked a Latina flavor, even in California. The  
top five: Jessica, Ashley, Emily, Jennifer and Samantha. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the favorite boy's names were Michael, Jacob,  
Matthew, Nicholas and Joshua, based on a sampling of Social 
Security card applications. Girls were Kaitlyn, Emily, Sarah, 
Hannah and Ashley.

<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom shares were down  
Friday amid rumors of a possible takeover bid for Cable &AMP; Wireless 
PLC and speculation that the telecommunications giant must partly 
finance start-up losses by its Global One joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom was trading at 33.50 euros ($55.77) at midday, a drop of  
1.9 percent from Thursday. At the same time, Cable &AMP; Wireless stock 
had risen 7.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom officials declined to comment on the takeover  
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	It also refused to comment on a Die Welt newspaper report that  
Global One suffered losses last year of $809 million, compared to 
losses of $660 million last year. The newspaper quoted an internal 
Deutsche Telekom report. 
</P>
<P>
	Global One is a joint venture of France Telecom, Deutsche  
Telekom and Sprint Corp., of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom also declined to confirm the Die Welt report but  
said it is ``satisfied'' with the company's progress. A company 
spokeswoman pointed out that France Telecom already has said Global 
One is not expected to break even until 2003.

<HEADLINE> Gen.: Saddam Desperate for Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last month's U.S and British air attacks  
against Iraq may have killed between 600 to 1,600 members of Saddam 
Hussein's Republican Guard, as well as ``several key individuals'' 
in his leadership structure, America's top general said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost a lot,'' Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, said at a breakfast with defense writers. The 
four-star Army general was questioned about the latest estimates of 
damage done in the four-day operation which targeted the Iraqi 
leader's top military units and his ability to use weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing also destroyed unique pieces of equipment used to  
maintain, repair and improve Iraq's missile capability. That means 
Saddam's program has been put back two years, instead of just one, 
the commander of Operation Desert Fox, Gen. Anthony Zinni, said at 
a separate press conference at the Pentagon later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In targeting Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and the means  
to use them, the United States used intelligence gathered by U2 spy 
planes and by eavesdropping on Iraq's communications network, a 
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The information gathering was conducted as part of a ``pool''  
drawn by the U.N. monitoring commission from several nations, 
including the United States, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not unilateral,'' the official said. ``It was done  
under UNSCOM's direction. It was focused solely on where the stuff 
was concealed.'' UNSCOM is the U.N. special commission monitoring 
Iraqi weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, the general in charge of Desert Fox said he was  
not aware that any information gained through the U.N. inspectors 
had been used by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the bombing hit ``several key individuals that were  
in the upper structure, that were no longer available to him to 
advise or to lead.'' Asked if that meant they were killed, Shelton 
replied, ``Yes.'' He declined to name the individuals, cite their 
positions or what their importance might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	The general emphasized that his estimates of deaths were ``based  
on unconfirmed reporting from a variety of sources,'' and warned 
that they were very difficult to determine exactly. He said, 
however, that the latest information ``would now indicate that 
there were hundreds of intended casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military officials have said the Republican Guards and the  
Special Republican Guards were targeted in the four-day operation 
because they protect Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, such as 
biological or chemical weapons and the missiles or aircraft used to 
deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... give you a range from about 600 to 1,600 that could have  
been killed and probably several times that ... that were killed or 
injured,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton and Zinni said they considered the operation successful  
because of the ``one-of-a-kind'' type of military items destroyed 
and because civilian damage was very low. Also, no U.S. forces were 
killed in the operation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni, the Marine Corps general who heads the U.S. Central  
Command, said the ``structural damage was far more severe'' to 
Saddam's military units than first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-star general said his estimates of deaths ranged up to  
2,000 Iraqis, but he did not clarify the difference between his 
figures and Shelton's. In any case, he said, such numbers were not 
the measure of the success of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We struck and damaged significantly'' 85 percent of the  
targets, Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, to his knowledge, the U.S. military didn't  
specifically use intelligence gathered by U.N. weapons inspection 
efforts to select Iraqi targets. He also said he didn't receive any 
``real-time'' information about Iraqi movements from any listening 
devices that were reportedly planted in Iraq by U.S. intelligence 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that the  
United States sent a spy into Iraq in March in the guise of a U.N. 
inspector to install an electronic eavesdropping system. For 10 
months, the device let the U.S. and a select elite within the U.N. 
inspection team monitor cell phones, walkie-talkies and other 
communications by military and intelligence officers who protect 
Saddam and conceal Iraq's weapons, according to the story. The 
Washington Post had a similar report. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said he believes the recent violations of the no-fly zones  
and the testing of U.S. and British aircraft is an indication of 
Saddam's desperation at being hit so hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he is shaken,'' said Zinni.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelton noted that in contrast to the Persian Gulf war, when the  
international media in Baghdad was allowed to view damage to 
civilians, very little such coverage has been allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (it is) to keep the media from seeing how much damage  
was done (to the military) and so no one would know how much pain 
or damage we inflicted on them,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Zinni said Saddam appears intent on shooting down a  
Western warplane to shore up his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni called the recent challenges to allied aircraft  
maintaining watch over Iraq ``a desperate attempt ... to claim some 
sort of victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest occurred Thursday, when an Iraqi missile battery  
targeted a U.S. warplane, which retaliated with a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fairly desperate attempts to regain some of that  
position (in Iraq and the region) that he held before, or thought 
he held before,'' said Zinni. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday with a group of international journalists,  
Zinni said he did not want to ``overstate'' the matter but said 
Washington is ``seeing things that indicate that maybe his grip on 
control and the ruthlessness by which he attempts to maintain 
control is slipping.''

<HEADLINE> Probe Faults U.S. Embassy Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An official panel that investigated the U.S.  
embassy bombings in Africa says a ``collective failure'' by 
administrations and congresses over the years has left U.S. 
diplomatic missions vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior official said Thursday night the panel, known as the  
Accountability Review Board, also accused the State Department and 
other agencies of giving low priority to embassy security. 
</P>
<P>
	The board was convened after the near simultaneous bombings at  
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. Twelve Americans 
were among the 224 people killed in the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was directed by retired Adm. William Crowe, a former  
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found no evidence that any employee of the U.S.  
government, including the armed services, did not fulfill his or 
her duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we believe there was a collective failure by several  
administrations and congresses over the past decades to invest 
adequate efforts and resources to reduce vulnerability of 
diplomatic missions around the world to terrorist attack,'' said 
the official, quoting from a summary of the report. The official 
insisted on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS News, which broke the story, said the report depicts a  
mindset in which senior officials were more concerned about budgets 
than lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department planned to release the report today.  
</P>
<P>
	The study said the government relies too heavily on prior  
warnings of terrorist attacks instead of assuming that the most 
vulnerable targets are most likely to be struck, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve security in the future, the administration will have  
to provide ``adequate and sustained'' funding for diplomatic 
missions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the August bombings, the State Department surveyed all 260  
diplomatic posts abroad and found that only 40 were fully secure. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress since has provided funds to upgrade security at subpar  
posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people have been indicted in the two bombings, believed  
to have been masterminded by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who is said 
be living in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin East African bombings occurred within minutes of each  
other on Aug. 7. Eleven people were killed at the U.S. Embassy in 
Dar es Salaam. A much more deadly explosion outside the U.S. 
Embassy in Nairobi killed 213 people and injured more than 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. forces retaliated 13 days later, launching cruise missile  
strikes against alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a 
chemical plant in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> UN Confronts US on Iraq Spy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The head of a U.N. commission charged with  
disarming Iraq is demanding to know whether the United States used 
the weapons inspectors' work to gather intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Butler said he brought the matter up with U.S. officials  
Thursday, asking them what Washington ``might have done unbeknownst 
to us,'' in reportedly using U.N. weapons searches to undermine the 
Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler also discussed his concerns with U.N. Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan, who later spoke with Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan and Albright discussed allegations that the United States  
had ``piggybacked'' on the inspectors' work for its own foreign 
policy goals, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright assured Annan that Americans in or connected with  
UNSCOM, the U.N. weapons commission, strictly supported Security 
Council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Butler said he  
expected to have a ``relevant conversation about it'' today with 
U.S. officials and that he ``wanted real answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want our system misused in that way,'' Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Butler came under fire following newspaper reports this week  
that detailed a surveillance operation that allowed Washington to 
eavesdrop on Iraqi military communications network, reportedly 
through U.N. weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times today quoted unidentified U.S. officials as  
saying that the United States used the U.N. team to eavesdrop, and 
that the operation had Butler's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler on Thursday denied he ever authorized any surveillance of  
Saddam Hussein's communications -- only messages that related to the 
National Monitoring Directorate, which works with U.N. inspectors 
in carrying out arms searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has long called for Butler's replacement, accusing him and  
his inspectors of being spies. Butler denied his staff had ever 
spied, but said he wanted Washington to clarify whether ``some 
other collection efforts or piggybacking on us may have been taking 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday that the United  
Nations wasn't in a position to investigate such allegations 
itself, and said it would have to wait to see if any of the charges 
were corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler stressed that he had never directed inspectors'  
surveillance go anywhere near the Iraqi government. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing the point, Butler said just before inspectors  
evacuated Iraq before the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes, they had 
established in the desert a system to check television waves to 
monitor the flight paths of missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I directed quite specifically, that there be limitation to  
that work, that Iraq be accompanied with us and see what we were 
doing, and that they (inspectors) in no way -- in any way -- lock on 
to any Iraqi military or government communications because I didn't 
want to be accused of exactly this sort of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that has been our policy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Butler has chaired UNSCOM for two years, heading the body  
responsible for overseeing the destruction of Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction as called for by the cease-fire resolutions that 
ended the Persian Gulf War. An oil embargo imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990 cannot be lifted until the inspectors report 
Iraq is weapons-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said Thursday he hadn't decided whether he would stay on  
the job after his term ends June 30. But he rejected the suggestion 
that the newspaper stories were leaked by Annan's office to 
undercut him and thus allow for a less controversial inspection 
regime to return to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that somehow that this whole mega-crisis with Iraq  
could be solved by giving my head on the plate to the Iraqis is 
just not serious,'' Butler said.

<HEADLINE> Dentist Admits To Molesting 5 Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A dentist accused of taking pictures of  
dozens of semiconscious and blindfolded girls performing sexual 
acts on him in his office admitted Friday to molesting five girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald C. Johnson, 48, pleaded guilty to five counts of lewd  
molestation and is expected to be sentenced to 70 years in prison. 
Sex abuse charges that carried possible life terms were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he surrendered in August, he knew he would be facing the  
music someday,'' said Robert Durban, Johnson's attorney. ``And that 
day is today. ... He is extremely remorseful -- and contrite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tim Harris said the plea bargain was made in part to  
spare the children from having to go through the court process. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson spent one week as a fugitive after employees at his  
Tulsa dental office discovered a box full of Polaroid photographs 
of blindfolded girls appeared to be anaesthetized while performing 
oral sex on a man. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's investigators had estimated there were more than 140  
photos involving more than 30 girls, some appearing as young as 4 
but most between the ages of 8 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities identified the man as Johnson based on a distinctive  
ring shown in the photos.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Aaron Glenn Won't Start Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Pro Bowl cornerback Aaron Glenn  
will not start the New York Jets' AFC playoff game Sunday against 
Jacksonville because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	New York coach Bill Parcells said Friday that Glenn will play,  
but would not reveal anything about his team's strategy in using 
Glenn, who has missed the last 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't tell you how I am deploying the players,'' Parcells  
said. ``It has nothing to do with his layoff. What I am saying is, 
we have certain jobs we want him to do and we think he can do them, 
and he tells me he can. As the game goes on, we'll see how he 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn practiced each day during the Jets' two weeks of  
preparations for their first postseason game in eight years. He 
said having a bye helped his ankle, but that there still is pain -- 
and probably will be for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be honest with him and with myself,'' said Glenn,  
who led the Jets with six interceptions and made the Pro Bowl for 
the second straight year. ``It's a big game and I want to play, 
even if it means just playing a couple of plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to him that I play. I think he wants me to play  
and it is important to me to play. If I feel I can be productive 
and help the team and he feels that way, he'll play me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn's replacement, Ray Mickens, usually is the nickel back,  
covering the slot receiver. But in his three starts in place of his 
Texas A&AMP;M buddy, Mickens has played well on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Jacksonville, Mickens knows the Jets will need to get as  
much production from Glenn as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith, both guys who've  
been to the Pro Bowl,'' Mickens said. ``You don't get to the Pro 
Bowl for doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my third year in the NFL and I have gotten better as a  
player physically and mentally since Bill Parcells and (defensive 
coordinator) Bill Belichick got here. You see me play well and you 
know I've got that confidence. If I play like crap and say I have 
all the confidence in the world, then people will say I am lying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn is most likely to play against three-receiver alignments,  
but Parcells didn't rule out more work if Glenn isn't hobbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, Glenn is glad to be back in uniform, even if it  
means just participating in a minimum number of plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I play on punt teams,'' he said, ``I want to get out  
there.''

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo To Sell Bottling Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc. will gain $1 billion from the  
planned sale of a majority stake in its bottling operations to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo disclosed the amount of the initial public offering for  
Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. in a regulatory filing Friday, but did 
not indicate how big of a stake in the bottling operations it would 
retain. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo, the No. 2 soft drink company behind Coca-Cola Co.,  
announced plans for the sale two months ago and plans to use 
proceeds from the offering to pay off debt. The filing did not 
indicate how many shares would be offered or when the sale would 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottling group handles 54 percent of the North American  
sales of such products as Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Lipton 
iced tea and Aquafina bottled water. It handles 32 percent of 
PepsiCo's worldwide beverage sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale allows PepsiCo to focus on marketing and developing  
soft drinks while continuing the very profitable practice of 
selling soft drink concentrate to the bottlers. Bottlers mix the 
concentrate with carbonated water, package it and distribute the 
drinks, but generally have lower profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the filing, Pepsi Bottling Group's earnings rose  
steadily from 1995 to 1997, but fell 36 percent to $70 million 
through the first nine months of fiscal 1998. Nine-month sales were 
up 7 percent to $4.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to beverages, PepsiCo owns Frito-Lay Inc., the  
nation's biggest snack food maker. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news of the stock sale, PepsiCo rose 62 1/2 cents Friday to  
close at $41.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Patch Adams' Non-Hollywood View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSBORO, W.Va. (AP) -- The hit Robin Williams movie ``Patch  
Adams'' ends on a feel-good note, with the audience told that 
construction of a free hospital is under way in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	That's Hollywood. In the mountains of West Virginia, the project  
exists mostly in the imagination. There is no hospital, just a 
hodgepodge of buildings, some half-finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hunter D. ``Patch'' Adams has been raising money for his  
cause since the early '70s -- more than $1.1 million, by his own 
account. He wants tens of millions more to complete the project, 
but some are questioning where the money is going -- and whether the 
movie dream will ever be reality. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gesundheit! Institute, a health-care reform movement founded  
by Adams more than 20 years ago, sits on 310 acres Adams bought on 
Droop Mountain. There is a 6,500-square-foot workshop, a half-built 
Russian-style dacha, a two-hole outhouse and a cottage with 
attached greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The cottage has a fax machine, a computer and three phone lines.  
The walls are unfinished planks. Heat comes from a wood-fired 
stove. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no patients, just two staffers who answer an endless  
stream of calls and letters from people suddenly enchanted with the 
concept of free health care from seeing ``Patch Adams,'' which 
stars Williams as a maverick medical student who espouses the 
healing power of humor and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams insists that $25 million from now, a hospital will stand.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the end of most Frank Capra movies: We're going to  
get the girl, get the business and ride into the sunset,'' he says 
from his home in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Others do not share his conviction.  
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cafoncelli, a Charleston nurse, grew disenchanted with  
Adams after a 1997 visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a great storyteller. He uses it to manipulate people,''  
she says. ``People are in tears after seeing this movie and they 
want to give him money, and that's exactly what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams dreams of a 40-bed, full-service hospital where people are  
emotionally, physically and spiritually healed through friendship, 
humor and holistic techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Gesundheit! staff member Jon Luchs, who has lived in Hillsboro  
for six months, remains a believer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tendency to become unhappy when the ideal isn't  
realized or it becomes apparent it's going to take work,'' he says. 
``Dissenters are often loud, even if there are only a few of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jef Harris, an herb-store owner who lives near Hillsboro, is  
among the dissenters. He has never met Adams but says financial 
concerns kept him from joining Gesundheit!. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's this money going? The staff could not answer that  
question,'' Harris says. ``He's taken people's money for years and 
done nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams dismisses Harris as someone who couldn't establish a  
business relationship with Gesundheit!. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unbelievably wholesome. We are wacky. And not everyone  
who has come to us has loved us. But 750,000 people love us,'' he 
says of his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1993 book, ``Gesundheit!,'' Adams said he needed $5  
million for construction and $1.5 million a year for operating 
costs. Today he wants $50 million -- half for construction and half 
for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fund-raising goal has changed as the plan for the hospital  
has evolved,'' Adams explains. ``The first plan was infantile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, 53, is a lean 6-foot-4 with long gray hair and a  
handlebar mustache. He dresses in colorful oversized clothing and 
clown shoes and behaves outrageously just to get a laugh. On film 
and in life, he rails against the medical establishment as being 
devoid of humanity and driven by greed. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the movie's release, money has become important to  
Gesundheit!, too. A Web site that once focused on Adams' mission 
now begs for money: ``Don't wait, donate!'' and ``Put your money 
where your nose is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For $10, donors get a red rubber nose. For $25, they get a  
whoopee cushion. And for $75, they get a free copy of Adams' 
200-page book. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams commands lecture fees as high as $20,000. Universal studio  
has donated $500,000. Adams got an additional $200,000 for the 
rights to his story but says he saw little of it after his 
publisher, his co-author and his ex-wife got their cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the questions about the money and motivation, Adams'  
supporters are unswayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``His charisma has genuine purpose,'' Luchs says. ``I like him.  
And I trust him.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Saxon, who played vaudeville houses as part  
of a comedy team early in his career and went on to produce 
Broadway plays, died Tuesday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s and '40s, Saxon sang with a number of big bands,

	HASTINGS, Neb. (AP) -- Gladys D. Seaton, a member of a family  
that operates newspapers and television stations in five states, 
died Tuesday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Seaton and her late husband, Fred A. Seaton, bought the  
Hastings Tribune with his father and brother and became its 
publisher. The family eventually owned several newspapers, a 
television station and radio stations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	She was vice president and a board member of family companies  
that operated the Alliance Times-Herald, the Lead (S.D.) Daily 
Call-Pioneer Times, the Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury, the Sheridan 
(Wyo.) Press and the Winfield (Kan.) Courier. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served as president of Nebraska Television Corp. in  
Hastings, operator of KHAS-TV, and as a director of the Seaton 
Publishing Co. (Tribune) and Nebraska Broadcasting Co. (KHAS 
Radio). 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include two sons, two daughters, seven grandchildren  
and one great-grandchild.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a psychiatrist and  
cult expert who conducted examinations of Jack Ruby and Patricia 
Hearst, died Jan. 2 of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	West headed the psychiatry department and the Neuropsychiatric  
Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles for 20 
years. He retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	West frequently served as a court-appointed expert. He testified  
that Ruby, killer of President Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey 
Oswald, suffered from ``major mental illness apparently 
precipitated by the stress of his trial and its aftermath.'' That 
opinion helped avoid a death sentence for Ruby, who died of cancer 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	West was also one of four psychiatrists who examined Hearst, the  
kidnapping victim turned bank robber, before her 1976 trial. The 
panel found she was sane and able to stand trial but recommended 
she should be treated before the trial, a recommendation ignored by 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	West was the first white psychiatrist to go to South Africa to  
testify on behalf of black prisoners during the effort to end 
apartheid. He was a member of the White House Conference on Civil 
Rights in 1966, and he worked for years to abolish the death 
penalty.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Goro Yamaguchi, a master of shakuhachi, or bamboo  
flute, who is credited with introducing traditional Japanese music 
to the world, died Sunday of a heart attack. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Designated a ``living national treasure'' in Japan for his  
exceptional musical talents, Yamaguchi was also known in the United 
States. In 1977, a recording of Yamaguchi's playing was included in 
a selection of music sent into outer space on NASA's Voyager 2 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his death, he taught music at Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku, a  
respected school of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yamaguchi began learning shakuhachi at age 11 from his father.  
Shakuhachi playing has been closely linked to the practice of Zen 
Buddhism throughout its history in Japan.

                          *Dr. Paul M. Zoll    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Paul M. Zoll, a heart specialist whose  
research led to the pacemaker and the defibrillator devices that 
have helped millions of patients, died Tuesday of respiratory 
arrest. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 45 years ago, Zoll was credited with showing for the  
first time that electrical stimulation can restart human hearts. 
His research aided the development of the electrocardiogram and 
open-heart surgery, said Dr. Seigo Izumo, director of 
cardiovascular research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Zoll won the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research  
Award, considered a leading scientific prize in the United States. 
The citation noted his work led to the development of the 
closed-chest defibrillator, which shocks the heart to restore a 
normal rhythm, and cardiac monitors as well as the pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoll was a clinical professor at Harvard Medical School and a  
physician at Beth Israel Hospital. He also wrote many articles for 
professional journals and in 1956 was named associate editor of the 
medical journal Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, he founded Zoll Medical Corp., which  
manufactured defibrillators.

<HEADLINE> Houston Octuplet Fights Infection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Concerns about infection have prompted doctors to  
suspend the feeding of breast milk to the first of the seven 
octuplets delivered Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests returned Thursday on Chidi Louis showed the possibility of  
infection, according to doctors at Texas Children's Hospital. 
Chidi, one of six girls, is receiving antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorom, the last-born girl, had been the only baby not receiving  
breast milk but was to begin receiving minute amounts Friday to 
supplement her intravenous feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the conditions of the seven surviving octuplets  
remained stable, said Dr. Carol Lynn Berseth, attending 
neonatalogist at Texas Children's. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 8, Nkem Chukwu delivered Ebuka, a girl. Two weeks later,  
on Dec. 20, she delivered seven more children -- led by Chidi. 
Odera, a girl who weighed 10.3 ounces at birth, died a week after 
birth.

<HEADLINE>  Holmgren To Coach Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren wanted total control. The  
Seattle Seahawks gave it to him, not to mention $4 million a year, 
to become their coach and general manager on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren got an eight-year contract that reportedly will pay him  
$4 million a season, making him the highest-paid coach in the NFL. 
George Seifert received $2.5 million in his contract to become 
coach of the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bob LaMonte, Holmgren's agent, nor the Seahawks would  
confirm the amount of Holmgren's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks, a franchise that has missed the playoffs for 10  
straight seasons, got their man and they paid a high price for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the NBA lockout, I wasn't in midseason form with these  
agents,'' said Bob Whitsitt, who also is president of owner Paul 
Allen's Portland Trail Blazers. ``I should have been in better form 
at this time of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who took the Packers to the last two Super Bowls, told  
team president Bob Whitsitt on Friday morning that he was accepting 
the job and canceled trips to Baltimore and Philadelphia for job 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Packers to tell them they'd have to find a new  
coach to work with Green Bay GM Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren was accompanied to Seattle by his wife, Kathy, and the  
youngest of four daughters, Gretchen, a high school student. He 
said he reached a decision to accept the Seattle job Thursday night 
after having dinner with Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the commitment is here,'' Holmgren said, referring  
to Allen, who has spent lavishly on free agents the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Whitsitt at team headquarters for five hours  
Thursday, he spent Thursday night at Allen's house for a private 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first impression was awesome,'' Holmgren said of Allen, who  
is listed as the third-richest American behind Bill Gates and 
Warren Buffett with a total worth of $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time last night. He's a very interesting  
man, interested in a lot of things. I knew right away that I had 
all the support I could ever need or ask for right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most important for Holmgren, 50, was becoming general manager as  
well as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be in charge of the football operations,'' he said during  
a news conference. ``Decision-making, personnel, all football 
decisions. Now, I'll have both (GM and coach) those 
responsiblities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in charge of Randy Mueller, vice president of  
football operations for the Seahawks for four seasons. In effect, 
Mueller has been Seattle's de facto general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren compiled a 75-37 record as coach of the Packers,  
leading them to a victory over New England in the Super Bowl after 
the 1996 season. In 1997, Green Bay lost in the Super Bowl to 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's decision came less than a week after the Packers were  
eliminated by the 49ers 30-27 in a first-round playoff game in San 
Francisco last Sunday. Green Bay lost with three seconds to go when 
Terrell Owens caught a 25-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Green Bay, Holmgren coached his teams into the playoffs six  
years in a row. In order, the Packers went 9-7, 9-7, 9-7, 11-5, 
13-3, 13-3 and 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers felt all season they probably would lose Holmgren.  
It turned out they were right, although Holmgren said it still was 
a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans in Green Bay are wonderful,'' he said. ``Our time  
there was wonderful. Our kids grew up there. It was a time period 
in our lives as a family professionally that I will always look 
back at a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the fans know that I gave it everything that I possibly  
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lure of having total control of a franchise, like  
Jimmy Johnson at Miami and Bill Parcells with the New York Jets, 
was too strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you like to have control, as much control as possible,  
over your personnel,'' Holmgren said. ``Who you pick. How you form 
your team. Things like that. I just think it makes things easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having control and a contract reportedly worth  
$32 million, Holmgren's new team will be playing in a new outdoor 
stadium with grass in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should make everybody very happy because my record on  
turf isn't very good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, Holmgren will take over a franchise that went 31-33  
the last four seasons under Dennis Erickson. Erickson was fired 
Dec. 28, one day after the Seahawks ended their disappointing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said he didn't know when he would form a coaching  
staff.

<HEADLINE> Cloned Sheep Dolly Will Be Stuffed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Scientists think they've found the  
best way to pay tribute to Dolly the sheep, the world's first 
cloned mammal. 
</P>
<P>
	After her death, they're going to stuff her.  
</P>
<P>
	The Roslin Institute, which cloned Dolly from an adult sheep in  
1996 using groundbreaking technology, announced today that it has 
made a deal with the National Museums of Scotland to preserve Dolly 
for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Shaw, the museums' keeper of geology and zoology, called  
Dolly a ``20th-century scientific icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to acquire Dolly principally because of the display  
potential and impact a mounted specimen would have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dolly was born on July 5, 1996 -- her arrival wasn't  
announced until seven months later -- she was the first mammal 
cloned from the cell of another adult mammal. 
</P>
<P>
	News of her birth raised concerns about the possible cloning of  
humans and generated ongoing ethical debate in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloning also has opened fresh areas of medical research and led  
to new drugs for heart attack, cystic fibrosis and stroke and 
easier methods of scientific testing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Finn Dorset breed named after country singer Dolly Parton,  
Dolly gave birth in April to a ewe named Bonnie. 
</P>
<P>
	The national museums will have to wait a bit to put her on  
display: Scientists say Dolly could live another 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Clemson Guard Hulsey Choses NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Guard Corey Hulsey on Friday became the  
second Clemson star to give up his senior year to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Hulsey told the school he will skip his senior season, joining  
linebacker Rahim Abdullah in declaring for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 335-pound offensive lineman was a second-team  
All-Atlantic Coast Conference member and would have been the 
Tigers' only returnee up front. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a difficult decision,'' said Hulsey, who was home in  
Lula, Ga. He said he enjoyed Clemson, ``but I think it is best for 
my future to turn professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, leaving early has become as much a Clemson tradition  
as Howard's Rock or running down the hill into Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Anthony Simmons left after his junior season a year  
ago, while defensive lineman Trevor Pryce gave up his senior season 
in January, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hulsey said his move had nothing to do with new coach Tommy  
Bowden, hired last month to replace Tommy West and revive Clemson 
after a 3-8 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said Hulsey, who started all but one of 23 games the past  
two years, would have been an important part of the offensive line 
next season. ``Anytime you lose someone who was an all-conference 
player, it is a big loss,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hulsey's departure has been talked about for weeks. Although he  
waited until the NFL's deadline day to decide, Hulsey missed 
Bowden's team meeting Wednesday and was scheduled for a Florida 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hulsey joins a long list of draftable Tigers from a team that  
finished near the bottom of the ACC. Abdullah and cornerback Antwan 
Edwards are considered by some to be top-round selections. 
Late-round possibilities are Hulsey, center Jason Gamble and 
defensive lineman Adrian Dingle. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said NFL people he spoke with recommended that Hulsey  
stay for his final season at Clemson. Mike Detillier, who puts out 
the M&AMP;D Draft Report, said Hulsey was at best a fourth-round 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said the offensive line will be a focus during recruiting  
this month and in spring practice, which starts March 6.

<HEADLINE> Disney Recalls `Rescuers' Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. on Friday recalled 3.4  
million copies of the animated video ``The Rescuers,'' apparently 
because the photographic image of a nude woman was inserted into 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The image was discovered by Disney employees after the  
re-release this month of the cartoon, which appeared in theaters in 
1977, 1983 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spokeswoman Claudia Peters declined to characterize the  
image, other than to say it was objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sources familiar with the recall told The Associated  
Press there was a photo of a woman's nude torso embedded in the 
video. 
</P>
<P>
	The image cannot be seen when the video is watched at normal  
viewing speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is a first for Disney, although conservative  
religious groups claim other animated features have included risque 
words or images. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has denied the allegations in each case, calling  
them misperceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney recalled the video ``to keep our promise to families that  
we can trust and rely on the Disney brand to provide the finest in 
family entertainment,'' Ms. Peters said. She would not say how much 
the recall would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The image was on only two of the cartoon's 110,000 frames. ``The  
Rescuers'' follows the exploits of a group of courageous mice who 
try to rescue a little girl from kidnappers. 
</P>
<P>
	The offending picture was inserted into the film after the  
cartoon was drawn, Ms. Peters said. The image was on copies sent to 
theaters, but as with the video, was not visible when shown at 
normal speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The image was not on copies of the video released in 1992  
because it was made from a different print, Ms. Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall applies only to videos purchased since Jan. 5. The  
company shipped 3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Disney knew who tampered with the film, Ms. Peters  
would only say it was an internal matter. ``This is something that 
was done more than 20 years ago,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 the Virginia-based American Life League urged a recall  
of ``The Lion King,'' arguing that in one scene rising clouds of 
dust spelled the word ``sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group also wanted Disney to excise portions of ``Aladdin''  
and ``The Little Mermaid.'' In ``Mermaid,'' the group said, a 
minister becomes aroused during a wedding ceremony and in 
``Aladdin'' the title character purportedly mumbles a phrase urging 
teen-agers to remove their clothes.

	In Green Bay, Holmgren coached his teams into the playoffs six  
years in a row. In order, the Packers went 9-7, 9-7, 9-7, 11-5, 
13-3, 13-3 and 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers felt all season they probably would lose Holmgren.  
It turned out they were right, although Holmgren said it still was 
a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans in Green Bay are wonderful,'' he said. ``Our time  
there was wonderful. Our kids grew up there. It was a time period 
in our lives as a family professionally that I will always look 
back at a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the fans know that I gave it everything that I possibly  
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lure of having total control of a franchise, like  
Jimmy Johnson at Miami and Bill Parcells with the New York Jets, 
was too strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you like to have control, as much control as possible,  
over your personnel,'' Holmgren said. ``Who you pick. How you form 
your team. Things like that. I just think it makes things easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having control and a contract reportedly worth  
$32 million, Holmgren's new team will be playing in a new outdoor 
stadium with grass in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should make everybody very happy because my record on  
turf isn't very good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, Holmgren will take over a franchise that went 31-33  
the last four seasons under Dennis Erickson. Erickson was fired 
Dec. 28, one day after the Seahawks ended their disappointing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said he didn't know when he would form a coaching  
staff.

<HEADLINE> W. Va.'s Page To Join NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- All-Big East offensive tackle Solomon  
Page of West Virginia announced Friday he will skip his senior 
season and make himself available for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 300-pound junior from Pittsburgh had said after  
West Virginia's loss to Missouri in the Insight.com Bowl on Dec. 26 
that he was awaiting word from NFL scouts as to where he might be 
picked in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year starter earned first team all-Big East honors in  
1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Page's decision was released by the university. Page was  
not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solomon Page came to West Virginia with enormous potential and  
he has been a fine player for us for three years,'' said coach Don 
Nehlen. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was the last day that players could notify the NFL of  
their intentions to enter the April draft.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Optimistic for 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Ask Tiger Woods a loaded question, expect  
to get a loaded answer. 
</P>
<P>
	After Woods opened with a 4-under 69 in the Mercedes  
Championships, he was asked what he would like to accomplish in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Win every tournament,'' he said before cracking a wide smile.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he should have said, ``Win ANY tournament.'' Woods won  
only two times last year, the BellSouth Classic at Atlanta and the 
Dubai Desert Classic on the European tour by coming from eight 
strokes down on Sunday to beat Ernie Els in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Woods continues to believe that he's much better off than  
he was in 1997 when he won four times, including the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned how to play,'' he said. ``This year is not going to  
be as mechanical a year. I didn't like the way I played in '97, 
even though I won a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has been preaching consistency over the past year and  
notes that he had 13 finishes in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, I'd like to give myself a lot of chances, and  
hopefully the putts will fall at the right time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His new season didn't get off to the best start -- he  
three-putted from 20 feet on the first hole and missed an 8-foot 
eagle putt on the final hole. As the sun set over Maui, he was on 
the putting green with coach Butch Harmon at his side. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EURO FOR EUROPE:* The euro is the new currency of the PGA  
European Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Schofield, executive director of the European tour, said  
Friday that prize money would be quoted in the new European 
currency instead of British pounds when the tour starts next week 
with the South African PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, launched Jan. 1 as the new currency of 11 European  
countries, will operate for the next three years as a banking and 
accounting device. Notes and coins -- replacing liras, guilders, 
pesetas, etc. -- will begin appearing in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an historic day on the eve of our 28th season,''  
Schofield said. ``We believe the decision to adopt the euro 
compliments the fact that we are by title, the European Tour, and 
as a pan-European organization we are aware of our responsibility 
to embrace the new political era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading Friday, one euro was worth about 70.6  
British pence and $1.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the PGA European Tour is based in Britain, Britain is  
one of four European Union countries not participating in the 
first-wave conversion to the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FITNESS CRAZE:* Billy Andrade never will be compared to Craig  
Stadler when it comes to physique, but that didn't stop him from 
taking on a regimented workout schedule during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been out of shape,'' he said. ``I just felt like  
once the season was over, I wanted to get fired up for this year, 
so I decided to just get in better shape. I did it for a better 
life than better golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got both in the first round of the Mercedes Championships  
after his 6-under 67 left him one stroke out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``A golf course like this, it helps you,'' Andrade said of the  
hilly Plantation course at Kapalua Resort. ``I just think over the 
course of a year or a career, it can't do anything but help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrade, whose victory in the 1998 Canadian Open was his first  
since 1991, certainly has good examples of what kind of rewards can 
be reaped from working out. David Duval lost about 40 pounds a 
couple of years ago and has seven victories since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only going to help down the road,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PATE ON THE PEAK:* Steve Pate believes the increased  
competition on the PGA Tour, particularly with more players doing 
so well so young, will lead to shorter peak times for the top 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate, 37, won for the first time last year since the 1992 Buick  
Invitational at San Diego. When he joined the PGA Tour in 1985, he 
always figured the peak years were between 30 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you see guys having 10-year peaks any more,''  
Pate said. ``Part of it is because we're getting better athletes 
playing. Guys come out of college prepared to play, tournament 
tough by the time they get out here. I don't think they're lasting 
as long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, for one, isn't about to buy into that theory.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval was an All-America at Georgia Tech, failed to make the  
tour on his first try but has never finished worse than 11th on the 
money list since his rookie season. His seven victories over the 
past 14 months are more than anyone on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says your real late 20s up to 35 or 36 is when  
everybody hits their prime,'' Duval said. ``I sure hope so. That 
would be a lot of fun.''

<HEADLINE> Egger Barely Holds On To Win Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) -- The new slope at Berchtesgaden was  
supposed to be one of the flattest and easiest on the World Cup ski 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	That was without the soft snow, hard rain and thick fog that hit  
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting through the fog, Sabine Egger edged Ingrid Salvenmoser  
by one-hundreth of a second as Austrian women ended their drought 
in the slalom in dramatic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could only fight your way downhill and wait to see what  
happened at the finish,'' said Salvenmoser. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger's combined time was one minute, 46.81 seconds, while  
Salvenmoser flashed across the finish line in 1:46.82 as an 
Austrian women won the slalom for the first time since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard. The fog was worse than the rain -- but I don't  
care if it ends this way,'' said Egger, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, after her dramatic comeback triumph at  
Maribor two weeks ago in the slalom, finished third in 1:46.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger became the sixth different skier to win a slalom in as  
many races at the first World Cup race held in Berchtesgaden in 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion who had been winless  
for two years until Maribor because of injuries, retained the 
overall slalom lead with 365 points to Egger's 351. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger, who had finished second three times in her favorite  
discipline, seized the lead by blazing to a 52.41 first run. The 
Austrian took advantage of starting sixth as soft snow and pouring 
rain quickly led to ruts that hurt later competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a joke -- the snow was so soft,'' said American Kristina  
Koznick, who finished seventh and moved up to third in the slalom 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tables turned on the second run as New Zealand's Claudia  
Riegler flew down the course in a day's-best 52.29 after finishing 
29th in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Riegler finished fifth, but held the lead as the fog deepened  
until 13th-placed Spela Pretnar pulled past her. Pretnar held the 
lead until the final three skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Austrians and Wiberg finally fought through fog so deep  
spectators couldn't see the racers and passed Pretnar, who had been 
more than a second back after the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Austrian to win the slalom was Elfi Eder, who did the  
feat three times in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	German skiers Hilde Gerg and Martina Ertl, second and third in  
the overall World Cup standings, failed to gain on leader Alexandra 
Meissnitzer of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerg, despite competing on her home course, spun out on her  
second run, while Ertl was disqualified for running over a gate. 
Meissnitzer didn't compete.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Finish Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures finished higher in  
trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after poor export sales figures pushed them lower, soybean  
future prices jumped as much as 7 1/2 cents. They were spurred in part 
by forecasts for drier-than-expected weather in South America -- 
conditions that could hurt crops in Brazil and Argentina. Others 
analysts attributed part of the surge to a correction of the 
previous day's fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also finished up in a recovery that analysts  
attributed to technical factors and the South American weather 
forecast. And wheat futures settled higher as traders await next 
week's crop reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.91 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn was up 2 cents to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; March oats were up 1 cent 
to $1.11 1/2 a bushel; and March soybeans were up 6 1/2 cents to $5.55 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were up .80 cent to 62.52 a pound; March  
feeder cattle were up .57 cent at 72.17 cents a pound; February 
lean hogs rose .48 cent to 37.20 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies were .32 cents lower at 49.22 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 2 Mass. Jail Escapees Are Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALDEN, Mass. (AP) -- A convicted bank robber and a man awaiting  
trial escaped from the county jail but were recaptured within hours 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Wallace was captured shortly after 7 a.m. after being  
spotted by police running through the back yard of a Malden home, 
according to Roy Lyons, spokesman for the Plymouth County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came in the same general area that James Remington  
was found about two hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the pair escaped from the Plymouth County Jail  
in Plymouth on Thursday night by scaling a recreation area fence, 
climbing onto an adjacent roof, lowering themselves with an 
electrical cord to a second roof, squeezing through circular razor 
wire and jumping to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The men allegedly then stole a car and fled, but were spotted at  
about 1 a.m. in Boston, which is about 40 miles away. Police chased 
the car into Malden, a Boston suburb, where the men abandoned it 
and ran away. 
</P>
<P>
	Remington, 35, was awaiting sentencing on federal bank robbery  
charges, while Wallace, 31, was awaiting trial on charges of 
assault with a dangerous weapon and breaking and entering. The two 
will face additional charges for escape, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was the first escape since the jail opened four years  
ago.

<HEADLINE> Despite Appeal, S.C. Man Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A man who killed a woman by suffocating  
her with a plastic bag while stealing her car was executed by 
injection Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Howard, 40 had argued that he was condemned by a jury  
skewed by racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, who was black, was convicted in the 1985 killing of  
Chinh Thi Nguyen Le, 34, after he and another man stopped her to 
steal her car. 
</P>
<P>
	He said only, ``I'm on my way,'' before put to death.  
</P>
<P>
	A co-defendant, Dana Weldon, 39, remains on Death Row.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Howard and Weldon were driving around looking  
for a car to steal one night when they spotted Le driving home from 
work on a secluded road. They used their car to bump her 1978 Ford 
Granada and fake an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The men put a plastic bag over Le's head to keep her quiet but  
suffocated her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, prosecutors dismissed six of seven black potential  
jurors and four of 35 whites at the trial of Howard and Weldon, who 
is also black. When alternates were selected, prosecutors dismissed 
only blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after one of Howard's first appeals was turned down by  
the state Supreme Court in 1989, the court adopted a rule requiring 
the comparison of the ratio of dismissed black jurors to accepted 
whites as part of the appeal process.

<HEADLINE>  Shoving Ends China Rights Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rival Chinese dissident groups exchanged  
shoves and shouts Friday after one group of exiles told a 
congressional panel that conditions have worsened dramatically in 
the seven months since President Clinton's visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before the House International Relations Committee  
demonstrated the fractious nature of the Chinese dissident 
community. Protesters complained that they hadn't been given a 
chance to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance, Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing  
criticized those who testified, insisting that China punishes only 
those who break its laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei Jingsheng, who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons, told the  
committee that there had been ``a constant stream of arrests'' 
since Clinton's visit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not act swiftly, there will soon be more and more  
mothers who have lost their sons, wives who have lost their 
husbands and children who have lost their parents,'' Wei said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other dissidents called on Congress to consider imposing  
economic sanctions on China, 20 years after the two nations 
formally established diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members of both parties seized on the testimony to  
appeal to administration officials to maintain a hard line next 
Tuesday in talks in Washington with China's assistant foreign 
minister, Wang Guangya. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration policy toward China is ``a pathetic  
failure,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee released a recent report by Amnesty International  
concluding that ``while there has been minor, and mostly symbolic, 
progress in a few areas, in most areas the situation has actually 
gotten worse in the last three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not one Tiananmen Square prisoner has been released since  
Clinton's visit, China has taken no steps to undertake a review of 
political prisoners and it continues the use of torture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing ended in melee between rival dissident groups,  
provoked by those who complained they hadn't been given a chance to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee staff members sought to keep shoving and shirt-pulling  
antagonists apart until police were summoned to restore order and 
clear the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The fracas began after shouting in Chinese broke out. Looking  
perplexed, Chairman Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., asked if anyone 
could translate. But without waiting for an answer, he gaveled the 
hearing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman quickly ducked out of the room as the shouting  
intensified and chairs were knocked over. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, in particular, criticized the committee's  
decision to invite Wei and three other former political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are outraged with the placement of the wrong persons on the  
panel,'' said a statement issued by a group of Washington-based 
Chinese dissidents who oppose what they view as Wei's 
self-proclaimed leadership of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Washington leaders of the Chinese Democracy Movement had  
broken with Wei late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Lipson, a spokesman for the committee, said that Gilman  
was not aware of the rivalries among the dissidents or that a 
protest had been planned, and was glad no one was hurt or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at the National Press Club, Ambassador Li scoffed at  
Wei, calling him a criminal who was allowed to come to the United 
States in 1997 for medical treatment and ended up testifying on 
Capitol Hill. Wei spent most of 18 years in Chinese prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``In China, we practice the rule of law,'' Li said. ``If you  
don't violate the criminal code, you don't get arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Li said those who talk most loudly about human rights ``didn't  
say one word about victims of flooding last year and didn't take 
any action at all.'' He said Americans should respect China's 
system as different from that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are differences among people and we have to get used to  
that,'' he said.

                           *William Allyn    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Allyn, a television and movie  
producer whose successful films include ``Cousins'' and ``Rich and 
Famous,'' died Sunday from complications of heart disease. He was 
71. 
</P>
<P>
	Allyn began his career as a stage actor. His first role was as a  
teen-ager on Broadway with Marlon Brando in ``A Flag Is Born.'' He 
also was in ``Ring Around the Moon'' and toured in ``I Am a 
Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allyn then spent many years producing shows for television,  
including about 350 episodes of ``Peyton Place'' and such TV movies 
as ``And No One Could Save Her'' and ``The Last Child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the big screen, Allyn specialized in remakes. His first major  
hit was the 1981 ``Rich and Famous,'' a remake of the 1943 drama 
``Old Acquaintance.'' In 1988, he produced the love story 
``Cousins,'' which reprised the 1975 French film ``Cousin, 
Cousine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently had been working on a remake of the 1937 film  
``Stage Door.'' 

</P>

                 *Emeritus Bartolome Carrasco Briseno    	
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Archbishop Emeritus Bartolome Carrasco  
Briseno, an advocate for the poor in the 17 years he led the Roman 
Catholic archdiocese of Oaxaca, died Thursday of kidney failure. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrasco Briseno, the archbishop of Oaxaca from 1976 to 1993,  
was an advocate of liberation theology, which sees the church's 
mission as lifting people out of oppression and poverty. Oaxaca, in 
the southwest, is one of Mexico's poorest states. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ordained as a priest in 1945. Before becoming archbishop  
of Oaxaca, he served as bishop in the cities of Huejutla and 
Tapachula.

</P>
<P>
	LORAIN, Ohio (AP) -- Jim Mahony, a journalist who spent 63 years  
at The Morning Call and wrote a popular daily lighthearted column, 
died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he started writing ``Mahony's Memos,'' which  
became a custodian of Lorain's memories and folklore. Although he 
retired in 1988, he continued to write his column for 10 more years 
and stopped writing it less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahony was 17 when he started at the paper as a sportswriter the  
day after he graduated from high school in 1935. He became sports 
editor three years later. Eventually, he became city editor, then 
news editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Phyllis; two sons, four daughters,  
13 grandchildren and a sister.

	EASTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Francis W. McGaughey II, owner and editor

<P>
	In addition to publishing the weekly newspaper, McGaughey served  
as a Holbrook selectman for 19 years and was town administrator for 
seven years.

	LONDON (AP) -- Henrietta Moraes, a nude model whose life was  
marked by extreme indulgence that included a brief career as a 
burglar, died Wednesday, according to obituaries published Friday 
in The Times and The Guardian newspapers. She was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Moraes inspired painter Francis Bacon, who painted her more than  
a dozen times, once as a nude pinned to a bed by a hypodermic 
needle, titled ``Lying Girl with Hypodermic Syringe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the publication of her 1994 autobiography,  
``Henrietta,'' she was lionized in the media as a lonely survivor 
of wilder times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some models inspire painters by their looks, others by their  
personality,'' Tim Hilton wrote in The Guardian. ``Henrietta was 
foul-mouthed, amoral, a thief, a violent drunkard and a drug 
addict. Yet she was witty, wonderfully warm and lovable. Her 
presence in any room immediately told you that life is more 
thrilling than we dull folk imagine.''

<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Norman Reyes, a Filipino-American  
radio broadcaster who was the voice of the resistance on Bataan 
peninsula during one of bloodiest battles of World War II, died 
Thursday from complications of a stroke. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes was one of two men who operated a guerrilla radio station  
in Bataan, west of Manila, to rally Filipino and American defenders 
of the peninsula against Japanese invaders. His voice was heard by 
Filipinos and American soldiers that announced the fall of Bataan 
on April 9, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines, then a U.S. colony, was among the first targets  
of Japanese invasion after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Overwhelmed 
by the onslaught, American commanders in the Manila area decided to 
retreat to Bataan, believing that U.S. reinforcements would soon 
land on its shores. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. fleet never came, and the peninsula instead turned  
into a trap from which the starving American and Filipino troops 
could not escape. 
</P>
<P>
	After their surrender on Bataan, about 70,000 U.S. and Filipino  
prisoners of war were forced by Japanese soldiers to make the 
nearly 100-mile ``Death March'' to a prison camp in Capas. Only 
about 54,000 made it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes was captured and taken to Tokyo, where he worked with the  
infamous ``Tokyo Rose,'' doing propaganda broadcasts at Radio 
Tokyo. He was tried in the United States on suspicion of being a 
Japanese spy, but was later cleared of the charges.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Harold E. Scott, who from 1979 to 1989 served  
as executive presbyter of the Pittsburgh Presbytery, died Wednesday 
of cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure as presbyter, Scott presided over what was  
then the country's largest presbytery, which had nearly 200 
churches and about 93,000 members. An organizer and consensus 
builder, he was pivotal in reorganizing the presbytery's mission 
focus and committee structure. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a pastor for 12 years, serving in Richmond, Kan., Des  
Moines, Iowa, and Santa Ana, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo Declines NY Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the  
eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, said Friday he will not run 
for the Senate seat being given up next year by fellow Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Cuomo plans to remain at the Department of Housing  
and Urban Development and help Vice President Al Gore run for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo, 41, said that as much as he would like to occupy the  
Senate seat once held by ``one of my heroes'' -- his wife's father, 
Robert F. Kennedy -- ``I believe I should complete my current job 
before seeking a new one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo's decision is certain to increase interest in whether  
Hillary Rodham Clinton might run for the New York Senate seat. She 
has not ruled out such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is eyeing the race from the  
Republican side. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton is one of 
several Democrats considering a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Democratic Party Chairman John Marino, a top Cuomo  
political adviser, said Cuomo's decision was not related to the 
first lady's possible interest in the seat. Marino said Cuomo had 
not been pressured by Clinton forces to stay out of the race for 
Mrs. Clinton's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, New York magazine, in an article prepared for  
publication Monday, reported that President Clinton did urge Cuomo 
in a recent conversation to remain at HUD and help Gore's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	Mario Cuomo said he was disappointed by his son's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'd make a great candidate,'' the former governor said.  
``Listen, his education is the best you could have, watching me 
make mistakes for 12 years. If he is not the best-prepared 
candidate in America, I don't know who is.''

<HEADLINE> Mother Get 50 Years Jail for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A mother sentenced Friday to 50 years in  
prison for strangling her six children repeated her belief that she 
killed them out of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Khoua Her, 24, recounted her troubled life in a two-hour court  
statement. The Laotian-born Hmong woman was forced to marry and 
became pregnant at age 12, and by 19 she had six children. 
</P>
<P>
	``She expressed her continued thought that in fact this was an  
act of love, that she intended to kill herself and did not want 
these children to be alone,'' prosecutor Susan Gaertner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her said the children, ages 5 to 11, were playing outside Sept.  
3 when she called them into the house one by one and tied a piece 
of black cloth around their necks. Police found her lying 
semiconscious with an extension cord wrapped around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Her's guilty plea to six counts of second-degree murder avoided  
a first-degree murder charge that could have resulted in an 
automatic life sentence and little chance of parole.

<HEADLINE> Cohen To Depart for Asian Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen departs Sunday  
for a weeklong visit to Japan and South Korea, where he will visit 
U.S. forces and meet with local military and political leaders, a 
Pentagon official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's visit makes up for one canceled in early November  
because of problems with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this trip as an important one and as an enduring  
signal of our commitment to maintain peace and stability'' in the 
region, said a senior Pentagon official, who briefed reporters on 
the visit on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, Cohen will discuss sharing of research on theater  
missile defenses ``as well as steps that the United States can take 
to support Japan's interests in acquiring satellites,'' the 
official said. The satellites could be used for surveillance in 
light of North Korea's recent missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, North Korea tested a missile that crossed Japanese  
airspace, heightening concerns in the region about Pyongyang's 
military ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that the missile shot across Japanese territory  
raised very real concerns, and I think that's probably at the top 
of Secretary Cohen's list,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, discussions also will touch on concerns that North  
Korea may be restarting its nuclear weapons program, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the United States and North Korea will resume  
talks later next week in Geneva about the underground site that 
some U.S. officials believe is being used to develop nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	During his stops in Japan and Korea, Cohen is also slated to  
visit several bases where U.S. military forces are stationed, the 
official said. The secretary returns to Washington on Jan. 16.

<HEADLINE> Former Lewinsky Boyfriend Divorcing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Andrew Bleiler, who had a five-year affair  
with Monica Lewinsky, is separated from his wife, Kathlyn, and the 
couple plans to divorce, a relative said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this whole year has played a terrible toll on them,  
and they're truly a casualty of the Monica Lewinsky scandal,'' said 
Michael Nason, a Southern California public relations adviser who 
is an uncle of Bleiler's wife, Kathlyn. He spoke to The Oregonian, 
which reported on the split Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bleilers revealed last January that Bleiler and Ms. Lewinsky  
had an affair. The two met when she was a student at Beverly Hills 
High School in California and Bleiler worked in the drama 
department as a stage technician. He said they began an affair in 
1992, the year after she graduated from another high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to the Portland area after Ms. Lewinsky became a  
student at Lewis &AMP; Clark College. Ms. Lewinsky became friends with 
Ms. Bleiler and occasionally baby-sat for the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky told investigators for Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr that she once forged a letter on Lewis &AMP; Clark stationery 
suggesting that Bleiler had job prospects in the school's theater 
department, to give him an excuse to come to Oregon and continue 
their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The affair continued after Ms. Lewinsky left for Washington in  
1995. Bleiler's lawyer, Terry Giles, said Ms. Lewinsky told the 
Bleilers when she left for her Washington internship in June 1995: 
``I'm going to the White House to get my presidential knee pads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She later told them she was having oral sex with a high-ranking  
White House official but was frustrated the relationship did not go 
further, Giles said. The affair with Bleiler ended in 1996, after 
his wife found out about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bleilers have an unlisted phone number and could not be  
reached for comment.

<HEADLINE>  Georgetown Coach Thompson Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During his early games at Georgetown, John  
Thompson was showered with racist taunts because he recruited a 
majority-black roster for the overwhelmingly white school. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, on the same McDonough Gymnasium floor, Thompson was  
lauded as the man who put the school's basketball program on the 
national map -- while still maintaining the integrity of a proud 
academic institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who resigned as coach for personal reasons, leaves a  
legacy of success achieved with a style that met controversy 
head-on. He always stood up for his race -- most dramatically so 
when he boycotted two games in protest of NCAA Proposition 42 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``What am I most proud of?'' Thompson said. ``Probably when  
somebody walked up to me and told me I wore my blackness well. I 
thought that was the greatest compliment I've ever received in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those who know him best are quick to point out that  
Thompson's pride should not be mistaken for racism. Instead, he is 
a loyalist, faithful to those who have stood by him and quick to 
return the favor. His successor, Craig Esherick, who happens to be 
white, has been by Thompson's side as an assistant since 1982. He 
was to make his head coaching debut at home today against 
Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is not happy,'' said Esherick, who spent three days  
trying unsuccessfully to talk his boss out of quitting. ``I'm not 
happy for myself, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I 
consider it an honor, and I also consider myself a complete fool to 
follow in his footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 57, emphasized he wasn't leaving to seek an NBA job or  
because this year's Hoyas (7-6, 0-4 Big East) could be Georgetown's 
worst team since the 1970s. The reasons, he said, were purely 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going through a problem with marriage right now,''  
Thompson said. ``And I owe it to my family to address that, not 
just to myself and to my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't deal with that as a distraction.''  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and his wife, Gwen, who have been married for 32 years,  
separated after a fire damaged their home three years ago. Thompson 
filed for divorce in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's wife said she was ``saddened that John felt it  
necessary to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am also saddened to hear that this process is taking such a  
toll on him,'' she said in a statement released by her lawyer. 
``But John filed for the divorce, not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case remains open as negotiations to resolve it continue,  
said her lawyer, Deborah Luxenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will stay at Georgetown, although he doesn't yet have a  
new title or any specific duties. He refused to say he would never 
coach again. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Thompson's former stars, including Patrick Ewing, Alonzo  
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, attended the news conference in the 
gym, a small facility almost overwhelmed by all the banners the 
team has earned over Thompson's 27 years. The biggest one 
commemorates the 1984 national championship win over Houston, one 
of three Final Four appearances in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's Georgetown years can be split in two parts: pre-Seoul  
and post-Seoul. He led the U.S. team to a disappointing bronze 
medal finish at the 1988 Olympics, and he hasn't been back to the 
Final Four with the Hoyas since. In the 1990s, more players began 
to leave Georgetown before graduating, and several have been in 
trouble with the police, tarnishing the program's lofty image. 
</P>
<P>
	While those who stayed four years under Thompson almost always  
graduated -- a rarity in big-time college sports -- the Hoyas now 
have the lowest overall graduation rate for men's basketball 
players among D.C.-area Division I schools, according to the latest 
NCAA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson, who cried after telling his players the news of  
his departure Friday morning, maintains that the game hasn't passed 
him by -- and it's definitely not why he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been afraid of the challenges of young people  
today,'' Thompson said. ``In fact, that has always stimulated me. 
... This is not something that was planned. This is not something 
that was plotted. It has nothing to do with our record. It's 
personal.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Sued Over Education Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida is violating the constitutional rights of  
many of its public school students by failing to provide adequate 
education, according to a lawsuit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Appleseed Center for Law and Justice filed the  
lawsuit in circuit court Monday on behalf of 1.4 million children. 
The schools named in the suit are in a cross-section of rural and 
urban counties that have a large percentage of poor or minority 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``This includes the poor, not just black children,'' said John  
Due, deputy general counsel for the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, a plaintiff. ``We're talking about 
poor white children. We're talking about children in the inner city 
regardless of their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the illiteracy rate at the schools range from  
25 percent to 75 percent, and those students lack the skills to 
hold a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't be required to go to a school where 70 percent  
of those kids are failing,'' plaintiffs attorney John Ratliff said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys said they are seeking an improvement in educational  
outcome, not a specific amount of money, although the amount of 
education funding likely will be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar lawsuits have been filed and are at various stages of  
litigation in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Alabama, North 
Carolina, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio and Vermont, the 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush's office is declining comment until its legal team  
has finished reviewing the suit, spokesman Cory Tilley said.

	Clinton Touting Economic Success  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton traded Washington's storms for  
Midwest snow today to celebrate the roaring economy during his 
now-imperiled administration. ``Most things are going right for our 
country,'' he said. Reveling in new economic data marking a 41-year 
low in the unemployment rate and ``the longest peacetime expansion 
in history,'' Clinton addressed a luncheon of the Detroit Economic 
Club. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Threatens Japan Over Steel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signaled he was ready  
to take more drastic action to curb a flood of imported steel. He 
singled out Japan, which has accounted for almost half the import 
surge, warning that unless those shipments begin dropping 
dramatically, his administration would begin action to impose stiff 
penalty tariffs on Japanese steel. 

</P>
<P>
	Senators Agree on Impeachment Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats reached a general  
agreement today covering ground rules for President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. Lawmakers on both sides said it included the 
possibility of testimony by witnesses. The details had not yet been 
drafted, senators said, and they cautioned that no final accord had 
been sealed. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that under the 
emerging plan the trial would begin next week with opening 
presentations.

	U.S. Backs Iraq Eavesdropping  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American intelligence experts, working with  
the U.N. weapons commission, eavesdropped electronically on the 
Iraqi government's communications network, gaining valuable 
information on the movement of concealed weapons material and 
documents, a senior U.S. official said today. Meanwhile, Henry 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. and 
British missile attacks on Iraq last month may have killed 600 to 
1,600 members of President Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard.

<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African police fired at a  
handful of Muslim protesters today, minutes before British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair arrived for a scheduled event, witnesses said. 
One journalist was wounded. Blair was not hurt and proceeded with 
the event in downtown Cape Town -- the awarding of medals to British 
soldiers who are assisting the South African military.

	Probe Faults U.S. Embassy Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An official panel that investigated the U.S.  
embassy bombings in Africa says a ``collective failure'' by 
administrations and congresses over the years has left U.S. 
diplomatic missions vulnerable. The panel, known as the 
Accountability Review Board, also accused the State Department and 
other agencies of giving low priority to embassy security. The 
board was convened after the near simultaneous bombings at U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. Twelve Americans were 
among the 224 people killed in the bombings. 

</P>
<P>
	One Dead at Georgia High School  
</P>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- One student was shot to death and a boy  
she had been dating was seriously wounded at a high school this 
morning, possibly in a double suicide attempt. The shootings, which 
were not seen by any other students, took place in a girls' 
bathroom at Central High School. Andrea Garrett, 15, died at Tanner 
Medical Center. Jeff Miller, 17, was airlifted to Crawford Long 
Hospital in Atlanta, about 40 miles to the east.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow industrials were  
up 20.60 to 9,558.36. NYSE decliners led advancers 1,612-1,343. The 
Nasdaq was 3.90 to 2,322.19.

	Holmgren Named Seahawks Coach  
</P>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks named Mike Holmgren  
coach and executive vice president today. They hope the man who led 
the Green Bay Packers to two consecutive Super Bowls would turn 
around a football team that hasn't had a winning season in eight 
years and has missed the playoffs for 10 straight years.

	Olympic Officials Quit in Scandal  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The two top officials of the Salt Lake  
City Olympic committee resigned today and two others were placed on 
paid leave in a dramatic housecleaning amid a bribery scandal. 
Frank Joklik, president of the city's Olympic organizing committee, 
resigned but will stay on until a successor is hired. He asked for 
and received the resignation of senior vice president Dave Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An abortion doctor testified Friday that  
feared for her life when she was named as one of ``The Deadly 
Dozen'' on anti-abortion fliers made out to look like wanted 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Elizabeth Newhall, one of a group of doctors accusing the  
site called the Nuremberg Files of being an invitation to murder, 
became even more worried when a Web site listing her among hundreds 
of ``baby butchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of slain abortion doctors listed on the site were  
crossed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It escalated the risk enormously,'' Newhall told an  
eight-member federal jury Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were saying to me that if I didn't stop doing abortions,  
my life was at risk,'' she said. ``Suddenly, I feel real visible to 
individuals who might not be quite balanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newhall, who performs up to 20 abortions a week at her Portland  
clinic, was the first witness in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit 
accusing The Nuremberg Files Web site of being nothing more than an 
invitation to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The site records the names of hundreds of doctors who perform  
abortions, and catalogs such personal information as addresses, 
license numbers and even the names of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	It drew attention in October, when the name of Dr. Barnett  
Slepian was crossed off the list shortly after he was killed at his 
suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	After Newhall's name appeared, she said she began wearing a  
bulletproof vest in public and carrying wigs with her to change her 
appearance. She also installed steel doors and bulletproof glass at 
her clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorneys are attempting to link anti-abortion  
posters, statements and books to the Web site as part of a wider 
intimidation and killing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Videos of defendant Andrew Burnett, a Portland-area  
anti-abortion activist, were played for the jury in which he called 
abortion doctors ``paid contract serial killers'' and said killing 
them was justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of doctors and Planned Parenthood are plaintiffs in the  
suit, which claims the Nuremberg Files site violates a federal law 
that bars activists from inciting violence against abortion doctors 
and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants, including the anti-abortion umbrella group American  
Coalition of Life Advocates, maintain the site and the fliers are 
constitutionally protected political speech.

	During cross-examination, attorneys for the defendants  
emphasized that the materials never made any explicit threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Newhall: ``The poster itself is a threat.''

<HEADLINE>  Georgetown Coach Thompson Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During his early games at Georgetown, John  
Thompson was showered with racist taunts because he recruited a 
majority-black roster for the overwhelmingly white school. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, on the same McDonough Gymnasium floor, Thompson was  
lauded as the man who put the school's basketball program on the 
national map -- while still maintaining the integrity of a proud 
academic institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who resigned as coach for personal reasons, leaves a  
legacy of success achieved with a style that met controversy 
head-on. He always stood up for his race -- most dramatically so 
when he boycotted two games in protest of NCAA Proposition 42 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``What am I most proud of?'' Thompson said. ``Probably when  
somebody walked up to me and told me I wore my blackness well. I 
thought that was the greatest compliment I've ever received in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those who know him best are quick to point out that  
Thompson's pride should not be mistaken for racism. Instead, he is 
a loyalist, faithful to those who have stood by him and quick to 
return the favor. His successor, Craig Esherick, who happens to be 
white, has been by Thompson's side as an assistant since 1982. He 
was to make his head coaching debut at home today against 
Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is not happy,'' said Esherick, who spent three days  
trying unsuccessfully to talk his boss out of quitting. ``I'm not 
happy for myself, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I 
consider it an honor, and I also consider myself a complete fool to 
follow in his footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 57, emphasized he wasn't leaving to seek an NBA job or  
because this year's Hoyas (7-6, 0-4 Big East) could be Georgetown's 
worst team since the 1970s. The reasons, he said, were purely 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going through a problem with marriage right now,''  
Thompson said. ``And I owe it to my family to address that, not 
just to myself and to my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't deal with that as a distraction.''  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and his wife, Gwen, who have been married for 32 years,  
separated after a fire damaged their home three years ago. Thompson 
filed for divorce in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's wife said she was ``saddened that John felt it  
necessary to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am also saddened to hear that this process is taking such a  
toll on him,'' she said in a statement released by her lawyer. 
``But John filed for the divorce, not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case remains open as negotiations to resolve it continue,  
said her lawyer, Deborah Luxenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will stay at Georgetown, although he doesn't yet have a  
new title or any specific duties. He refused to say he would never 
coach again. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Thompson's former stars, including Patrick Ewing, Alonzo  
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, attended the news conference in the 
gym, a small facility almost overwhelmed by all the banners the 
team has earned over Thompson's 27 years. The biggest one 
commemorates the 1984 national championship win over Houston, one 
of three Final Four appearances in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's Georgetown years can be split in two parts: pre-Seoul  
and post-Seoul. He led the U.S. team to a disappointing bronze 
medal finish at the 1988 Olympics, and he hasn't been back to the 
Final Four with the Hoyas since. In the 1990s, more players began 
to leave Georgetown before graduating, and several have been in 
trouble with the police, tarnishing the program's lofty image. 
</P>
<P>
	While those who stayed four years under Thompson almost always  
graduated -- a rarity in big-time college sports -- the Hoyas now 
have the lowest overall graduation rate for men's basketball 
players among D.C.-area Division I schools, according to the latest 
NCAA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson, who cried after telling his players the news of  
his departure Friday morning, maintains that the game hasn't passed 
him by -- and it's definitely not why he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been afraid of the challenges of young people  
today,'' Thompson said. ``In fact, that has always stimulated me. 
... This is not something that was planned. This is not something 
that was plotted. It has nothing to do with our record. It's 
personal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man stole a car waiting to pick up Virginia's  
governor and died Friday when he drove straight into a 
tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they believe the man purposely rammed the 1999  
Lincoln Continental into the oncoming truck while speeding the 
wrong way on a highway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks suicidal to me,'' said Las Vegas Police Lt. Wayne  
Petersen. ``He made no attempt to avoid an accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man, who was not immediately identified, was fired at twice  
by a Virginia state trooper late Thursday night as he jumped into 
the rented car. The car was idling outside an air terminal waiting 
to pick up Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
	The trooper said he fired when the man drove right at him.  
</P>
<P>
	He was not seen again until shortly after 11 a.m. Friday when  
the car was spotted by police in the nearby town of Blue Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	With police in pursuit, the vehicle turned onto Interstate 15 on  
the southern outskirts of Las Vegas and headed south in the 
northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The car sped about four miles, narrowly missing other vehicles,  
before hitting a pickup truck and then smashing into a 
tractor-trailer hauling cars, according to police.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow eclipsed the 9,600 mark for the first  
time today before trimming its gains, but were still in positive 
territory in late afternoon. Other stock indexes slipped into 
negative territory after rising to records on a rally in technology 
and blue-chip shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 20.86 at 9,558.62, beating Wednesday's closing record of 
9,544.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes turned lower. The Nasdaq composite was down  
5.73 to 2.320.36. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was down 5.57 
at 1,264.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, up 6 1/4 83 1/2, led the Dow higher after reporting  
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. Other big Dow 
gainers included AT&AMP;T, up 3 3/8 at 85 5/8, and General Motors, up 2 
15/16, at 80 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Hog Producers To Get $50 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers trying to cope with the lowest hog  
prices in four decades will get $50 million in government payments, 
the latest in a series of steps the Clinton administration has 
taken to shore up the ailing pork industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore announced the subsidies during a trip  
Friday to Iowa, whose caucuses kick off the 2000 presidential 
nominating season. Iowa is the nation's biggest hog producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are encouraged by the recent strengthening in hog  
prices, additional aid is needed to help family farms that produce 
hogs meet their living and operating expenses,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the money might help, but only a little. The  
payments would average less than $600 a producer if they were 
spread equally among the 85,000 farms that derive most of their 
income from hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's plan to shift dollars around sadly  
amounts to only a drop in the bucket,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, 
R-Texas, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the payments have not been worked out, and  
Agriculture Department officials said they could not say yet where 
the money would come from. Hogs and other livestock normally are 
not subsidized by the government. There are 100 million hogs 
marketed nationwide each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in agriculture is going to turn down free money, but  
$50 million is a relatively small number in relation to the kind of 
losses that are being experienced in the hog sector,'' said Ford 
Runge, a University of Minnesota economist who is advising 
potential Gore rival Bill Bradley on farm issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Donna Reifschneider, president of the National Pork  
Producers Council, said it was the most the administration could do 
``within its discretionary powers, which should be a signal to 
Congress that immediate action is desperately needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an additional move, the Agriculture Department will make an  
emergency transfer of $80 million into a special fund used to buy 
animals infested with the swine disease pseudorabies. That would 
take up to 1.7 million hogs out of the production cycle and should 
help increase prices, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, 632 herds totaling 479,000 hogs are infested.  
</P>
<P>
	Hog prices have fallen as low as $8 to $10 a hundredweight in  
recent weeks, down from $46.50 a year ago. Prices are expected to 
improve by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House recently assigned a task force to comb the  
federal government for programs that could be used to assist the 
farmers. The government has been stepping up purchases of pork for 
nutrition programs and offered to extend loan payments for strapped 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers have asked for a series of measures, including an  
airlift of hogs to hurricane-damaged parts of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is running for president in 2000, has announced many  
of the government's initiatives, which have been trickling out on a 
weekly basis over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is viewed skeptically by some farmers because of his  
advocacy for environmental causes.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Quit in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The two top officials of the Salt Lake  
City Olympic committee resigned today amid a bribery scandal, the 
International Olympic Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a release from its Swiss headquarters, the IOC said it had  
``learned with regret'' that Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
president Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson had stepped 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	It said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch had spoken about  
the matter today with Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC wishes to reiterate that it has full confidence in the  
organizers of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and has no doubt as to 
their ability to ensure the total success of these games,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Samaranch promised Leavitt he would visit Salt Lake City  
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations were expected to be announced in Salt Lake,  
where the boards of the organizing committee and the U.S. Olympic 
Committee were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of ``lower-ranked employees'' of the SLOC will be  
placed on administrative leave, Olympic sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and Johnson were involved in Salt Lake's successful bid  
to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. That effort has become the target 
of four investigations into hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
went into scholarships and gifts for International Olympic 
Committee members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings follow Leavitt's call earlier this week for SLOC  
staffers embroiled in the gifts investigations to take leaves of 
absence. Leavitt did not identify specific staffers in his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune and KTVX-TV reported earlier today that  
Joklik and Johnson were expected to leave their organizing 
committee jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Associated Press has learned that three months after the  
IOC awarded Salt Lake the Winter Games, an IOC member bought three 
luxury-home sites about 20 miles from the Olympic downhill course. 
The member earned $60,000 on the land deal that was arranged 
through a member of the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times quoted unidentified investigators as saying  
Salt Lake Olympic officials made individual cash payments ranging 
from $5,000 to $70,000 to IOC members from Africa and Latin 
America. It said investigators still were trying to determine the 
number of payments, the amounts and the recipients, and that some 
of the payments may have been legitimate reimbursement for 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former USOC member Howard Peterson told USA Today that Salt  
Lake's gift-giving began in the 1980s in the competition with 
Anchorage, Alaska; Reno-Tahoe, Nev.; and Denver to become the U.S. 
bidder for the 1998 Winter Games. Peterson, a member of the 1989 
USOC site selection committee, said at least three USOC board 
members received expense-paid trips to the area, visits he called 
``ski vacations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Tribune reported that at least three relatives of IOC  
members were hired by Salt Lake companies during the bid, with the 
bid committee largely paying the salary of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Olympics sponsor US West announced it has decided to withhold a  
$5 million payment to SLOC until it answers questions about the 
scandal. The phone company demanded an explanation last month and 
sought assurances there will be no more surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Pound, the International Olympic Committee vice president  
who is heading that organization's inquiry into the scandal, said 
it has the bulk of the evidence it needs, and he is confident the 
panel could complete its investigation by the Jan. 23-24 target 
date. ``I'm quite pleased with what (SLOC officials have) given us 
and with the level of cooperation,'' he said from Montreal. Pound's 
committee will focus on wrongdoing by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound spent two days in Salt Lake City late last month  
interviewing officials and reviewing documents connected with the 
Utah capital's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the land deal, The Associated Press learned that  
Jean-Claude Ganga's purchase and sale of three residential lots 
were being investigated by the SLOC's ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, from the Republic of Congo, bought the three luxury home  
parcels in Pleasant View in September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was introduced to the seller, a home builder, by Bennie  
Smith, a bid committee and SLOC member who spent eight years wooing 
African IOC members whose votes were considered crucial for Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics panel is trying to determine the source of the  
cash for Ganga's investment, but lacks subpoena power necessary to 
obtain bank records, a source close to the investigation said 
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Ganga in Paris, Brazzaville and Cameroon were  
unsuccessful. Smith did not return telephone messages left at his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has been identified as one of three African IOC members  
who received free medical care from Salt Lake-based Intermountain 
Health Care. He reportedly was treated for hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Brent Keller, a Weber County home builder, said that Smith  
was helping Ganga look for promising land investments when the two 
first visited Pleasant View in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga bought three half-acre, undeveloped lots on the hillside  
overlooking Ogden and the Great Salt Lake for $25,000 each. Keller 
then built a road to the lots, put in utilities and a storm basin, 
and Ganga sold the lots for $45,000 each, one in 1997 and the other 
two in August, for a profit of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically played bank for me,'' Keller said. Without  
Ganga's purchase at essentially a wholesale price, Keller didn't 
have the cash to improve the lots for eventual sale to home buyers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said Ganga wrote a check when he bought the land in 1995,  
and as far as Keller knows, he used his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said that after Ganga bought the land, Smith was no  
longer involved.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Takes Back Seat to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Scott Hanson twirled his cap and eyed the  
tiny television in the corner of the mechanic's office as the chief 
justice of the United States walked into the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	He could hardly believe what he was seeing -- and then he changed  
the channel to ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gotta get the latest on that NBA thing, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's not that people in Fargo don't care about the nation's  
first impeachment trial since 1868. But as Hanson put it, whatever 
happens to President Clinton won't change life for most Americans. 
The bills will still be there -- and in Fargo, it will still be 
bitter cold in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've still got a truck that's frozen,'' said Hanson, a  
construction worker and divorced father of two. ``And I still gotta 
pay to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This city of 74,000 at the moment looks like it's portrayed in  
the black comedy film ``Fargo'': It's snowy and highs today aren't 
forecast to get out of the single digits. And as far as impeachment 
goes, well, Washington is nearly 1,400 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Sears, Roebuck and Co. store, all but one of the more than  
35 televisions in the electronics department were tuned to 
something other than the impeachment proceedings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, we'd have it on the big screens,'' said salesman Chad  
Charon. ``But we're watching `Armageddon.' We just got it in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan and Carrie Berglind, who were in Sears exchanging Christmas  
presents with their 3-week-old daughter, showed little interest in 
the historic proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been building it up for months,'' Berglind said. ``And  
I don't think anyone expects he'll get removed. So what's the 
point?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a fire house near Fargo's largest shopping mall, the four  
firefighters on duty avoided the impeachment subject, keeping busy 
instead doing chores and studying for exams. 
</P>
<P>
	The television in the break room was on briefly over the noon  
hour, said Lt. Dean Meyer, but no one in the firehouse seemed 
interested in impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone on for so long and long,'' he said. ``It just  
doesn't captivate me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a soap opera on television,'' added Lt. Erv Wolff.  
``It goes on and on for weeks and nothing ever really happens.''

<HEADLINE> Cendant Settles Class-Action Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Cendant Corp. has settled one of two  
class-action lawsuits brought by investors after the company's 
revelations of widespread accounting fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchiser of Ramada and Howard Johnson hotels, Century 21  
real estate and Avis car rentals agreed Thursday to raise the value 
by $350 million of a special class of securities Cendant issued two 
months before the accounting fraud was disclosed. The type of 
security, called Prides, obligates the investor to purchase common 
shares at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
	The company offered $1.5 billion of Prides in 1998. The holders  
of the securities currently have to pay $37 to $48 a share for 
Cendant common stock, twice its current market value. 
</P>
<P>
	The new securities will be valued at $11.71 above the original  
ones, under the settlement, which needs approval of a federal judge 
in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant said it will take an after-tax charge of $220 million,  
or 26 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the fourth quarter to 
pay for the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company still faces a large class-action lawsuit by  
individuals and institutions that held Cendant common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant was formed in December 1997 from the merger of  
Parsippany-based franchiser HFS Inc. and Stamford, Conn.-based CUC 
International Inc., which runs shopping and other membership clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the company announced it had found major accounting  
fraud at the former CUC unit, and restated its earnings for the 
past three years. The disclosures of fraud, which added up to about 
$500 million in bogus revenues, led to the dismissals and 
resignations of several CUC officials and slashed Cendant's market 
value by up to 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Probe Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A Cambodian prosecutor has opened an  
investigation to determine whether the top leaders of the brutal 
Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement should face trial, the justice 
minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation announced by Justice Minister Uk Vithun is  
separate from a U.N. effort to try Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide 
in either an international or Cambodian court. 
</P>
<P>
	Uk Vithun said he had ordered appeals court prosecutors to begin  
a review of a 1979 conviction of late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot 
and his deputy, Ieng Sary. Pol Pot died last year and Ieng Sary 
defected to the government in return for a pardon in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The order marks the first step taken by Hun Sen's government to  
convene a trial against architects of the Cambodian genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look at this first before we can answer what the  
ministry can do next,'' Uk Vithun said after a meeting of Prime 
Minister Hun Sen's cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pol Pot's Maoist-inspired regime between 1975 and 1979 forced  
Cambodians into slave labor camps and caused the deaths of one 
person in five from overwork, starvation, disease and executions. 
At least 2 million people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressured to bring recent Khmer Rouge defectors Nuon Chea and  
Khieu Samphan to trial, Hun Sen reversed his stance last week and 
came out in favor of a trial for the men -- the top architects of 
the movement's genocidal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Sen is Cambodia's most powerful politician and the court  
system, which is in shambles, is easily influenced. Many people 
believe that a Cambodian trial, unsupervised by the international 
community, would fail to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear what a review of Pol Pot's and Ieng Sary's  
conviction would accomplish, other than buy time for Hun Sen to 
appease critics who are calling for someone to finally be held 
accountable for the Khmer Rouge reign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Vietnam invaded and ousted the Khmer Rouge from  
power 20 years ago, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary were sentenced to death 
in a show trial organized by the new, Hanoi-installed government. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1979 trial did not cover Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, two of  
Pol Pot's inner circle. They are staying at a former rebel 
stronghold, Pailin, nominally under government control but in fact 
run by Ieng Sary. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Khmer Rouge officials in recent days have threatened that  
attempts to violate the deal and bring the pair before a tribunal 
could rekindle civil war.

<HEADLINE> Six Hurt in Another N.J. Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- A Greyhound bus crashed into a  
concrete median on the New Jersey Turnpike on Friday, injuring six 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries were serious, said State Police spokesman  
John Hagerty. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the fifth bus crash on a major New Jersey  
highway in little more than two weeks. Eight people died and 14 
were hurt in a Christmas Eve crash on the Garden State Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, carrying 27 passengers, was traveling north on the  
Turnpike when the driver lost control and slid into the concrete 
divider, Hagerty said. No other vehicles were involved, and the 
driver was issued a ticket for speeding and careless driving on the 
snow-covered road.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Europe, Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against European currencies  
Friday, but continued to struggle against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar rose against the euro and the Swiss  
franc on reports of continued strength in the U.S. economy and a 
surging U.S. stock market. The dollar suffered in thin trading 
against the yen, continuing a month-long slide against the Japanese 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading picked up midmorning after the government announced  
strong U.S. job growth and a decline in unemployment, then tapered 
off in the afternoon, as snowfall hastened the usual Friday early 
exit. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 106 points to a 
close at a record 9,643. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar bought 110.93 Japanese yen,  
down from 111.04 yen late Thursday. The dollar was trading at 124 
at the start of December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend is strongly downward for the dollar against the yen.  
That has a lot of people afraid to buy the dollar,'' said Kevin 
Harris, international economist at MCM CurrencyWatch in New York. 
``At the same time, all the news suggests the dollar should be the 
stronger currency, so people are reluctant to sell, so it's just 
going sideways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1554, down from $1.1670.  
</P>
<P>
	``The general tone now is there's a window where the euro rate  
is soft and the dollar rates are going to stay where they are, so 
there's a shift on the outlook ... which favors the dollar right 
now against Europe,'' said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange 
at Republic National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6929 German 
marks, up from 1.6756 late Thursday; 1.3913 Swiss francs, up from 
1.3753; 5.6766 French francs, up from 5.6211; 1,675.04 Italian 
lire, up from 1,658.37. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound, which is not part of the euro, slipped to  
$1.6447 from $1.6513. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5126 Canadian dollars, down  
slightly from 1.5129.

<HEADLINE> Wintry Mix Wreaks Havoc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	More than 100 tractor-trailers got stranded today in western  
Kentucky, and schools were closed in several states as much of the 
nation's eastern half was pelted with a wintry mix of snow, sleet 
and freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people died in traffic accidents on icy roads on Oklahoma.  
A cattle truck overturned on Interstate 40 east of Oklahoma City, 
forcing a tricky roundup as the cattle divided into two herds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty hectic out here,'' said Connie Tillery, a manager  
at Bruce's OKC I-40 Travel Plaza in Choctaw, just east of Oklahoma 
City -- where plenty of truckers had parked their rigs to wait out 
the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Many areas were getting their third snowfall in less than a  
week, including last weekend's monster storm that paralyzed parts 
of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 5 inches of snow fell in parts of Ohio overnight, coating  
highways that were just cleared. Authorities urged residents to 
stay home if they could. 
</P>
<P>
	Vehicles slid off glazed roadways, according to Kentucky State  
Police, and parts of several highways were closed. Many of the 
100-plus 18-wheelers jackknifed and remained across driving lanes 
during the early morning hours, Deputy William Whobrey said. ``Some 
just didn't want to try it on the ice and pulled over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann DeMarco said she's ready for her 9- and 11-year-old sons to  
go back to Pikeville Elementary School in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been getting bored and driving me nuts,'' she said  
after classes were canceled Thursday and today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of traffic accidents were blamed on a thin coating of ice  
that glazed bridges and overpasses in northern Arkansas, and dense 
fog hindered travelers in southern Arkansas. Nearly 100 schools or 
school districts closed their doors. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm system developed over the Ohio Valley and pushed into  
the Northeast and New England today. Accumulations of 3 to 8 inches 
were possible from southern Wisconsin to Vermont and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south of the snow, a large area of freezing rain and  
sleet was expected to hit from southern Illinois, along the Ohio 
River and into the central Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	With snow expected to continue into Saturday too, people  
prepared for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware stores in Cincinnati and Cleveland reported heavy sales  
of salt, snow shovels and other winter items, and people were 
stocking up on groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to sell out as soon as we restock, and you don't have  
time to catch your breath. It's continual catch-up,'' said Steve 
Jagers, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based Kroger supermarket 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, a slippery mix of sleet and freezing rain, along  
with a few areas of heavy snow, caused traffic accidents and school 
closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's about 4 1/2 inches of snow already,'' Chris Stewart, a  
cook at High's Restaurant in Monterey, Va., said about two hours 
after daybreak. ``It's snowing hard, man, and the wind is whipping 
it around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took forecaster Larry Dattilo of the weather service's office  
in Louisville to offer some measure of optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Summer is only 5 1/2 months away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Funallover Wins at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Just as she did a year ago, Funallover  
rallied from far off the pace to win Friday's $112,500 Survive 
Stakes by one-half length at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Funallover, who paid $70 when she won the Survive last year,  
returned $9.40, $4.60 and $4.20. Ridden by Alex Solis, the 
5-year-old gray covered 5 1/2 furlongs in 1:03 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Funallover won by a neck under Rene Douglas.  
</P>
<P>
	This time, she raced in eighth early and was 12 lengths behind  
the leader when the field turned for home. She went widest of all 
horses through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Loveontheroad returned $5.20 and $4.80 and Iza Bon Bon was  
another neck back in third and paid $4.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $67,500, increased Funallover's career  
earnings to $280,024, with eight victories in 19 starts.

<HEADLINE> U S West Withholds Olympic Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Some $50 million in cash and services U S West  
Communications has pledged for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt 
Lake City is jeopardized by allegations of bribery, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver-based communications company said it was withholding  
a scheduled payment of $5 million for the Salt Lake City effort 
before the end of January because of the problems that have been 
uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Two top officials of the Salt Lake City Olympic committee  
resigned Friday, acknowledging that cash payments, in one case 
$70,000, were made to members of the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Frandsen, a spokesman for U S West in Salt Lake City,  
said the company wouldn't elaborate on its concerns at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is so volatile right now we won't be responding  
to any of the things that developed today,'' he said. ``We feel 
very strongly there's a need for everyone to have a chance to work 
through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, spokesman David Beigie in Denver said the company was  
taking the scandal very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's pledge was for about $50 million, half in cash and  
the rest made up of in-kind donations involving upgrades to the 
Salt Lake City telephone system, officials said. The first cash 
payment of $5 million was to be delivered before the end of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	But U S West said it was wanted to know if the bribery claims  
were true, whether the integrity of Olympic sponsorship was 
untarnished and if Salt Lake planned full financial disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	Those questions earlier were posed by Mark Roelling, U S West  
vice president for public policy, in a letter to the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik resigned Friday as SLOC's president but will stay  
on until a successor is named. Joklik said senior vice president 
Dave Johnson was asked for and provided his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik said two other senior employees who were part of Salt  
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games -- senior vice 
president of marketing and legal affairs Kelly Flint and licensing 
director Rod Hamson -- would be placed on paid leave pending the 
outcome of investigations of their roles.

<HEADLINE> Report: Holmgren To Coach Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren has been  
hired as coach and general manager of the Seattle Seahawks, five 
days after the Packers were eliminated from the playoffs, NFL 
sources said today 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m. EST, and the  
Packers scheduled one for 90 minutes later at Lambeau Field in 
Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning, Holmgren arrived at Seahawks headquarters in this  
Seattle suburb in a limousine, accompanied by his wife and 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN initially reported the deal, and the league sources,  
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed it to The Associated 
Press. The network said the long-term deal was worth more than $4 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Packers referred all questions about  
Holmgren to the Seahawks. Packers president Bob Harlan did not 
immediately return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	With Green Bay eliminated by the San Francisco 49ers in the  
first round of the playoffs, the Packers coach was at the Seahawks' 
headquarters Thursday, interviewing for the job left vacant when 
Seattle fired coach Dennis Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old Holmgren coached the Packers to victory two  
years ago in the Super Bowl. He had one more year left on his 
contract in Green Bay, where he earned $2 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren has said he would like a position in which he would be  
general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked for hours Thursday with team president Bob Whitsitt  
before going to dinner at the Mercer Island home of Microsoft 
co-founder Paul Allen, owner of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, coach of the Packers for seven seasons, was  
accompanied by his agent, Bob LaMonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt and Holmgren also met for several hours earlier  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt said last week that Allen would only become involved in  
the latter stages of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle fired Erickson Dec. 28 after the Seahawks missed making  
the playoffs for the 10th year in a row, the longest drought among 
NFL teams.

<HEADLINE> Texas Bank Robbery Leaves One Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGVIEW, Texas (AP) -- A robber fatally shot one bank employee  
and wounded another after he was told the branch office did not 
have the $50,000 he demanded, a relative of the slain worker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities captured one of the two suspects hours after  
Thursday's robbery. The second man was at large, but the FBI said 
it believed he was in the area 150 miles east of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were shot at the First Federal Savings Bank shortly  
after noon. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Lori Bailey said one bandit entered the bank  
while the other waited outside in a car. She said cash was taken 
from the bank, but would not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Paddie, 60, died at a hospital from a gunshot wound.  
Elizabeth ``Libby'' Flahie, 53, was hospitalized in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Paddie's granddaughter, 16-year-old Ashley Weathermom, said  
the wounded employee told relatives that the robber was upset when 
told the bank did not the money he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandmother had opened a car loan and put the money the  
counter,'' she said. ``The man bent over and came up with a gun and 
demanded $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Libby said they didn't have that kind of money at the branch  
office. ... My grandmother was shot first, in the neck, and died 
instantly.''

<HEADLINE>  Austrian Favorite Crashes in Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHLADMING, Austria (AP) -- Austrian favorite Thomas  
Stangassinger crashed. But his 20-year-old teammate gave 30,000 
Austrian ski fans what they wanted: a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Raich, a rookie on the World Cup tour, came from the  
23rd position after the first run Thursday to capture the first 
victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sensational,'' said Raich, a five-time World Junior  
Champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich's comeback went down in the record books. The biggest  
previous comeback in slalom dated to 1974, when Swedish star 
Ingemar Stenmark came from 17th place to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only meant to have a good second run, and instead I won,'' a  
jubilant Raich said. 
</P>
<P>
	After blazing down the second run, Raich waited anxiously at the  
finish line to see the times of the skiers who came after him. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered wildly as, one by one, Raich's rivals finished  
behind him or crashed before reaching the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich showed reporters the blue Superman t-shirt he bought to  
wear under his race suit in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brought me luck,'' Raich said.  
</P>
<P>
	The steep course -- with one especially tricky gate -- claimed  
seven of the top 30 racers, including Stangassinger, the 1994 
Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pushed really hard to try to win,'' said Stangassinger, who  
was in second position after the first run. ``But when you want to 
win, sometimes you fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raich, at his first full season on the World Cup tour, completed  
the two-run race in 1 minute, 33.32 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Austrian has been improving race by race. On  
Wednesday, he finished third in a World Cup slalom in Kranjska 
Gora, Slovenia, won by hometown favorite Jure Kosir. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Pierrick Bourgeat, 22, winner of the first slalom of  
the season, finished second, just .12 back. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who has won 14 races in his  
career, but none this season, finished third in 1:33.51. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992 -- when he was Raich's age -- Aamodt won the Olympic  
super-G title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more fun beating the old guys than being beaten by the  
young ones,'' said Aamodt, now 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosir, who was leading the race after the first run, slid to  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Italian star Alberto Tomba won the previous two editions  
of the Schladming slalom, which is run under floodlights. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his crash Thursday, Stangassinger kept his lead in the  
World Cup slalom standings. Bourgeat moved into second position, 
and Kosir is third. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian powerhouse Hermann Maier, who does not race slalom,  
holds a 59-point lead in the overall standings.

<P>
	The men's next race is a super-G Saturday in Schladming.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Speeds Local Service Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. hopes its big push into the local  
phone business will come sooner than had been expected, with 
millions of consumers being offered local service over cable 
television lines by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	As its purchase of Tele-Communications Inc. nears completion,  
AT&AMP;T announced Friday it will spend an additional $2 billion this 
year to speed its upgrades of TCI's cable systems to handle 
all-in-one packages of TV, local phone and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T will initially offer those services in 10 markets later  
this year to gauge demand, and hopes to expand its offerings to 
most TCI customers by 2000. Between TCI and its affiliates, AT&AMP;T 
could eventually reach 22 million homes for local phone service at 
a time when its share of the long-distance business is slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan puts AT&AMP;T about a year ahead of most expectations for  
its broad rollout of local phone services, said Mel Marten, a 
telecommunications analyst at the brokerage firm Edward Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology to offer these services ... has been improving  
pretty rapidly,'' Marten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both AT&AMP;T and TCI shares rose on the news, with AT&AMP;T ranking as  
the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T hopes consumers will be enticed by the convenience of  
receiving phone service channeled through the same cable TV 
circuits that deliver hundreds of channels, Internet access and 
online banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial test markets will be Chicago, Dallas, Pittsburgh,  
Seattle, Denver, Salt Lake City, St. Louis, Portland, Ore., and two 
San Francisco Bay Area communities. They include about 5 million 
potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been spending furiously to break into the $110 billion  
local phone market. In addition to its planned acquisition of TCI, 
the nation's second-largest cable company, AT&AMP;T spent $11.3 billion 
last year on Teleport Communications, a smaller local phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is still by far the nation's biggest long-distance  
provider, but it has been concentrating on faster-growing 
businesses such as mobile phones and local service as its 
long-distance share slips. For example, AT&AMP;T expects its consumer 
long-distance revenue is expected to fall by as much as 4 percent 
this year as stiff competition has forced it to lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has said it would be interested in ventures with other  
cable companies to provide local service over their high-speed 
lines. Time Warner Inc., the No. 1 cable company, has been an 
oft-reported potential partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to really make this national effort, they do need and  
go out and enter into partnerships with other cable companies,'' 
Marten said. ``I expect there will be further agreements reached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, AT&AMP;T said it will buy back up to $4 billion of its  
stock -- the nation's most widely held -- in the open market and use 
those shares to help pay for the TCI purchase. The deal, worth 
$31.7 billion when it was announced in June, is now worth about $43 
billion based on recent gains in AT&AMP;T's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T shares rose $2.81 1/4, or 3 percent, to close at $85.06 1/4. TCI  
shares climbed $1.18 3/4, or 2 percent, to $62.25 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, AT&AMP;T said it will not immediately create a separate  
``tracking'' stock to reflect its cable TV and consumer phone 
business after the TCI purchase, a plan that had been part of the 
initial merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said in a statement that AT&AMP;T  
needs to concentrate on smoothly combining its varied businesses 
before considering whether to issue a stock that would only reflect 
the performance of its consumer businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T also plans a 3-for-2 stock split after the TCI takeover is  
completed. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter 
pending regulatory and shareholder approval.

<HEADLINE> Hazelnut Cookie Recall Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York company is expanding a recall of  
cookies because the English-language ingredient list on the 
imported boxes does not list hazelnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	People allergic to hazelnuts run the risk of a serious or  
life-threatening reaction if they consume the products. 
</P>
<P>
	Dangold Inc. last week recalled Allegro butter cookies filled  
with eclair because of the problem. Friday, the company expanded 
the recall to include Allegro butter cookies filled with chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	The cookies are in 7-ounce boxes sold before November and bear  
the UPC numbers 0927 1936 1831 or 0927 1936 1817. They have no 
expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may return recalled cookies to the place of purchase  
for a refund, or call Dangold at 718-591-5286.

<HEADLINE> Maris Missing on Hall of Fame Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though the assault on his home run record  
brought Roger Maris back into baseball prominence last summer, he 
won't get any payoff when the Hall of Fame veterans committee meets 
March 2 at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Maris is not on the final oldtimers ballot because he has not  
received enough support from voters in previous elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1991, the Veterans Committee had no restrictions on  
candidates. Then a rule was passed requiring the committee to limit 
consideration to players who had received 100 votes of 60 percent 
of the votes cast in any single Baseball Writers Association 
election. Also eligible is any pre-1946 player with 10 years in the 
major leagues. Players not elected in 15 years on the BBWAA ballot 
are passed to the Veterans Committee after an additional three-year 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
	That creates what Hall of Fame official Jeff Idelson called ``a  
massive list in the hundreds.'' The list then is turned over to a 
screening committee, which reduces the candidates to between 15 and 
20. Maris was eliminated at that stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans Committee is composed of 15 members -- five Hall of  
Famers, five executives and five media members. Current members are 
players Yogi Berra, Juan Marichal, Stan Musial, Pee Wee Reese and 
Ted Williams; executives Buck O'Neill, Hank Peters, Bill White, Joe 
L. Brown and Buzzie Bavasi; and media Jerome Holtzman, Bob Broeg, 
Ken Coleman, Leonard Koppett and Allen Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee can elect one candidate in each of four categories  
-- players; umpires, executives and managers; 19th century players 
and personnel, and Negro Leaguers. Election requires 75 percent of 
the vote, the same as the BBWAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs in 1961 was broken  
last year by both Mark McGwire, who hit 70, and Sammy Sosa, with 
66.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Speak in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton braved the Midwest snow  
emergency to tout his accomplishments directly to the public today 
while senators at his impeachment trial worked to determine his 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the future,'' Clinton said after browsing  
the North American International Auto Show and watching a 
demonstration of futuristic fuel technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving Washington aswirl in both controversy and its own  
snowfall, the president came to Detroit for a lunchtime speech to 
the Detroit Economic Club, celebrating a 41-year low in the 
unemployment rate and ``the longest peacetime expansion in 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was heralding a new report by his Council of Economic  
Advisers charting the economy's continued growth over the past 93 
months ``the longest peacetime expansion in history,'' White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion following the 1982 recession lasted 92 months,  
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which 
determines changes in the business cycle using a combination of 
measures of gross domestic product, income, employment and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech, sketching themes he will underscore in  
his upcoming State of the Union address and new budget, was planned 
before anyone knew it would fall on the day after the Senate opened 
trial proceedings on the impeachment charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let Bill alone! Let Bill alone!'' was the chant at a rally  
today organized by Detroit's Democratic Rep. John Conyers and union 
activists outside the Cobo Center, site of the auto show and 
Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits of escaping Washington's turmoil were not lost on  
White House aides eager to show that Clinton was above the fray and 
focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foot of snow that left many Detroit streets  
unplowed, Clinton was lingering here even as another 2 to 4 inches 
of snow was forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his hourlong tour of the auto show, he was to  
tape his weekly radio address from the United Auto Workers union 
hall and participate in other private events there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has expanded from one to two days his trip to New York  
on Thursday for a conference of Wall Street executives trying to 
increase minority participation in the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's always looking for opportunities to travel  
around the country to see the American people,'' Toiv said 
Thursday. ``And the auto show is a symbol of our economic future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is expected to  
draw 800,000 visitors to see the retro new editions of the 
Volkswagen Beetle, Ford T-Bird and Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a repressed hot-rodder confined to presidential  
limousines, owns a 1967 Mustang convertible that he and his 
brother, Roger, helped restore. 
</P>
<P>
	In an education speech Thursday, the president sounded nostalgic  
for those heady, I-can-do-anything days of his youth. He saluted 
Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., who preceded the president with a 
fiery call for help in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at Congressman Ford thinking, you know, I was 28  
once. And when I ran for Congress at that age, I got beat. I see 
why he got elected,'' Clinton said. ``There's a 28-year-old young 
guy with his whole life before him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of today's CEA report have become familiar fodder for  
Clinton speeches in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
	--Average family income rose $3,500 from March 1991 to December  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--New jobs totaled 18.6 million in the same period, with 17.5  
million of them created since January 1993 when Clinton took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the State of the Union coming up, it's a good time for  
the president to reiterate economic themes that have been part of 
every State of the Union address because he's had a consistent 
policy,'' Toiv said.

<HEADLINE> Couch Declares for NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Tim Couch knows the questions about him.  
</P>
<P>
	Questions about his arm strength. Questions about whether the  
big numbers he put up as Kentucky's quarterback the last two 
seasons were a result of the pass-happy offense of Wildcats coach 
Hal Mumme. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing Thursday that he will pass up his final year of  
college eligibility to enter the NFL draft, Couch said he is ready 
to start answering those questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the exciting part to it,'' Couch said. ``It's a  
brand-new challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out of high school, a lot of people said, `He  
played at Leslie County High School. They didn't play anybody. He 
put up these big numbers because of this and that,''' Couch said. 
``Then I come to the best conference in America and I put up even 
better numbers than I did in high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they're going to have more questions: that I was a product  
of coach Mumme's system and can I really do it in a system that 
doesn't throw the ball that many times in a game?'' he added. 
``That's going to be another challenge, and I accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's decision, announced the day before the NFL's deadline  
for early entry to the draft, clears the way for the native of the 
Appalachian town of Hyden to make millions as the potential No. 1 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Cleveland Browns own the selection, and Browns  
president Carmen Policy has said he is open to taking a franchise 
quarterback if one is available. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL prohibits teams from commenting on underclassmen who are  
leaving school early until the league releases its list of players 
on Monday. So the Browns, who could be torn between taking Couch or 
Texas running back Ricky Williams, won't be able to discuss their 
plans for the No. 1 pick until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scouts believe Couch -- with his size (6-foot-5, 225  
pounds), accuracy, touch and experience in Kentucky's pro-style 
passing offense -- is the kind of prospect around whom the Browns 
could build a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch made no effort Thursday to hide his desire to play in  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to know that's where I want to be,'' Couch said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch's announcement ended months of questions and weeks of  
speculation that reached high pitch in the days since Kentucky's 
season ended Jan. 1 with a 26-14 loss in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he decided to leave earlier this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a competitive person, and I want to compete  
at the highest level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lexington, four local television stations carried Couch's  
announcement live -- even on a day when the U.S. Senate was 
beginning a presidential impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch choked up several times Thursday, once as he talked about  
having the chance to take care of his parents financially, and 
again as he talked about his pride in getting Kentucky to its first 
New Year's Day bowl in 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And he spoke of his sadness in losing his childhood best friend,  
Scott Brock, who was killed in a Nov. 15 truck crash that also took 
the life of one of Couch's teammates, transfer defensive end Artie 
Steinmetz. Kentucky center Jason Watts, who was driving, has been 
charged with second-degree manslaughter and drunken driving in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The University of Kentucky, the fans, they've seen me at my  
lowest points, my freshman year, they've seen me at one of the 
hardest times in my life, when my best friend got killed, and 
they've seen me at my highest points, when we go to LSU and beat 
LSU, when we beat Alabama,'' Couch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wore No. 2 on his jersey, Couch has been No. 1 in the  
hearts of Kentucky football fans since 1996, when he spurned 
scholarship offers from Penn State, Florida and Tennessee to attend 
his home-state university. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch did not enjoy immediate success in then-coach Bill Curry's  
conservative offense and considered transferring after his freshman 
season. Curry was fired midway through the season, however, and 
Kentucky athletics director C.M. Newton replaced him with Mumme. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch stayed and blossomed under Mumme's wide-open ``Air Raid''  
attack. He leaves Kentucky with 26 school records, 14 Southeastern 
Conference records and four NCAA marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without him (Mumme), I probably wouldn't be at the University  
of Kentucky right now, and I definitely wouldn't have had the 
chance to show what I could do on the football field,'' Couch said. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Couch threw for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns, and  
completed Kentucky's transformation from SEC doormat to contender. 
The Wildcats finished with a 7-4 regular season record and earned a 
bowl berth for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch finished fourth in balloting for this year's Heisman  
Trophy. He also was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award as the 
nation's top college quarterback and was chosen SEC Player of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he has narrowed his choice of agents to Tom Condon of  
Cleveland-based IMG and Gary Wichard of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Jets Ready and Eager To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Judging from the way practice went this  
week, the New York Jets might be frothing at the mouth when they 
hit the field at Giants Stadium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	By winning the AFC East with a 12-4 record, the Jets earned a  
first-round playoff bye. Their opponent this weekend, the 
Jacksonville Jaguars, won the AFC Central at 11-5 and had to play 
last Sunday, beating New England. 
</P>
<P>
	With their final regular-season game against the Patriots, a  
31-10 victory, meaning little to them, the Jets have not played a 
critical game in almost a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about our preparation, it's hard not to,'' coach  
Bill Parcells said Friday. ``We had ample time to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're upbeat, alert, anxious. I think all of them wish the  
game was today ... I don't think we are doing anything to leave it 
on the (practice) field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the game gets closer, Parcells is more likely to rely on the  
19 Jets who have had playoff experience -- all but All-Pro 
linebacker Mo Lewis with other teams. But he won't warn the players 
if they seem extra edgy heading into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't say anything,'' he said. ``Nervous energy manifests  
itself in people in lots of different ways. Some get giddy, some 
get quiet, some withdraw, some get more exuberant. Some coaches are 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't try to monitor players' moods or control their  
anxiousness. I only tell them they must under these pressure 
situations rely on their fundamentals. If they don't have that base 
while the pressure is on, failure is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just do your job and don't rely on anything else.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who played in many big games  
while at Southern California, isn't quite chomping at the bit yet. 
But by late Saturday night, he'll be hyped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been high, but it's probably like being on a  
high,'' he said. ``The anticipation. I start the week with eight 
hours sleep a night and by gametime I'm getting four hours. I lose 
an hour each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vision of plays running through your mind, what defense  
they might run and what plays we might run, what if he (the 
defender) reacts some way, what do I do? 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't see me throwing up on the sideline. I don't get  
nervous. That's just anticipation, knowing you got this game coming 
and everybody is looking at you and your teammates are looking at 
you to make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the weather turns ugly, the Jets say it won't lessen  
their eagerness. When they stand in the tunnel before the game and 
hear 75,000 voices rising to a crescendo, they probably wouldn't 
even notice any rain, sleet, snow or hail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I'll have butterflies before the game,'' linebacker  
Chad Cascadden said. ``This is just what you play for. Who knows 
when the next time will come? 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Marino made the Super Bowl in his second year and he  
hasn't been back. So who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson knows two things: there will be no shortage of emotion  
on Sunday. And no shortage on preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be fine-tuned,'' he said. ``That feeling coming out  
there is going to be fun.''

<HEADLINE> Oxford Says It May See Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Oxford Health Plans says it renewed more  
memberships than expected this month and could return to 
profitability in the second half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwalk-based health maintenance organization also announced  
Friday that it will return to the Medicare market after its 
voluntary suspension last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford expects to lose fewer than 50,000 commercial members  
during the important January period in its New York, New Jersey and 
Connecticut market even though the HMO increased premiums by an 
average of nearly 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial membership at the end of the third quarter was  
estimated at 1.6 million. The company previously said it would lose 
more than 50,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a darling of insurance investors and a model for HMOs  
nationwide, Oxford saw its fortunes change in late 1997 when it 
revealed it would take heavy losses because of billing delays and 
underestimated costs. The company has lost more than $900 million 
in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the company brought in a new management team and has  
raised $710 million from private investors as part of its 
turnaround plan. It also left unprofitable markets including 
Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. The HMO has now 
largely returned to its original business stronghold of New York, 
New Jersey and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with these results,'' said Norman C.  
Payson, Oxford's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford's stock rose $1.20 Friday to close at $20.02 in Nasdaq  
Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately one-third of Oxford's commercial membership renews  
in January. Companies that renewed this month received an average 
premium increase ranging from nine to 10 percent -- slightly higher 
than targeted in the company's turnaround plan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Oxford earned approval from the Health Care  
Financing Administration to resume marketing and enrollment of 
beneficiaries into its Medicare HMO program. Oxford is one of 
nearly a dozen HMOs that left certain Medicare markets last year 
after the federal government said it was cutting fees.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Debbie Reynolds has joined the crusade to  
keep the landmark H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D sign looming above the nation's 
entertainment capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a lot of wood and tin. You have to look after these

</P>
<P>
	It's part of ``Extreme Shopping: Hollywood'' on cable  
television's QVC home shopping network Jan. 22 and Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsors won't be able to affix logos to the sign but  
can use it in advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	QVC viewers can also adopt a celebrity star along the Walk of  
Fame during the special Hollywood themed program. For $250, viewers 
will be able to pay tribute to their favorite celebrities with 
proceeds going to benefit maintenance of the Walk of Fame stars.

	David Batuski and Chris Miller, University of Maine astronomers,  
said Thursday that a long filament in one end of the constellation 
Aquarius may contain more than 100,000 galaxies that are slowly 
collapsing into an immense structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the national meeting of the American Astronomical  
Society, Batuski said new studies of the supercluster show that it 
may be linked to a second filament of galaxies that is about 300 
million light-years long. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronomers first discovered the supercluster in 1997.  
Further study showed it to be at least 400 million light-years 
across and Batuski noted, ``We have some indication it may extend 
even further,'' perhaps to 1 billion light-years. 
</P>
<P>
	A light-year is about 6 trillion miles. The Aquarius structure  
is about a billion light-years from Earth and is seen from the 
Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Batuski said the Aquarius supercluster includes 14 groups, or  
clusters, of bright galaxies. These are called ``rich'' because of 
their brightness and because they contain at least 50 galaxies of 
stars. The rest of the supercluster is made of about 100,000 dimmer 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	The supercluster is like a major continent in the vast ocean of  
space. Its parts are grouped in a density 20 times greater than an 
average slice of the universe. In most of the sky, there are 
immense amounts of space between galaxies or groups of galaxies, 
but in a supercluster the objects are bunched together, relatively 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Superclusters are thought to be very rare. They were unknown  
until astronomers realized in recent years that groups of galaxies 
seemed to form patterns of density instead of being randomly 
scattered about the sky. At least four other superclusters have 
been found, but none matches the mass of the Aquarius formation, 
Batuski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of superclusters may be the next stage in a  
process that is shaping and forming fundamental units in the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers believe the process began after the Big Bang,  
thought to be the origin of the universe. Matter in the universe 
expanded out rapidly, and continues to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	But some matter clumped together to form stars. Then gravity  
took over and the stars formed galaxies, then groups, then clusters 
and, now, superclusters. Most astronomers believe that supercluster 
formation is only at an early stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``These objects may be at the critical point of resisting the  
expansion and are collapsing'' into an increasingly dense super 
structures, Batuski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth and its sister planets orbit an ordinary star, the  
sun, that is part of the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way, in turn, 
is one of a dozen or so galaxies that make up what is called the 
Local Group. There are smaller groups of galaxies nearby. The 
nearest cluster, containing hundreds of galaxies, is in the Virgo 
constellation, about 72 light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical galaxy can contain vast clouds of dust and gas, along  
with billions of stars such as the sun.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen today in  
Tokyo amid rumors that a U.S. ratings agency may downgrade Japan's 
sovereign debt. Tokyo share prices fell after a two-day advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 144.75 points,  
or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 13,391.81 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. It had a gain 
of 235.72 points, or 1.78 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 111.42 yen, up 0.44 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 111.04 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly moved as high as 112.40 yen in the afternoon  
on rumors that a U.S. rating agency might downgrade Japanese 
government bonds, but it quickly retreated to the low-111-yen 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's both said they  
were not planning to release ratings updates on Japan for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewed concern about the U.S. and Brazilian economies weighed  
on the dollar for much of today's trading in Asia, despite rounds 
of position-adjustment buying of dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 110.52 yen and 112.40 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at $1.1676, up from $1.1642 in  
Tokyo late Thursday but below $1.1713 late Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks finished lower today on concern over  
earnings among Japanese exporters amid continued volatility in 
global foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worried that the dollar's rapid fall below 110.00  
yen on Thursday in overseas market for the first time in 27 months 
would affect on the outlook for profits of Japanese exporters, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't make money at these levels,'' said Robert Sasaki,  
head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among losers were major exporters, including Sony and Toyota  
Motor. Sony's stocks fell for a seventh straight session, finishing 
at $68.20 per share, down $1.17. Toyota Motor closed at $25.67, 
down $1.03. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen cuts into profits made overseas by Japanese  
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was moderate with about 358 million shares changing  
hands on the first section, compared with Thursday's turnover of 
383 million shares. Declines outnumbered advances 843 to 293, with 
154 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 11.20 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,058.40. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.84 points, or 1.02 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.670 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.710 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.05 yen from 100.73 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Senators OK Blueprint for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenged to avoid ``the black pit'' of  
partisanship, the Senate unanimously sealed an elusive accord 
Friday on rules for President Clinton's impeachment trial. Opening 
arguments were set for next week with the possibility of witnesses 
still open. 
</P>
<P>
	After an unprecedented closed-door meeting in the ornate Old  
Senate Chamber -- where great issues in American history once were 
thrashed out -- lawmakers formally ratified the rules on a vote of 
100-0. Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided over the brief, 
solemn session. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal summons was dispatched to the White House moments  
later, commanding Clinton to ``abide by, obey and perform such 
orders, directions and judgments'' that the Senate dictates in the 
name of the Constitution. ``Hereof you are not to fail,'' it 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Gregory Craig pledged a  
``vigorous, successful and complete defense. ... We are optimistic 
that senators, once they see and hear this defense ... will 
conclude the articles do not justify or warrant conviction or 
removal from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Henry  
Hyde, said he was ready to present a ``compelling case'' and added 
that he hoped the Senate would agree to his request for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the agreement was struck for ground rules, Sen. Joseph  
Biden, D-Del., said, ``The idea that the Senate would degenerate 
into a pit bull ring ... was something we thought would reflect 
incredibly badly on this institution.'' Biden and other senators in 
both parties stressed a determination to shatter the precedent set 
in the House during last year's pitched impeachment battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``I think today  
we have acted in the very best tradition of the Senate, and it is 
an appropriate approach for this historic, very solemn event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of two articles of impeachment, perjury  
and obstruction of justice, in connection with his effort to 
conceal a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He is only the 
second president in history to be subjected to a trial, after 
Andrew Johnson in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Clinton maintained a  
business-as-usual demeanor, traveling to Detroit for an auto show 
and touting the current economic expansion, at 93 months the 
longest in peacetime in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again. It's working -- not just the economy.  
The crime rate's the lowest in 25 years. A lot of our social 
problems are receding. It's working again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was working, too, but on a subject Clinton would just  
as soon have disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the timetable approved, it will likely be the last week in  
January before presentations are concluded and the Senate takes its 
first substantive votes on Clinton's fate -- deciding whether to 
adjourn the trial or proceed further with witnesses. It takes a 
two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove him from office, 
but a simple majority is sufficient to adjourn the trial without a 
vote, or to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers began their day in an extraordinary bipartisan caucus,  
a closed-door session of the Senate in everything but name. There, 
they thrashed out their differences, capping several days of 
behind-the-scenes struggle in which Republicans had sought room for 
witnesses in the schedule and Democrats objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise left it up to the Senate to decide after hearing  
opening arguments and the presentation of evidence over the next 
few weeks. Either the House or the White House, may then seek to 
have witnesses called, and the full Senate will make the decision 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, though, the president's allies will have a chance  
to gain a vote to adjourn the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, according to lawmakers in both parties, senators  
peered into the abyss of ceaseless partisan struggle -- in the first 
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years -- and opted for dignity 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker, Democrat Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a  
41-year veteran of the Senate and scholar of its history, appealed 
to his colleagues to think of ``higher things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has sullied itself,'' he said in remarks later  
released by his office. ``The House has fallen into the black pit 
of partisan self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink 
of that same black pit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, said afterward  
he had told his colleagues they had a chance to emulate the giants 
in Senate history, men like Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and Henry 
Clay, known as the Great Compromiser. Alternatively, Dodd said, 
they could wind up in a brawl reminiscent of 1856 when one 
congressman caned a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretrial preparations continued.  
</P>
<P>
	House Republican officials said consideration was being given to  
trying to have Kathleen Willey summoned as a witness. She is a 
former White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted 
sexual pass at her in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential witnesses include Ms. Lewinsky, presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan, White House Secretary Betty Currie and a 
clutch of present and former presidential aides and advisers, chief 
of staff John Podesta among them. 
</P>
<P>
	As drafted, the agreement gives the White House until Monday to  
file an answer to the summons, and the House will have until 
Wednesday to file required papers and deliver evidence to the 
Senate, some of it presumably the voluminous material that 
Independent Counel Kenneth Starr turned over in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial would resume on Wednesday for the Senate to rule on  
any motions filed by either side. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, the House will have 24 hours -- three,  
eight-hour days, for example -- to present its case, based solely on 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning the following day, the White House will have the same  
time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step would be for senators to question both sides for  
16 hours, with the queries posed through Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of that process, motions would be allowed. Any motion  
to adjourn would be voted on first. If it failed, a motion for 
witnesses would be voted on. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate agreed to allow witnesses, they would be  
questioned in closed session and senators would then decide who 
would be permitted to testify.

<HEADLINE> Egger Wins World Cup Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) -- Sabine Egger, skiing through a  
thick fog, edged Austrian teammate Ingrid Salvenmoser by 
one-hundreths of a second in the slalom Friday and won her first 
World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the first time since 1995 that an Austrian woman has  
won a slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger's combined time was one minute 46.81 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard. The fog was worse than the rain -- but I don't  
care if it ends this way,'' said the 21-year-old Egger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, after her dramatic comeback victory  
Maribor two weeks ago, finished third in 1:46.93 in a race also 
troubled dogged by hard rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger became the sixth different skier to win a slalom in as  
many races at the first World Cup race held in Berchestgaden in 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion winless for two  
years until Maribor because of injuries, retained the overall 
slalom lead with 365 points to Egger's 351. 
</P>
<P>
	American Kristina Koznick, with one slalom victory this season,  
finished seventh at 1:47.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger, who has had three second-place finishes in her favorite  
discipline, took the lead by blazing to a 52.41 first run. She got 
a break by starting sixth because soft snow and the rain quickly 
led to ruts that hurt competitors who skied later. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tables turned on the second run, as New Zealand's  
Claudia Riegler blazed down the course in a day's best 52.29 after 
finishing 29th in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Riegler, who finished fifth, held her lead as the fog deepened,  
until 13th-placed Spela Pretnar pulled past her and claimed the 
lead until the final three skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Egger, Salvenmoser and Wiberg finally fought through fog so deep  
spectators couldn't see the racers and passed Pretnar, who had been 
more than a second back after the first run.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 105.56 at 9,643.32 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The buying party continued on Wall Street today,  
pushing major indexes to all-time highs for the fifth time in as 
many trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was up 105.56 points at the closing at 9,643.32, beating  
Wednesday's closing record of 9,544.97 and logging its third record 
in the first week of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes lost a little steam in the afternoon and  
threatened to close lower, but then rallied to finish at record 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks continued to lead the market, but shares from  
other industries performed well, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 5.27 to 1,275.00, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 18.82 to 2,344.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,525 to 1,523 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 536 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 934.01 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
850.84 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.87 to 611.06, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.78 to 707.76. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.38 to 431.21.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa led the Dow higher after reporting stronger-than-expected  
fourth-quarter earnings. Other big Dow gainers included AT&AMP;T and 
General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks were still flying high, despite the  
retreat in the Nasdaq composite. Amazon.com, Lycos and Yahoo! all 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were buying after a new employment report showed that  
the U.S. economy remains healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell to 4.3  
percent in December and averaged 4.5 percent for 1998, the lowest 
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. Employers added 
378,000 jobs to their payrolls -- the most in 15 months and nearly 
double what analysts anticipated.

<HEADLINE> Thompson To Quit As Georgetown Coach </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At preseason practices in November, John  
Thompson bubbled with the enthusiasm of a first-year coach, telling 
anyone who would listen that Georgetown was just one season away 
from a return to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it seems, someone else will be in charge courtside when the  
Hoyas turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, whose tough-love emphasis of academics as well as  
athletics turned Georgetown into a respected national basketball 
powerhouse over the past quarter century, planned to announce his 
resignation today, according to the father of one of his recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The university called a ``major'' news conference for 10 a.m.  
EST. Bill Shapland, spokesman for the men's basketball team, 
wouldn't release any details, but Charles Freeman, father of 
recruit Courtland Freeman, said Thompson called on Thursday to say 
he was resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just decided he was going to step down from the coaching  
position,'' Charles Freeman said. ``I think he was going to be in 
the head office. He wasn't leaving the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said Thompson told him he was stepping down for  
``personal reasons'' and that the coach didn't elaborate. Freeman 
said Craig Esherick, an assistant under Thompson for the last 16 
years, would take over as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtland Freeman, a 17-year-old forward from Socastee High  
School in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said he received the news via a phone 
call from Ronny Thompson, the coach's son and an assistant with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' Courtland Freeman said. ``From my  
understanding, he's still going to be in the head office, so it 
looks like nothing's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman is one of four major recruits Thompson was touting when  
he proclaimed ``Help is coming'' during the preseason. 
Unfortunately, next year's class can do nothing to help this year's 
team, which appears headed for Georgetown's first losing campaign 
since Thompson's first season as coach in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas are off to their worst start ever in the Big East  
(0-4), including an 11-point loss at Seton Hall on Monday night. 
Georgetown's winning record (7-6) is mainly due to victories over 
perennial non-conference patsies Thompson schedules every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this season's struggles, and despite some off-the-court  
incidents the last few years that have taken some of the shine off 
the school's carefully cultivated sports reputation, Thompson's 
achievements are memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown was barely a blip on the national basketball radar  
screen when Thompson arrived 27 years ago. His first team went 
12-14, the second was 13-13. Every team since has been invited to 
postseason tournament play -- 20 NCAAs and four NITs. He won the 
national championship with Patrick Ewing in 1984, and his Hoyas 
were runners-up in 1982 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's record is 596-239, a .713 winning percentage, and he  
is 10th among active coaches in victories. Furthermore, Thompson's 
players almost always graduated on time -- 97 percent of his players 
who stayed four years left with a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dynasty has faded over the last few years, starting in  
1996 when Allen Iverson became Thompson's first player to declare 
early for the NBA draft. Victor Page, Ed Sheffey and Kenny Brunner 
also left early, for various reasons, and all four -- especially 
Iverson -- have made ugly headlines that clearly embarrassed and 
hurt their former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Thompson last year allegedly received threatening phone  
calls from a former player, Kevin Millen, who in November ignored 
an order to stay off campus. Millen is being held in a halfway 
house and is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Georgetown had a 15-14 regular-season record and was  
invited to the NIT on reputation alone. The Hoyas defeated Florida 
before losing to Georgia Tech in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson knew this year would be a challenge, but any hopes of  
the Hoyas being competitive in the Big East were dashed when junior 
guard Shernard Long, the team's leading scorer last season, was 
suspended for the season for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are playing better,'' Thompson said after the Seton  
Hall defeat, ``but it is getting to the point where we have to win 
some games.''

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Murder Retrial Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Shareef Cousin, who at 17 became the youngest  
person ever sent to death row in Louisiana, will not be retried on 
charges he murdered a man in a holdup outside a French Quarter 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney dropped the case Friday after the  
Louisiana Supreme Court last year ordered a new trial for Cousin on 
the grounds that prosecutors improperly used hearsay evidence that 
he admitted to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Harry Connick said prosecutors do not have  
enough evidence to pursue the case. ``We think he did it and our 
opinion has not changed,'' Connick said. But ``the court left us 
with very little to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean Cousin will get out of prison. He is serving a  
20-year sentence for four armed robberies unrelated to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Cousin was convicted of murdering 25-year-old Alfred Michael  
Gerardi, who was gunned down in 1995. Cousin was 16 at the time. 
His conviction and death sentence prompted an outcry from Amnesty 
International and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cousin maintained he was at a city recreation department  
basketball game at the time, and his coach testified that he 
dropped him off at home about 20 minutes after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerardi's date told police she was not wearing her glasses or  
contact lenses and could not identify the three assailants. But 
three weeks later she picked out Cousin as the gunman from a 
photographic lineup.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Aid for Hog Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog producers will get $50 million in direct  
payments from the government to help them recover from the lowest 
pork prices in four decades, Vice President Al Gore said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are encouraged by the recent strengthening in hog  
prices, additional aid is needed to help family farms that produce 
hogs meet their living and operating expenses,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the payments have not been worked out, and  
Agriculture Department officials said they could not say yet where 
the money would come from. Hogs and other livestock normally are 
not subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog prices have fallen as low as $8 to $10 a hundredweight in  
recent weeks, down from $46.50 a year ago. Prices are expected to 
improve by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House recently assigned a task force to comb the  
federal government for programs that could be used to assist the 
farmers. The government has been stepping up purchases of pork for 
nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is running for president in 2000, has announced many  
of the government's initiatives. Iowa, a major hog-producing state, 
holds the first caucuses in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Experts Analyze Big Jury Verdicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Reflecting what legal experts described as anger  
at big business and a desire to send a message, juries awarded $2.8 
billion in the nation's 10 biggest verdicts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 10 topped $100 million each, according to Lawyers  
Weekly USA, a Boston-based publication that has been compiling such 
a list since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined figure was nearly four times the total of the 1997  
top 10, and would be the highest tally ever, if not for a bizarre 
case in 1996 in which jurors awarded a single $22 billion judgment 
against former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. That verdict 
has since been overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation is under control in the country, but not in the  
courtroom,'' said Thomas F. Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest winner on the 1998 list was a Russian inventor in  
Houston who was awarded $1.5 billion after his business partners 
forced him out of a company he founded. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, the largest verdict was $75 million, a figure that  
wouldn't have even made it onto this year's list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you can have a $50 million award and it is not even in the  
newspaper,'' said Victor Schwartz, general counsel to the American 
Tort Reform Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts attribute the steady increase to factors including  
the publicity from previous verdicts, as well as the fact that 
juries seem to be angrier at big businesses, and more willing to 
make them pay for their wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases -- like last year's No. 5 award in a Ford Ranger  
rollover accident in Jackson, Miss. -- punitive damages made up $120 
million of the $144.9 million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juries are starting to think that maybe you need to award this  
much money to get the message across,'' Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in the composition of the bench over the last three  
decades also has made an impact, said Richard Samp, chief counsel 
of the Washington Legal Foundation, a watchdog group that supports 
tort reform. Many judges were former plaintiff trial lawyers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judges who are hearing such cases no longer believe that  
there should be realistic limits set by the law on an amount of an 
award that can be given,'' Samp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The list only includes verdicts that the editors at the  
publication believe have a chance of being collected. A $525 
million verdict against a convicted killer out of Greenville, N.C., 
was kept off the list. The defendant -- sentenced to 27 years -- has 
no assets and no way to pay his victim, Lawyers Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the verdicts are likely to be significantly lowered on  
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Dust Rings Bring Hint of Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Powerful new evidence for the presence of  
planets outside the solar system has been found in the first 
pictures ever taken of dust rings around distant stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope clearly show dust  
rings around two stars and astronomers said such rings probably 
formed because the stars have planets. The discovery was announced 
Friday at the national meeting of the American Astronomical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars, identified as HR 4796A and HD 141569, are both about  
300 light years from Earth. Each is twice the size of the sun, but 
much brighter and much younger, at about 10 million years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounding each star like immense hula hoops are disks of dust  
that appear to have been shaped by planets in the same way that the 
moons of Saturn sculpt the rings about that planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring around one of the stars, HD 141569, has a dark gap that  
may have been cut by the gravitational influence of a planet, said 
Alycia Weinberger of the University of California, Los Angeles, a 
member of the astronomy team that made the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most obvious way to form a gap in a disk is with a  
planet,'' Weinberger said at a news conference. ``The disk is under 
the gravitational influence of some other body. This means that we 
have the circumstantial evidence of a planet about this star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of such rings has been suggested in earlier  
studies, but the Hubble images are the first actual pictures, said 
Bradford A. Smith of the University of Hawaii, another team member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, everything had been inferred,'' said Smith.  
``This is the first time we have actually seen a circumstellar 
disk. It came as a really big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw it, we said, 'Wow, that looks like Saturn,''' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of such rings is part of the process that builds a  
structure like our solar system. The process starts when dust and 
gas come together to begin forming a star. Some of the material 
also clumps together to form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	When the star gets big enough, its nuclear fires are ignited.  
The outflow from the star blows away the remaining dust and gas, 
leaving behind the planets and some orbiting boulders called 
plantisimals. 
</P>
<P>
	The boulders collide and grind each other up, creating the dust.  
If no planets are orbiting the star, the dust will disperse. But 
the presence of planets gives the dust a gravitational kick that 
shapes it into a disk. 
</P>
<P>
	In the solar system, which is about 4 billion years old, only a  
faint dust ring remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Around HD 141569, the disk is 75 billion miles across, ringing  
an area much larger than the entire solar system. The gap in the 
disk is prominent, occupying about 5 percent of the entire ring. 
The ring is about 21 billion miles from the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring around HR 4796A is about 1.5 billion miles from its  
star. The ring is about 13 billion miles in diameter and about 1.6 
billion miles thick. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the rings were captured by a special camera on Hubble  
that allows photos of the area around a star while blocking the 
bright, obscuring light from its center. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the rings are extremely faint: Detecting them is like  
trying to look at a dime from 4 miles away.

<HEADLINE> Alexander May Make Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, who  
unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 
1996, is moving ahead with a possible bid to lead the GOP ticket in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who planned to form a presidential exploratory  
committee today, went on the offensive against a potential 
Republican rival for the White House, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
and Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said in a telephone interview Thursday that he has a  
problem with Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are weasel words,'' he said. ``Compassionate  
conservative is just like Al Gore talking about `practical 
idealism.' They're designed to mean nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say `compassionate conservative,' it sounds like  
you're saying, `I'm not like the rest of those politicians who are 
not compassionate,''' Alexander said. ``I think we need to say in 
plain words, `I am a conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for Bush, responded: ``When Governor  
Bush says `compassionate conservative,' he is saying a conservative 
philosophy is a compassionate philosophy. Teaching people to read 
is both compassionate and conservative. Moving people from welfare 
to work is both compassionate and conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for the vice president, Chris Lehane, said it was  
``unfortunate'' that Alexander ``has joined the Republican attack 
pack by engaging in this politics of personal destruction'' rather 
than focusing on ``the best way to prepare America for the 21st 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 59, was Tennessee governor from 1979 to 1987. He also  
was president of the University of Tennessee and was secretary of 
education under President George Bush, the Texas governor's father.

<HEADLINE> State Pols Avoid D.C. Partisanship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	State politicians around the country are opening their 1999  
legislative sessions with a plea to one another and a promise to 
the public to keep it civil and avoid acting like the crowd in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's work together. Let's resist the politics of personal  
destruction that has paralyzed our federal government,'' 
Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, said Wednesday in 
his inaugural address. The crowd of 1,000 burst out into applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we resort to shrill partisanship, people rightfully will be  
saying, `You're no better than what we're seeing in Washington,''' 
Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe said Tuesday, the 
opening day of the new session. Moe is a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative leaders from every region, Republican and Democrat  
alike, sought to distance themselves from Washington as the Senate 
on Thursday opened its first presidential impeachment trial in 130 
years. Many saw the proceedings, which could stretch on for weeks 
or months, as the ultimate symbol of political paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all watched the spectacle in Washington, D.C., and I  
can't think of anybody who has been real impressed with the way 
that's been handled. We'll try to avoid the kind of gridlock that's 
occurred there,'' said Iowa Gov.-elect Tom Vilsack, the state's 
first Democratic governor in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who unexpectedly lost House seats in this fall's  
election and blamed their leaders' handling of the Clinton scandal, 
were particularly open about their disgust with the issue and their 
desire to separate themselves from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota state Sen. David Knutson said he recently sent out a  
letter to constituents asking for their opinion on the impeachment 
hearings. Some Republicans wrote back to say that they would never 
contribute to the party again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tainted by the perceived partisanship in Washington,''  
Knutson said. ``I think we're trying to distance ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knutson said he would handle things differently this year,  
introducing bills as part of a ``belief system'' instead of part of 
the GOP platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to get those party lines drawn in the sand,'' he  
said. ``People are tired of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a note also sounded by Massachusetts Gov. Paul  
Cellucci. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will shun the unyielding partisanship that has engulfed our  
nation's capital,'' Cellucci said Thursday in his inaugural speech. 
``We will build coalitions, forge consensus and get results.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Morning Show Finds Ratings Slip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Diane Sawyer to the rescue, again!  
</P>
<P>
	CBS's perennial doormat, ``This Morning,'' slipped past ABC's  
``Good Morning America'' into second place last week behind the 
traditional morning champ, NBC's ``Today.'' The last time the CBS 
morning news program climbed out of last place in the ratings was 
in early 1984 -- when Sawyer was co-host. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's solution? The network is bringing back Sawyer and Charles  
Gibson as hosts in hopes of stopping the ratings slide. 
</P>
<P>
	At CBS -- which hasn't beaten ABC in the morning since Jan. 17,  
1977 -- staff members brought in champagne to celebrate Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge deal for us,'' said Allen Berman, executive  
producer of ``This Morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an even bigger embarrassment for ``Good Morning America.''  
Troubled by the show's decline, ABC announced this week that it was 
replacing morning show hosts Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman with 
Sawyer and Gibson starting Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' had a 2.8 rating during New Year's week,  
compared to ABC's 2.7 rating, Nielsen Media Research said. 
``Today'' had a 5.1 rating, meaning it almost had as many viewers 
as the two other morning shows combined. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS affiliates were so disgusted with the network's morning  
ratings three years ago that many wanted to do their own shows 
between 7 and 9 a.m. As a result, CBS turns over much of the first 
hour of ``This Morning'' to affiliates for local news, a format 
that's beginning to pay ratings dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing things right and we're slowly but steadily  
improving as a result,'' Berman said. ``The problems at `GMA' have 
probably contributed, but I'm convinced we've been making progress 
regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a year-to-year basis, morning ratings for CBS and NBC have  
largely held steady. ``Good Morning America,'' however, is down 22 
percent this season compared to last.

	CBS staffers had reason to pop open champagne Thursday -- the

</P>
<P>
	The last time the CBS morning news program climbed out of last

<HEADLINE> IOC Has `Regret' Over Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC expressed regret today over  
the resignations of Salt Lake City's two top Olympic officials but 
said it had confidence that the 2002 Winter Games will be a ``total 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
said he spoke by phone today with Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt about the 
bribery scandal. Samaranch said he would visit Salt Lake City this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement came as Salt Lake Organizing Committee president  
Frank Joklik and vice president Dave Johnson stepped down in the 
scandal over scholarships, gifts and other favors that went to IOC 
members or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it learned of the resignations ``with regret.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC wishes to reiterate that it has full confidence in the  
organizers of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and has no doubt as to 
their ability to ensure the total success of these games,'' the 
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Quit in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The two top officials of the Salt Lake  
City Olympic committee resigned today and two others were placed on 
paid leave in a dramatic housecleaning amid a bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, president of the city's Olympic organizing  
committee, resigned but will stay on until a successor is hired. He 
asked for and received the resignation of senior vice president 
Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations were the latest moves in what has become the  
worst ethics scandal in Olympics history and were announced 
following a joint session of the Salt Lake and U.S. Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deplore it,'' Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt, who attended  
the meeting, said of the scandal that has rocked the Olympic 
community. ``We cannot avoid the fact we've been injured. ... We 
will clean this wound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his resignation, Joklik confirmed the bid  
committee that had landed the 2002 Games had paid International 
Olympic Committee members cash and gifts, in one case more than 
$70,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must draw a sharp line to ensure SLOC can put on the games  
successfully,'' Joklik said of the resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and Johnson were involved in Salt Lake's successful bid  
to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. That effort has become the target 
of four investigations into hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
went into scholarships and gifts for International Olympic 
Committee members and their relatives.

<HEADLINE> INS Deports Record Number in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government said Friday it removed a record  
number of illegal immigrants from the United States last year, 
deporting 171,154 foreigners with criminal records or other 
disqualifying factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Removals for the fiscal year that ended in September were up 50  
percent from the 1997 record of 114,386, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service said, boasting that the figures were well 
ahead of the agency's goal of 123,000 deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Removals play a crucial role in our effort to restore (the)  
credibility of our nation's immigration laws,'' said INS 
Commissioner Doris Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures don't include the estimated 1.5 million cases of  
illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. borders last year, most 
at the Southwest border, and immediately turned back. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of those deported, 56,011 people, were ousted because of  
their criminal records. Nearly half of the criminal aliens had drug 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican nationals accounted for 81 percent of the overall  
removals and 78 percent of the criminal removals last year, INS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Removals have increased in each of the last five years as the  
agency has enjoyed major funding increases from Congress and the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee  
also cited a tough 1996 immigration law for the increased 
deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new INS deportation numbers are further proof that the  
1996 immigration reform law has untied immigration agents' hands to 
promptly return illegal aliens and is having a tremendous impact,'' 
said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``It is securing America's borders, 
reducing crime, protecting jobs and saving taxpayers billions of 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as deportations are increasing, the number of illegal  
immigrants living in the United States continues to grow. The 
illegal alien population is estimated at more than 5 million people 
and growing by 275,000 annually.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens Japan Over Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the steelworkers union expressed strong  
disappointment in the administration's initial efforts to deal with 
rising layoffs, President Clinton today signaled he was ready to 
take more drastic action to curb a flood of imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton singled out Japan, which has accounted for almost half  
the import surge, warning that unless those shipments begin 
dropping dramatically, his administration would begin action to 
impose stiff penalty tariffs on Japanese steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bankrupting the American steel industry that went through so  
much (in the 1980s) is not my idea'' of how to get Japan back on 
its feet, Clinton said in a speech today to the Economic Club of 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said if Japan's steel exports, which have surged by 400  
percent this year, don't return quickly to lower levels, the 
administration will ``initiate forceful action'' under U.S. trade 
law designed to protect domestic industries against harmful surges. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's tough words followed by a day release of an  
administration plan that was widely criticized by the steel 
industry and its supporters in Congress. Critics assert the plan 
offers too little in the way of help for an industry that is 
suffering millions of dollars in profit losses and thousands of job 
layoffs because of the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America  
union, called the administration's response totally inadequate and 
said today the union would press its case for tougher action with 
Congress. Lawmakers from steel-producing states also voiced 
displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have no choice but to work with our supporters in  
Congress ... to pass into law the vital relief we need,'' Becker 
said in a letter to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a steel industry hemorrhaging with the flooding of  
our markets with foreign dumped steel, causing the loss of 
thousands of jobs, and the administration is applying a small 
Band-Aid to that massive hemorrhage,'' complained Sen. Arlen 
Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	In his plan, Clinton pledged to seek $300 million in tax breaks  
for steel companies that contend they are losing millions of 
dollars in sales because foreign nations are dumping excess steel 
in this country at unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he would appoint a high-level White  
House coordinator to make sure government benefits flow quickly to 
the thousands of steelworkers laid off because of cutbacks in U.S. 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan did not give the industry its most cherished goals  
-- either quotas on steel imports or broad negotiations to force 
other nations to accept ``voluntary'' restraints on their shipments 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration missed by two days the deadline set by  
Congress to produce the plan, reflecting an intense internal 
debate. One group of advisers, led by Commerce Secretary William 
Daley, argued the political merits of helping a key U.S. industry 
and its union workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposing camp, led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,  
carried the day with arguments that the United States could not 
risk setting back chances for recovery from the worst global 
economic crisis in a half-century by erecting protectionist 
barriers that would close off the big U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the president seems more concerned about the  
global economic effect of taking action on steel than protecting 
American steelworkers who are suffering,'' complained Sen. Jay 
Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
	When the administration missed the Tuesday deadline, it gave as  
one reason Clinton's desire to talk personally about the issue with 
Rockefeller. But the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement 
late Thursday that he was ``deeply disappointed'' in the plan and 
would work to make sure Congress crafts a tougher response. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration insisted it was ``deeply concerned '' about  
the record steel imports to the United States in 1998, up 30 
percent in the first 10 months of the year, and was committed to 
protecting American companies and their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said it would seek $300 million in new tax  
breaks for steel companies in Clinton's new budget, which he is 
scheduled to submit on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new relief would allow steel companies to spread out over  
five years, instead of just two, losses incurred from the import 
surge. A similar ``carryback'' provision for farmers was approved 
last year, providing tax relief to another sector hard hit by trade 
losses from the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry and its unions have already filed cases  
against Japan, Russia and Brazil, accusing those nations of 
``dumping'' steel in this country at unfairly low prices and asking 
the government to impose penalty tariffs of up to 200 percent on 
certain types of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's report pledged those cases would be handled  
on an expedited basis and noted that the Commerce Department has 
agreed to apply the punitive tariffs retroactively to mid-November. 
But members of Congress said those cases will require months before 
tariffs can be imposed, meaning thousands more layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Thursday, Bethlehem Steel announced plans to eliminate 540  
jobs in Washington, Pa., and Massillon, Ohio, citing sustained 
losses and the impact of ``unfairly traded'' steel imports.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Re-Signs Pitcher Swift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Free agent Bill Swift, Seattle's fifth starter  
last season, agreed to a minor league contract with the Mariners on 
Friday and was invited to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift, 37, was 11-9 with a 5.85 ERA in 26 starts last year. He  
would get an $850,000, one-year contract if he makes the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill will come to camp in the mix for the fifth starter job,''  
Mariners general manager Woody Woodward said. ``He pitched well for 
us last season and he's a veteran pitcher who has had success in 
the past as both a starter and as a reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swift began in his career in Seattle, which made him its  
first-round draft pick in 1984 and kept him through 1991. The 
right-hander rejoined the Mariners last year after stints with San 
Francisco and Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Woman Does Trunk Routine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A woman allegedly kidnapped by her  
ex-boyfriend and thrown into the trunk of her car was freed five 
hours and 173 miles later after motorists spotted her finger 
wiggling through a broken taillight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies stopped the car on Interstate 40 on Thursday  
and heard the screams of Amy Maxwell, 19, of Huntsville, Ala. She 
had gone through the ordeal wearing only a T-shirt and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gal was obviously a fighter,'' Sheriff Tim Hutchison said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies arrested the driver, David Michael Tate, 21, who has  
been fighting with Ms. Maxwell over custody of their 2-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Scott Nowinksi said federal kidnapping charges  
would be filed against Tate. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Tate sneaked into Ms. Maxwell's house Thursday  
morning after her boyfriend had left. He allegedly put a pillow 
over her face until she faked unconsciousness, then bound her with 
tape and placed her in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maxwell told deputies that she loosened the tape over her  
mouth and began screaming when he stopped for gas. When Tate turned 
up the radio to cover her screams, she unplugged the speakers, 
forcing him to drive off without finishing the refueling, Hutchison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Ms. Maxwell freed her hands, broke out a taillight  
and began pushing papers, sticks and a finger through the hole. 
Dale and Teri Schroeder of Wauseon, Ohio, saw her finger and called 
police.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Court Upholds Plea Bargains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An appeals court ruled Friday that prosecutors can  
offer plea bargains in exchange for testimony, overturning a court 
decision that declared the practice illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision last summer by a three-member panel of the 10th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had shocked the Justice Department. 
That ruling took issue with the moral and legal underpinning of 
immunity deals -- which critics describe as a form of bribery -- and 
essentially would make criminals of federal prosecutors who offer 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was put on hold until the full Denver-based appeals  
court could decide. In its majority opinion Friday, a 12-member 
panel wrote that if Congress had intended to overturn the accepted 
practice, ``it would have done so in clear, unmistakable and 
unarguable language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal pleased Justice Department officials.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for federal prosecutors across this nation,''  
said Linda McMahan, U.S. attorney for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges who made the earlier ruling also sat on the  
12-member panel and dissented in Friday's reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on the Kansas conviction of Sonya Singleton on  
charges of cocaine trafficking and money laundering. The three 
judges said the chief prosecution witness illegally received 
leniency in exchange for his testimony, violating federal law 
against bribery witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If justice is perverted when a criminal defendant seeks to buy  
testimony from a witness, it is no less perverted when the 
government does so,'' said Judge Paul J. Kelley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the practice is common, noting that  
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were convicted in the Oklahoma 
City bombing based on testimony from a former friend who struck a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges had ordered a new trial for Singleton and said  
Congress should rewrite anti-bribery laws if legislators believe 
prosecutors should be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers scrambled to delay other cases affected by the ruling,  
but most did not expect it to stand. If the full 10th Circuit court 
did not overturn it, they said Congress would likely amend the law.

<HEADLINE> Senators OK Blueprint for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenged to avoid ``the black pit'' of  
partisanship, the Senate unanimously sealed an elusive accord 
Friday on rules for President Clinton's impeachment trial. Opening 
arguments were set for next week with the possibility of witnesses 
still open. 
</P>
<P>
	After an unprecedented closed-door meeting in the ornate Old  
Senate Chamber -- where great issues in American history once were 
thrashed out -- lawmakers formally ratified the rules on a vote of 
100-0. Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided over the brief, 
solemn session. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal summons was dispatched to the White House moments  
later, commanding Clinton to ``abide by, obey and perform such 
orders, directions and judgments'' that the Senate dictates in the 
name of the Constitution. ``Hereof you are not to fail,'' it 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Gregory Craig pledged a  
``vigorous, successful and complete defense. ... We are optimistic 
that senators, once they see and hear this defense ... will 
conclude the articles do not justify or warrant conviction or 
removal from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Henry  
Hyde, said he was ready to present a ``compelling case'' and added 
that he hoped the Senate would agree to his request for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the agreement was struck for ground rules, Sen. Joseph  
Biden, D-Del., said, ``The idea that the Senate would degenerate 
into a pit bull ring ... was something we thought would reflect 
incredibly badly on this institution.'' Biden and other senators in 
both parties stressed a determination to shatter the precedent set 
in the House during last year's pitched impeachment battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``I think today  
we have acted in the very best tradition of the Senate, and it is 
an appropriate approach for this historic, very solemn event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of two articles of impeachment, perjury  
and obstruction of justice, in connection with his effort to 
conceal a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He is only the 
second president in history to be subjected to a trial, after 
Andrew Johnson in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Clinton maintained a  
business-as-usual demeanor, traveling to Detroit for an auto show 
and touting the current economic expansion, at 93 months the 
longest in peacetime in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again. It's working -- not just the economy.  
The crime rate's the lowest in 25 years. A lot of our social 
problems are receding. It's working again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was working, too, but on a subject Clinton would just  
as soon have disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the timetable approved, it will likely be the last week in  
January before presentations are concluded and the Senate takes its 
first substantive votes on Clinton's fate -- deciding whether to 
adjourn the trial or proceed further with witnesses. It takes a 
two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove him from office, 
but a simple majority is sufficient to adjourn the trial without a 
vote, or to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers began their day in an extraordinary bipartisan caucus,  
a closed-door session of the Senate in everything but name. There, 
they thrashed out their differences, capping several days of 
behind-the-scenes struggle in which Republicans had sought room for 
witnesses in the schedule and Democrats objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise left it up to the Senate to decide after hearing  
opening arguments and the presentation of evidence over the next 
few weeks. Either the House or the White House, may then seek to 
have witnesses called, and the full Senate will make the decision 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, though, the president's allies will have a chance  
to gain a vote to adjourn the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, according to lawmakers in both parties, senators  
peered into the abyss of ceaseless partisan struggle -- in the first 
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years -- and opted for dignity 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker, Democrat Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a  
41-year veteran of the Senate and scholar of its history, appealed 
to his colleagues to think of ``higher things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has sullied itself,'' he said in remarks later  
released by his office. ``The House has fallen into the black pit 
of partisan self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink 
of that same black pit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, said afterward  
he had told his colleagues they had a chance to emulate the giants 
in Senate history, men like Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and Henry 
Clay, known as the Great Compromiser. Alternatively, Dodd said, 
they could wind up in a brawl reminiscent of 1856 when one 
congressman caned a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretrial preparations continued.  
</P>
<P>
	House Republican officials said consideration was being given to  
trying to have Kathleen Willey summoned as a witness. She is a 
former White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted 
sexual pass at her in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential witnesses include Ms. Lewinsky, presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan, White House Secretary Betty Currie and a 
clutch of present and former presidential aides and advisers, chief 
of staff John Podesta among them. 
</P>
<P>
	As drafted, the agreement gives the White House until Monday to  
file an answer to the summons, and the House will have until 
Wednesday to file required papers and deliver evidence to the 
Senate, some of it presumably the voluminous material that 
Independent Counel Kenneth Starr turned over in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial would resume on Wednesday for the Senate to rule on  
any motions filed by either side. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, the House will have 24 hours -- three,  
eight-hour days, for example -- to present its case, based solely on 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning the following day, the White House will have the same  
time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step would be for senators to question both sides for  
16 hours, with the queries posed through Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of that process, motions would be allowed. Any motion  
to adjourn would be voted on first. If it failed, a motion for 
witnesses would be voted on. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate agreed to allow witnesses, they would be  
questioned in closed session and senators would then decide who 
would be permitted to testify.

<HEADLINE> New Phone Finds Cheap Calling Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Every time Sidney Klein sees another long  
distance telephone rate advertised he feels a little worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this cognitive dissonance. Am I getting the best rate?  
Am I getting ripped off? I start feeling awful,'' the Fairfield, 
Conn., merchandiser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein may have found relief Friday at the Consumer Electronics  
Show. It's a new high-tech telephone that goes price shopping every 
time its dialed, seeking the cheapest long-distance rate from 
hundreds of plans before it places your call. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Distance Manager, made by cordless phone company Uniden  
America Corp., is expected to reach store shelves in the spring at 
a price of about $49. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attendees said the phone could allow consumers to ignore  
the complicated advertising pitches now crowding the TV airways. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always telling you to dial 10-10-whatever it is,''  
said D.K. Thompson, of Garden Grove, Calif. ``How are you going to 
remember that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Uniden's competitors, contending callers prefer to stick  
with a particular long distance plan or phone, said they weren't 
worried about the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Ramage, a product marketing manager for VTech  
Communications, of Beaverton, Ore., another big seller of cordless 
phones, said Uniden has exaggerated expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Long Distance Manager is an add-on feature that some  
people might enjoy, but it's somewhat gimmicky,'' he said. ``Most 
people have a secure relationship with their long distance company 
and aren't looking to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Distance Manager claims to deliver speed as well as  
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer won't be able to tell the phone is searching for  
the lowest long distance rate because it works within 50 
milliseconds,'' said John Harris, Uniden's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniden's goal is an average price of between 7 and 8 cents per  
minute, with no additional fees. At that price, calls made with the 
Long Distance Manager would be cheaper than those in many calling 
plans. However, it might not be able to match some plans that offer 
a cheaper rate depending on how long the call lasts. 
</P>
<P>
	A caller using the phone pushes the ``long distance'' button and  
dials the number. The phone dials a federal database containing 
hundreds of long distance plans, searches for the best rate and 
routes the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Each month, a consumer will receive a bill detailing each call,  
like a typical bill from a long distance carrier. The difference 
will be that this bill may include calls through dozens of 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniden said it expects to sell a million of the phones in the  
first 12 months they're on the market.

	ROME, Ga. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl was sentenced to two years  
probation for offering to pay a classmate $100 to kill another high 
school student. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, whose name was withheld because she is a juvenile, was  
also ordered Wednesday to attend peer group counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said a male student at Armuchee High School who  
overheard a conversation between the two teen-agers in May reported 
it to the school principal, but said he did not think the girl was 
serious.

<HEADLINE>  Shoving Ends China Rights Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rival Chinese dissident groups exchanged  
shoves and shouts Friday after one group of exiles told a 
congressional panel that conditions have worsened dramatically in 
the seven months since President Clinton's visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before the House International Relations Committee  
demonstrated the fractious nature of the Chinese dissident 
community. Protesters complained that they hadn't been given a 
chance to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance, Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing  
criticized those who testified, insisting that China punishes only 
those who break its laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei Jingsheng, who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons, told the  
committee that there had been ``a constant stream of arrests'' 
since Clinton's visit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not act swiftly, there will soon be more and more  
mothers who have lost their sons, wives who have lost their 
husbands and children who have lost their parents,'' Wei said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other dissidents called on Congress to consider imposing  
economic sanctions on China, 20 years after the two nations 
formally established diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members of both parties seized on the testimony to  
appeal to administration officials to maintain a hard line next 
Tuesday in talks in Washington with China's assistant foreign 
minister, Wang Guangya. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration policy toward China is ``a pathetic  
failure,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee released a recent report by Amnesty International  
concluding that ``while there has been minor, and mostly symbolic, 
progress in a few areas, in most areas the situation has actually 
gotten worse in the last three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not one Tiananmen Square prisoner has been released since  
Clinton's visit, China has taken no steps to undertake a review of 
political prisoners and it continues the use of torture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing ended in melee between rival dissident groups,  
provoked by those who complained they hadn't been given a chance to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee staff members sought to keep shoving and shirt-pulling  
antagonists apart until police were summoned to restore order and 
clear the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The fracas began after shouting in Chinese broke out. Looking  
perplexed, Chairman Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., asked if anyone 
could translate. But without waiting for an answer, he gaveled the 
hearing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman quickly ducked out of the room as the shouting  
intensified and chairs were knocked over. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, in particular, criticized the committee's  
decision to invite Wei and three other former political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are outraged with the placement of the wrong persons on the  
panel,'' said a statement issued by a group of Washington-based 
Chinese dissidents who oppose what they view as Wei's 
self-proclaimed leadership of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Washington leaders of the Chinese Democracy Movement had  
broken with Wei late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Lipson, a spokesman for the committee, said that Gilman  
was not aware of the rivalries among the dissidents or that a 
protest had been planned, and was glad no one was hurt or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at the National Press Club, Ambassador Li scoffed at  
Wei, calling him a criminal who was allowed to come to the United 
States in 1997 for medical treatment and ended up testifying on 
Capitol Hill. Wei spent most of 18 years in Chinese prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``In China, we practice the rule of law,'' Li said. ``If you  
don't violate the criminal code, you don't get arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Li said those who talk most loudly about human rights ``didn't  
say one word about victims of flooding last year and didn't take 
any action at all.'' He said Americans should respect China's 
system as different from that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are differences among people and we have to get used to  
that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Casino Chip Stealing Gang Gets Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- Four members of a gang of thieves  
believed to be responsible for stealing more than $750,000 in a 
rash of Atlantic City casino robberies were sentenced to jail terms 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gang, which prosecutors say was made up of casino hustlers,  
paid off desperate gamblers to steal fistfuls of $500 and $1,000 
chips from casinos and flee. Their getaway car driver: A 
Philadelphia lawyer who needed the money to recoup his gambling 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $750,000 worth of chips were stolen in the four-year  
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The gang recruited gamblers who were losing, who appeared to be  
athletic or fast runners, and who they later learned had little or 
no criminal records, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people who participated in the ring either as thieves or  
``blockers'' -- who would purposely get in the way of security 
guards chasing chip thieves -- have pleaded guilty already. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Superior Court Judge Manuel Greenberg sentenced four  
men to jail terms: 
</P>
<P>
	--Barry Washington, 42, of Atlantic City, was sentenced to seven  
years for conspiracy; 
</P>
<P>
	--Anthony Watkins, 41, of Silver Springs, Md., was sentenced to  
six years for conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	--John ``Little John'' Robinson, 36, of Pleasantville, was  
sentenced to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Franklyn Bradley, 51, of Philadelphia, a lawyer who pleaded  
guilty to conspiracy, theft and attempted theft, was sentenced to 
six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a 25-year lawyer and former youth counselor for the  
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia with no previous 
criminal record, broke down as he stood for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize, I'm sorry for the things that I did,'' he said,  
choking back tears. ``I want to start my life over again.''

<HEADLINE> Recluse Accused of Killing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RINGGOLD, Ga. (AP) -- For nearly 30 years, family and friends  
hadn't seen Virginia Ridley. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives say they were chased away when they tried to visit the  
home she shared with her husband, Alvin Ridley. Neighbors said he 
told them his wife had left him and went north. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Mrs. Ridley's body was found inside the roach-infested,  
dilapidated house just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Police accuse Ridley of holding his wife captive in their home  
for nearly three decades before smothering her. His own lawyer, Ken 
Poston, admits Ridley is a ``pitiful,'' reclusive, paranoid man 
oblivious to the filth he lives in. But he said Ridley isn't 
capable of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's he guilty of, being crazy?'' Poston asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in Ridley's murder trial began on Thursday. The  
former TV repairman, who has been free on bail, could get life in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy found that Mrs. Ridley died of asphyxiation. Her  
husband says she died after having an epileptic seizure brought on 
because they could no longer afford medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley has an eccentric reputation among the residents of  
Ringgold, a sleepy burg in the Appalachian foothills that has grown 
into a suburb of Chattanooga, Tenn., a few miles away. Neighbors 
called him a hermit with a blank stare and a suspicious and 
cantankerous nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just never socialized with him,'' said Jan Disheroon, a  
Ringgold native who has lived across the street from the Ridleys 
for 39 years. ``He was strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His relationship with his future wife began as a correspondence  
when he was in the Army. They married after he was discharged in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple lived in public housing in Ringgold, but were soon  
evicted. Ridley pursued the matter to trial in 1970, where a judge 
issued a verdict against the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	At that trial, Mrs. Ridley's family, which had not seen her  
since she got married, obtained an order requiring her to appear in 
court. On Sept. 15, 1970, Mrs. Ridley told the judge she was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sister, Linda Barber, said relatives tried to visit Mrs.  
Ridley repeatedly in the years since, but were always run off. The 
couple's phone was disconnected two years ago, and some neighbors 
say Ridley lives without electricity and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if they came out of a time capsule from the  
'20s and '30s rural South,'' Poston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, Ridley had litigation and verbal  
confrontations with neighboring business owners. After his father 
was in an accident with a cement truck, Ridley sued the local 
police chief, accusing him of falsifying a report. 
</P>
<P>
	When the case was tossed out, and when the chief won his legal  
fees, authorities seized Ridley's van to satisfy the judgment. 
Later, Ridley won an appeal, arguing that deputies had ``illegal 
seized'' his van. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, campaigning on the theme of reforming corruption,  
Ridley ran for sheriff. He collected just 210 votes in a county of 
50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Ridley doesn't speak to them during his frequent  
walks around the neighborhood. His small home sits on a wooded 
hillside lot with numerous signs to ward away would-be trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he does is look at you when you pass. He never says  
anything,'' Mrs. Disheroon said. He said hello to her once, at a 
funeral. ``And I thought, 'Oh my God, he can talk.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Sweeney said many neighbors consider Ridley an eccentric,  
but not a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daddy took TVs down there when I was a little girl,'' she  
said of the repair shop Ridley used to run with his late father. 
``The talk was he was kind of (crazy), but I was never scared of 
him.''

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Won't Bid for AirTouch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. won't be entering a bidding  
war for AirTouch Communications Inc., the world's largest 
independent cellular phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, which has been waiting in the wings of the  
fast-growing cellular market, said Friday it considered acquiring 
AirTouch, but ``has determined not to pursue a bid for the company 
at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elimination of MCI WorldCom as a potential suitor clears the  
way for San Francisco-based AirTouch to continue negotiations with 
Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest cellular phone company, and 
Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bell Atlantic and AirTouch declined comment. Vodafone could  
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But MCI WorldCom's decision helped stop a steep selloff in its  
stock that began after word surfaced it was considering topping a 
$55 billion offer for AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a relief,'' said Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager for  
Eaton Vance Utilities A, who owns 465,000 shares of MCI WorldCom, 
making it the mutual fund's third-largest holding. ``It hasn't been 
a pleasant couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien and other investors in MCI WorldCom watched wide-eyed as  
the company's shares fell $3.25 Thursday and then an additional 
$4.80 Friday before word spread that MCI WorldCom would not make a 
bid. A stock offer from MCI WorldCom for AirTouch would have 
diluted the value of MCI WorldCom's outstanding shares. In late 
trading Friday, after it ruled out a bid, MCI WorldCom recovered 
almost all of the day's lost ground to end down 12 1/2 cents at $75 a 
share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, Miss.-based MCI WorldCom, however, still needs to break  
into the $30 billion U.S. cellular phone industry, shareholders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to do something, but the don't have to do something  
immediately,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular phones are quickly changing the where-when-and-how  
people communicate around the globe. The number of worldwide 
cellular phone subscribers is expected to soar from 285 million in 
1998 to 615 million within four years, according to Strategis 
Group, a telecom consulting company in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	As telecom companies jockey for market position, AirTouch has  
become a hot property. AirTouch has a strong network in the Western 
United States, as well as 12 partnerships overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is based in New York and offers local and  
cellular service from Maine to South Carolina, offered about $45 
billion for AirTouch in a move to strengthen its footing to compete 
with AT&AMP;T Corp.'s flat-rate cellular plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone quickly counter-offered with a $55 billion  
cash-and-stock deal. Negotiations with AirTouch kicked off 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders hoping for a three-way bidding war, were disappointed by  
MCI WorldCom's withdrawal and sent AirTouch stock down $3 to $79 a 
share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone's U.S. stock fell $3.12 1/2 to $173.12 1/2 a share on the  
NYSE, where Bell Atlantic's stock rose 62 1/2 cents to $56.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Maris Misses Hall of Fame Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Maris missed the Hall of Fame ballot cut  
and will be missing from the list of candidates considered by the 
veterans committee March 2 in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Maris, whose record of 61 home runs was broken last season by  
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, was among as many as 100 players 
dropped by the screening committee, which cuts the list of 
candidates to between 10 and 15 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those believed to be favorites on this year's ballot are  
Orlando Cepeda, Gil Hodges, Dom DiMaggio and Bill Mazeroski. Only 
one can be elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1991, the Veterans Committee had no restrictions on  
candidates. Then a rule was passed requiring the committee to limit 
consideration to players who had received 100 votes or 60 percent 
of the votes cast in any single Baseball Writers Association 
election. Also eligible is any pre-1946 player with 10 years in the 
major leagues. Players not elected in 15 years on the BBWAA ballot 
are passed to the Veterans Committee after an additional three-year 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans Committee is composed of 15 members -- five Hall of  
Famers, five executives and five media members. Current members are 
players Yogi Berra, Juan Marichal, Stan Musial, Pee Wee Reese and 
Ted Williams; executives Buck O'Neill, Hank Peters, Bill White, Joe 
L. Brown and Buzzie Bavasi; and media Jerome Holtzman, Bob Broeg, 
Ken Coleman, Leonard Koppett and Allen Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee can elect one candidate in each of four categories  
-- players; umpires, executives and managers; 19th century players 
and personnel, and Negro Leaguers. Election requires 75 percent of 
the vote, the same as the BBWAA.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Coach Agrees to 7-Year Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA football coach Bob Toledo has agreed on  
a new seven-year contract that will pay him $578,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal runs through the 2005 season and includes a rollover  
clause, athletic director Peter Dalis said Friday. 
</P>

<P>
	UCLA finished 10-2, with losses in its last two games -- a defeat

argument over a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
	David Tyrone Adams, 19, entered the plea Thursday to  
second-degree murder. Sentencing guidelines call for three to five 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams allegedly used a 5-iron to strike Dale Leroy McElheny, 42,  
in 1997 after Adams made a U-turn in front of McElheny's car and 
the two got into an argument about it in a convenience store 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	McElheny died six weeks later from a reaction to medicine  
prescribed to prevent seizures during his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams' mother, Bonnie Adams, said her son acted in self-defense.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Officials May Step Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two officials involved in the city's  
successful bid to be host of the 2002 Winter Olympics were 
reportedly expected to step aside today in the midst of a 
wide-ranging bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, were involved in the  
bid that is now the target of four investigations into hundreds of 
thousands of dollars that went into scholarships and gifts for 
International Olympic Committee members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, is  
expected to leave voluntarily while Johnson, the panel's vice 
president, will be asked to resign, The Salt Lake Tribune reported 
today. KTVX-TV also quoted unidentified sources as saying Joklik 
and Johnson will step down. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known if the moves would be permanent.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a heck of a lot to say. The final decisions have  
not been made,'' Joklik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Associated Press learned Thursday that an African  
member of the IOC made $60,000 buying Utah property in an 
arrangement aided by a member of the Salt Lake organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo bought three luxury  
home parcels in Pleasant View, about 20 miles from the Olympic 
downhill race course. The September 1995 purchases of $25,000 each 
came three months after the IOC awarded Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was introduced to the seller, a home builder, by Bennie  
Smith, a bid committee and SLOC member who spent eight years wooing 
African IOC members whose votes were considered crucial for Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Brent Keller, a Weber County home builder, said he built a  
road to Ganga's land, put in utilities and a storm basin, and Ganga 
sold the lots for $45,000 each, one in 1997 and the other two in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics panel is trying to determine the source of the  
cash for Ganga's investment, a source close to the investigation 
said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Ganga in Paris, Brazzaville and Cameroon were  
unsuccessful. Smith did not return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Former U.S. Olympic Committee member Howard Peterson told USA  
Today that Salt Lake's gift-giving began in the 1980s, before the 
international bidding campaign, with at least three USOC board 
members receiving ``ski vacations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times today quoted unidentified investigators as  
saying Salt Lake Olympic officials made individual cash payments 
between $5,000 and $70,000 to IOC members from Africa and Latin 
America. It said investigators still were attempting to determine 
the exact number of payments, the amounts and the recipients and 
that some of the payments may have been legitimate reimbursement 
for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Tribune reported that at least three relatives of IOC  
members were hired by Salt Lake companies during the bid, with the 
bid committee largely paying the salary of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Olympics sponsor U S West said it will withhold a $5 million  
payment to SLOC until it answers questions about the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Pound, the International Olympic Committee vice president  
who is heading that organization's inquiry into the scandal, said 
it has the bulk of the evidence it needs. He said the panel could 
complete its investigation by the Jan. 23-24 target date. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it will not strip Salt Lake City of the Games.

<HEADLINE> After Lockout, NBA Must Face Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern's NBA had always enjoyed a  
reputation as a charmed league, never losing a game to a labor 
dispute in its 52-year history and earning billions from TV and 
sponsorship deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the league and Stern face the difficult task of rebuilding  
that image after a bitter six-month lockout cost them almost half 
the season and the good will of many fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern was a lightning rod for criticism during the lockout and  
his public image was sullied, but he should emerge as a winner in 
the years ahead. The new labor agreement gives him much greater 
control over financial matters and player discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout affected the reputations, futures and wallets of  
many others. Among the winners and losers: 
</P>
<P>
 *WINNERS:   	
</P>
<P>
	The owners: They put their collective trust in David Stern's  
hands and allowed the commissioner to strike a deal that will save 
them from themselves. Under the old labor agreement, Glen Taylor of 
Minnesota could set the market price by giving Kevin Garnett $126 
million. George Shinn of Charlotte did it a few years earlier by 
paying Larry Johnson $72 million. Now, however, there's a 
negotiated limit -- the maximum salaries agreed to by the union that 
are based upon years of service. Stern also held out against the 
union's luxury tax, thereby keeping multimillionaires like Paul 
Allen of Portland from being able to buy a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Granik: He was the ``designated bad guy,'' Stern said, and  
also could have been the fall guy if the owners actually had 
canceled the season. Instead, Granik passed his final test and 
showed himself worthy of succeeding Stern as commissioner someday 
in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
	The locked-up members of the Draft Class of '95: Garnett ($126  
million for six years), Rasheed Wallace ($80 million for six 
years), Bryant Reeves ($66 million for six years) and Michael 
Finley ($48 million for five years) chose long-term security over 
quick free agency. Not one of them had to sweat during the lockout 
or have his market value artificially limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Thorn: The owners gave Thorn, the league's discipline czar,  
a much larger hammer. They increased penalties for everything from 
on-court behavior to missing practices to skipping media sessions 
to missing the rookie orientation program. Washington Wizards owner 
Abe Pollin said gaining more control over such matters was as 
important to him as gaining cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Hunter: Yes, he gave up a lot. But he also achieved his  
goals of preventing a hard salary cap, maintaining a strong Larry 
Bird exception and taking care of the middle-class and minimum 
salaried players. 
</P>
<P>
 *LOSERS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing: He took a public relations beating by repeatedly  
putting his size 16s in his mouth, being seen as a hindrance to a 
deal and David Falk's puppet. Some of the criticism was unfair, and 
Ewing was a galvanizing force among the players themselves. 
Unfortunately, the public never got to see that side. 
</P>
<P>
	Class of '96 draft picks: No one will lose more money than the  
likes of Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray 
Allen and Antoine Walker. They can still get extensions worth $73 
million, but all five would have been looking at contracts that 
would have approached or surpassed Garnett's. Abdur-Rahim's deal 
with Vancouver, according to one agent, would have approached $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Class of '95 draft picks: Antonio McDyess and Damon Stoudamire  
also will end up with less money than they could have gotten under 
the old system, and in McDyess' case the loss is about $50 million 
over six years. The biggest loser of all from this class is Joe 
Smith, who reportedly turned down $80 million from Golden State 
before they traded him. He'll be lucky to get a third of that now. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloon payees: A handful of players were due to get balloon  
payments this season. Charles Oakley was rewarded for all his hard 
work for the Knicks with a $10 balloon payment, of which he'll lose 
more than $3.9 million. Terrell Brandon was due $7 million, of 
which he'll lose $2.73 million. Will Purdue loses $1.7 of his $4.4 
million and Muggsy Bogues loses $1.1 million of his $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Washouts: Lionel Simmons, the former LaSalle star who was a bust  
with the Sacramento Kings, was due $4.2 million. He'll lose $1.6 
million. Bobby Hurley, who was due to make $4.03 million from 
Vancouver, will lose $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Olowokandi and the Los Angeles Clippers: The No. 1 draft  
pick made a last-minute decision to sign in Europe, and he can't 
join the Clippers until Feb. 15 at the earliest. He'll miss his 
first training camp and the first two weeks of the season, then 
have to play catchup the rest of the season. The Clippers, 
meanwhile, won't have a legitimate starting center until Olowokandi 
arrives because they'll probably lose Ike Austin to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents: The big shots like Falk and Arn Tellem signed most of  
their clients to megabuck contracts under the old system, so they 
won't be hurt quite as badly as some have suggested. Other 
up-and-coming agents will be affected by the limitations on 
high-end salaries, and some of the best players won't need to pay 
an agent 4 percent if they can get a lawyer to negotiate their 
contracts for an hourly rate.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Wonder About Point Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Mike Shanahan can't figure why the Denver Broncos  
are so heavily favored over the Miami Dolphins Saturday, but he's 
not worrying about it. The Broncos say they ignore point spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson knows the reasons the Broncos are two-touchdown  
favorites over his Dolphins even though Miami beat the Broncos 
31-21 only 19 days ago at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that would concern a team from Miami is there,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Dolphins have won a road playoff game since  
1972. We don't play well in cold weather. This year we haven't 
played well on the road. We're physically not in good shape. We're 
playing in a place that is a tremendous home field advantage and 
that is Mile High Stadium. so anything you can think of doesn't 
make for a positive towards us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins (11-6) will show up at Mile High Stadium Saturday,  
banged up from their 24-17 win over Buffalo in the wild-card round 
but happy to still be alive for the AFC berth in the Super Bowl, to 
be played Jan. 31 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Broncos, who finished the regular season 14-2, this is  
their first playoff game, and they're wary because two years ago 
they lost at this stage as a huge favorite over Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	They then won the NFL title the hard way last season, winning at  
home as a wild-card team, winning two more games on the road, then 
beating Green Bay 31-24 in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	They were two-touchdown underdogs to the Packers in that game,  
which is why Shanahan disregards this week's odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dolphins can use that as incentive,'' he said. ``We don't  
pay any attention to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sideshow to this one is the second meeting in three weeks  
between John Elway and Dan Marino, who had met only once previously 
in 16 seasons since being the stars of the quarterback class of 
1983. If the Broncos lose, it could be Elway's final game -- he 
almost retired after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something that concerns me now,'' said Elway, who  
won't lack for money -- a mile-long strip two miles from the 
Broncos' training facility is lined with a collection of car 
dealerships bearing his name that he sold last year to Wayne 
Huizenga, the Dolphins' owner. 
</P>
<P>
	What does concern the Broncos is what happened at Miami Dec. 21,  
when Elway had his worst game of the season, Marino had his best, 
and Terrell Davis, the Broncos' 2,000-yard rusher, was limited to 
29 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, the Dolphins have lost two starting defensive  
linemen -- Jason Taylor and Tim Bowens. 
</P>
<P>
	Several others, including leading receiver O.J. McDuffie and  
tight end Troy Drayton, were hurt against Buffalo last week. 
McDuffie probably will play, Drayton probably won't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a question of us coming out flat and them  
coming out at their best,'' Denver fullback Howard Griffith said of 
that game, which took place a week after the Broncos' quest for an 
unbeaten season was ended by the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stopped the run and they had success covering our  
receivers one-on-one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that game, Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos' tight end, said  
Denver was 10-to-14 points better, but hadn't played that way. He 
reiterated that statement this week, something that made for 
bulletin-board material in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Broncos wondered why they're such big favorites.  
</P>
<P>
	The oddsmakers listened to Sharpe.

<HEADLINE> High School Coach Cancels Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- The Richmond High School basketball team  
may be undefeated this season, but their coach is unhappy that some 
players aren't making the grade off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ken Carter canceled all team-related activities, including  
practices and pep rallies, until the team's grades improve. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year coach postponed last Friday's non-league game  
and has threatened to forfeit next week's league opener if there is 
no improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids need to understand that working together is part of  
the process,'' Carter said. ``This is just a way of getting their 
attention. I wanted to show them that playing sports is just a 
small part of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of practicing this week, players are required to attend  
two-hour tutoring sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Wayne Oliver said he agreed Carter's decision was  
for the best, ``but I think we still need to practice. Not everyone 
has bad grades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement between players and coach, the students must  
maintain at least a 2.0 grade point average for each quarter, 
commit at least 10 hours a week to study time, attend all classes 
and sit in the front row of class. 
</P>
<P>
	``What coach Carter is doing is very courageous, and it supports  
the feeling of our administration wholeheartedly,'' vice principal 
Frank Fadelli said. ``Yeah, we're 13-0 right now, and our kids 
might think they're invincible, so this is a real wake-up call for 
them.''

	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) -- Crime is so bad in Ecuador's  
rough-and-tumble Pacific port of Guayaquil that the government 
declared a state of emergency Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree, which affects the entire province of Guayas with  
more than 2 million of Ecuador's 11 million people, means police 
and soldiers can enter homes without a warrant. It also suspends 
the right to free transit and allows cities to declare curfews, 
Guayas Governor Guillermo Lasso told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Guayaquil, located 275 miles southwest of the capital Quito, is  
Ecuador's largest city and has its highest crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders in Guayaquil had called for the tough measure  
after a crime wave in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Guayaquil's gas stations and shopping centers reported losses  
due to robberies doubled to $10,000 a day from December to January, 
said the Guayaquil Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of home break-ins and auto thefts also doubled over  
the same period, said chamber of commerce President Joaquin 
Zevallos.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Four heavily armed men robbed a Mexican  
police patrol car carrying payroll money Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three police agents and a payroll officer were riding in a  
patrol car when they were forced to stop by a pickup truck about a 
half-mile from their station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed men forced the officers to turn over the payroll --  
believed to be about $31,000 -- as well as the officers' guns and an 
automatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	They also took the car keys and the microphones of the police  
radios so the officers couldn't call for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they suspected the robbery was an inside job,  
because patrol cars rarely carry money.

	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- The neighboring South American  
countries of Suriname and French Guiana have agreed to joint 
measures to stem drug trafficking, robbery and other crimes along 
their border. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of talks, officials from the two countries agreed  
to establish regular meetings between law enforcement officials and 
planned to negotiate a treaty of judicial cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 330-mile border along the Maroni River is mostly undeveloped  
jungle. A series of robberies in December in eastern Suriname 
spurred officials to seek greater cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	French Guiana's ambassador to Suriname, Olivier Maitland Pelen,  
said cooperation must be broadened in fighting drug trafficking, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Suriname Police Commissioner Chandrikapersad Santhoki said  
police officials from the two countries will meet at least every 
three months.

<HEADLINE> TV Covers Opening of Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The interest in how the Senate decides to  
conduct the impeachment trial of President Clinton extends to the 
people who decide the next bed-hop or betrayal on television soap 
operas. 
</P>
<P>
	At ABC, executives who decide the daytime schedule met Thursday  
to talk about how an impeachment trial will affect the story lines 
of soap operas. They need to consider how a long trial that would 
lead to frequent program interruptions will affect viewers' 
attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate still hasn't decided how to proceed. Neither have  
most network executives. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS and NBC twice broke into regular programming Thursday  
for the first steps of the trial. The broadcasters and cable news 
networks were mindful of the historic nature of the events even if 
they were largely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras followed grim-faced senators signing their names to a  
promise to be impartial jurors, and watched House managers carry 
the articles of impeachment over to the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was to meet today to plan how the trial will proceed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone is a little bit on tenterhooks here because  
it would be nice to know,'' said Beth O'Connell, NBC's executive 
producer for special events. 
</P>
<P>
	After covering the trial's opening for about a half hour at 10  
a.m., the three broadcast networks returned again around 1 p.m. for 
the swearing in of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who will 
preside over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC are expected to cover most of  
any public Senate action on impeachment; big moments in the 
Lewinsky case have generally meant ratings bumps for the cable news 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	It's different for the networks, which must decide whether they  
want to cast aside daytime programming and its lucrative 
advertising for extensive coverage of a case polls say many 
Americans wish was over.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Top the Luxury Tax List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles must pay for their awful season.  
</P>
<P>
	After spending the most money in the major leagues last year and  
finishing with a losing record, the Orioles were socked Friday for 
the largest luxury tax bill in the major leagues: $3,138,621. 
</P>
<P>
	The money must be paid to the commissioner's office by Jan. 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which finished 79-83 and 35 games behind the  
first-place New York Yankees in the AL East, had a final payroll of 
$79,468,674 for luxury tax purposes, according to figures received 
by teams Friday and obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike conventional payroll figures, these are computed by using  
the average annual value of contracts instead of salaries for 
single seasons. They also include the entire 40-man roster plus 
$5,576,415 per team in benefits paid to players. 
</P>
<P>
	The luxury tax was adopted as part of the settlement following  
the 1994-95 strike and was designed to discourage spending by 
high-revenue teams. For the teams with the five highest payrolls, 
the tax is assessed at a 35 percent rate on the amount above the 
midpoint between teams Nos. 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees, who paid the highest 1997 tax at  
$4,431,180, lowered their tax bill to $684,390 but still managed to 
win the World Series and set a record for combined regular- and 
postseason wins, going 125-50. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had the third-highest tax, finishing behind Boston,  
which will pay $2,184,734 after winning the AL wild-card spot with 
a 92-70 record, 22 games behind the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which advanced to the NL championship series for the  
seventh straight time, has the fourth-highest tax at $495,625, 
followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, taken over by one of Rupert Murdoch's companies  
before the season, rose from 11th to fifth and will pay $49,593. 
The Dodgers' payroll was about $283,000 above the Cleveland 
Indians, who finished sixth in the payroll standings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first season of the tax, the Yankees were followed by  
Baltimore ($4,030,228), Cleveland ($2,065,496), Atlanta 
($1,299,957) and Florida ($139,607). 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will combine to pay $6,552,963 in tax, down from  
$11,966,468 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the top four or five spenders probably spent less on  
payroll than they would have without the tax, high-revenue teams 
are continuing to pull away from baseball's middle and lower class. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the tax is relatively ineffective as long as  
there are six high-spending teams, since the threshold 
automatically adjusts to the midpoint between the fifth and six 
teams. Owners originally hoped it would be $55 million last season 
but it wound up at $70,501,185. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, owners originally hoped the threshold would be $58.9  
million, but it will be at least $75,506,769, because of the 
automatic adjustment contained in the collective bargaining 
agreement. The tax rate drops to 34 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is scheduled to be the final year of the tax, some  
lawyers among both the players' association and management appear 
open to extending the tax as part of an overall extension of the 
labor agreement.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Snubs Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's president  
says he is determined to move forward with negotiations to end 34 
years of civil war, even though he was snubbed at the opening of 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, President Andres Pastrana could not help but look  
dejected after Manuel Marulanda, the leader of the Western 
hemisphere's most powerful rebel group, failed to appear at 
Thursday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	A groan of disappointment rose from the crowd of 5,000  
dignitaries and townspeople when a lower-level guerrilla commander 
stepped forward to read a speech by Marulanda, the 68-year-old 
patriarch of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombians have never seen Marulanda in public -- and his  
presence would have lent credibility to FARC claims that they are 
serious about ending the long conflict that claims thousands of 
lives every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the FARC has lost an opportunity,'' U.S. Ambassador  
Curtis Kamman, one of the hundreds of diplomats and foreign guests 
at the ceremony, said in an interview with RCN television. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana sat alone on a canopy-covered stage in the sun-drenched  
town square of San Vicente, before hundreds of diplomats, foreign 
guests and a national television audience. The plastic chair 
reserved for Marulanda beside him was empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to San Vicente del Caguan to keep my word,''  
Pastrana exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The absence of Manuel Marulanda Velez cannot be a reason to  
not go forward with the installation of the negotiating table,'' he 
said, later declaring that the peace talks have formally begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel commanders told Pastrana moments before the ceremony that  
FARC had decided the risk of a right-wing assassination attempt 
against Marulanda was too great, despite massive security by both 
rebel troops and presidential security guards in the town, 180 
miles southwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's ceremony, a team of four government-appointed  
negotiators met with rebel commanders in a church sacristy to 
discuss an agenda and timetable for the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite high hopes, prospects for the talks are tenuous: FARC is  
at its strongest ever and growing, with 15,000 regulars controlling 
40 percent of the countryside. The movement has refused a 
cease-fire ahead of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marulanda's six-page speech read at the ceremony showed little  
sign of reconciliation, launching into a scathing indictment of the 
Colombian government, which it accused of a history of duplicity in 
past peace overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	The guerrillas recalled the case of the Patriotic Union, a FARC  
political offshoot formed in 1984 that saw 3,000 party activists, 
dozens of elected officials and two presidential candidates 
slaughtered. Past peace attempts in 1982-84 and 1991-92 both 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marulanda's conditions for peace include the dismantling of  
right-wing paramilitary groups and the exchange of 252 jailed 
rebels for more than 350 police and soldiers captured since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long term, he seeks wealth redistribution in a country  
where the top 5 percent earn 30 times more than the bottom 5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana, meanwhile, has taken a risk making concessions to draw  
FARC into talks. Last month, after rebel demands, he withdrew all 
government troops from San Vicente and a surrounding area the size 
of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel speech also accused the U.S. government of getting  
involved in the Colombian military's counterinsurgency effort under 
the guise of stepped up anti-narcotics aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has a stake in the peace talks, since FARC  
rebels protect many rural production centers of cocaine, of which 
Colombia is the world's biggest exporter. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have talked with the rebels about promoting  
alternative crops to coca in areas under FARC control as part of 
any peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marulanda's absence from the ceremony dampened a festive  
atmosphere in the town. Pastrana returned to Bogota immediately 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good. It worries me,'' said Gilberto Toro,  
president of the national mayors' federation. ``This is a president 
who has made every effort for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the ceremony, rebel fighters shook hands and chatted with  
townspeople and reporters eager to see the legendary guerrilla 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel deceived,'' said Luz Dari Pinzon, a 27-year-old  
housewife from San Vicente. ``I wanted to greet him, to hug him and 
to ask him to help us.''

<HEADLINE>  Shoving Ends China Rights Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rival Chinese dissident groups exchanged  
shoves and shouts Friday after one group of exiles told a 
congressional panel that conditions have worsened dramatically in 
the seven months since President Clinton's visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before the House International Relations Committee  
demonstrated the fractious nature of the Chinese dissident 
community. Protesters complained that they hadn't been given a 
chance to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance, Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing,  
criticized those who testified, insisting that China punishes only 
those who break its laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei Jingsheng, who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons, told the  
committee that there had been ``a constant stream of arrests'' 
since Clinton's visit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not act swiftly, there will soon be more and more  
mothers who have lost their sons, wives who have lost their mothers 
and children who have lost their parents,'' Wei said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other dissidents called on Congress to consider imposing  
economic sanctions on China, 20 years after the two nations 
formally established diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members of both parties seized on the testimony to  
appeal to administration officials to maintain a hard line next 
Tuesday in talks in Washington with China's assistant foreign 
minister, Wang Guangya. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration policy toward China is ``a pathetic  
failure,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee released a recent report by Amnesty International  
concluding that ``while there has been minor, and mostly symbolic, 
progress in a few areas, in most areas the situation has actually 
gotten worse in the last three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not one Tiananmen Square prisoner has been released since  
Clinton's visit, China has taken no steps to undertake a review of 
political prisoners and continues the use of torture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing ended in melee between rival dissident groups,  
provoked by those who complained they hadn't been given a chance to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee staff members sought to keep shoving and shirt-pulling  
antagonists apart until police were summoned to restore order and 
clear the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The fracas began after shouting in Chinese broke out. Looking  
perplexed, chairman Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., asked if anyone 
could translate. But without waiting for an answer, he gaveled the 
hearing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman quickly ducked out of the room as the shouting  
intensified and chairs were knocked over. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, in particular, criticized the committee's  
decision to invite Wei and three other former political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are outraged with the placement of the wrong persons on the  
panel,'' said a statement issued by a group of Washington-based 
Chinese dissidents who oppose what they view as Wei's 
self-proclaimed leadership of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Washington leaders of the Chinese Democracy Movement had  
broken with Wei late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Lipson, a spokesman for the committee, said that Gilman  
was not aware of the rivalries among the dissidents or that a 
protest had been planned, and was glad no one was hurt or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at the National Press Club, Ambassador Li scoffed at  
Wei, calling him a criminal who was allowed to come to the United 
States in 1997 for medical treatment and ended up testifying on 
Capitol Hill. Wei spent most of 18 years in Chinese prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``In China, we practice the rule of law,'' Li said. ``If you  
don't violate the criminal code, you don't get arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Li said those who talk most loudly about human rights ``didn't  
say one word about victims of flooding last year and didn't take 
any action at all.'' He said Americans should respect China's 
system as different from that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are differences among people and we have to get used to  
that,'' he said

<HEADLINE> Nanny Pleads Guilty to Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nanny who took a Brooklyn boy with cerebral  
palsy to South Carolina and set off a frenzied search by his 
parents and authorities has pleaded guilty to conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Theresa Goldberg could receive up to five years and 11 months in  
prison when she is sentenced March 23 for plotting to kidnap 
6-year-old Chaim Weill, a wheelchair-bound boy she had taken care 
of for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to do what was best for the child,'' her attorney,  
Jerome Karp, said after her plea Thursday. ``She just went about it 
the wrong way, that's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goldberg, 40, had taken Chaim for a walk last October when  
they disappeared, sending neighbors in his Hasidic community into 
the streets seeking clues. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents arrested Mrs. Goldberg in a suburb of Richmond, Va.,  
two days later when she and the boy were found sleeping in a car. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldberg, 47, told the FBI that his wife had been talking  
for months about abducting the child, court papers said. He said 
his wife planned to take Chaim to South Carolina and that once she 
found a place to stay, she would call him and he would send money 
to her, the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaim's parents, who are Hasidic Jews, said Chaim's sidelocks  
had been cut off and his yarmulke thrown away so he wouldn't be 
recognized. Hasidic Jews believe in a biblical prohibition against 
cutting males' side curls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goldbergs had originally faced federal kidnapping and  
conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goldberg admitted only to plotting to kidnap Chaim, while  
her husband pleaded guilty to not reporting the crime. He could 
receive up to 21 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Karp denied reports that Mrs. Goldberg, a Jehovah's Witness, had  
wanted to take the boy to South Carolina for ``holistic healing.'' 
He said she simply believed that he was not getting enough 
attention from his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``She loved that kid,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Sweep Snowboard Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPPER MOUNTAIN, Colo. (AP) -- Mayumi Fukuda won the women's  
snowboard cross event in a photo finish Friday and Drew Neilson 
took the men's contest by a wider margin as Canadians dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The race jury looked at photos and footage of the finish before  
giving Fukuda the verdict over Julie Zell of Jackson, Wyo. Fukuda 
and Neilson earned $10,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowboard cross is a combination of Alpine racing and freestyle  
as riders start four or six in a group, then race down a course 
that includes bumps, banked turns and other obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw it, I knew that course was just made for me,''  
Fukuda said. ``Copper did a great job because the course had 
everything -- air (jumps), speed, obstacles, lots of steep 
sections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Canadian survived a near spill at the finish as  
she looked back to check on her three pursuers in the final round 
and fell back on her board. Zell charged as Fukuda stumbled and 
they hit the finish together, with local favorite Sara Osterberg 
not far astern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't believe I'd won until I got the check,'' Fukuda said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neilson edged newcomer Adam Smith of Bend, Ore., who was  
competing in his first snowboard cross. Ben Wainwright of Canada 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never figured I'd make it through the first heat,'' Smith  
said. ``I just tried to relax and enjoy it. It was fun.''

<HEADLINE> Joaquin Phoenix Makes it on Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joaquin Phoenix can feel good about making it on  
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	While initially overshadowed by his older brother, River, who  
died of a drug overdose in 1993 while partying at the Viper Room in 
Los Angeles, Joaquin Phoenix endured the glare of media attention 
and broke through to stardom with his role in 1995's ``To Die For'' 
with Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in Cosmopolitan magazine's February issue, the  
24-year-old actor says he's not offended by the media labeling him 
his brother's heir apparent in acting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my brother,'' he says. ``I would never NOT want  
to be associated with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's just finished four back-to-back films which began last fall  
with ``Clay Pigeons'' with Vince Vaughn. His upcoming film is 
``8MM,'' with Nicolas Cage.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Defensive Back Bly Going Pro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Dre' Bly, North Carolina's most  
decorated player ever, will leave school early to enter the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Bly, a defensive back who was redshirted his first year, has  
filed the necessary paperwork with the NFL, school officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a challenge,'' he said. ``With the way I finished  
last year, there are non-believers out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm basically back where I was when I headed into college.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bly entered North Carolina as a relatively anonymous player, but  
by the 1997 season opener he had earned a starting spot at 
cornerback and quickly became one of the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bly, selected to the AP All-America second team in 1998, set an  
Atlantic Coast Conference record for career interceptions with 20, 
despite playing only three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	His third year was sub-par compared to the two previous years,  
and Bly plans to cure any lingering doubts about his ability during 
the annual NFL Combine on Feb. 18-22 in Indianapolis. He's already 
begun working out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to show that those first two years weren't a fluke,''  
Bly said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-OSU Track Star Convicted of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The status of former Ohio State track star  
Chris Nelloms in no way affected how a case accusing him of rape 
was prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if he is a track star,'' said Assistant  
Montgomery County Prosecutor Angela Frydman. ``I don't care if he 
is a surgeon. I don't care if he is a homeless man. I don't care if 
he is the president of the United States. If you commit a crime, 
then you must be held accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms was found guilty Friday of raping a young girl multiple  
times and faces a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	When the verdict from the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court  
jury was read, Nelloms dropped his head. His fiancee, Tina Smith, 
began sobbing from the second row of the courtroom and was escorted 
out by a friend. The verdict also left Nelloms' mother, Gloria 
Nelloms, in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guilty verdict just took everything out of me,'' Shelly  
Brown, Nelloms' sister-in-law, said later. ``From what I heard in 
the courtroom, there was no evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-year-old girl accused Nelloms of sexually assaulting her in  
homes in Dayton and Lexington, Ky., from 1995 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms was convicted of seven counts of rape of a child younger  
than 13 and one count of felonious sexual penetration of a child 
under 13. He was found innocent of attempted rape of a child under 
13, a charge stemming from an allegation that he attempted to 
sodomize the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Kessler revoked Nelloms' bond and ordered him held in  
jail pending sentencing. Nelloms was led from the courtroom in 
handcuffs. Prosecutors say a life sentence is mandatory, but 
Nelloms will be eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jon Paul Rion said he plans to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disturbed by this verdict,'' Rion said. ``Clearly  
this case came down to who was telling the truth and who was not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 26, of suburban Trotwood, set school records at Ohio  
State and tried unsuccessfully to qualify for the 1996 Olympics in 
the 200-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury heard four days of testimony and deliberated for five  
hours over two days before reaching a verdict. The 12-year-old girl 
testified on the second day of the trial.

	Senate Sets Impeachment Trial Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Friday unanimously voted on rules  
for President Clinton's impeachment trial with opening arguments 
set for next week. Moments after the 100-0 vote, a formal summons 
was dispatched to the White House, commanding Clinton to ``abide 
by, obey and perform such orders, directions and judgments'' that 
the Senate dictates in the name of the Constitution. At the White 
House, spokesman Gregory Craig pledged a ``vigorous, successful and 
complete defense.''

	U.S. Says Iraqi Forces Took Hard Hit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon Friday doubled its estimate of  
damage to Iraq from U.S. airstrikes. It said the December attacks 
set back Saddam Hussein's weapons program two years and killed 600 
to 2,000 Republican Guards, including key leaders. ``The 
effectiveness was even greater than we first thought,'' Marine Gen. 
Anthony Zinni, head of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, said at the 
Pentagon.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed Friday  
at its second new high of 1999, rising 105.56 to 9,643.32. 
Investors were encouraged by a report that the unemployment rate 
averaged just 4.5 percent for 1998, the lowest since 1969, pushing 
the market past 9,600 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq was up 
18.82 at 2,344.91.

	Gore Defends President  
</P>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, linking himself  
ever closer to President Clinton, said key GOP leaders ``are 
completely obsessed'' with impeachment. ``I know there is a big 
disconnect between part of the Republican Party, including the 
Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, for example, 
and the rest of the American people where President Clinton is 
concerned,'' Gore told The Associated Press. 

</P>
<P>
	Winter Storms Strike Again  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Schoolchildren in several states got an early  
start on their weekends as snow, sleet and freezing rain pelted 
much of the nation's eastern half, slowing travel and undoing the 
recent work of busy road crews. Many areas were getting their third 
blast of snowfall in less than a week, including last weekend's 
monster storm that paralyzed parts of the Midwest. As much as 8 
inches fell in western Maryland. Flights were delayed at several 
airports. President Clinton, who had made an economic speech and 
toured an auto show, had to leave Detroit for Washington on Air 
Force One about 30 minutes late because of the weather. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Court OKs Plea Bargains  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A U.S. appeals court ruled Friday that prosecutors  
can offer plea bargains in exchange for testimony, overturning a 
federal court decision that had declared the practice illegal. 
``It's a great day for federal prosecutors across this nation,'' 
said Linda McMahan, U.S. attorney for Colorado. The earlier 
decision by a panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had 
shocked the Justice Department. The original ruling against plea 
bargains was put on hold until the full Denver-based appeals court 
could decide the matter.

	Cuba Dismisses Impact of U.S. Plan  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's parliament speaker Ricardo Alarcon  
dismissed a U.S. move to ease the embargo on his country as ``a 
public relations maneuver,'' saying Friday the measures announced 
this week by President Clinton would have little effect on Cuba's 
economy. Earlier, Economy Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez also 
criticized Clinton's decision, which eases a few elements of the 
U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba while still maintaining the 
bulk of the blockade.

	INS Deports Record Number in 1998  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. government sent away a record number  
of illegal immigrants last year, deporting 171,154 foreigners with 
criminal records or other disqualifying factors. Removals for the 
fiscal year that ended in September were up 50 percent from the 
1997 record of 114,386, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
said. The total exceeded the agency's goal of 123,000 deportations. 
The figures don't include the 1.5 million cases of illegal 
immigrants turned back at U.S. borders.

	LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) -- Vinny Pazienza, a former five-time world  
champion, stopped Undra White at 2:55 of the ninth round Friday 
night in a non-title super middleweight bout. Pazienza (44-7) was 
ahead on all three scorecards when referee Michael Ortega stopped 
the bout. Pazienza had White (21-9) pinned on the ropes and threw 
several unanswered punches.

<HEADLINE> Willey Case Witness Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Julie Hiatt Steele, the friend whose testimony  
undermined Kathleen Willey's claim that President Clinton made an 
unwanted sexual advance, has been indicted on charges of lying and 
obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was charged Thursday with three counts of obstruction  
of justice and one count of false statements by a grand jury in 
Alexandria, Va., working with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the indictment accused Ms. Steele of filing  
a false affidavit in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against 
Clinton, lying to two grand juries and attempting to influence the 
testimony of other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just shocked,'' Ms. Steele was quoted as saying in today's  
editions of the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ``I can't believe it's all 
come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home today, Mrs. Willey said, ``I regret that she  
brought this upon herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Luque, a lawyer for Ms. Steele, called the indictment  
reckless and said it ``is a glaring example of Mr. Starr's gross 
abuse of his prosecutorial power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Starr has clearly timed this baseless accusation in a  
transparent attempt to unfairly influence the pending impeachment 
proceeding,'' Luque said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Luque said she began receiving phone calls from reporters three  
days ago indicating that Ms. Steele was to be indicted and accused 
Starr of ``unlawfully leaking confidential grand jury information 
to the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers had used Ms. Steele's testimony in an  
effort to cast doubt on the credibility of Mrs. Willey, a former 
White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance toward her in the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies Mrs. Willey's accusation, which became a focus of  
Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. In his testimony in the 
Jones lawsuit, the president said Mrs. Willey ``was not telling the 
truth'' and that her credibility had been ``pretty well 
shattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment notes that a lawyer for Clinton approached Ms.  
Steele in January 1998 to get her to file the affidavit and that 
she initially refused, then changed her mind. Ms. Steele eventually 
filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit alleging that Mrs. Willey 
never told her about the alleged advance as she had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr alleged Thursday that the affidavit and Ms. Steele's  
subsequent testimony before two federal grand juries were false. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele ``well knew and believed'' Mrs. Willey had told her  
about the alleged sexual advance shortly after it happened and 
``even related information about Mrs. Willey's account of the 
incident to several of defendant Steele's friends'' as early as 
1993, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also contend that Ms. Steele lied to FBI agents  
working for Starr and ``attempted in the Eastern District of 
Virginia to influence the testimony of one or more witnesses in the 
grand jury investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charges that Ms. Steele ``repeatedly attempted''  
to convince two friends that she had not told them about the Willey 
incident. At the time, one of the friends was being sought by FBI 
agents for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's nationally televised accusations of an unwanted  
sexual advance eventually became part of Starr's investigation into 
Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and 
allegations that the Jones lawsuit was obstructed by supporters of 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele and Mrs. Willey testified before the grand jury in  
Washington that Starr used during the Lewinsky investigation. 
Starr's office then used a separate grand jury in the northern 
Virginia suburbs of Washington to further investigate Ms. Steele 
and other allegations that Mrs. Willey may have been threatened and 
intimidated by unknown persons after her story became public. 
</P>
<P>
	Each obstruction charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in  
prison and $250,000 in fines. The false statement charge carries a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele came to public attention when she was quoted in a  
Newsweek article in August 1997 that first brought Mrs. Willey's 
allegation to light. Ms. Steele contended she lied to the Newsweek 
reporter at Mrs. Willey's request, and told the reporter that Mrs. 
Willey had confided to her about the alleged episode with Clinton. 
She later told the reporter she had lied. The magazine noted the 
allegation and the switch in the same story.

<HEADLINE>  Georgetown Coach Thompson Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Thompson always told his players that if  
basketball gets in the way of more important things, it's time to 
put basketball aside. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he tearfully took his own advice.  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's startling resignation as Georgetown basketball coach  
came in a way no one would have predicted. He isn't leaving for the 
NBA. It isn't because his team appears headed for a losing season. 
It isn't because he's fed up with NCAA academic rules -- or with a 
'90s generation of players whose behavior has tarnished his 
program's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Thompson quit to deal with marriage problems, bringing  
a sudden and sad end to a storied college coaching career that 
helped set a standard for academic and athletic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going through a problem with marriage right now,''  
Thompson said. ``And I owe it to my family to address that, not 
just to myself and to my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't deal with that as a distraction.''  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and his wife, Gwen, who have been married for 32 years,  
separated after a fire damaged their home three years ago. Thompson 
filed for divorce in October 1997, and the hurt was evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' Thompson said. ``I can't give all the  
attention right now to my job that I need to give, and that burns 
the hell out of me. I don't mind losing, that goes with the 
territory, but I want to make sure I give my best effort if I lose. 
I can't do things halfheartedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his statements, Thompson's wife said she was  
``saddened that John felt it necessary to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am also saddened to hear that this process is taking such a  
toll on him,'' she said in a statement released by her lawyer. 
``But John filed for the divorce, not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case remains open as negotiations to resolve it continue,  
said her lawyer, Deborah Luxenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Esherick, an assistant under Thompson since 1982, will  
debut as Georgetown's new coach Saturday at home against 
Providence. Georgetown president Leo J. O'Donovan said Esherick 
will shortly be signed to a new, long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Thompson, he will stay at Georgetown, doing ``whatever  
Father O'Donovan wants me to do.'' O'Donovan called Thompson the 
school's ``coach emeritus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson broke the news to his players Friday morning. He cried  
when he walked out of the room. Some of the players were already in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock,'' senior guard Joe Touomou said. ``Some guys  
were crying and stuff. He's like a father, so the reaction was 
obvious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Thompson's former stars, including Patrick Ewing, Alonzo  
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, also attended the news conference at 
McDonough Gymnasium, a small facility almost overwhelmed by all the 
banners the team has earned over Thompson's 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Esherick also was tearful, saying he tried to talk Thompson out  
of resigning. The 42-year-old former Georgetown player said he 
would have been content to remain an assistant for another 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is not happy,'' Esherick said. ``I'm not happy for  
myself, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I consider it an 
honor, and I also consider myself a complete fool to follow in his 
footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown was not a major basketball program when Thompson  
arrived in 1972. His first team went 12-14, the second 13-13. Every 
team since has been invited to postseason tournament play -- 20 
NCAAs and four NITs. He won the national championship with Ewing in 
1984, and his Hoyas were runners-up in 1982 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's record is 596-239, a .713 winning percentage, and he  
is 10th among active coaches in victories. Furthermore, Thompson's 
players almost always graduated on time -- 97 percent of his players 
who stayed four years left with a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last decade or so hasn't been the same. Thompson led the  
U.S. Olympic team to a disappointing bronze medal in the 1988 
Olympics, and the Hoyas haven't been to a Final Four in 14 years. 
Players began to leave Georgetown before graduating, and several 
made ugly off-the-court headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas now have the lowest graduation rate for men's  
basketball players among D.C.-area Division I schools, according to 
the latest NCAA statistics. This year's team (7-6, 0-4 Big East) is 
struggling in part because Shernard Long, last year's leading 
scorer, was suspended for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been afraid of the challenges of young people  
today,'' Thompson said. ``In fact, that has always stimulated me. 
... This is not something that was planned. This is not something 
that was plotted. It has nothing to do with our record. It's 
personal.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons, Jets: Rare in Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons and New York Jets, unaccustomed to  
postseason pressure, will be among four NFL division champions at 
home for playoff games this weekend against wild-card round 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Atlanta will face the San Francisco 49ers, the team  
the Falcons beat for the NFC West championship. In Saturday's other 
game, defending Super Bowl champion Denver plays Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, who became the last team to win a division  
championship when they captured the AFC East, play AFC Central 
champion Jacksonville Sunday. Then Arizona, another infrequent 
playoff team, is at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
                        	 *Saturday's Games    	
</P>
<P>
                        	 *49ers at Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third meeting of the year between these NFC  
West teams. They split the first two, each winning at home and both 
are 10-1 against common opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco has the league's top offense, although running  
back Garrison Hearst reinjured a hamstring while rushing for 128 
yards during last week's dramatic victory over Green Bay and is 
listed as questionable. Atlanta, on the other hand, has a healthy 
Jamal Anderson, who led the NFC with 1,846 yards rushing, ready to 
roll against a beat-up 49ers defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have only two playoff victories in their history but  
have won 20 of their last 24 games over two seasons, the best 
record in the NFL during that span. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers come in riding the momentum of a dramatic victory last  
week against Green Bay when Steve Young's 25-yard pass to Terrell 
Owens with three seconds to play eliminated the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
                       	 *Dolphins at Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Denver 31-21 three weeks ago as Dan Marino threw four  
touchdown passes. So how come the Broncos are 11 1/2-point favorites? 
Well, the fact that Denver has won 17 straight home games might 
have something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is within reach of some formidable playoff records. He  
needs 24 yards to reach 4,000 for his playoff career and one TD 
pass for 31 to move past Terry Bradshaw for second place on the 
career postseason list. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got the right defense to pick on. Denver allowed 228.8  
yards passing per game and 28 touchdown passes during the regular 
season -- 26th in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Terrell Davis, who led the league in rushing with 2,008  
yards and 23 TDs, managed only 29 yards against the Dolphins last 
month. John Elway finished second in the AFC with a 93.0 
quarterback rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos lost two of their final three games after winning  
the first 13. 
</P>
<P>
                         	 *Sunday's Games    	
</P>
<P>
                         	 *Jaguars at Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	This is the first home playoff game for the Jets since 1986.  
That was also the last time the team won a postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde, signed as a backup quarterback, became New  
York's starter early and posted a 12-1 record. He led the AFC with 
a 101.6 rating and team-record 29 TD passes. The Jets had a pair of 
1,000-yard receivers in Keyshawn Johnson (1,131) and Wayne Chrebet 
(1,083) and a 1,000-yard rusher in Curtis Martin (1,287). 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Fred Taylor rushed for 162 yards in Jacksonville's  
first-round victory over New England. Mark Brunell returned at 
quarterback and was 14-for-34 for 161 yards and 1 TD after missing 
three weeks with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a matchup of old coaching buddies. Jacksonville's Tom  
Coughlin was an assistant on Bill Parcells' staff with the New York 
Giants from 1988-90, when the team won its second Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
                      	 *Cardinals at Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, coming off the franchise's first playoff victory in  
more than half a century, faces a huge challenge at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings have won eight straight, are undefeated at home, had  
the league's best record (15-1) and scored an NFL-record 556 
points. Quarterback Randall Cunningham led the NFL with a 106.0 
rating and was second in the league with a career-high 34 TD 
passes. Robert Smith ran for 1,187 yards and Randy Moss led the NFC 
with a rookie-record 17 TDs and was second in the conference with 
1,313 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there's the defense.  
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle John Randle posted 10 1/2 sacks, his seventh  
straight 10-sack season, and cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock was second 
in the NFC with a career-high seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals eliminated Dallas last week after squeezing into  
the playoffs as a wild-card on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Frank Sanders led the NFC with 90 receptions and had  
three catches for 72 yards in the victory over Dallas. Quarterback 
Jake Plummer, who has become the sparkplug of the Cardinals, was 
19-for-36 for 213 yards and two TDs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Trim Medicare Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials are warning  
health care providers that the president's proposed budget may 
further trim Medicare payments, despite their complaints that 
reimbursements for elderly Americans' health care are already too 
small. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping for some relief, but ... we were told that they  
were in fact considering some additional reductions,'' Richard J. 
Pollack of the American Hospital Association said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent discussions, administration officials have revealed no  
specifics about how deep the new cuts might be or which types of 
health care services would be affected, Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget office and Health and Human Services  
officials declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration warning, however, is one of the first clues  
about where Clinton may look for possible savings after a recent 
string of announcements of new spending proposals for his fiscal 
2000 budget, due Feb. 1. So far, Clinton has proposed new spending 
on defense, after school child care and tax credits for families 
caring for a disabled relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he plans to pay for some of the initiatives by  
closing tax loopholes, but so far it is unclear where the rest of 
the money would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	The task is complicated by Clinton's call for government  
surpluses to be set aside for Social Security, which like Medicare 
faces financial jeopardy as the nation's huge baby boom generation 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, any new Medicare cuts would directly benefit the  
nation's health insurance program for the elderly and disabled by 
slowing the flow of money out of its fast-dwindling trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Clinton and Congress have been looking for ways  
to save Medicare money in the short term to buy time to work on a 
more longterm solution. 
</P>
<P>
	But because Medicare's reserves are invested in Treasury bonds,  
any money saved also stays available -- in the short term, at least 
-- for general government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent studies indicate that health care providers --  
such as hospitals -- have been overpaid by Medicare in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Improper payments to health plans for administrative expenses  
could be costing Medicare as much as $1 billion a year, the HHS 
inspector general said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another inspector general's report estimated that Medicare may  
be losing 11 cents of every dollar to fraud and payment errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, last month a panel of private experts that advises  
Congress on Medicare payment rates reported that hospital profit 
margins for inpatient care averaged 16 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the panel's chairwoman, Gail Wilensky, notes that those  
numbers don't reflect $115 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years 
that Congress and Clinton agreed in their 1997 balanced budget 
deal. Most of that money will be subtracted from future payment 
increases that hospitals, health plans and doctors had been 
expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be reticent to recommend additional reductions now,''  
Wilensky said. ``I think you ought to look to see what you've done 
before you do yet more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, medical groups, along with some patients, are  
pressuring lawmakers to reverse some of the 1997 cuts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, health plans that enroll Medicare beneficiaries say  
inadequate government payments forced them to drop more than 
400,000 elderly and disabled patients this year. The American 
Association of Health Plans is in the midst of a 50-city tour, 
telling senior citizens' groups to contact members of Congress to 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings are planned to look into the disputes,  
but AAHP spokeswoman Susan Pisano said providers are girding to 
fight for every Medicare dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has been made very clear to us is that there will be a  
lot of discussion this year on Capitol Hill about payments, and 
every group will be expected to make its case,'' Pisano said.

<HEADLINE> Tussaud Making Rhys-Jones Waxwork </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- It had to happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the announcement that Sophie Rhys-Jones was  
engaged to Prince Edward, the Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum said 
Friday that fashioning a replica of her had become ``a top 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rhys-Jones' long-term relationship with the youngest son of  
Queen Elizabeth II already had gained the attention of the museum, 
one of London's premier tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been on our list of people to make into waxworks for  
about a year,'' spokeswoman Beth Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lockwood said the museum would decide in two weeks whether  
to proceed with the replica, and would approach Ms. Rhys-Jones 
before beginning work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't make a waxwork without the permission of the  
individual, but no one has yet refused us,'' Ms. Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	If all systems are go, Ms. Rhys-Jones, 33, would have to pose  
for an hour and have measurements and photographs taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Each waxwork costs about $50,000 to make and six months to  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	No date has yet been set for the royal wedding.

	Unemployment Drops to 4.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of year-end hiring returned the  
nation's unemployment rate to 4.3 percent in December and helped 
produce in 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four 
decades. The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.4 percent in 
November, returned to the level reached in April and May and, 
before that, in 1970, the Labor Department said today. For the 
year, unemployment averaged 4.5 percent, the lowest since 3.5 
percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. President Clinton 
celebrated the report during a luncheon address to the Detroit 
Economic Club. ``This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats,'' 
he said, noting historically low rates for blacks and Hispanics.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mentor Graphics Corp. ended its bitter  
five-month takeover battle for Quickturn Design Systems Inc. today, 
clearing the way for Quickturn to be sold to its white-knight 
bidder Cadence Design Systems Inc. for $271.3 million. Mentor 
Graphics withdrew its $15 a share offer for Quickturn and canceled 
the special shareholders' meeting scheduled today after it became 
clear Mentor didn't have enough support to oust Quickturn's board 
of directors. Mentor Graphics and Cadence both make computer

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is being investigated by a  
federal grand jury over alleged irregularities in maintenance and 
repair records for some jetliners, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 
reported today. The criminal investigation involving the federal 
Department of Transportation is centered around allegations that 
maintenance and repair work was recorded as having been done when 
it was not, according to the copyright story, which cites 
unidentified sources close the case. Seattle-based Alaska Airlines 
has never had a fatality. The carrier said it has not been given 
specifics of the inquiry, but the Federal Aviation Administration 
has assured it that the probe is not related to air safety or 
airworthiness.

	PARIS (AP) -- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin asked Japan today to  
work with all 11 euro-currency countries, not just France, to 
minimize exchange rate fluctuations. Japanese Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi and French President Jacques Chirac yesterday urged greater 
cooperation on currency exchange, saying such reforms are needed to 
stabilize world financial markets. But Jospin stressed that any 
such efforts needed to be broad-based because since the New Year 
the euro has been the currency of 11 different countries, 
supplanting the financial sovereignty of each one.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mergers, corporate spinoffs and name changes may  
affect the newspaper stock listings and ticker symbols you've 
followed for years. For instance, the takeover of Amoco Corp. by 
British Petroleum Co. PLC was completed as 1998 ended. The new 
company is called BP Amoco PLC, with a trading symbol of BPA, and 
appears in newspaper New York Stock Exchange lists as BP Amoco. 
Although known as Alcoa since 1929, Aluminum Company of America, 
the world's largest producer of aluminum, is making it official by 
changing its name to Alcoa Inc. The Pittsburgh-based company made 
the change to reflect the global scope of the company.

	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Oil company executives smeared black oil  
on their faces Friday to celebrate the opening of a new pipeline 
bringing crude from Azerbaijan's rich Caspian Sea fields across 
Georgia and on to world markets. The new pipeline is relatively 
small but is another key marker in the development of the Caspian 
fields, which hold reserves thought second only to the Persian Gulf 
but have lacked an adequate pipeline system for exporting. The line 
begins in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, on the Caspian Sea and heads 
west across the country to neighboring Georgia, culminating at 
Georgia's Black Sea port of Supsa.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Money for FDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is seeking to  
infuse more cash into the agency that monitors the safety of food 
and drugs because of worries it's losing the ability to fully 
safeguard Americans' health. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration says it's $165 million in the  
hole because of six years of budgets that didn't keep up with 
inflation. It's short 500 employees, and needs more specialized 
scientists to evaluate increasingly complex therapies. Its 
inspectors can check the safety of only a fraction of medical and 
food factories every year. And its research, which helps ensure new 
products are safe, has been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot do everything that is expected of us,'' FDA  
Associate Commissioner Linda Suydam told industry lawyers recently, 
in an unusually stark admission. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's unclear if Congress, which has long battled the agency  
over issues such as tobacco, will go along. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton officials say more FDA money is a priority this year,  
but won't yet give a total. The first chunk: An extra $30 million 
that would increase food safety by hiring 60 more inspectors and 
better monitoring foods imported from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is responsible for $1 trillion in products -- from  
drugs, medical devices and donated blood to foods and cosmetics -- 
that Americans use daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as it sounds an alarm, the agency insists consumers  
shouldn't panic. It has reshuffled enough resources to deal with 
serious health threats and properly approve new medicines, its two 
top jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has been under intense congressional pressure to approve  
new drugs faster. Consumer advocates charge that is dangerous and 
point to controversial drugs like the impotence pill Viagra, 
arguing it won approval with too little warning of deadly side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new report to Congress, the FDA details numerous gaps in  
other duties, including inspecting manufacturing plants and 
monitoring drug side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress and the American public have said they want  
smaller, more efficient government. I think the FDA has certainly 
recognized and responded to that,'' said Deputy Commissioner 
Michael Friedman, who ran the agency the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But with an increasing workload that demands ever more  
expertise, ``we face some really formidable challenges,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An influential Republican lawmaker was more blunt: ``Let's face  
it, the FDA is underfunded,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a 
recent speech. ``The administration and indeed the Congress is 
going to have to take a hard look at what we are asking the FDA to 
do, and with what resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, the number of new products FDA evaluates rises by 12  
percent. The products are getting more complex, including 
technologies like genetically engineered drugs. In recent years, 
threats such as new viruses and food poisonings have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's budget is $1.1 billion, up from $800 million in  
1993. Six years of inflation and the increased workload mean the 
FDA actually has a $165 million shortfall, Friedman estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress allows the agency to charge drug makers fees that hire  
reviewers of prescription medicines. Similar fees pay for quality 
inspections at mammography clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	But money for other areas has lagged: There are delays in  
reviewing new foods and cheaper generic drugs. An aging population 
is using more powerful drugs and medical devices, yet the FDA 
estimates it detects only 10 percent of injuries caused by improper 
use or unexpected side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things sacrificed is the scientific expertise,''  
Friedman added, as the agency struggles to recruit those trained in 
the newest technologies. New Commissioner Jane Henney has pledged 
to make rebuilding the science base a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	And vaccine experts express frustration that scientific research  
has been slashed, saying the agency must find money to study an 
experimental new way of making vaccines -- by growing them in human 
tumor cells -- to make sure it's safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all very worried about the financial structure'' of  
FDA, said Dr. Patricia Ferrieri of the University of Minnesota. 
``The nation's health is the subject here that we're grappling 
with.''

<HEADLINE> Two More Godzilla Movies Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You just can't keep an angry lizard down.  
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Godzilla'' was widely characterized as a  
disappointment at the summer box office, the big-budget film ended 
up grossing enough money worldwide and stirring up enough nostalgia 
in Japan to warrant at least one more Godzilla movie -- maybe two. 
</P>
<P>
	Toho Co. Ltd. of Japan plans to start filming ``Godzilla  
Millennium'' in April for a December 1999 release, featuring a 
monster that likely will look more like the guy-in-a-rubber-suit 
model seen in 22 Japanese films since 1954 than the sleek 
computer-generated lizard of the American version. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Centropolis Entertainment, the production company  
that created last summer's ``Godzilla,'' intends to make a sequel 
for Sony's film arm Columbia-TriStar, Centropolis spokeswoman 
Suzanne Fritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	American audiences may not be able to see ``Godzilla  
Millenium,'' at least not immediately. Toho doesn't hold the 
distribution rights for a new Godzilla movie outside Japan, while 
Sony has the non-Japanese, worldwide Godzilla rights, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film projects come despite the fact that the Godzilla  
monster seemed to have been on its last scaly legs, having died 
twice in recent years on film -- and a third time at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	A monster destroyed Godzilla in the 1995 Japanese film  
``Godzilla vs. Destoroyah'' and the U.S. military shot Godzilla 
down at the end of last summer's film from Centropolis (though the 
ending strongly suggested a sequel featuring one of Godzilla's 
offspring). 
</P>
<P>
	``Godzilla'' also was widely reported to be the summer's big  
loser, failing to live up to a year's worth of hype with the 
ubiquitous ``size does matter'' campaign. Prospects of a sequel 
were said to be grim. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when all the receipts were counted, ``Godzilla'' ended up  
grossing nearly $400 million worldwide and stands to makes millions 
more in video. It also created renewed interest in the beast in its 
native Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports last month that suggested Toho was  
dissatisfied with what Hollywood had done to its creature. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman was reported in numerous publications as  
saying that because the American Godzilla was ``so different from 
the Japanese version'' there was a ``clamor'' among fans and 
company officials to create a Godzilla ``unique to Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this week Toho released a new statement saying that its  
official was misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to have two kinds of Godzillas in the future, both a  
Toho Godzilla and TriStar Godzilla,'' said Toho spokesman Masaharu 
Ina in an interview. ``Both are very important for us.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Networking for Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is jumping into a home computer  
networking competition that could some day help you use a PC to 
find a lost dog, keep your family's diet healthy or confer to your 
child's teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The software giant said it plans to extend its Windows software  
so that household appliances, computer devices and other high tech 
gadgets can all work together. 
</P>
<P>
	``As appliances become more intelligent and the distinction  
between appliances and computing devices blurs, a key part of their 
value to consumers will come from their ability to communicate with 
other intelligent devices,'' Microsoft senior vice president Craig 
Mundie told some of the 100,000 attendees at the Consumer 
Electronics Show on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is introducing its so-called ``Universal Plug and  
Play'' in a field already occupied by rival Sun Microsystems Inc., 
which has been publicly testing a networking software called Jini 
since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it's going to be a tough and important battle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Transparent networking has the potential to change computing  
dramatically,'' said Gartner Group analyst David Smith. ``There's a 
lot more here than meets the eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network computing can be used to link a toaster, a dog collar, a  
camera -- anything that can hold a computer chip -- into a 
synchronized computer system that can keep schedules, lists and 
controls of nearly everything in a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if Fido is missing, a dog owner could track him  
down in a car listening to directions through what used to be the 
car stereo. 
</P>
<P>
	Recipes could be downloaded at a supermarket into a palm-sized  
computer, and then used at home not only for cooking meals, but 
also for keeping track of what a family has been eating and its 
nutritional value. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher could check a parent's computerized calendar and set  
up a meeting, describing in advance what needs to be discussed and 
reviewing what may be going on at home that could affect a child's 
performance in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is spontaneous networking between potentially  
millions and millions of networked devices,'' said Mike Clary, 
director of Sun's Jini project. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's Jini is written in the Palo Alto, Calif., company's Java  
language that is universally accepted by all different programs, 
which makes it easier to get devices to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	Mundie said Thursday that Microsoft's system is equally  
compatible, using protocols already in place through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies are also battling for partners. Sun's include  
the printer company Canon Inc., disk drive maker Seagate Technology 
Inc. and computer maker Toshiba Corp., while Microsoft's supporters 
include Eastman Kodak Co., computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. and 
chip maker National Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies in Campbell,  
Calif., said consumers can expect the competition to increase as 
the two companies continually update their versions to top each 
other.

<HEADLINE>  Gunfire Rattles Sierra Leone Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Gunfire rattled through the night  
in Sierra Leone's capital, belying broadcasts early today on 
state-run radio that a cease-fire between rebels and government 
forces had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter pilot who flew repeated trips overnight between  
military bases outside Freetown and the city center said today 
there had been no letup in shooting. The pilot spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah told reporters that he met with  
jailed rebel leader Foday Sankoh and they agreed to a truce. Tape 
recordings of Kabbah and Sankoh announcing the cease-fire were 
broadcast early today on state-controlled radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both agreed to the need to stop this carnage and  
destruction of our very limited infrastructure,'' Kabbah told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, rebels terrified civilians in Freetown, setting  
neighborhoods ablaze and dragging residents from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels stunned the government and its allied West African  
defense force Wednesday when they battled their way into the 
capital, the most populous city in this nation of 4.5 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the poorest countries in the world and battered by years  
of civil war and military coups, Sierra Leone has again fallen 
victim to a rebel movement whose motives are murky, but whose 
methods are clearly brutal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah told reporters that the rebels had burned the city's  
university, its main hospital and the former British colony's State 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys, they're desperate,'' Kabbah said. ``They're doing  
exactly what a desperate man does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah said discussed with Sankoh the possible release of the  
longtime rebel leader, renowned for his ruthlessness toward 
civilians. Sankoh was convicted late last year of high treason and 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah was deposed in a coup in May 1997 by a military junta  
allied with the rebels, but soldiers from the Nigerian-led West 
African coalition force restored him to power 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the insurgents have been rebuilding, strengthened by  
defections from Sierra Leone's military and by mercenaries from 
Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have spent time with the rebels say they fiercely  
believe in their cause -- a vague mixture of agrarian democracy and 
revolutionary socialism. 
</P>
<P>
	But their only stated goals are the ouster of Kabbah, who they  
accuse of corruption, and freedom for Sankoh, a former photographer 
who claims supernatural powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses being evacuated from Freetown aboard military  
helicopters Thursday said the rebels were moving from house to 
house, demanding allegiance from civilians. The homes of families 
that failed to do so were set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Commanders from the West African defense force, known as ECOMOG,  
said the rebels were using civilians as human shields, slowing down 
government efforts to dislodge them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leonean officials has accused Liberian President Charles  
Taylor -- once tightly allied with Sankoh -- of supporting the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC Radio  
that he had ``sent a very firm message to Liberia that we believe 
there is credible evidence'' it is supporting the Sierra Leonean 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor has denied sending soldiers into Sierra Leone, although  
he concedes that Liberian mercenaries are helping the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Some Unfazed by Impeachment Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- ``The great days of Watergate'' obsessed  
Sanford Levinson, but the University of Texas law professor isn't 
as fascinated by President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some partisanship in that -- I hated Richard Nixon and  
luxuriated in what was happening. But those were also important 
issues. I read every single article every day,'' said Levinson, who 
teaches constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
	The current impeachment proceedings, he said, are ``somewhere  
between a circus and a train wreck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doubts that it will be part of many constitutional law  
courses -- it's more a topic for political scientists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was among 500 law professors, librarians and  
administrators who packed a meeting room at the American 
Association of Law Schools for a town hall about the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers included a House Judiciary member, Rep. Barney Frank,  
D-Mass., and John O. McGinnis, a Yeshiva University professor who 
worked for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr when Starr was an 
appeals court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy attendance countered earlier comments from some  
conference participants who said they weren't all that interested 
in one of the most unusual trials of their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here all day, working. We can't follow the  
impeachment,'' Stephen Burnett, a consultant for Lexis Law 
Publications and an exhibitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``People did talk about it at supper last night,'' said John  
FitzRandolph, dean of Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Leffler, who teaches intellectual property at Indiana  
University in Bloomington, said he'd followed proceedings closely 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got so sick of it I stopped following the details. Just  
turned off. Turned off,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gerald P. Moran, a professor at the University of Toledo,  
said he watches early coverage at his hotel in the morning, and 
then watches the day's reruns when he gets back to his room at 
night. ``I'm obsessed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Despite Odds, NFL's Cards Talk Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals, new kids on the NFL  
playoff block, were talking big Friday after their final practice 
before they leave the sunshine for the frozen north and a game 
hardly anyone expects them to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going up there to win a football game,'' coach Vince  
Tobin said, ``not just to play a football game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers have made the Minnesota Vikings 15 1/2-point favorites  
in Sunday's NFC semifinals, a fact that doesn't faze an Arizona 
team long accustomed to being an underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could care less what everybody else thinks,'' rookie  
cornerback Corey Chavous said. ``A lot of people are not giving us 
a chance because Minnesota's had such a great season. But who cares 
about what they've done during the season? Now they have to win in 
the playoffs, and we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, the last time the Cardinals won a playoff game  
was 1947 in a one-game postseason. The Chicago Cardinals beat 
Philadelphia for the NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So this is definitely uncharted territory for a squad that  
gained immeasurable confidence from its dominant 20-7 playoff road 
victory over the Dallas Cowboys last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time that you have some success, it builds your  
confidence and it builds your ability to think that you can do even 
more good things,'' Tobin said. ``Until you've experienced that, I 
don't think you realize just how good you can be. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I've tried to work on for three years -- not  
worrying too much about where we've been but where we're going. I 
think we're an improving football team that feels pretty good about 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Cardinals staged a ``Fan Fest'' in the parking  
lot next to the team headquarters. A big rally is planned at Sky 
Harbor Airport when the team leaves on Saturday, and another when 
it returns Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case last week, the Cardinals are taking all the  
injured, taxi squad and inactive players with them to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those injured players, wide receiver Anthony Edwards,  
gave an emotional pep talk to the team at the end of Friday's 
practice, just as he had done the previous two weeks. Tobin had 
asked him to speak again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like anything, when you get on a roll you continue to  
call on the things you did before,'' Tobin said. ``I don't know 
whether you'd use the term superstitious. It's more that I'm 
consistent. When things are going a particular way, I like to stay 
in the same routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Metcalf, one of the few Cardinals with playoff experience,  
said the team is loose as it heads to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have the pressure,'' he said. ``Everybody thinks  
that Minnesota is just going to show up and win the game. But it 
still matters what happens between the white lines. We have the 
confidence to go in there and make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jamir Miller said confidence is the team's new  
ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about understanding that it takes confidence to win,'' he  
said. ``That's what we've finally understood. The talent level has 
always been here. Now we're finally starting to play together as a 
team and understanding that regardless of what happens, you can 
win.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in Nelloms Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A jury resumed deliberations today in the  
rape trial of former Ohio State track star Chris Nelloms, who says 
a 12-year-old girl has falsely accused him. 
</P>
<P>
	After four days of testimony, the Montgomery County Common Pleas  
Court jury deliberated for a few hours Thursday night without 
reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms testified Thursday, denying the allegations in a voice  
that cracked with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a liar,'' he said. ``I think she's doing it because  
she's troubled and disturbed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 26, of suburban Trotwood, set school records at Ohio  
State but missed qualifying for the 1996 Olympics in the 200-meter 
dash. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Nelloms was charged with eight counts of rape of a  
child less than 13, one count each of attempting to commit rape of 
a child less than 13 and felonious sexual penetration of a child 
less than 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can he sit there so smug and so self-righteous ... and  
tell you that child came into this courtroom and lied about these 
things?'' assistant prosecutor Angela Frydman said in closing 
arguments on the fourth day of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Frydman said Nelloms isn't before the jury as a track star.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Nelloms is a child abuser,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Kevin Lennen said the prosecution's case was  
``unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen said there supposedly were people in the area when the  
alleged rapes occurred, but no one saw or heard anything. He also 
said the doctor who testified for the prosecution could say only 
that he believed the girl had sexual intercourse at least once, 
even though Nelloms is accused of raping the child several times 
from 1995 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She has accused Nelloms of raping her at homes in Dayton and  
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen also said that police concluded the child had been abused  
before completing their investigation and that the girl showed no 
emotion during her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a 12-year-old child who told a lie. Why? I don't  
know,'' Lennen said. ``It's an unbelievable story that could only 
be told by a 12-year-old child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms faces a life sentence if convicted of any of the rape  
counts or the felonious sexual penetration charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Frydman told jurors Thursday that one of the eight rape counts  
against Nelloms had been dismissed. Lennen said the dismissal 
occurred because the girl changed her story about one of the 
alleged rapes.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Mostly Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices were mostly  
higher in early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after poor export sales figures pushed them lower, soybean  
futures prices opened higher, jumping as much as 7 cents. Soybeans 
were spurred in part by forecasts for drier-than-expected weather 
in South America -- conditions that could hurt crops in Brazil and 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also opened higher in a recovery that analysts attributed  
to technical factors and the South American weather forecast. And 
wheat was up slightly as traders awaited next week's crop reports 
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.87 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn was up 1 3/4 cent to $2.21 1/2 a bushel; March oats were up 1/2 cent 
to $1.11 a bushel; and March soybeans were up 4 3/4 cents to $5.53 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were up .10 cent to 61.82 a pound; March  
feeder cattle were up .10 cent at 71.70 cents a pound; February 
lean hogs dropped .57 cent to 36.15 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies were .50 cents lower at 48.40 cents a pound.

	Senate OKs Impeachment Trial Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators voted unanimously today to approve  
rules for President Clinton's impeachment trial. The plan calls for 
lawyers to begin their presentations next week and limits them to 
the evidence made public in the House. Senators agreed to decide 
later whether to call witnesses. Under the plan, the trial would 
begin next Wednesday with motions by the two sides, followed the 
next day by opening presentations. Two senators from each party are 
to negotiate on the difficult issue of witnesses. GOP House 
prosecutors are pressing for witnesses, while many Democrats oppose 
the idea. 

</P>
<P>
	Democrats Seek Public Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Senate Democrats said today they plan to  
urge colleagues to suspend the rules for the presidential 
impeachment trial so the public can watch the entire proceeding, 
including on television. Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone said it 
would be a mistake for any part of the first presidential 
impeachment trial since 1868 to take place behind closed doors. 
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa agreed, saying, ``We must let the sun shine 
in.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow was up 105.56 points today, closing at  
9,643.32 to beat Wednesday's closing record of 9,544.97 and log its 
third record in the first week of the year. NYSE decliners led 
advancers 1,520-1,506. The Nasdaq was up 18.82 at 2,344.91.

	U.S. Unemployment Reaches New Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of year-end hiring returned the  
nation's unemployment rate to 4.3 percent in December and helped 
produce in 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four 
decades. The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.4 percent in 
November, returned to the level reached in April and, before that, 
in 1970, the Labor Department said today. For the year, 
unemployment averaged 4.5 percent, the lowest since 3.5 percent in 
1969 during the Vietnam War. The 1998 mark was the lowest peacetime 
rate since 1957, when it averaged 4.3 percent.

	Andrew Cuomo Declines NY Senate Run

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the  
eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, said today he will not run 
for the Senate seat being given up next year by fellow Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The younger Cuomo plans to remain at the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development and help Vice President 
Al Gore run for president. Cuomo's decision is certain to increase 
interest in whether Hillary Rodham Clinton might run for the New 
York Senate seat. She has not ruled out such a move.

	Rescuers Reach Angola Crash Site  
</P>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- An international rescue team reached the  
crash site today of a U.N. plane that went down two weeks ago in 
central Angola. One journalist reported seeing a number of burned 
and mangled bodies among the wreckage. The corpses were so badly 
mutilated it was impossible to identify or count them, reported 
Jaime Azulay, an Angolan reporter with Luanda Antena Comercial, a 
private radio station. The plane was carrying 14 people when it 
crashed Dec. 26.

	Japan Questions Dollar's Dominance  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told French  
leaders it was time to reassess the U.S. dollar's dominance in the 
global financial system, his spokesman said today. ``Japan would 
like to increase the utility of the yen as an international 
currency,'' Obuchi was quoted as saying. The Japanese leader 
arrived in Paris just a week after the official launch of the euro 
currency in 11 European nations.

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A new high-tech telephone unveiled today goes  
price shopping every time it's dialed, seeking the cheapest 
long-distance rate from hundreds of plans before it places the 
call. The Long Distance Manager, made by a big cordless phone 
company Uniden America Corp., is expected to reach store shelves in 
the spring at a price of about $49.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The two top officials of the Salt Lake  
City Olympic committee resigned today amid allegations of bribery. 
Frank Joklik, president of the city's Olympic organizing committee, 
and senior vice president Dave Johnson resigned. Joklik confirmed 
the bid committee had paid International Olympic Committee members 
and their families cash, in one case more than $70,000. The 
committee also paid for housing, travel and education expenses for 
IOC member relatives, and gave expensive gifts and free health care 
to IOC members and their families, he acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Indian Trust Fund Dispute Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The long and embarrassing effort to clean up  
$2.5 billion in Indian trust funds got messier with the sudden 
resignation of the presidential appointee in charge of reconciling 
the accounts and improving the bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	In quitting Thursday, Special Trustee Paul Homan accused  
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt of stripping him of the authority 
he needed to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's department is being sued over its decades-long  
mismanagement of the money. Babbitt faces a contempt hearing Monday 
over the government's failure to turn over canceled checks and 
other records for accounts held by the lawsuit's lead plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Babbitt ordered a reorganization of Homan's  
office ``to enable us to make progress where it is now flagging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homan, a former banker appointed to his post in 1995 under a set  
of congressionally ordered reforms, fired back in his resignation 
letter that Babbitt ``usurped the powers, duties and 
responsibilities'' of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Homan's advisory board accused Babbitt of making him  
a scapegoat for the department's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like me telling you to drive a car but not giving you the  
keys of the car, and then turning around and chastising you for not 
driving the car,'' said Gregg Bourland, a board member and chairman 
of South Dakota's Cheyenne River Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
	An Interior Department spokeswoman, Stephanie Hanna, declined  
comment on the resignation but denied that Babbitt sought to 
undermine Homan. He ``has done a good job of moving the ball as far 
as he has moved it,'' Hanna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds include 300,000 accounts held by individual Indians  
worth $500 million and another 2,000 tribal accounts worth $2 
billion. The money includes lease revenue, royalties and court 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the accounts are worth only a few dollars. The largest  
one, valued at $400 million, is a court's award to the Sioux nation 
for its loss of the Black Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Among a series of embarrassing revelations, the Bureau of Indian  
Affairs was unable to document $2 billion of transactions in the 
tribal accounts over a 20-year period. It is not known how much of 
that is actually missing, but it has been estimated the government 
could be liable for up to $575 million just in the tribal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The special trustee's office is responsible for handling the  
money and improving the accounting system. But leases and other 
records necessary for reconciling the accounts are scattered around 
the country in various BIA offices. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Homan proposed creating a quasi-governmental bank to  
handle the money. Babbitt rejected the idea and promised that the 
department would develop a state-of-the-art accounting system 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's reorganization order put one of Homan's assistants in  
charge of developing the new accounting system and placed the 
record keeping under a new official with extensive experience in 
government records management. 
</P>
<P>
	In his resignation letter, Homan said he was not informed of the  
actions before Babbitt took them, and he complained that the new 
official had no experience with the trust fund records.

<HEADLINE> '99 Baseball Season Opens in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Last time the big star was Fernando Valenzuela.  
Now it'll be Vinny Castilla as major league baseball again goes 
south of the border, this time for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla's Colorado Rockies will play the defending NL champion  
San Diego Padres on Sunday night, April 4, in Monterrey, Mexico. It 
will be the first time two big league teams have opened a season 
outside the United States or Canada, and likely won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, to be played at 26,000-seat Estadio Monterrey, will be  
called the ``Apertura Internacional'' -- the International Opener. 
It will be shown on ESPN in the United States, and officials say it 
will be televised to 200 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very significant step for baseball, a very symbolic  
step for baseball, and the name is not an accident,'' Padres 
president Larry Lucchino said during a news conference Friday. 
``This is the first international opener. I suppose the NFL would 
put a Roman numeral I next to it. Maybe we should do that as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're seeing what I hope will be a perhaps annually,  
maybe periodically, series of international openers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres got into the spirit Friday, serving up both a  
mariachi band and fish tacos, the latter a staple at Qualcomm 
Stadium, which sits about 20 miles due north of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres and New York Mets played a three-game series at  
Estadio Monterrey in August 1996, the first regular-season games 
outside the United States or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	With his countrymen cheering his every move, Valenzuela started  
and won the opener of that series, which was moved in part because 
of a potential scheduling conflict with the GOP convention, and 
because the Padres were expanding their marketing into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Caminiti, weakened by food poisoning and dehydrated by the  
brutal heat, became a folk hero when he took two bags of 
intravenous fluid just before the final game, then hit two home 
runs as the Padres won two of three. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the 1,000-mile trip for a ``home'' series was necessary  
because Estadio Monterrey is considered the best ballpark in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres might try to get Valenzuela, who's playing in the  
Mexican leagues, to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	When baseball's international committee suggested the Monterrey  
opener, these two teams were the natural choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres are one of the trend setters in international  
marketing, and definitely the leader in exotic road trips -- they 
also moved a series to Honolulu in 1997. The Rockies have Castilla, 
one of the most popular ballplayers to come from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the invitation came to us, we grabbed at it,'' Lucchino  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game will be good for baseball and very good for both  
Colorado and Mexico,'' Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris said in a 
statement. ``We are proud to have Vinny Castilla, one of the most 
popular and successful players in Mexico's history, on our team and 
look forward to a great game versus the Padres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla hit 46 homers last year, and should like the bandbox  
Estadio Monterrey. During the 1996 series, the Padres hit eight 
homers and the Mets one. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla was playing in Mexico and wasn't available for comment,  
a Rockies spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	To heighten the impact, only one game will be played in  
Monterrey. The teams will return to San Diego for the Padres' home 
opener on Tuesday, April 6, then finish the series the following 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucchino said it's possible that future international openers  
will be played in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.

basketball coach, leaving behind a school he turned into a 
powerhouse and took to the national championship during the past 
quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he was quitting purely for personal reasons. He  
and his wife, Gwen, who have been married for 32 years, have been 
separated since a fire damaged their home three years ago. Thompson 
filed for divorce in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Esherick, an assistant under Thompson for the last 16  
years, was hired as the new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You now that I am going through a problem with marriage right  
now,'' Thompson said. ``And I owe it to my family to address that. 
Not just to myself and to my wife, I owe it to my family to address 
that. I would be irresponsible if I did not address that. I can't 
deal with that as a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson emphasized he was not leaving to explore an NBA job or  
because his team is suffering through a difficult season. The Hoyas 
are 7-6 but just 0-4 in the Big East, their worst start ever in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not tired of basketball,'' Thompson said. ``I do it  
because I love it. I am not retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tearful Esherick said he tried to talk Thompson out of  
resigning, but was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was my very first recruit I failed to land as coach, and  
I'm sorry for that,'' Esherick said. ``I'm not happy for myself. I 
look forward to the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he received a call from Temple coach John Chaney  
suggesting he take a sabbatical instead of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Do you ever lend somebody a toothbrush to use?' It's  
either their toothbrush or your toothbrush. You don't lend a 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he would remain at Georgetown, performing  
unspecified duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Thompson's resignation first came Thursday night when  
Charles Freeman, father of recruit Courtland Freeman, said the 
coach had called him to say he was resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtland Freeman, a 17-year-old forward from Socastee High  
School in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said he received the news via a phone 
call from Ronny Thompson, the coach's son and an assistant with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' Courtland Freeman said. ``From my  
understanding, he's still going to be in the head office, so it 
looks like nothing's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman is one of four major recruits Thompson was touting when  
he proclaimed ``Help is coming'' during the preseason. 
Unfortunately, next year's class can do nothing to help this year's 
team, which appears headed for Georgetown's first losing campaign 
since Thompson's first season as coach in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this season's struggles, and despite some off-the-court  
problems the last few years that have taken some of the shine off 
the school's sports reputation, Thompson's achievements are 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown was barely a blip on the national basketball radar  
screen when Thompson arrived 27 years ago. His first team went 
12-14, the second was 13-13. Every team since has been invited to 
postseason tournament play -- 20 NCAAs and four NITs. He won the 
national championship with Patrick Ewing in 1984, and his Hoyas 
were runners-up in 1982 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's record is 596-239, a .713 winning percentage, and he  
is 10th among active coaches in victories. Furthermore, Thompson's 
players almost always graduated on time -- 97 percent of his players 
who stayed four years left with a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dynasty has faded over the last few years, starting in  
1996 when Allen Iverson became Thompson's first player to declare 
early for the NBA draft. Victor Page, Ed Sheffey and Kenny Brunner 
also left early, for various reasons, and all four -- especially 
Iverson -- have made ugly headlines that clearly embarrassed and 
hurt their former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Thompson last year allegedly received threatening phone  
calls from a former player, Kevin Millen, who in November ignored 
an order to stay off campus. Millen is being held in a halfway 
house and is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Georgetown had a 15-14 regular-season record and was  
invited to the NIT on reputation alone. The Hoyas defeated Florida 
before losing to Georgia Tech in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson knew this year would be a challenge, but any hopes of  
the Hoyas being competitive in the Big East were dashed when junior 
guard Shernard Long, the team's leading scorer last season, was 
suspended for the season for academic reasons.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Disability Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court soon may bring into sharper  
focus a law that protects the disabled from discrimination. One 
issue that needs clarification is how, if at all, the law applies 
to people with poor eyesight or other conditions that can be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Friday it will use cases involving two very  
nearsighted pilots, a truck driver blind in one eye and a mechanic 
with high blood pressure to help decide the scope of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. Decisions in the three cases from Colorado, 
Oregon and Kansas are expected by July. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 anti-bias law, best known for requiring handicap access  
to public buildings, has spawned hundreds of lawsuits nationwide -- 
forcing judges to interpret just how far Congress intended the law 
to reach. The rulings have been conflicting and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bars employers from discriminating against a ``qualified  
individual with a disability'' because of that disability. A 
qualified individual is a person who can perform a job's essential 
functions when given reasonable accommodation. Disability is 
defined as a condition that substantially limits a major life 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case from Colorado, twin sisters who want to be pilots for  
United Airlines say their extreme nearsightedness should be 
considered a disability protected against employment bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts had ruled that Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton are  
not protected by the ADA because their poor vision is fully 
correctable when they use glasses or contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sisters, now pilots for regional commuter airlines,  
unsuccessfully applied in Denver for jobs with United in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sisters have corrected vision of 20-20 in both eyes, but  
United refused to consider either because it requires all pilot 
applicants to have uncorrected vision of 20-100. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
against the women, concluding that although their poor eyesight was 
a disability it did not substantially limit a major life activity, 
and therefore was not protected by the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Oregon case, truck driver Hallie Kirkingburg says a  
supermarket chain violated the anti-bias law when it fired him 
after he flunked a vision test. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkingburg had been a commercial truck driver since 1979 with a  
good driving record when he was hired in 1990 by Albertson's 
supermarkets in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	He performed well on a road test. Although he is almost blind in  
one eye, medical examiners twice certified that he met federal 
Transportation Department vision standards. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Kirkingburg suffered a non-driving injury and was off  
the job for almost a year. When he returned to work and took a new 
vision test, a doctor refused to certify that he met the vision 
standard. Albertson's fired him in 1992 for failing the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkingburg sued Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, saying it  
violated the ADA by refusing to let him return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for Albertson's, but the 9th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals reversed that ruling and said Kirkingburg must be 
given a chance to prove his discrimination claim in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Murphy was a mechanic for United Parcel Service in  
Topeka, Kan., when fired because of the high blood pressure he has 
had since age 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Because UPS mechanics conduct road tests on trucks, the company  
requires them to have commercial drivers' licenses as well as 
health certification from the U.S. Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy got Transportation Department approval, but shortly after  
he was hired, a company nurse reviewed his file and determined his 
blood pressure exceeded the federal standard. UPS decided his 
health approval was issued in error and fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts ruled against Murphy's lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Friday, Murphy said health conditions  
should be evaluated as possible disabilities covered by the 1990 
law without taking into account the effects of medication. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS lawyers said Murphy's view would expand the disability law's  
coverage to millions of Americans with conditions that can be 
effectively treated, such as asthma, diabetes and even poor 
eyesight.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Eagerly Awaits Sign From MJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Tim Floyd has been thinking for months  
about what he'll say to Michael Jordan the first time he talks to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Will they talk triangle offense? Compare favorite Chicago  
restaurants? Will Floyd tell Jordan it's OK to call him ``Pink,'' 
the not-so-endearing nickname Jordan gave him last season? 
</P>
<P>
	That's between him and MJ, Floyd said. He just hopes he gets the  
chance to sit down with His Airness. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I'm) just as anxious as all of you are,'' the Chicago Bulls'  
coach-in-waiting said Friday. ``And really looking forward to 
hearing what his intentions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Join the club. Everyone from chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to Floyd  
to the guys playing pickup games at the local gym are wondering if 
Jordan is done or if he'll come back for a shot at another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's not saying. But Reinsdorf plans to get in touch  
with him soon, either personally or through his agent, David Falk, 
Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Friday that Jordan was out of the country. ``I hope  
Michael makes a decision he's comfortable with,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Jordan makes his decision, the Bulls -- and Floyd -- are in  
limbo. If he returns, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the rest of 
the gang are more likely to, too. If he hangs up his shorts, 
however, Chicago will undergo one of the biggest rebuilding efforts 
in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I could see it being a very delightful situation if  
all of the players come back,'' Floyd said. ``I can see it being a 
very difficult situation if they're not back, but the same plan 
will be in place. And that plan will be to try to win a 
championship at some point, but there may be a process involved if 
those guys aren't here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Call him an optimist, but Floyd is planning as if Jordan and his  
sidekicks will all be back. While that prospect seemed almost 
impossible when former coach Phil Jackson left last summer, it may 
not be too farfetched. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who could be the key to Jordan's return, is still  
interested in Chicago, his agent, Jimmy Sexton, told ESPN Radio 
1000. Pippen, who made $2.7 million last year, has long felt 
undervalued and underappreciated by the Bulls, who refused to 
renegotiate the longterm contract he signed early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But past animosity is irrelevant, Sexton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Scottie Pippen will be theirs to lose at this  
point,'' Sexton said. ``Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team and 
so, if we can work a deal out that works for Scottie, I think he 
would like to stay there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams can't sign free agents until the labor agreement is put on  
paper, which is expected to take another week. Pippen is one of the 
hottest free agents on the market, and Sexton said they won't wait 
if Jordan hasn't made a decision by the time the labor deal is 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Floyd, he doesn't have a choice but to wait for Jordan.  
Though Jordan has backed off his stance that he won't play for 
anyone but Jackson -- Reinsdorf asked Jackson back one more time 
earlier this week, but Jackson turned him down -- Reinsdorf wants to 
talk to Jordan before he officially makes Floyd the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't bother him, Floyd said. He's just happy there's  
going to be a basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week's going to be very difficult for me from the  
standpoint that there'll be balls bouncing out there and we can't 
watch them,'' he said. ``I'd like to be out there with them.''

<HEADLINE> `Sopranos' Dramatizes Crime Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's your family values: New Jersey mob boss  
Tony Soprano can barely get an honest day's work out of the mugs in 
HIS family. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, on the home front, his wife spends too much time with  
the handsome Catholic priest. His son and daughter take turns 
exasperating him. His widowed mother frightens him to death. And 
there's hardly a spare moment for his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Who needs the headaches!  
</P>
<P>
	As if all that weren't enough, the beloved ducks raising their  
own family in his swimming pool take wing, without warning, for 
fairer climes. They, unlike Tony, are free as birds. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder he has an anxiety attack, right beside his Weber  
grill. This (wink, wink) waste management consultant is in serious 
need of a stress management consultant. Next thing he knows, he's 
pouring out his soul to a shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be in something from the ground floor. I came too  
late for that,'' Tony tells her wistfully. ``But lately I'm getting 
the feeling that I came in at the end.'' Thus begins ``The 
Sopranos,'' premiering on HBO Sunday at 9 p.m. EST (repeated 
Tuesday at 11 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
	Written and acted so well it deserves multiple viewings, ``The  
Sopranos'' is a 13-week romp through vice and vicissitudes; a 
scrumptious exploration of the American Dream tempered with Old 
World protocol -- and all of it hilariously, tragically, scarily 
unravelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are trending downward,'' Tony says sadly.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet life must go on. You bust up a creditor. You take your kid  
to soccer. But you can't always get what you want, and, these days, 
it's touch-and-go even getting what you need. Where's the Prozac? 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the title's plural form, ``The Sopranos'' is really the  
world seen through Tony Soprano's eyes. Free of stereotyping, this 
antihero comes alive thanks to series creator David Chase (``I'll 
Fly Away'') and the virtuoso performance of James Gandolfini. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about well-rounded! By turns, Tony is all-powerful,  
impotent, shrewd, vulnerable. He can be sinister, he can be 
charming. And Gandolfini, a big beefy guy with thinning hair and 
small, arresting eyes, gives viewers clear insight into Tony's many 
facets. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony is your surrogate. Remarkably enough, you find yourself  
cheering him on when he brutishly stomps a whimpering debtor in 
broad daylight at a Jersey office park. Why not? At moments like 
this, he cuts through life's red tape in ways you only dream of. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tony, like you, feels less and less able to take direct  
action. Endless meetings with squabbling mob family members. 
Endless problems at home. No one in his charge, be they kids or 
paisanos, are playing by the old, time-tested rules anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	RICO! Drugs! This younger, disrespectful generation!  
</P>
<P>
	``You know how many mobsters are selling screenplays and  
screwing everything up?'' Tony explodes when Christopher, his 
loose-cannon nephew, proposes doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder you ache for Tony, even as you chortle at his many  
tribulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the family of characters -- and actors playing them --  
is no less exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Gandolfini (in the current film ``A Civil Action''),  
other standouts include Edie Falco (seen the past two summers as a 
prison guard on HBO's drama ``Oz''), who plays Tony's loyal but 
sharp-tongued suburban wife Carmela; Michael Imperioli 
(``GoodFellas'') as Christopher; and Nancy Marchand (the patrician 
Mrs. Pynchon on TV's classic ``Lou Grant''), who will make your 
blood curdle, just as she does Tony's, as his shrewish mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorraine Bracco (``GoodFellas'') brings soothing authority to  
Dr. Jennifer Melfi, Tony's psychiatrist. Their therapy scenes might 
have served only for heavy-handed explication, but instead become 
dramatic set pieces, replete with wisdom and psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Tony is desperate to talk to someone about his  
overcrowded life. His resorting to therapy underscores that 
desperation. Not only is he skeptical about psychiatry (``It's 
dysfunction this, dysfunction that,'' he scoffs), but, being in a 
business where image is everything, he knows that to be caught 
seeing a shrink would mean certain death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wrong person finds out about this,'' he tells Dr. Melfi as  
she writes out a prescription for Prozac, ``and I get a 
steel-jacket antidepressant in the back of the head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funny. Sad. Chillingly relatable. Indeed, ``The Sopranos'' is  
like a tidal flow where the humor washes into pathos and back 
again, almost imperceptibly. Nothing is played for laughs, even 
when Carmela lectures her and Tony's curfew-breaking daughter on 
how ``you can't just lie and cheat and break the rules you don't 
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's wrong. Or maybe she's right and Tony, to his horror, is  
finding that out.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Follow Dollar Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Friday for the second  
straight session as the dollar lost ground against other 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 21/32  
point, or $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to a seven-week high of 5.27, up from 
5.22 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds sank as the Labor Department reported today that the  
nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in December, when 
employers added 378,000 jobs to their payrolls -- the most in 15 
months and nearly double what analysts anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The resilience of the economy reduced hopes that Fed  
policy-makers would see a need to stimulate growth by moving to cut 
interest rates. A key short-term rate was lowered three times late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 5/32 and 1/4 point, and intermediate maturities were 
down 15/32 to 5/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 6.58 
points to 1309.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.46 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 point to 4.36 percent from late Thursday. 
Six-month yields were 4.51 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 point 
to 4.36 percent. One-year yields were 4.57 percent as the discount 
rose 0.08 point from late Thursday to 4.37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.88 percent from 4.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Electric Gadgets Debut at Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- An array of useful, entertaining or simply  
strange items are showing up this year the 1999 Consumer 
Electronics Show. Here are a few: 
</P>
<P>
	--Invisible Walls: Want to change the television station while  
you're out of the room? Jensen is debuting a new remote control 
that combines radio frequency with infrared. The result: Users can 
operate electronic devices through walls, floors and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
	--Foul Language Filter: Viewers who don't want to hear television  
or videotape profanity can now install the TVGuardian, a $200 box, 
and get all those bad words filtered out. TVGuardian reads encoded 
closed-caption signals and references it against a preset 
dictionary to detect offensive language. If a character says 
something nasty, all a viewer hears is a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bad Air: A new carbon monoxide detector called the Pollumetre  
Air fits in a user's pocket and can be used anywhere. Driven by a 
microprocessor, the cigarette-box sized device reads carbon 
monoxide levels in the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
	--Phone Zapper: Easy Hang Up gets rid of telephone solicitors.  
The credit card sized box hooks into your telephone. When an 
unwanted caller dials in, the user pushes a button on the $12.99 
device and the caller hears this message: ``I'm sorry, this number 
does not accept this type of call. Please regard this message as 
your notification to remove this number from your list. Thank 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Star Finder: The Night Navigator computer tracking system  
locates and identifies constellations, planets and stars. Users 
enter their position into the $129 navigator, which uses a digital 
electronic compass to establish the stargazer's position on earth. 
The telephone book sized navigator then tells the user which 
constellations, stars and planets are within their viewing area, 
and shows them which way to look.

<HEADLINE> Running Backs Key in Jags-Jets Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Curtis Martin and Fred Taylor, who  
weren't even with their current teams a year ago, could be the key 
players in Sunday's AFC playoff game between the New York Jets and 
Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	With cold temperature expected, wind always a factor at the  
Meadowlands and precipitation a possibility, how well each team 
runs the ball will be a major component. While both clubs have 
prolific passing offenses, they aren't exactly slouches at 
halfback. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin rushed for 1,287 yards, the fourth straight season he  
surpassed 1,000. Although he averaged only 3.5 yards per carry (the 
lowest of his career), he made up for it in quantity of runs, 369, 
a team record. He scored eight times and had eight 100-yard games 
in 15 appearances after signing with New York as a restricted free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``My body feels good,'' said Martin, who cost the Jets first and  
third-round draft picks -- plus $36 million over six years -- when he 
was signed away from New England. ``I feel rejuvenated. My body 
feels as well as it has at any time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'll be able to move a little faster, like I'll be able  
to burst a little more and hopefully outrun some people. I felt 
hindered much of the season in doing that, with some nagging things 
(hamstring and bruised leg). I feel that I'll bring a part of my 
game that I haven't had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's hardly good news for the Jaguars, who ranked only 22nd  
against the rush. They'll have enough to worry about in slowing 
down AFC passing leader Vinny Testaverde and his strong group of 
receivers. If Martin is at his best, it could be decisive. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a guy that over the long run of a game is going to end  
up killing you,'' Jaguars defensive tackle John Jurkovic said. ``We 
have to keep his hands off the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One way of doing that is to have Taylor dominate with his  
running. The ninth overall choice in last year's draft, the rookie 
from Florida ran for 1,223 yards, with a hefty 4.6 average. He 
scored 14 times rushing and three more as a receiver on 44 catches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars had an uncertain situation at running back when  
Natrone Means went back to San Diego as a free agent. That left 
James Stewart as the starter, but he tore up a knee in the third 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville had no choice: Taylor was the man.  
</P>
<P>
	``When the decision was made a year ago that Natrone would move  
on, we went to get a guy with speed and big-play capability,'' 
Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said, ``and he has been every bit and 
more of that. The question always asked is to what extent is the 
difference he has made and to judge him on what other rookies did. 
He is a guy who made the most of his opportunity to a greater 
extent than any other players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised. The things I saw prior to drafting him are  
the kind of the things we saw in college: power and his ability to 
lower a shoulder when has to, and then when people misjudge him, he 
has the ability to knock the home run ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what the Jaguars might need, because quarterback  
Mark Brunell is coming off a high ankle sprain and was shaky in 
last weekend's playoff victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor is ready to deliver, although he was a bit unprepared for  
good things to happen so quickly for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to play a little and find out how the NFL was  
and come in slow and learn from there,'' he said. ``The success I 
had this season surprised me; a lot of things I do surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
	``After James got hurt, I had to worry about carrying the team  
as much as I can as far as the running game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He might have to carry the whole team Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Arrest Made in Tourist Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- The man accused of killing a German  
tourist who couldn't understand his demands told authorities he 
wasn't targeting foreigners in last fall's attack, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont Santos, 21, was charged with murder and the special  
circumstance of carrying out the murder during a robbery. He also 
was charged with three counts of attempted robbery, Los Angeles 
County district attorney's spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos, the third person charged in the case, was to be  
arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourist, Horst Fietze, 50, was walking with his wife and  
another German couple Oct. 12 when they were confronted by four 
people near the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. He was shot after 
an argument which police said was the result of a language barrier 
with the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	His death was the first of seven killings in a six-week span  
that shattered the feeling of security in this normally peaceful 
coastal city, where only one person was killed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief James Butts said Santos was arrested in Greenville,  
S.C., on Jan. 2 and admitted to shooting Fietze. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves said they weren't targeting tourists.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were in L.A. They decided to do a robbery. They robbed  
the first persons they saw,'' Butts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roshana Latiesha Roberts and Tyrina Griffin, both 18, were  
charged last month in Fietze's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts has pleaded innocent to murder and attempted robbery.  
</P>
<P>
	Griffin, who was 17 at the time of the slaying, is charged as a  
juvenile with murder, attempted robbery and assault with a firearm, 
Butts said. A Jan. 11 hearing is scheduled to decide if she will be 
tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth suspect is still at large.

<HEADLINE> Electra: I'm Still Married to Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Baywatch'' actress Carmen Electra says she  
and Dennis Rodman still are married and have no plans on getting an 
annulment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks we got the annulment,'' she said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had considered dissolving their marriage after they  
exchanged vows at a quick ceremony in Las Vegas on Nov. 14 but then 
decided to stick together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love each other,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls star known for his outrageous outfits, tattoos  
and dyed hair ``really does have a good heart,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's what I love about him. His kind generous heart and  
his way of trying to make everyone around him feel comfortable and 
happy and have a good time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Electra, 26, said she doesn't mind living in separate homes. She  
lives in a house in Beverly Hills while he lives in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us time to miss each other,'' she said. ``I think if  
we were together every day we would get on each other's nerves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a public appearance in New York last month, Rodman insisted  
that he and Electra were still married despite the annulment papers 
he filed nine days after their ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very classy woman,'' Rodman said. ``The decision I  
made was my decision and hopefully it stays.''

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Giving Son AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) -- Brian Stewart sat quietly in court,  
hands crossed before him, as his former girlfriend spoke of the 
horrors of their son's AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Stewart remained silent, staring straight ahead,  
as the judge sentenced him to life in prison for injecting the boy 
with HIV-tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe when God finally calls you, you are going to burn in  
hell from here to eternity,'' Judge Ellsworth Cundiff told Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 32, of Columbia, Ill., was convicted last month of  
first-degree assault. Prosecutors said the hospital technician 
injected the blood in his son so he could avoid paying child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to sentencing, the child's mother, identified only as  
Jennifer to protect the boy's anonymity, sobbed as she read a 
statement from her son, now 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel mad ... Why did he do such a bad thing to me,'' she  
quoted the boy as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer said the life sentence was little consolation for what  
Stewart has forced her and her family to endure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who really has been given a life sentence?'' she asked. ``We  
are prisoners without cells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart declined to make a statement. His attorney, Joseph  
Murphy, said his client is innocent and that an appeal has been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and Jennifer dated in the early 1990s. He denied he was  
the father of the boy, though tests later indicated he was. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the child, then 11 months old, was hospitalized in St.  
Charles County. At the time, Stewart worked at a St. Louis hospital 
as a phlebotomist -- a person who draws blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Stewart snuck a syringe filled with HIV-tainted  
blood under a lab coat into the boy's hospital room, then waited 
until they were alone and injected the blood into the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	The child was diagnosed with AIDS in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 8 Hurt in Another N.J. Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- A Greyhound bus crashed into a  
median on the New Jersey Turnpike on Friday, injuring eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries were serious, said State Police spokesman  
John Hagerty. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the fifth bus crash on a major New Jersey  
highway in little more than two weeks. Eight people died and 14 
were hurt in a Christmas Eve crash on the Garden State Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, carrying about 50 passengers, was traveling northbound  
on the Turnpike when the driver lost control and slid into a center 
median, Hagerty said. No other vehicles were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police are investigating the cause of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Utah Public Land Swap Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOUNTIFUL, Utah (AP) -- A 1 million-acre land deal -- the  
country's largest since Alaska statehood in 1959 -- was finalized 
Friday when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt handed over a $50 
million check to Gov. Mike Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt accepted the check on behalf of the state's school trust  
lands administration and its beneficiaries, Utah's public school 
students. The school trust also will receive about $13 million in 
future coal revenues and 153,000 federally owned acres rich in 
natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the federal government gets a checkerboard of  
376,739 acres owned by the school trust, including the Jacob 
Hamblin Arch on Lake Powell, the Eye of the Whale Arch in Arches 
National Park and rock art in Dinosaur National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah also agreed to give up mineral rights below the surface of  
another 454,000 acres and drop lawsuits challenging the Grand 
Staircase-Escalante National Monument created in 1996 without 
consulting state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a $50 million transaction,'' Leavitt said. ``Over  
the next 20 years, this will be a billion-dollar transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swap eliminates all school trust lands within Utah's  
national parks. Sections of land were set aside for schools at 
statehood in 1896, but could not be developed within the parks and 
reservations set aside by the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Wrap Up Final Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- As the Arizona Cardinals prepared to depart  
for the frozen north, they'd heard enough talk about the great 
Minnesota Vikings' wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be perfectly honest about it, at this point in the week,  
I'm tired of hearing about them,'' rookie cornerback Corey Chaveous 
said after the Cardinals' last practice Friday. ``They're great 
receivers. There's nothing else to say about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaveous insists he's not upset by Randy Moss's remark that  
other than Aeneas Williams, the Cardinals have an ``average'' 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't affect us one way or another. Everybody we play  
says the same thing,'' Chaveous said. ``Just because we played one 
good week of football, we don't think we're the best group of 
secondary guys in the league. We're trying to earn our respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers have made the Vikings and their high-powered offense  
15 1/2-point favorites in Sunday's NFC semifinals, a fact that doesn't 
faze an Arizona team long accustomed to being an underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could care less what everybody else thinks,'' Chaveous  
said. ``A lot of people are not giving us a chance because 
Minnesota's had such a great season. But who cares about what 
they've done during the season? Now they have to win in the 
playoffs, and we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, the last time the Cardinals won a playoff game  
was 1947 in a one-game postseason. The Chicago Cardinals beat 
Philadelphia for the NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So this is definitely uncharted territory for a squad that  
gained immeasurable confidence from its dominant 20-7 playoff road 
victory over the Dallas Cowboys last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time that you have some success, it builds your  
confidence and it builds your ability to think that you can do even 
more good things,'' coach Vince Tobin said. ``Until you've 
experienced that, I don't think you realize just how good you can 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I've tried to work on for three years -- not  
worrying too much about where we've been but where we're going. I 
think we're an improving football team that feels pretty good about 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case last week, the Cardinals are taking all the  
injured, taxi squad and inactive players with them to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those injured players, wide receiver Anthony Edwards,  
gave an emotional pep talk to the team at the end of Friday's 
practice, just as he had done the previous two weeks. Tobin had 
asked him to speak again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like anything, when you get on a roll you continue to  
call on the things you did before,'' Tobin said. ``I don't know 
whether you'd use the term superstitious. It's more that I'm 
consistent. When things are going a particular way, I like to stay 
in the same routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Metcalf, one of the few Cardinals with playoff experience,  
said the team is loose as it heads to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have the pressure,'' he said. ``Everybody thinks  
that Minnesota is just going to show up and win the game. But it 
still matters what happens between the white lines. We have the 
confidence to go in there and make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jamir Miller said confidence is the team's new  
ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about understanding that it takes confidence to win,'' he  
said. ``That's what we've finally understood. The talent level has 
always been here. Now we're finally starting to play together as a 
team and understanding that regardless of what happens, you can 
win.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Discusses `Dateline' Carjacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A ``Dateline NBC'' correspondent who was  
carjacked at gunpoint in Haiti says she's convinced the robbery was 
engineered by authorities who didn't want her reporting a story 
about alleged trouble with U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The story by correspondent Lea Thompson airs Sunday on  
``Dateline NBC,'' three months after the still-unsolved crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was in Haiti to interview Steven Dieuvit, a former  
mechanic at the U.N. compound there who said he was beaten and 
raped by U.N. peacekeepers. It was one of several allegations of 
abuse that she was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, two camera crew operators and an interpreter were  
returning from an interview at a U.N. compound Oct. 21 when their 
vehicle was blocked by five or six men in a pickup truck. The men 
forced them out of the car and stole it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody didn't want us to do this story,'' Thompson said.  
``Whether it was the (Haitian) police or the U.N., I don't know, 
but I do know it wasn't a bunch of thugs who came up to us and 
suddenly decided they wanted television equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The robbers ignored money and jewelry but were particularly  
interested in Thompson's briefcase, which contained notes and 
documentation for her stories, she said. Some of the equipment and 
tapes that were stolen were later recovered, but some were 
destroyed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was recovered near a police station and the U.S.  
Embassy, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she suspects the robbers had some sort of police or  
military training because of the way they approached the car and 
because they had new semi-automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In Haiti, a police spokesman said only that the attack was under  
investigation. A U.N. press officer there was said to be on 
vacation and unavailable for comment. And the U.S. Embassy said it 
had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said Haitian authorities were preparing to arrest her  
on drug charges because of a syringe that was part of a bee-sting 
kit they found in her wallet. U.S. Embassy officials advised the 
NBC crew to lay low in their hotel and leave the country as quickly 
as possible, which they did. 
</P>
<P>
	After her plane left Haitian airspace, Thompson said, she was  
approached by Bob Manuel, secretary of state for public security 
for the Haitian government, who was a fellow passenger. He told her 
that her gear and tapes had been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised to find out that he had seen our tapes and the  
notes and knew what was in them,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in Haiti, Thompson said, she was approached by a  
representative of the United Nations who said he was sent to tell 
the NBC crew that it had ``better do a good story.''

	Senators Consider Trial Framework  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from both parties gathered today for  
a private meeting aimed at working out a framework for the 
impeachment trial of President Clinton. ``We're close,'' Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said as he arrived. Republicans and 
Democrats walked together into the Old Senate Chamber, the scene of 
many great debates in the first half of the 19th century, in a show 
of bipartisanship as both side tried to keep the proceedings from 
dissolving into partisan sniping.

	Willey Case Witness Indicted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Julie Hiatt Steele, the friend whose testimony  
undermined Kathleen Willey's claim that President Clinton made an 
unwanted sexual advance, has been indicted on charges of lying and 
obstructing justice. Ms. Steele was charged yesterday with three 
counts of obstruction of justice and one count of false statements 
by a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., working with Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr.

	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African police fired at a  
handful of Muslim protesters today, minutes before British Prime

One journalist was wounded. Blair was not hurt and proceeded with 
the event in downtown Cape Town -- the awarding of medals to British 
soldiers who are assisting the South African military.

	Pope Meets With Italian Premier  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II -- an ardent foe of  
communism -- welcomed former communist Massimo D'Alema, Italy's new 
prime minister, to talks at the Vatican today. For many Italians, 
the pontiff's meeting with D'Alema, the first former communist to 
head a West European government, is a sign of acceptance for 
Italians loyal to the nation's ``other church'' -- the Italian 
Communist Party.

	ABC Morning Show Finds Ratings Slip  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS staffers have reason to celebrate now that  
the network's ``This Morning'' show moved up a notch to second 
place behind morning champ, NBC's ``Today.'' ABC's ``Good Morning 
America'' dropped down to third place. The last time the CBS 
morning news program climbed out of last place in the ratings was a 
few weeks in 1983-84 when the show was briefly ahead of ``Today.'' 
CBS hadn't beaten ABC in the morning since January 1977.

	Two Shot at Georgia High School  
</P>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- Two high school students were wounded  
this morning in a shooting at a high school, possibly in a double 
suicide attempt. The two 17-year-olds, both students at Central 
High School in Carrollton, were being treated at Tanner Medical 
Center, spokeswoman Carol Arrington said. The conditions of the 
students -- a boy and a girl -- were not immediately available.

	Unemployment Drops to 4.3 Percent

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of year-end hiring returned the  
nation's unemployment rate to 4.3 percent in December and helped 
produce in 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four 
decades. The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.4 percent in 
November, returned to the level reached in April and May and, 
before that, in 1970, the Labor Department said today.

today. Both officials were involved in Salt Lake's successful bid 
to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. That effort has become the target 
of four investigations into hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
went into scholarships and gifts for International Olympic 
Committee members and their relatives.

	Senate Faces Second Day of Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are working feverishly to keep the  
first presidential impeachment trial this century from becoming a 
model of partisan discord. Majority Leader Trent Lott and his 
Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle, invited their rank-and-file

	KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of people rampaged through  
an Indonesian town today, hurling stones at police stations and 
looting shops. Police fired plastic bullets at the mobs, killing at 
least one person and injuring nine. Rioters in Karawang, on the 
main island of Java, banged drums, burned a motorcycle, taunted 
security forces and threw bricks. They smashed the windows of a 
bank, a hotel, two Protestant churches and attacked the home of an 
ethnic Chinese businessman. Civil unrest plagued the Southeast

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Members of a Denver-based Christian doomsday  
cult packed their belongings today and Israeli authorities said the 
group would be deported this weekend. Police suspect the cult 
members planned a violent incident at one of Jerusalem's holy sites 
to bring about the second coming of Christ as the millennium 
approaches. No charges have been filed. The group's leader, Monte 
Kim Miller, who is not in Israel, has said he would die in the 
streets of Jerusalem in December 1999 and be resurrected three days 
later. There has been concern that cult members were planning a 
mass suicide.

2000. He planned to form a presidential exploratory committee 
today. Alexander, 59, was governor from 1979 to 1987. He also was

Pollard, want fellow senators to demand the former U.S. Navy 
analyst remain in prison for life. Pollard was convicted as a spy 
for handing over thousands of top-secret documents to Israel in 
1984 and 1985. Clinton confirmed last month that he promised 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at U.S.-sponsored 
negotiations with the Palestinians in October that he would look 
into Netanyahu's request for leniency for Pollard.

Tom Barrasso turned aside Sami Kapanen's penalty shot with 1:06 
left in the third period to preserve the win. Barrasso got his left

Jan Hrdina deliberately dislodged the net during a scramble in

his recruits. The university called a ``major'' news conference for 
10 a.m. EST. A spokesman for the men's basketball team wouldn't

Courtland Freeman, said Thompson called yesterday to say he was 
resigning.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains, Livestock Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean and grain futures surged Friday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade, regaining much of their losses from the previous day on 
forecasts for dry weather in South America. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, livestock futures rose, while energy futures  
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after poor export sales figures pushed them lower, soybean  
future prices jumped as much as 7 1/2 cents a bushel. They were 
spurred in part by forecasts for drier-than-expected weather in 
Brazil and Argentina -- conditions that could hurt crops there. 
Others analysts attributed the surge to a correction of the 
previous day's fall, as March corn hit its highest mark since Dec. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really have is a weather-type story here,'' Don Roose,  
an analyst with Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc., said of the 
pre-weekend rash of ``nervous buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roose also said traders were anticipating favorable crop  
production reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to be 
released next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.91 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn was up 2 cents to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; March oats were up 1 cent 
to $1.11 1/2 a bushel; and March soybeans were up 6 1/2 cents to $5.55 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lean hog futures  
continued their upward climb. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 2.1 million head of hogs slaughtered this week  
nationwide -- proof that the Midwestern snowstorm did little to 
prevent farmers from getting their hogs to packers, said Bill 
Plummer, president of Chicago-based Frontier Risk Management. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he thinks lean hog futures will creep above 30 cents a  
pound for farmers as the slaughter rate drops below the 2 
million-head-per-week range in the weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally we're going to get to a point where there are fewer  
hogs than the packer has the capacity to kill,'' Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, February lean hogs rose .48 cent to 37.20  
cents a pound; February live cattle were up .80 cent to 62.52 a 
pound; March feeder cattle were up .57 cent at 72.17 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were .32 cents lower at 49.22 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, February crude  
oil fell 2 cents to $13.07 a barrel; February heating oil rose .32 
cents to 36.11 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline fell .67 
cents to 38.19 cents a gallon; and February natural gas futures 
fell .60 cent to $1.830 a cubic foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst with AG Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in  
St. Louis, says heating oil -- a derivative of crude -- rose only 
because crude futures have been on an upward trend. But forecasts 
for an end to the recent U.S. cold snap are expected to put 
pressure on both heating oil and natural gas futures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to need nasty, long extensive forecasts (for  
cold), and we're just not going to get that,'' O'Grady said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Humans Caused Extinctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the large animals in Australia were  
driven to extinction by the early humans who colonized the 
continent and began using fire to burn the forests, a new study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of researchers led by Gifford Miller of the University of  
Colorado at Boulder reports today in the journal Science that an 
analysis of fossilized egg shells from a huge extinct bird suggests 
that the animals disappeared after humans repeatedly scorched the 
earth in the central regions of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird, called Genyornis newtoni, died out 50,000 years ago.  
More than 85 percent of the Australian animals weighing more than 
100 pounds disappeared at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Just what killed off the Australian animals long has been  
debated by scientists. Some propose the extinctions were caused by 
climatic changes, and others blame early human colonists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have compelling evidence that the Genyornis  
extinction date is applicable to the vast majority of Australian 
megafauna (large animals),'' Miller said in a statement. ``There 
are certainly no secure dates to refute this supposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humans arrived in Australia 53,000 to 60,000 years ago and  
brought to the continent the controlled use of fire. Miller and his 
co-authors said the humans burned vast areas of the outback more 
frequently than natural burning caused by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire was used as a hunting tool, as a way to promote new plant  
growth and as a signal between groups, the researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
	This burning, said Beverly Johnson, a co-author, was extremely  
destructive in what was already a fragile, dry environment. She 
said it so disrupted the normal growth cycles of shrubs and trees 
that the plants eventually died out and deprived the Genyornis and 
other animals of their primary food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frequent burning pushed the ecosystem beyond the point  
where it could regenerate,'' said Johnson, now a researcher at the 
University of Washington in Seattle. Genyornis was so specialized 
in what it ate that it simply perished from malnutrition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genyornis relied primarily on shrubs and trees,'' she said.  
``Emus (another large bird) that lived at the same time had a more 
variable diet, feeding on grasses, trees and shrubs. It survived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extinctions have occurred naturally on all continents over the  
last tens of thousands of years, but Australian fauna has suffered 
the most. About 60 distinct species disappeared. Among them were 19 
types of marsupials, some weighing more than 220 pounds; a 
hippo-sized animal that was related to the wombat; a 25-foot-long 
snake; a 25-foot-long lizard, and a horned tortoise that was the 
size of a small car. 
</P>
<P>
	Genyornis was a huge bird, weighing more than 200 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller, Johnson and their co-authors found evidence of the  
ecosystem change by analyzing the fossil shells of the Genyornis. 
The tests, on shells found in three different locations, determined 
the types of food the bird ate and documented their age. 
</P>
<P>
	Genyornis, they found, appeared about 100,000 years ago and then  
abruptly disappeared about 50,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said that the team eliminated climate change as the  
cause of the Genyornis extinction. She said the animal endured 
extreme climates changes over its 50,000 years of existence and 
died out only after humans had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy F. Flannery, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, said  
the study by Miller and his colleagues has ``broken new ground in 
dating megafaunal extinction in Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flannery, writing an analysis in Science, said the eggshell  
studies ``represent a major challenge'' to scientists who believe 
the Australian extinctions were caused by climate.

<HEADLINE> Dust Rings Bring Hint of Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The first telescope images of dust rings  
around distant stars reveal powerful new evidence of planets formed 
beyond the solar system, astronomers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope of two distant stars  
show dust rings that may have been gravitationally sculpted by 
planets, astronomers said at the national meeting of the American 
Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars, identified as HR 4796A and HD 141569, are both about  
300 light years from Earth. Each is twice the size of the sun, but 
much brighter and much younger at about 10 million years old. 
</P>
<P>
	And, surrounding each star like immense hula hoops are disks of  
dust that appear to have been shaped by planets in the same way 
that the moons of Saturn sculpt the rings about that planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings around one of the stars, HD 141569, have a dark gap  
that may have been cut by the gravitational influence of a planet, 
said Alycia Weinberger of the University of California at Los 
Angeles, a member of the astronomy team that made the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most obvious way to form a gap in a disk is with a  
planet,'' Weinberger said at a news conference. ``The disk is under 
the gravitational influence of some other body. This means that we 
have the circumstantial evidence of a planet about this star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of such rings has been suggested in earlier  
studies, but the Hubble images are the first actual pictures, said 
Bradford A. Smith of the University of Hawaii, another team member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, everything had been inferred,'' said Smith.  
``This is the first time we have actually seen a circumstellar 
disk. It came as a really big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw it, we said, 'Wow, that looks like Saturn,''' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of such rings is part of the process that builds a  
structure like our solar system. The process starts when dust and 
gas come together to begin forming a star. Some of the material 
also clumps together to form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	When the star becomes big enough, its nuclear fires are ignited.  
The outflow from the star blows away the remaining dust and gas, 
leaving behind the planets and some orbiting boulders called 
plantisimals. 
</P>
<P>
	The boulders collide and grind each other up, creating the dust.  
If there are no planets orbiting the star, the dust will disperse. 
But the presence of planets gives the dust a gravitational kick 
that shapes it into a disk. 
</P>
<P>
	In the solar system, which is about four billion years old, only  
a faint dust ring remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Around HD 141569, the disk is 75 billion miles across, ringing  
an area much larger than the entire solar system. The gap in the 
disk is prominent, occupying about five percent of the entire ring. 
The ring is about 21 billion miles from the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring around HR 4796A is about 1.5 billion miles from its  
star. The ring is about 13 billion miles in diameter and about 1.6 
billion miles thick. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the rings were captured by a special camera on Hubble  
that allows photos of the area around a star while blocking the 
bright, obscuring light from its center. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the rings are extremely faint: Detecting them is like  
trying to look at a dime from four miles away.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Begin Life Under Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- When he was doing background checks during his  
coaching search, San Diego Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard 
was told by many that Mike Riley was the best-kept secret in 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the secret's out. Riley, who began a turnaround at  
perennial patsy Oregon State, became the Chargers' fourth coach in 
as many seasons on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Riley seemed mildly dazed with the quick chain of events  
that put him in his first NFL job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it's surprising for a lot of people,'' Riley said.  
``I appreciate their faith in me. This whole thing is kind of a 
surprise to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, 45, signed a guaranteed five-year contract with a salary  
of $750,000 a year, more than five times his base pay of $135,000 
at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	He inherits a team that hasn't had a winning record in three  
seasons, has no first-round draft picks until 2001 and whose 
quarterback, Ryan Leaf, was a bust on the field and a problem off 
it. Interim coach June Jones left for the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was 8-14 in two seasons at Oregon State, which one of his  
predecessors called ``a coach's graveyard.'' The same might be said 
of the Chargers, who were 5-11 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he took the job for the same reason he left his job  
as Southern Cal's offensive coordinator to take the Oregon State 
job in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great opportunity to improve and to work to get  
better, get more wins. That's what we're all after,'' said Riley, 
who grew up in Corvallis, Ore., home to Oregon State. ``I decided 
that this may be the greatest opportunity in my career, and one 
that I'd really like to try. So I took that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Alex Spanos said he's never been as impressed with a coach  
as he was when he first met Riley 10 days ago in Palm Springs, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley soon learned of Spanos' famous impatience when the owner  
said: ``Mike Riley, we're looking to you to take us back to the 
Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers' lone Super Bowl appearance was four years ago, and  
they've gone 26-39 since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly think this is a great fit for me, and I'm very  
appreciative of these guys believing that I can do it,'' Riley 
said. ``I'm anxious to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley followed his father, Bud, into coaching and has known San  
Diego general manager Bobby Beathard for years, even coaching his 
son, Jeff, in the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley had a two-day interview with the Chargers that included  
meeting with the assistant coaches, many of them remaining at 
Beathard's insistence. Among them are those who coached the NFL's 
top-ranked defense, plus Joe Bugel (offensive line) and Ollie 
Wilson (running backs). 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he'll probably hire four coaches from outside the  
organization, including an offensive coordinator-quarterbacks 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's workable,'' he said of inheriting so many assistants. ``I  
need NFL experience on this staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard has spoken with former Baltimore Ravens quarterbacks  
coach Don Strock about possibly filling the same role in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	After the disastrous 6-16 tenure of Kevin Gilbride, who was  
fired Oct. 13, Beathard wanted to hire someone he was familiar 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call anybody who's ever been associated with Mike  
Riley and find out quickly what type of person he is,'' Beathard 
said. ``As good a person as he is, he's equally as good a football 
coach. I've got a very, very strong gut feeling about Mike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley comes highly regarded as a smart coach and a good person.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's my man. I think he is a good coach, very creative,''  
said New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who played at 
Southern Cal when Riley was the Trojans' offensive coordinator. 
``He helped me become the No. 1 pick. He recognizes talent, I do 
know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers think Riley can develop Leaf, who was benched after  
nine games because of poor play and his off-field antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can work with any football player,'' Beathard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he's confident the Chargers can turn it around  
because of the number of close games they played and because the 
team played hard even though it was out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard great things about the character of this team and  
how hard they played, and that is a great starting point for any 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the  
pass-happy CFL from 1987-90, won two Grey Cups and was named the 
league's coach of the year each time. He was at USC from 1993-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State was 5-6 last fall, its best record since 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he also was contacted by the Baltimore Ravens and  
Chicago Bears.

<HEADLINE>  Holmgren Hits It Rich in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren is leaving Brett Favre and  
Green Bay to relocate to Seattle, where his quarterback will be Jon 
Kitna. On the other hand, he will be the highest-paid coach in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen gave Holmgren, the Packers'  
coach for the last seven seasons, an eight-year contract that 
reportedly will pay him $32 million -- $4 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, the third-richest American behind Bill Gates and Warren  
Buffett with a total worth of $22 billion, flew from Costa Rica to 
Seattle to hold a dinner party for Holmgren Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest things was Mike wanted to meet Paul very  
badly,'' agent Bob LaMonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, 50, liked what he heard from Allen and on Friday  
accepted a job as coach and general manager of the Seahawks, a 
franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen played host to Holmgren, Holmgren's wife, Kathy, and the  
couple's youngest of four daughters, Gretchen, a high school 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to Paul's -- I was going to say home like we say home --  
but I want to say compound,'' LaMonte said. ``Needless to say, it 
was wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the Packers were eliminated from the playoffs by  
San Francisco, Holmgren received total control from Allen and team 
president Bob Whitsitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happened very, very quickly,'' LaMonte said.  
</P>
<P>
	By giving Holmgren a reported $32 million, a figure that neither  
LaMonte nor the Seahawks would confirm, Allen established a 
precedent in the NFL's coaching salary structure. 
</P>
<P>
	George Seifert received $2.5 million in his contract to become  
coach of the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that NBA lockout, I wasn't in midseason form with these  
agents,'' said Whitsitt, who also is president of Allen's Portland 
Trail Blazers. ``I got worn down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It became abundantly clear that they were not going to let  
Mike Holmgren go to Baltimore, no matter what,'' LaMonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a reason. After firing Dennis Erickson Dec. 28, the  
Seahawks felt they needed to do something dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who took the Packers to the last two Super Bowls, told  
Whitsitt Friday morning that he was accepting the job and canceled 
scheduled trips to Baltimore and Philadelphia for job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Packers to tell them they'd have to find a new  
coach to work with Green Bay GM Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the commitment is here,'' Holmgren said, referring  
to Allen, who has spent lavishly on free agents like running back 
Ricky Watters and linebacker Chad Brown in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first impression was awesome,'' Holmgren said of Allen.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time last night. He's a very interesting  
man, interested in a lot of things. I knew right away that I had 
all the support I could ever need or ask for right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most important for Holmgren was becoming general manager as well  
as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be in charge of the football operations,'' he said during  
a news conference. ``Decision-making, personnel, all football 
decisions. Now I'll have both (GM and coach) those 
responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in charge of Randy Mueller, vice president of  
football operations for the Seahawks for four seasons. In effect, 
Mueller has been Seattle's de facto general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren compiled a 75-37 record as coach of the Packers,  
leading them to a victory over New England in the Super Bowl after 
the 1996 season. In last year's Super Bowl, Green Bay lost to 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In Green Bay, Holmgren coached his teams into the playoffs six  
years in a row. In order, the Packers went 9-7, 9-7, 9-7, 11-5, 
13-3, 13-3 and 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having control and a record-breaking contract,  
Holmgren will field a team in a new outdoor stadium with a grass 
field in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's departure from Green Bay means the Seahawks will have  
to give the Packers their 1999 second-round draft choice.

<HEADLINE> Gore Won't Shift Away From Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, linking his  
fortunes ever closer to President Clinton's, said Republican 
leaders ``are completely obsessed'' with impeachment and are 
misreading the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there is a big disconnect between part of the  
Republican Party, including the Republican leadership in the House 
of Representatives, for example, and the rest of the American 
people where President Clinton is concerned,'' Gore said in an 
Associated Press interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is widely expected to seek the Democratic nomination for  
president in 2000, and some Republicans have sought to saddle him 
with some of Clinton's baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing formation of his exploratory committee, former  
Education Secretary Lamar Alexander suggested Gore has become 
little more than an apologist for Clinton, moving beyond the 
loyalty expected of a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore dismissed the suggestion, saying, ``I'm not bothered by it  
in the least,'' and turning his fire on Republicans attacking 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The national Republican Party appears to be completely  
obsessed with attacking the president and the House Republican 
leadership seems to be obsessed with dragging out this process and 
trying to remove him from office,'' said Gore. ``The American 
people don't agree with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has established his own exploratory committee and faces the  
traditional problem vice presidents experience when they begin 
seeking the top spot -- carving out an individual identity without 
appearing disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Gore said there was no reason to establish  
distance from Clinton, despite the impeachment controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any intention of trying to come up with some  
artificial political design aimed at separating myself from the 
president,'' said Gore. ``This has been a Clinton-Gore 
administration from day one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore flatly rejected suggestions he's vulnerable because of his  
closeness to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton is a great president and he has made a tremendous  
positive difference in the lives of Americans,'' said Gore. ``I 
feel privileged to be a part of his administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most consider Gore the prohibitive favorite to get the  
Democratic presidential nomination, though he's likely to have 
competition. Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone and former New Jersey 
Sen. Bill Bradley are among those considering a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's comments came on his latest swing through Iowa, where  
precinct caucuses traditionally launch the presidential nominating 
season. In that swing, he was giving lessons in the clout that 
holding the White House brings to the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving for an anti-drug town meeting, Gore announced a $50  
million subsidy program for financially strapped hog farmers. At 
the later drug event, he announced a $1.2 million federal grant to 
the state to combat the drug methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	At that town meeting, prosecutors, students and teachers spoke  
of a methamphetamine epidemic that's sweeping through the Midwest. 
Law enforcement officials report the highly addictive and 
relatively cheap drug is the region's fastest growing narcotics 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to elevate awareness,'' said Gore, and White House  
drug policy director Barry McCaffrey added: ``Meth addiction is the 
worst addiction we have seen, bar none.''

<HEADLINE> Alcoa's 4Q Profits Jump 23 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. reported Friday that  
its earnings soared 23 percent in the fourth quarter thanks to cost 
reductions and increased sales. The company's stock jumped 10 
percent on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa earned $218.3 million, or $1.19 per share, compared to  
$177.6 million, or $1.23 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings topped analysts' expectations of $1.06 per share,  
as reported by First Call Corp. The company's stock lept 10 
percent, or $7.75, to $85 in afternoon trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three months ending Dec. 31 were $4.2 billion,  
compared to $3.3 billion during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Alcoa announced a 50 percent increase in the  
company's quarterly stock dividend to 37.5 cents per share on a 
pre-split basis, a 10 million share repurchase program and a 
two-for-one stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	After the split, Alcoa will have about 367 million common shares  
outstanding. The new stock will be distributed on Feb. 25 to 
shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes reflect our conviction that we have achieved a  
new base level of operating performance and that further major 
improvements will be realized this year,'' said Alcoa chairman and 
chief executive officer Paul O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa, the world's largest producer of aluminum, shipped nearly  
1.2 million metric tons of aluminum products in the last quarter of 
1998, compared with 734,000 metric tons in the same quarter of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income in the 1998 fourth quarter included after-tax losses  
of $900,000 for marking to market some aluminum commodity 
contracts. In 1997, the same losses amounted to $11.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 quarter included an after-tax gain of $32.7 million  
from the sale of Alcoa's Brazilian cable business and a land sale 
in Japan. The net income increase excludes that special item. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Alcoa had a profit of $853 million, or $4.87  
per share, up 12 percent from 1997, when profits totaled $761.2 
million, or $4.66 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The attributed its improved performance for the year in part to  
the acquisition of two companies: Inespal, Spain's state-held 
aluminum business, and Alumax of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors helped the company overcome a 20 percent decline  
in aluminum prices since the beginning of the year, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for all of 1998 were $15.3 billion versus $13.3 billion  
for 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen today in  
Tokyo amid rumors that a U.S. ratings agency may downgrade Japan's 
sovereign debt. Tokyo share prices fell after a two-day advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 144.75 points,  
or 1.07 percent, closing the week at 13,391.81 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. It had a gain 
of 235.72 points, or 1.78 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 111.42 yen, up 0.44 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 111.04 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar briefly moved as high as 112.40 yen in the afternoon  
on rumors that a U.S. rating agency might downgrade Japanese 
government bonds, but it quickly retreated to the low-111-yen 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's both said they  
were not planning to release ratings updates on Japan for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewed concern about the U.S. and Brazilian economies weighed  
on the dollar for much of today's trading in Asia, despite rounds 
of position-adjustment buying of dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 110.52 yen and 112.40 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at $1.1676, up from $1.1642 in  
Tokyo late Thursday but below $1.1713 late Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks finished lower today on concern over  
earnings among Japanese exporters amid continued volatility in 
global foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were worried that the dollar's rapid fall below 110.00  
yen on Thursday in overseas market for the first time in 27 months 
would affect on the outlook for profits of Japanese exporters, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't make money at these levels,'' said Robert Sasaki,  
head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among losers were major exporters, including Sony and Toyota  
Motor. Sony's stocks fell for a seventh straight session, finishing 
at $68.20 per share, down $1.17. Toyota Motor closed at $25.67, 
down $1.03. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen cuts into profits made overseas by Japanese  
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was moderate with about 358 million shares changing  
hands on the first section, compared with Thursday's turnover of 
383 million shares. Declines outnumbered advances 843 to 293, with 
154 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 11.20 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,058.40. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.84 points, or 1.02 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.670 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.710 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.05 yen from 100.73 yen.

<HEADLINE> Report: Holmgren To Coach Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren has been  
hired as coach and general manager of the Seattle Seahawks, ESPN 
reported today, five days after the Packers were eliminated from 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said the long-term deal was worth more than $4  
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report could not be immediately confirmed with the Seahawks.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m. EST.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Packers referred all questions about  
Holmgren to the Seahawks. Packers president Bob Harlan did not 
immediately return a telephone message to The Associated Press for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	With Green Bay eliminated by the San Francisco 49ers in the  
first round of the playoffs, the Packers coach was at the Seahawks' 
headquarters Thursday, interviewing for the job left vacant when 
Seattle fired coach Dennis Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren has said he would like a position in which he would be  
general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked for hours Thursday with team president Bob Whitsitt  
before going to dinner at the Mercer Island home of Microsoft 
co-founder Paul Allen, owner of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, coach of the Packers for seven seasons, was  
accompanied by his agent, Bob LaMonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Whitsitt spoke when a five-hour meeting broke up Thursday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was productive,'' he said. ``Obviously, we still  
have more conversations to continue with, which we will be doing 
into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said earlier, we're not going to give you a big  
play-by-play every time we're interviewing people. But I guess you 
know he's here and we're talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt and Holmgren also met for several hours earlier  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt said last week that Allen would only become involved in  
the latter stages of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect when we get down to the final meeting of our  
choice, that Paul will be in the meeting,'' Whitsitt told the 
Post-Intelligencer. ``It is important for the head coach to know 
who the owner is and for the owner to know who the coach is, and to 
have that chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle fired Erickson Dec. 28 after the Seahawks missed making  
the playoffs for the 10th year in a row, the longest drought among 
NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, 50, coached the Packers to victory two years ago in  
the Super Bowl. He has one more year left on his contract in Green 
Bay, where he earned $2 million this season.

<HEADLINE>  Holmgren Hits It Rich in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren is leaving Brett Favre and  
Green Bay to relocate to Seattle, where his quarterback will be Jon 
Kitna. On the other hand, he will be the highest-paid coach in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen gave Holmgren, the Packers'  
coach for the last seven seasons, an eight-year contract that 
reportedly will pay him $32 million -- $4 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, the third-richest American behind Bill Gates and Warren  
Buffett with a total worth of $22 billion, flew from Costa Rica to 
Seattle to hold a dinner party for Holmgren Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest things was Mike wanted to meet Paul very  
badly,'' agent Bob LaMonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, 50, liked what he heard from Allen and on Friday  
accepted a job as coach and general manager of the Seahawks, a 
franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen played host to Holmgren, Holmgren's wife, Kathy, and the  
couple's youngest of four daughters, Gretchen, a high school 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to Paul's -- I was going to say home like we say home --  
but I want to say compound,'' LaMonte said. ``Needless to say, it 
was wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the Packers were eliminated from the playoffs by  
San Francisco, Holmgren received total control from Allen and team 
president Bob Whitsitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happened very, very quickly,'' LaMonte said.  
</P>
<P>
	By giving Holmgren a reported $32 million, a figure that neither  
LaMonte nor the Seahawks would confirm, Allen established a 
precedent in the NFL's coaching salary structure. 
</P>
<P>
	George Seifert received $2.5 million in his contract to become  
coach of the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that NBA lockout, I wasn't in midseason form with these  
agents,'' said Whitsitt, who also is president of Allen's Portland 
Trail Blazers. ``I got worn down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It became abundantly clear that they were not going to let  
Mike Holmgren go to Baltimore, no matter what,'' LaMonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a reason. After firing Dennis Erickson Dec. 28, the  
Seahawks felt they needed to do something dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who took the Packers to the last two Super Bowls, told  
Whitsitt Friday morning that he was accepting the job and canceled 
scheduled trips to Baltimore and Philadelphia for job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Packers to tell them they'd have to find a new  
coach to work with Green Bay GM Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the commitment is here,'' Holmgren said, referring  
to Allen, who has spent lavishly on free agents like running back 
Ricky Watters and linebacker Chad Brown in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first impression was awesome,'' Holmgren said of Allen.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time last night. He's a very interesting  
man, interested in a lot of things. I knew right away that I had 
all the support I could ever need or ask for right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most important for Holmgren was becoming general manager as well  
as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be in charge of the football operations,'' he said during  
a news conference. ``Decision-making, personnel, all football 
decisions. Now I'll have both (GM and coach) those 
responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in charge of Randy Mueller, vice president of  
football operations for the Seahawks for four seasons. In effect, 
Mueller has been Seattle's de facto general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren compiled a 75-37 record as coach of the Packers,  
leading them to a victory over New England in the Super Bowl after 
the 1996 season. In last year's Super Bowl, Green Bay lost to 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In Green Bay, Holmgren coached his teams into the playoffs six  
years in a row. In order, the Packers went 9-7, 9-7, 9-7, 11-5, 
13-3, 13-3 and 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having control and a record-breaking contract,  
Holmgren will field a team in a new outdoor stadium with a grass 
field in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's departure from Green Bay means the Seahawks will have  
to give the Packers their 1999 second-round draft choice.

<HEADLINE> GOP Congressman Debates 1999 HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This year's battle over HMOs began in earnest  
on Capitol Hill as a maverick Republican again cast his lot with 
President Clinton, complicating the hot political issue for his own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, congressional Democrats and now Rep. Charles Norwood,  
R-Ga., have pledged to battle through 1999 to give patients new 
rights to sue their health insurance companies, choose their 
doctors and get needed treatments in the era of cost-conscious 
managed care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we allowed partisanship and scandal to defeat a  
truly nonpartisan effort,'' Norwood told reporters Thursday. ``We 
will not make that mistake again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course scandal continues to preoccupy Congress, with the  
Senate's impeachment trial officially under way. Norwood's HMO news 
conference was a rare moment of policy on display on Capitol Hill 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, faced with Democratic momentum on the issue and polls  
showing voter dissatisfaction with health maintenance 
organizations, House Republicans wrote their own legislation and 
pushed it through the House on a party-line vote. Democrats 
denounced it as a sham, saying it did not address the core issues. 
The bill died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood went along with his party in 1998. But he insisted  
Thursday that this time he will fight for a bipartisan plan. He 
also refused to back off of the most contentious issue in the 
debate: the right to sue health plans, an idea that is anathema to 
business, insurance companies and many Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Norwood attracted more than 200 co-sponsors to his  
legislation, including nearly 100 Republicans. He made it clear 
that if GOP leaders bottle up his bill, he will work to get half 
the members of the House to sign a discharge petition, which would 
force a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has not signed up any co-sponsors, opting to  
introduce the bill alone on the first day of the new Congress. But 
he is expected to attract significant support again. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have lots of opposition. Business and insurance lobbies  
were quick to denounce Norwood's bill as more big government that 
will raise the cost of health insurance and force employers to drop 
coverage for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big government mandates are the wrong prescription for health  
care,'' said a statement from Dan Danner, chairman of the Health 
Benefits Coalition, a group of employers and insurers that led the 
fight to defeat HMO legislation last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition was also quick to link Norwood to liberal Sen.  
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. GOP polling has found that just mentioning 
Kennedy turns off many Americans, but Norwood, who had a 
conservative reputation before the HMO issue surfaced, resisted the 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Kennedy and I are not going to have a press conference,''  
Norwood bristled. ``Not on your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Norwood may have better luck this year than they  
did in 1998. Last year's GOP measure passed by just five votes, and 
Democrats gained five House seats in the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood was temporarily buoyed by Republicans' initial choice  
for speaker: Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who was a co-sponsor of 
Norwood's HMO bill. But then Livingston gave up the post and 
announced he would resign after disclosures that he had had 
extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the new House speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., may  
be more inclined to allow the committee process to run its course 
than former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., was. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert was chairman of the Republican task force that produced  
the legislation that was so strongly opposed by Democrats. Norwood 
insisted that Hastert is more friendly to the cause than he let on. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was following orders'' from GOP leaders, Norwood said.  
``There is a lot of this he understands and agrees with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year may be different, with presidential elections looming.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone wants this on the plate for the year  
2000,'' Norwood said. ``We will have a health care bill.''

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Drops to 4.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of year-end hiring returned the  
nation's unemployment rate to 4.3 percent in December and helped 
produce in 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.4 percent in November,  
returned to the level reached in April and, before that, in 1970, 
the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, unemployment averaged 4.5 percent, the lowest  
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. The 1998 mark was 
the lowest peacetime rate since 1957, when it averaged 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, employers added 378,000 jobs to their payrolls --  
the most in 15 months and nearly double what analysts anticipated. 
Some of the gain reflected unseasonably warm weather, which 
produced a huge 104,000 gain in construction but much of it 
reflected the U.S. economy's resilience in the face of the global 
economic slump that began in Asia a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, employers added 2.9 million jobs, compared with  
3.4 million in 1997. That growth was achieved despite 234,000 job 
losses in manufacturing and 35,000 in mining, principally 
oil-drilling, reflecting slack world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, makers of computers, farm equipment and other  
industrial machinery recorded 10,000 job losses but manufacturers 
whose products are used in construction -- stone, clay and glass 
products, furniture and fixtures -- are still hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction has been helped not only by warm weather at the end  
of the year but by low interest rates, a byproduct of economic 
problems elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Payrolls in related service industries also are growing  
strongly. Real estate firms added 5,000 jobs in December 57,000 
jobs in 1998, double the gain of 1997, and mortgage brokerages 
added 4,000 in December and 52,000 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers expanded their payrolls by 53,000 in December,  
reflecting big increases at restaurants, department stores and 
building-supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of brisk job growth last year included temporary  
help firms, computer and management services and public relations. 
However, new jobs in health services totaled 131,000, about half as 
many as in 1997. Changes in government reimbursement policies led 
to declines in home health care services. 
</P>
<P>
	Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor  
Statistics, cautioned that December job growth may have been 
inflated somewhat by a statistical anomaly. The department recorded 
59,000 new jobs in government after seasonal adjustment, most of 
them state education jobs. But that probably reflects the fact that 
it surveyed a bit earlier in December than usual and a 
larger-than-usual number of colleges were still in session, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists are predicting the labor market will weaken  
somewhat this year, though it will remain healthy by historical 
standards. The number of Americans filing first-time claims for 
unemployment benefits jumped during the last two weeks of December 
to the highest level since the summer's General Motors strikes. And 
layoff announcements doubled in December, compared with November. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, though, strong labor demand, coupled with  
inflation in consumer prices of less than 2 percent, has increased 
Americans' buying power. Average hourly wages for nonfarm, 
nonsupervisory workers rose 5 cents in December to $12.98, up 3.8 
percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touting Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- President Clinton traded Washington's storms for  
Midwest snow today to celebrate the roaring economy during his 
now-imperiled administration. ``Most things are going right for our 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reveling in new economic data marking a 41-year peacetime low in  
the unemployment rate and ``the longest peacetime expansion in 
history,'' Clinton addressed a luncheon of the Detroit Economic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gather today at a time of American economic renaissance,''  
he said in a speech before taking questions on trade, international 
finance and defense spending from some of the club's 2,000 members 
and guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's political predicament was not raised in the audience's  
written questions fielded by the city's Democratic mayor, Dennis 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton heralded a new report by his Council of Economic  
Advisers charting the economy's continued growth over the past 93 
months as the nation's longest peacetime expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion following the 1982 recession lasted 92 months,  
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which 
determines changes in the business cycle using a combination of 
measures of gross domestic product, income, employment and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department presented with Clinton more good news  
today: a national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in December, 
giving 1998 the strongest peacetime labor market in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again. It's working -- not just the economy.  
The crime rate's the lowest in 25 years. A lot of our social 
problems are receding. It's working again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His address, set against the backdrop of the turmoil in  
Washington, read like a defense of his six years in office. He took 
credit for the fiscal discipline and investments that he said drive 
the current economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he broadly traced his agenda for his remaining two years.  
``We will never have -- in all probability in the lifetime of people 
in this room -- to take the long view, to imagine how our children 
will live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While senators on Capitol Hill moved closer to working out  
details for the impeachment trial determining his fate, Clinton 
leisurely browsed the North American International Auto Show and 
watched a demonstration of futuristic fuel technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the future,'' Clinton told reporters at the  
show. ``It made me feel like a kid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech, sketching themes he will underscore in  
his upcoming State of the Union address and new budget, was planned 
before anyone knew it would fall on the day after the Senate opened 
trial proceedings on the impeachment charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let Bill alone! Let Bill alone!'' was the chant at a rally  
today organized by Detroit's Democratic Rep. John Conyers and union 
activists outside the Cobo Center, site of the auto show and 
Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits of escaping Washington -- the impeachment drama and  
a couple inches of snow -- were not lost on White House aides eager 
to show that Clinton was above the fray and focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foot of snow that left many Detroit streets  
unplowed, Clinton was lingering here even as another 2 to 4 inches 
of snow was forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his hourlong tour of the auto show, he was to  
tape his weekly radio address from the United Auto Workers union 
hall and participate in other private events there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has expanded from one to two days his trip to New York  
on Thursday for a conference of Wall Street executives trying to 
increase minority participation in the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's always looking for opportunities to travel  
around the country to see the American people,'' White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv said Thursday. ``And the auto show is a symbol 
of our economic future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is expected to  
draw 800,000 visitors to see the retro new editions of the 
Volkswagen Beetle, Ford T-Bird and Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a repressed hot-rodder confined to presidential  
limousines, owns a 1967 Mustang convertible that he and his 
brother, Roger, helped restore. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of today's CEA report have become familiar fodder for  
Clinton speeches in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
	--Average family income rose $3,500 from March 1991 to December  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--New jobs totaled 18.6 million in the same period, with 17.5  
million of them created since January 1993 when Clinton took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the State of the Union coming up, it's a good time for  
the president to reiterate economic themes that have been part of 
every State of the Union address because he's had a consistent 
policy,'' Toiv said.

<HEADLINE> Bail Denied in Forced-Marriage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Two men accused of trying to smuggle a  
bound-and-gagged woman across the U.S. border in a frigid car trunk 
were denied bail Friday as family members disputed her claim of 
being forced into an arranged marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal magistrate ruled that Afghanistan natives Jamal Nasser  
Aziz, 37, of Toronto, and Wahid Nader, 29, of San Francisco, are a 
danger to the woman, Mine Betoor. Aziz, Ms. Betoor's uncle, and 
Nader, her would-be husband, face kidnapping and smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration agents discovered Ms. Betoor at the Rainbow Bridge  
in Niagara Falls on Jan. 1. Authorities said her hands and feet had 
been bound, a scarf was placed in her mouth and she had been in the 
trunk 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betoor, whose age was not released, told authorities she was  
trying to escape the Dec. 29 marriage in Toronto when Aziz and 
Nader knocked her unconscious. She said she was held more than two 
days in the basement of her uncle's home before being put in the 
trunk, where she was joined by Nader. She said Aziz threatened to 
kill her if she made a noise. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing against bail, federal prosecutors said Ms. Betoor  
fears for her life because her family supports the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives claimed she is lying.  
</P>
<P>
	Aziz's brother, Abdul Aziz, and a cousin who would not give his  
name, said Ms. Betoor and Nader had been married since 1994. They 
showed what appeared to be a marriage certificate from Pakistan and 
photos of Ms. Betoor and Nader together. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed Ms. Betoor, living in Canada since 1995, wanted to  
see the United States. They said Ms. Betoor made up the arranged 
marriage claim so she wouldn't get in trouble if caught, and that 
they were told she wanted to be gagged in case she panicked and 
screamed at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Aziz and Nader said they were still sorting out  
details and could not confirm the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unusual for an alien to want to be smuggled in  
bound and gagged,'' said assistant U.S. Attorney Trini Ross. 
``Common sense says that makes absolutely no sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And whether the couple really are married is irrelevant because  
a spouse has no authority to kidnap another spouse, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nader, a naturalized American citizen, was convicted last year  
of assaulting Ms. Betoor. Aziz, a naturalized Canadian citizen, was 
convicted in 1996 of aiding and abetting people who illegally 
entered Canada.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy Estimates Have Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A long look deep into space by the Hubble  
Space Telescope has led astronomers to increase their estimate of 
the total number of galaxies in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an experiment called the Hubble Deep Field South, the space  
telescope was focused on a small portion of the sky above the 
Southern Hemisphere for 10 days, taking images of galaxies out to 
about 11 billion light-years. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the number of objects detected by the telescope,  
astronomers estimated that the universe contains about 125 billion 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier study, called the Hubble Deep Field North, the  
total number of galaxies was estimated at 80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry C. Ferguson of the Space Telescope Institute in Baltimore  
said the new estimate is higher because the space telescope has new 
instruments that allowed it to look farther than was possible in 
the first deep field study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it could look deeper, he said, the telescope detected a  
greater density of galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said the new study focused on an ordinary part of the  
sky over the Southern Hemisphere. The target was incredibly small, 
about the apparent size of a grain of sand held at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
	But the telescope looked through some 11 billion light-years of  
space, exploiting the absolute limit of the telescope's keen 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of the study was to capture a narrow beam sample of  
what the universe is like. It is rather like a core sample of the 
heavens. The images now will be studied by hundreds of astronomers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The first deep field study by the Hubble resulted in dozens of  
new discoveries and increased a general understanding about the 
nature of the most distant part of the universe.

<HEADLINE> Profiles of Olympic Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Profiles of the two top officers of the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee who resigned Friday amid the Olympics bribery scandal: 
</P>
<P>
 *FRANK G. JOKLIK   	
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, 70, president and chief executive officer of the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee, had been actively involved in the city's 
Olympic effort for more than a decade. In October 1991 he was 
appointed chairman of the city's Olympic bid committee after Salt 
Lake narrowly lost the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1995, after Salt Lake won the 2002 bid, Joklik became  
chairman of the board of trustees for SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected SLOC president and CEO in August 1997, after Tom  
Welch resigned in the wake of spouse-abuse allegations. Joklik was 
paid $280,000 a year. He declined retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	A geologist, Joklik was president and CEO of copper mining giant  
Kennecott Corp., from 1980 to 1993, when he retired. He was elected 
president and CEO of MK Gold company in November 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Vienna, Austria, Joklik grew up in Australia, where he  
received a doctorate in geology at the University of Sydney. He 
came to the United States in 1953 as a Fulbright Scholar at 
Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC and IOC leaders endorsed the appointment of Joklik, a  
seasoned executive with international credentials and the 
experience to pull together large-scale projects. They trusted he 
could get the organizing committee, still reeling from the Welch 
affair, back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Welch's appointees quit and Joklik hired his own team to  
oversee creation of a $1.45 billion budget and a detailed 
three-year schedule for staging the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *DAVID R. JOHNSON   	
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 40, the SLOC's senior vice president, played a major  
role in fundraising and playing host to members of the 
International Olympic Committee during Salt Lake's bidding efforts 
for the Winter Games of 1998 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Johnson's responsibilities was to learn the likes and  
dislikes of IOC members and keep track of where the bid committee's 
votes were. Former Olympic officials said other bid cities had 
similar pointmen who kept tabs on those IOC members who could be 
influenced with gifts and perks, and those who shunned the 
freebies. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Welch and Joklik, Johnson kept a low profile and was paid  
for his work on the bid effort after becoming involved in 
mid-1980s. In 1995, he earned $237,639 and his current salary is 
about $200,000, SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said. Had he stayed with 
SLOC through 2002, he stood to retire on a $62,500 annual pension. 
</P>
<P>
	A Salt Lake City native and University of Utah graduate, Johnson  
was responsible for the planning, coordination, implementation and 
management of all functional aspects of the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympics bribery scandal was not Johnson's first brush with  
controversy. When he headed the Utah Sports Foundation, he kept his 
job even after a legislative audit found he had double-billed 
expenses while also working for a group raising money for the 
Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A former salesman for SLOC chairman Robert Garff's auto  
dealerships, Johnson is a past director of sport development for 
the state's Community and Economic Development office. He also 
worked for Turner Broadcasting, coordinating sites and logistics 
for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also was involved with bidding and organizing events for  
the board of directors of the U.S. Olympic Committee, national 
sports federations and other Olympic community groups.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cult Members May Be Deported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Members of a Denver-based Christian doomsday  
cult packed their belongings today and Israeli authorities said the 
group would be deported this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspect the cult members planned a violent incident at  
one of Jerusalem's holy sites to bring about the second coming of 
Christ as the millennium approaches. No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's leader, Monte Kim Miller, who is not in Israel, has  
said he would die in the streets of Jerusalem in December 1999 and 
be resurrected three days later. There has been concern that cult 
members were planning a mass suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen cult members arrived in Israel in September, settled in  
two homes in the Jerusalem suburbs of Mevasseret Zion and Moza and 
eventually came under police surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, police raided the two homes and detained the  
14, including six children. Deportation orders were issued against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, accompanied by one of the 14, entered one of the homes  
today in Mevasseret Zion. The young man, who appeared to be in his 
late teens or early 20s, was handcuffed when he emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli security agents with walkie-talkies rolled four  
suitcases out of the house and loaded them into a white van. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't talk,'' one of the officers told the man when he was  
approached by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Security agents arrived at the other home in Moza to gather the  
belongings of cult members. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the deportation  
would apparently take place today or Saturday. The group's 
destination was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cult members questioned by police earlier this week --  
Terry Smith, John Bayles and Eric Malesic -- told their Israeli 
lawyer that they don't want to return home because they fear the 
United States will be destroyed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they preferred to go to Greece, but it was not clear  
whether Greece would accept them. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyer, Eran Avital, said he was never shown the alleged  
evidence against his clients. The three have denied any wrongdoing 
and told Avital they simply wanted to await the millennium in 
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Banks, Brokerages Set Up Risk Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last fall the nation's biggest bankers and brokers spent $3.6  
billion to bail out a high-risk investment fund that had nearly 
borrowed itself into extinction. Now some of these same firms are 
banding together to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of last year's Long-Term Capital Management debacle,  
a dozen of the nation's biggest banks and brokerage firms formed a 
new group to develop risk standards for financial institutions 
extending credit in volatile global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Top executives of the Wall Street giants met Wednesday in New  
York with Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and senior staff members of the presidential Working 
Group on Financial Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential group has been looking at possible restrictions  
on bank loans to risky investment funds in the aftermath of LTCM's 
near-collapse in September. After the fund's managers bet big on 
interest-rate swings and lost, the fund's meltdown threatened to 
disrupt world financial markets. The Federal Reserve helped arrange 
a $3.6 billion bailout by a group of big banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of those financial institutions also are members of the  
new industry group whose formation was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street companies, led by executives of investment firms  
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said in a statement 
they were forming the group ``in the aftermath of the severe market 
disruptions experienced in the late summer and early fall of 
1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies noted that their move is supported by Levitt,  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strong set of best practices (by financial institutions) is  
a useful contribution,'' said Howard Schloss, a spokesman for 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Levitt declined comment, and Greenspan's spokesmen  
couldn't immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to J.P. Morgan and Goldman, Sachs, the new group  
includes Citigroup, Chase Manhattan, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., Bear Stearns, Germany's Deutsche Bank 
and Britain's Barclays Bank.

<HEADLINE>  Gen.: Saddam Desperate for Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last month's U.S and British air attacks  
against Iraq may have killed between 600 to 1,600 members of Saddam 
Hussein's Republican Guard, as well as ``several key individuals'' 
in his leadership structure, America's top general said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost a lot,'' Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, said at a breakfast with defense writers. The 
four-star Army general was questioned about the latest estimates of 
damage done in the four-day operation which targeted the Iraqi 
leader's top military units and his ability to use weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing also destroyed unique pieces of equipment used to  
maintain, repair and improve Iraq's missile capability. That means 
Saddam's program has been put back two years, instead of just one, 
the commander of Operation Desert Fox, Gen. Anthony Zinni, said at 
a separate press conference at the Pentagon later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In targeting Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and the means  
to use them, the United States used intelligence gathered by U2 spy 
planes and by eavesdropping on Iraq's communications network, a 
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The information gathering was conducted as part of a ``pool''  
drawn by the U.N. monitoring commission from several nations, 
including the United States, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not unilateral,'' the official said. ``It was done  
under UNSCOM's direction. It was focused solely on where the stuff 
was concealed.'' UNSCOM is the U.N. special commission monitoring 
Iraqi weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, the general in charge of Desert Fox said he was  
not aware that any information gained through the U.N. inspectors 
had been used by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the bombing hit ``several key individuals that were  
in the upper structure, that were no longer available to him to 
advise or to lead.'' Asked if that meant they were killed, Shelton 
replied, ``Yes.'' He declined to name the individuals, cite their 
positions or what their importance might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	The general emphasized that his estimates of deaths were ``based  
on unconfirmed reporting from a variety of sources,'' and warned 
that they were very difficult to determine exactly. He said, 
however, that the latest information ``would now indicate that 
there were hundreds of intended casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military officials have said the Republican Guards and the  
Special Republican Guards were targeted in the four-day operation 
because they protect Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, such as 
biological or chemical weapons and the missiles or aircraft used to 
deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... give you a range from about 600 to 1,600 that could have  
been killed and probably several times that ... that were killed or 
injured,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton and Zinni said they considered the operation successful  
because of the ``one-of-a-kind'' type of military items destroyed 
and because civilian damage was very low. Also, no U.S. forces were 
killed in the operation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni, the Marine Corps general who heads the U.S. Central  
Command, said the ``structural damage was far more severe'' to 
Saddam's military units than first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-star general said his estimates of deaths ranged up to  
2,000 Iraqis, but he did not clarify the difference between his 
figures and Shelton's. In any case, he said, such numbers were not 
the measure of the success of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We struck and damaged significantly'' 85 percent of the  
targets, Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, to his knowledge, the U.S. military didn't  
specifically use intelligence gathered by U.N. weapons inspection 
efforts to select Iraqi targets. He also said he didn't receive any 
``real-time'' information about Iraqi movements from any listening 
devices that were reportedly planted in Iraq by U.S. intelligence 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that the  
United States sent a spy into Iraq in March in the guise of a U.N. 
inspector to install an electronic eavesdropping system. For 10 
months, the device let the U.S. and a select elite within the U.N. 
inspection team monitor cell phones, walkie-talkies and other 
communications by military and intelligence officers who protect 
Saddam and conceal Iraq's weapons, according to the story. The 
Washington Post had a similar report. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said he believes the recent violations of the no-fly zones  
and the testing of U.S. and British aircraft is an indication of 
Saddam's desperation at being hit so hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he is shaken,'' said Zinni.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelton noted that in contrast to the Persian Gulf war, when the  
international media in Baghdad was allowed to view damage to 
civilians, very little such coverage has been allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (it is) to keep the media from seeing how much damage  
was done (to the military) and so no one would know how much pain 
or damage we inflicted on them,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Zinni said Saddam appears intent on shooting down a  
Western warplane to shore up his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni called the recent challenges to allied aircraft  
maintaining watch over Iraq ``a desperate attempt ... to claim some 
sort of victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest occurred Thursday, when an Iraqi missile battery  
targeted a U.S. warplane, which retaliated with a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fairly desperate attempts to regain some of that  
position (in Iraq and the region) that he held before, or thought 
he held before,'' said Zinni. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday with a group of international journalists,  
Zinni said he did not want to ``overstate'' the matter but said 
Washington is ``seeing things that indicate that maybe his grip on 
control and the ruthlessness by which he attempts to maintain 
control is slipping.''

<HEADLINE>  Gen.: Saddam Desperate for Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last month's U.S and British air attacks  
against Iraq may have killed between 600 to 1,600 members of Saddam 
Hussein's Republican Guard, as well as ``several key individuals'' 
in his leadership structure, America's top general said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost a lot,'' Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, said at a breakfast with defense writers. The 
four-star Army general was questioned about the latest estimates of 
damage done in the four-day operation which targeted the Iraqi 
leader's top military units and his ability to use weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing also destroyed unique pieces of equipment used to  
maintain, repair and improve Iraq's missile capability. That means 
Saddam's program has been put back two years, instead of just one, 
the commander of Operation Desert Fox, Gen. Anthony Zinni, said at 
a separate press conference at the Pentagon later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In targeting Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and the means  
to use them, the United States used intelligence gathered by U2 spy 
planes and by eavesdropping on Iraq's communications network, a 
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The information gathering was conducted as part of a ``pool''  
drawn by the U.N. monitoring commission from several nations, 
including the United States, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not unilateral,'' the official said. ``It was done  
under UNSCOM's direction. It was focused solely on where the stuff 
was concealed.'' UNSCOM is the U.N. special commission monitoring 
Iraqi weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, the general in charge of Desert Fox said he was  
not aware that any information gained through the U.N. inspectors 
had been used by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the bombing hit ``several key individuals that were  
in the upper structure, that were no longer available to him to 
advise or to lead.'' Asked if that meant they were killed, Shelton 
replied, ``Yes.'' He declined to name the individuals, cite their 
positions or what their importance might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	The general emphasized that his estimates of deaths were ``based  
on unconfirmed reporting from a variety of sources,'' and warned 
that they were very difficult to determine exactly. He said, 
however, that the latest information ``would now indicate that 
there were hundreds of intended casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military officials have said the Republican Guards and the  
Special Republican Guards were targeted in the four-day operation 
because they protect Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, such as 
biological or chemical weapons and the missiles or aircraft used to 
deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... give you a range from about 600 to 1,600 that could have  
been killed and probably several times that ... that were killed or 
injured,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton and Zinni said they considered the operation successful  
because of the ``one-of-a-kind'' type of military items destroyed 
and because civilian damage was very low. Also, no U.S. forces were 
killed in the operation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni, the Marine Corps general who heads the U.S. Central  
Command, said the ``structural damage was far more severe'' to 
Saddam's military units than first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-star general said his estimates of deaths ranged up to  
2,000 Iraqis, but he did not clarify the difference between his 
figures and Shelton's. In any case, he said, such numbers were not 
the measure of the success of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We struck and damaged significantly'' 85 percent of the  
targets, Zinni said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, to his knowledge, the U.S. military didn't  
specifically use intelligence gathered by U.N. weapons inspection 
efforts to select Iraqi targets. He also said he didn't receive any 
``real-time'' information about Iraqi movements from any listening 
devices that were reportedly planted in Iraq by U.S. intelligence 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that the  
United States sent a spy into Iraq in March in the guise of a U.N. 
inspector to install an electronic eavesdropping system. For 10 
months, the device let the U.S. and a select elite within the U.N. 
inspection team monitor cell phones, walkie-talkies and other 
communications by military and intelligence officers who protect 
Saddam and conceal Iraq's weapons, according to the story. The 
Washington Post had a similar report. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni said he believes the recent violations of the no-fly zones  
and the testing of U.S. and British aircraft is an indication of 
Saddam's desperation at being hit so hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he is shaken,'' said Zinni.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelton noted that in contrast to the Persian Gulf war, when the  
international media in Baghdad was allowed to view damage to 
civilians, very little such coverage has been allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think (it is) to keep the media from seeing how much damage  
was done (to the military) and so no one would know how much pain 
or damage we inflicted on them,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Zinni said Saddam appears intent on shooting down a  
Western warplane to shore up his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni called the recent challenges to allied aircraft  
maintaining watch over Iraq ``a desperate attempt ... to claim some 
sort of victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest occurred Thursday, when an Iraqi missile battery  
targeted a U.S. warplane, which retaliated with a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fairly desperate attempts to regain some of that  
position (in Iraq and the region) that he held before, or thought 
he held before,'' said Zinni. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday with a group of international journalists,  
Zinni said he did not want to ``overstate'' the matter but said 
Washington is ``seeing things that indicate that maybe his grip on 
control and the ruthlessness by which he attempts to maintain 
control is slipping.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Begin Life Under Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- When he was doing background checks during his  
coaching search, San Diego Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard 
was told by many that Mike Riley was the best-kept secret in 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the secret's out. Riley, who began a turnaround at  
perennial patsy Oregon State, became the Chargers' fourth coach in 
as many seasons on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Riley seemed mildly dazed with the quick chain of events  
that put him in his first NFL job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it's surprising for a lot of people,'' Riley said.  
``I appreciate their faith in me. This whole thing is kind of a 
surprise to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, 45, signed a guaranteed five-year contract with a salary  
of $750,000 a year, more than five times his base pay of $135,000 
at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	He inherits a team that hasn't had a winning record in three  
seasons, has no first-round draft picks until 2001 and whose 
quarterback, Ryan Leaf, was a bust on the field and a problem off 
it. Interim coach June Jones left for the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was 8-14 in two seasons at Oregon State, which one of his  
predecessors called ``a coach's graveyard.'' The same might be said 
of the Chargers, who were 5-11 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he took the job for the same reason he left his job  
as Southern Cal's offensive coordinator to take the Oregon State 
job in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great opportunity to improve and to work to get  
better, get more wins. That's what we're all after,'' said Riley, 
who grew up in Corvallis, Ore., home to Oregon State. ``I decided 
that this may be the greatest opportunity in my career, and one 
that I'd really like to try. So I took that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Alex Spanos said he's never been as impressed with a coach  
as he was when he first met Riley 10 days ago in Palm Springs, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley soon learned of Spanos' famous impatience when the owner  
said: ``Mike Riley, we're looking to you to take us back to the 
Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers' lone Super Bowl appearance was four years ago, and  
they've gone 26-39 since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly think this is a great fit for me, and I'm very  
appreciative of these guys believing that I can do it,'' Riley 
said. ``I'm anxious to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley followed his father, Bud, into coaching and has known San  
Diego general manager Bobby Beathard for years, even coaching his 
son, Jeff, in the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley had a two-day interview with the Chargers that included  
meeting with the assistant coaches, many of them remaining at 
Beathard's insistence. Among them are those who coached the NFL's 
top-ranked defense, plus Joe Bugel (offensive line) and Ollie 
Wilson (running backs). 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he'll probably hire four coaches from outside the  
organization, including an offensive coordinator-quarterbacks 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's workable,'' he said of inheriting so many assistants. ``I  
need NFL experience on this staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard has spoken with former Baltimore Ravens quarterbacks  
coach Don Strock about possibly filling the same role in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	After the disastrous 6-16 tenure of Kevin Gilbride, who was  
fired Oct. 13, Beathard wanted to hire someone he was familiar 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call anybody who's ever been associated with Mike  
Riley and find out quickly what type of person he is,'' Beathard 
said. ``As good a person as he is, he's equally as good a football 
coach. I've got a very, very strong gut feeling about Mike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley comes highly regarded as a smart coach and a good person.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's my man. I think he is a good coach, very creative,''  
said New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who played at 
Southern Cal when Riley was the Trojans' offensive coordinator. 
``He helped me become the No. 1 pick. He recognizes talent, I do 
know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers think Riley can develop Leaf, who was benched after  
nine games because of poor play and his off-field antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can work with any football player,'' Beathard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he's confident the Chargers can turn it around  
because of the number of close games they played and because the 
team played hard even though it was out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard great things about the character of this team and  
how hard they played, and that is a great starting point for any 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the  
pass-happy CFL from 1987-90, won two Grey Cups and was named the 
league's coach of the year each time. He was at USC from 1993-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State was 5-6 last fall, its best record since 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he also was contacted by the Baltimore Ravens and  
Chicago Bears.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Japan on Steel Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accused of failing to do enough to help  
endangered American steelworkers, President Clinton pointedly 
warned Japan on Friday to curb its steel shipments or face stiff 
trade penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, Clinton said he  
would not hesitate to bring ``forceful action'' unless Japan 
voluntarily curbs an import surge that has seen Japanese steel 
shipments rise by more than 400 percent in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bankrupting the American steel industry'' is not the answer to  
Japan's own economic problems, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he hoped his audience of business executives  
would not think he had gone ``stark, raving protectionist,'' but he 
pledged determination in enforcing American laws against unfair 
trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's warning was decidedly more forceful than the  
language used in a 20-page action plan his administration released 
late Thursday to deal with rising layoffs and plunging sales in the 
U.S. steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	That program, which pledged to seek $300 million in new tax  
relief for steel companies, was roundly panned by the industry, its 
unions and members of Congress from steel-producing states for 
offering too little help in a crisis that has already resulted in 
thousands of layoffs and pushed some companies to the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, head of the politically powerful United  
Steelworkers union, told reporters Friday his group would now take 
its fight to Congress, hoping lawmakers will enact the import 
quotas on foreign steel that the administration rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steel industry is bleeding to death,'' Becker said in a  
letter to Clinton. ``We do not need tax breaks for the steel 
industry nor a pat on the head. ... We need this administration to 
stand up for steel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Barnette, chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, said in an  
interview Friday that Clinton's initial plan was ``totally 
insufficient'' in dealing with Japan and that the tax relief ``will 
be of limited use to our company or steel companies generally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., accused the administration of  
``taking baby steps when leaps and bounds are needed to address 
what has quickly become a critical situation facing the domestic 
steel industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official said Clinton decided to toughen his  
warnings to Japan after hearing from members of Congress traveling 
with him to Detroit that the plan had not been strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``didn't think there should be any ambiguity on the  
issue so he decided to spell it out in the speech,'' said the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The action plan, ordered by Congress, had been delayed for two  
days because of an internal administration debate. 
</P>
<P>
	One group, led by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, had argued  
that increasing U.S. trade barriers would send the wrong message at 
a time when the administration is trying to find ways to help the 
40 percent of the world that has been plunged into recessions 
because of the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But another group, led by Commerce Secretary William Daley,  
argued that a Democratic administration had to find ways to be 
responsive to demands for help from union workers losing jobs 
because of a soaring trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	While the steel industry has brought cases against Japan, Brazil  
and Russia accusing those nations of ``dumping'' steel in the 
United States at unfairly low prices, supporters of tougher action 
argued that the administration should speed up the process by 
bringing its own, broader, injury cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade experts warned, however, that the administration could run  
the risk of igniting a trade war if it imposes trade sanctions on 
foreign steel shipments that cannot be defended under the rules of 
the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	If the WTO ruled the United States was arbitrarily imposing  
steel tariffs, other countries could win the right to slap 
retaliatory tariffs on exports of American products in other 
industries.

<HEADLINE> State Lawmakers Stay Away From D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	State lawmakers around the country are starting off the year  
full of promises -- to cut taxes, crack down on crime and, maybe 
most important of all, to act as little like Washington as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will shun the unyielding partisanship that has engulfed our  
nation's capital,'' Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci said Thursday 
in his inaugural speech. ``We will build coalitions, forge 
consensus and get results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate opened its first presidential impeachment trial in  
130 years on Thursday, governors and legislative leaders were 
pledging to one another and to their constituents to keep it civil. 
</P>
<P>
	The same note was sounded by his fellow Republican and New  
Englander, Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's work together. Let's resist the politics of personal  
destruction that has paralyzed our federal government,'' Rowland 
said Wednesday in his inaugural address. The crowd of 1,000 burst 
out into applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we resort to shrill partisanship, people rightfully will be  
saying, `You're no better than what we're seeing in Washington,''' 
Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe said Tuesday, the 
opening day of the new session. Moe is a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative leaders from every region, Republican and Democrat  
alike, sought to distance themselves from Washington as the Senate 
on Thursday opened its first presidential impeachment trial in 130 
years. Many saw the proceedings, which could stretch on for weeks 
or months, as the ultimate symbol of political paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all watched the spectacle in Washington, D.C., and I  
can't think of anybody who has been real impressed with the way 
that's been handled. We'll try to avoid the kind of gridlock that's 
occurred there,'' said Iowa Gov.-elect Tom Vilsack, the state's 
first Democratic governor in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who unexpectedly lost House seats in this fall's  
election and blamed their leaders' handling of the Clinton scandal, 
were particularly open about their disgust with the issue and their 
desire to separate themselves from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota state Sen. David Knutson said he recently sent out a  
letter to constituents asking for their opinion on the impeachment 
hearings. Some Republicans wrote back to say that they would never 
contribute to the party again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tainted by the perceived partisanship in Washington,''  
Knutson said. ``I think we're trying to distance ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knutson said he would handle things differently this year,  
introducing bills as part of a ``belief system'' instead of part of 
the GOP platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to get those party lines drawn in the sand,'' he  
said. ``People are tired of it.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Reaches Angola Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- A U.N. rescue team today reached the crash  
site of a U.N. plane carrying 14 people that went down two weeks 
ago over rebel-held territory in central Angola. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said he was expecting a report  
later in the day on whether any survivors of the Dec. 26 crash had 
been found. However, he could not say when information about the 
rescue operation would be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``People's lives are in danger,'' Toure said. ``We want to be  
very cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An SOS distress signal was picked up from the plane after it  
went down, and the United Nations said the plane's fuselage was 
mostly intact. 
</P>
<P>
	A second U.N. plane went down a week ago with nine people on  
board and led to the suspension of all U.N. flights in this vast 
southwest African nation where a civil war restarted Dec. 4 between 
the government and UNITA rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. military peacekeepers from the capital, Luanda, flew  
shortly after dawn to the central highland city of Huambo, 300 
miles southeast of Luanda. There, the 27 U.N. staff involved in the 
operation went with government army forces to the crash site, about 
25 miles outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The team would also search for the C-130 cargo aircraft's flight  
recorder, according to Toure. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rescue team would be sent to the site of the second  
plane crash once today's mission was completed, Toure said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations believes the planes came under fire as they  
flew over the war zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says UNITA is holding survivors of the first  
crash, but the rebels deny that claim. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. special envoy arrived last Monday to press the government  
and UNITA to allow a search-and-rescue team to be deployed and 
cooperate in an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from several countries, including the United  
States and Russia, both sides this week gave envoy Benon Sevan 
assurances they would cooperate in reaching the crash sites but 
offered no assurances of a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Thursday it had retaken control of the area  
where the first plane went down. 
</P>
<P>
	UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the  
Total Independence of Angola -- stymied implementation of the 1994 
pact by refusing to relinquish control of its highland strongholds 
and by keeping a 30,000-strong army hidden in the bush.

<HEADLINE> Troubles Persist for Caldor Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Caldor Corp., a discount retailer  
struggling to emerge from a bankruptcy reorganization, has stopped 
buying or receiving merchandise from its suppliers while it 
continues discussions with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwalk-based company, now with 145 stores in nine states  
and annual sales of $2.5 billion, filed for protection from 
creditors in September 1995 under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code while it tried to reorganize its finances. It had hoped to 
emerge from bankruptcy this coming spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendi Kopsick, a Caldor spokeswoman, would not comment on the  
current situation and whether it will force closing of any or all 
Caldor stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has suspended payment for merchandise shipment and  
has also suspended its receipt of merchandise for which it has not 
paid while it continues its discussions with its creditor 
contingencies,'' Kopsick said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Barnard of Barnard Consulting Group in Upper Montclair ,  
N.J., said the stores are poorly run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Caldor has been a loser for at least three years,'' he said.  
``There is absolutely no chance that they could recover as a 
stand-alone small, discount operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, Caldor announced it would close 12  
unprofitable stores, including all of its stores in the Washington, 
D.C., area. At that time, officials said Caldor wanted to 
concentrate on its main markets in New England and the Middle 
Atlantic states.

<HEADLINE> Relatives Question L.A. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Relatives of a 19-year-old woman  
questioned the release of coroner's findings that she was legally 
drunk and had traces of marijuana in her system when she was shot 
12 times by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyisha Miller had a blood-alcohol level of 0.13 percent, Mark  
Wasserman of the Riverside County sheriff-coroner's office said 
Thursday. The legal limit for driving in California is 0.08 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary toxicology tests also found cannabinoids, a  
byproduct of marijuana, in the black teen-ager's system. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members have claimed Ms. Miller was unconscious when she  
was shot early Dec. 28 as she sat in a disabled car. Four officers 
-- three white and one Hispanic -- and a white sergeant who were at 
the scene have been placed on paid leave. The FBI is conducting an 
inquiry into whether Ms. Miller's civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnell Butler, a cousin of Ms. Miller's, wondered why police  
released the toxicology report so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were quick to release the report on the toxicology of  
Tyisha. What about the toxicology on the police men?'' he said. 
``What about the 911 report? Why don't you release the tapes? Where 
is it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller, who was armed with a handgun, was shot after police  
responded to a call that she was locked in a car at a gas station, 
unresponsive to relatives who banged on the window. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators first said Ms. Miller fired at officers, but later  
said they didn't know who fired first.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) -- The number of unemployed Germans  
exceeded 4 million in December for the first time in four months, 
due to a cutback in government jobs and a cold snap that slowed 
construction, the Labor Office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate rose to 10.9 percent, an increase of a  
quarter-million people, surpassing even the 10.8 percent regional 
rate for the 11 countries that last week launched the new European 
currency, the euro. Otmar Issing, a member of the European Central 
Bank's executive board, on Friday called the euro bloc's rate 
``unbearably high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German unemployment jumped last month to 4.2 million people, up  
0.7 percent from November's level. Still, the figure was below that 
of the previous year, when the jobless rate was 11.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the comparison with 1997, Ottmar Schreiner, a spokesman  
for the governing Social Democrats, said the December figure was 
``gratifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposition Free Democrats called it an economic warning  
signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted for a winter slowdown in the construction industry,  
unemployment showed a more gradual increase of 34,000 people from 
the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the adjusted statistics showed that a relatively bigger  
share of the increase came in already hard-hit eastern Germany, 
where 26,000 people lost their jobs last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate in eastern Germany stood at 17.4 percent,  
while in western Germany it was 9.3 percent. The formerly communist 
East is still adjusting to a market economy after unifying with the 
former West Germany in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Office chief Bernhard Jagoda said a sharp curtailment in  
government jobs programs in eastern Germany accounted for about 
half the jobs lost there. Germany's former conservative government 
started the jobs programs in the days leading up to national 
elections in September.

<HEADLINE> CBS News Fights Military Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Newsman Mike Wallace says he is astonished  
by a U.S. military subpoena for his unaired interviews with two 
Marine aviators about the cable-car tragedy in the Italian Alps 
last year that killed 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is fighting the Marine prosecutor's subpoena seeking tapes  
of interviews Wallace conducted for a ``60 Minutes'' report being 
prepared about the case, in which a Marine jet sliced through a 
cable and sent a ski gondola plunging to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do they need us to help them make their case?'' Wallace  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams asked a military  
court in North Carolina to quash the subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P.  
Schweitzer, the navigator, are scheduled to stand trial next month 
on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide and could spend 
the rest of their lives in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently Wallace interviewed Ashby and Capt. Chandler P.  
Seagraves, one of the jet's two back-seat officers. Charges against 
Seagraves have been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams characterized the subpoena as highly unusual, since the  
story has not been broadcast or even completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is a particularly egregious violation to require  
`60 Minutes' to produce to the government interviews when those 
interviews may well be critical of the government itself,'' Abrams 
said. ``The notion of making CBS the conduit to the government for 
those interviews is inconsistent with First Amendment principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a decision for the Marine Corps to make,''  
responded Marines spokeswoman Lt. Col. Katie Haddock. ``The final 
decision on whether or not the materials will be released rests 
with the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he can't understand why the subpoena was served.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at a loss,'' he said. ``To be asked for this kind of  
material before the piece has been broadcast! And they have no idea 
what we intend to use. They want all of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said ``60 Minutes'' is continuing to work on the story  
and plans to put it on the air the Sunday before the trial begins.

<HEADLINE> New Phone Finds Cheap Calling Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A new high-tech telephone unveiled Friday goes  
price shopping every time it's dialed, seeking the cheapest 
long-distance rate from hundreds of plans before it places the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Distance Manager, made by a big cordless phone company  
Uniden America Corp., is expected to reach store shelves in the 
spring at a price of about $49. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the phone, introduced at the Consumer Electronics  
Show, could allow consumers to ignore the complicated advertising 
pitches now crowding the TV airways. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the growing number of long distance services and  
providers, this could be a very interesting product,'' said Kevin 
Hause with International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attendees at the show agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're always telling you to dial 10-10-whatever it is,''  
said D.K. Thompson, of Garden Grove, Calif. ``How are you going to 
remember that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Uniden's competitors, contending callers prefer to stick  
with a particular long distance plan or phone, said they weren't 
worried about the product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Distance Manager claims to deliver speed as well as  
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer won't be able to tell the phone is searching for  
the lowest long distance rate because it works within 50 
milliseconds,'' said John Harris, Uniden's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniden's goal is an average price of between 7 and 8 cents per  
minute, with no additional fees. At that price, calls made with the 
Long Distance Manager would be cheaper than those in many calling 
plans. However, it might not be able to match some plans that offer 
a cheaper rate depending on how long the call lasts. 
</P>
<P>
	A caller using the phone pushes the ``long distance'' button and  
dials the number. The phone dials a federal database containing 
hundreds of long distance plans, searches for the best rate and 
routes the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Each month, a consumer will receive a bill detailing each call,  
like a typical bill from a long distance carrier. The difference 
will be that this bill may include calls through dozens of 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	While many long distance companies advertise cheap rates of 10  
cents a minute or less, two-thirds of American households still do 
not belong to any of these plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, like David Gonzalez of Brea, Calif., they are  
automatically routed through AT&AMP;T and are charged an average of 28 
cents per minute, adding up to about $500 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I want a service, I really don't feel like shopping  
around. I just want someone to hook me up,'' said Gonzalez, who 
checked out the Long Distance Manager at the electronics trade show 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniden said it expects to sell a million of the phones in the  
first 12 months they're on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Ramage, a product marketing manager for VTech  
Communications, of Beaverton, Ore., another big seller of cordless 
phones, said Uniden has exaggerated expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Long Distance Manager is an add-on feature that some  
people might enjoy, but it's somewhat gimmicky,'' he said. ``Most 
people have a secure relationship with their long distance company 
and aren't looking to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Brannan, marketing vice president for Northwestern Bell  
Phones, added that his own company has the competitive advantage in 
the industry, even without Long Distance Manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our symbol is one of the top five most recognizable symbols in  
the country,'' he said. ``Everyone knows us, and in an industry 
this competitive, that's what matters.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Woman Rescued From Car Trunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A woman allegedly thrown into the trunk  
of her car by her ex-boyfriend was freed five hours and 173 miles 
later after motorists spotted her finger wiggling through a broken 
taillight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies stopped the car on Interstate 40 on Thursday  
and heard the screams of Amy Maxwell, 19, of Huntsville, Ala. She 
had gone through the ordeal wearing only a T-shirt and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knew where I was and if I didn't help myself, no one  
else was going to help me,'' Ms. Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies arrested the driver, David Michael Tate, 21, who has  
been fighting with Ms. Maxwell over custody of their 2-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Scott Nowinksi said federal kidnapping charges  
would be filed against Tate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maxwell told deputies that she eventually freed her hands,  
broke out a taillight and began pushing papers, sticks and a finger 
through the hole. Dale and Teri Schroeder of Wauseon, Ohio, saw her 
finger and called police.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Far From Impeachment Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was braving the Midwest snow  
emergency to tout his accomplishments directly to the public while 
senators at his impeachment trial worked to determine his future. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lunchtime speech planned for the Detroit Economic Club  
today, the president was heralding a new report by his Council of 
Economic Advisers proclaiming the past 93 months ``the longest 
peacetime expansion in history,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the economic expansion following the 1982 recession  
lasted 92 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic 
Research, which determines changes in the business cycle using a 
combination of measures of gross domestic product, income, 
employment and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech, meant to sketch themes he will  
underscore in his upcoming State of the Union address and new 
budget, was planned before anyone knew it would fall on the day 
after the Senate opened trial proceedings on the impeachment 
charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidental or not, the benefits of escaping Washington's  
turmoil were not lost on White House aides eager to show that 
Clinton was above the fray and focused on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foot of snow that caused Detroit's snow emergency  
and left many of the city's streets unplowed, Clinton planned to 
linger there even as another 2 inches to 4 inches of snow was 
forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	He was to check out the annual auto show, tape his weekly radio  
address from the autoworkers' union hall and participate in other 
private events there. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Clinton expanded from one to two days his trip  
to New York next Thursday for a conference of Wall Street 
executives trying to increase minority participation in the stock 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's always looking for opportunities to travel  
around the country to see the American people,'' Toiv said 
Thursday. ``And the auto show is a symbol of our economic future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opens to the public Saturday, is expected to  
draw 800,000 visitors to see the retro new editions of the 
Volkswagen Beetle, Ford T-Bird and Chevrolet Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, a repressed hot-rodder since he has been confined to  
presidential limousines, owns a 1967 Mustang convertible that he 
and his brother, Roger, helped restore. 
</P>
<P>
	In an education speech on Thursday, the president sounded  
nostalgic for those heady, I-can-do-anything days of his youth. He 
saluted Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., who preceded the president 
with a fiery call for help in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at Congressman Ford thinking, you know, I was 28  
once. And when I ran for Congress at that age, I got beat. I see 
why he got elected,'' Clinton said. ``There's a 28-year-old young 
guy with his whole life before him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of today's CEA report have become familiar fodder for  
Clinton speeches in recent months: 
</P>
<P>
	--Average family income rose $3,500 from March 1991 to December  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--New jobs totaled 18.6 million in the same period, with 17.5  
million of them created since January 1993 when Clinton took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the State of the Union coming up, it's a good time for  
the president to reiterate economic themes that have been part of 
every State of the Union address because he's had a consistent 
policy,'' Toiv said.

<HEADLINE> Familiar Name Leads Mercedes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- New season, same old story.  
</P>
<P>
	Nobody had more than the four victories David Duval rung up last  
year on the PGA Tour. Nobody has come close to his seven victories 
over the past 14 months. And if Duval continues his assault on the 
Kapalua Plantation course, nobody stands a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarded by his peers as the best player in golf, Duval showed  
why Friday in the second round of the Mercedes Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval tied the course record with a 10-under-par 63 on another  
day of dry, relatively calm conditions, giving him a five-stroke 
lead through two rounds of the season-opening, winners-only 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know if I go out there and play well that I can win,'' Duval  
said. ``It doesn't mean I'm going to every week, but I know I can 
do it. I don't have to think about it and wonder whether I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field must be wondering if Duval will ever slow  
down from a pace reminiscent of Johnny Miller in the 1970s and Tom 
Watson in the early 1980s. Another victory this week would be his 
eighth in his last 27 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Duval has played the first two rounds over a benign  
Plantation course, about the only thing that seems possible of 
stopping him is the Trade winds that howl off the coast of Maui but 
have been strangely absent all week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That might be the only thing we can hope for, the way David is  
playing,'' said Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was at 16-under 130, five strokes ahead of PGA champion  
Vijay Singh and two of the co-leaders from the first round, Fred 
Funk and Billy Mayfair. The other two, Joe Durant and Steve Pate, 
were at 136. 
</P>
<P>
	Love and Couples were in the group at 137, while Tiger Woods and  
Mark O'Meara were another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to need something different than we've played in  
all week,'' Woods said. ``If we get a little wind, it might be 
different. If you look at most of the tournaments David has won, 
he's led after three rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-under 63 tied the course record set by Pate in the  
unofficial Kapalua International in November 1997. It also tied the 
tournament record set by Lee Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say a key was anything,'' said Duval, who set a record  
last year with nearly $2.6 million in earnings. ``You don't just 
putt well and shoot 10-under. You have to do everything well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he did -- a drive that caught the slope on No. 6 and stopped  
rolling 380 yards from the tee, setting up an easy birdie on the 
398-yard hole; a 5-iron into 2 feet on the 203-yard eighth hole and 
solid putting throughout the round. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-under matched Duval's best round on tour -- he shot a 62  
in the third round at Pebble Beach in 1997, when he wound up one 
stroke behind O'Meara; and he shot a 62 in the second round of the 
Tucson Classic last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both times I did it with a 28-34,'' Duval said.  
``Consistently, this was probably the best one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That can't be a good sign to everyone else.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Duval won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring  
average. The way his first two rounds have gone, this year might be 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like I continued from last year,'' Duval said. ``I didn't  
really take a break. I put time in the gym and I put time in the 
golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for rain, which caused play to begin two hours  
early on Friday, never materialized. Duval started the second round 
one stroke out of the lead, and it didn't take him long to move up 
the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the turn in 4-under 32, then made birdies on six of the  
nine holes on the back side of the Plantation course with only two 
birdie putts longer than 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it close and made some putts,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval is only 27, but wise enough to know that 36 holes doesn't  
win a tournament, especially on a Kapalua course renowned for its 
fierce winds. Those Trade winds were in the forecast today, which 
should prevent another round of low scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Michael Bradley (78) and Jesper Parnevike (74) failed to  
break par among the 30 players in the field, and only Bradley and 
Steve Elkington were over par through two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no wind. That's a lot of difference,'' Singh said.  
``They say it's coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It could be the only thing that can stop Duval.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Suspected Nev. Sniper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) --Investigators and psychologists remain baffled  
by a 20-year-old film buff who claims that his shooting rampage on 
an interstate was the first step in a planned cross-country killing 
spree intended to mock American violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can honestly say I don't have a clue on this man,'' Dr. Ole  
Thienhaus, chairman of the psychology department at the University 
of Nevada, Reno, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Lee Merritt, of Mankato, Minn., was scheduled to be  
arraigned in Washoe Justice Court in Reno today on eight counts, 
including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrested Monday in Las Vegas, Merritt has confessed to being the  
sniper who opened fire on Interstate 80 earlier that day near Reno. 
One man was wounded in the chest and several vehicles were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway was closed for hours and school children were  
ordered indoors while more than 100 law officers searched the 
Sierra Nevada foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the arrest, a county prosecutor has touched off a battle  
with local media by serving search warrants on three television 
stations and a newspaper for interviews they had with the suspect -- 
who says he planned the murder spree ``for the thrill of killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt originally told police he planned to shoot motorists so  
they would crash and he could rob them. 
</P>
<P>
	But in interviews beginning Tuesday night, he has said he  
planned to shoot more than 10 people throughout the country -- a 
spree he thought would make some kind of ``satirical'' statement 
about America's appetite for violence in books and films. 
</P>
<P>
	``He changed his story about this crime -- from a very stupid  
scheme to a mass murder spree,'' said Thienhaus, who has examined 
Merritt but is prohibited from discussing any details. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt told The Associated Press in an interview at the jail on  
Wednesday that he planned the shootings ``for my own enjoyment ... 
my own amusement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to violent books and movies, including ``Natural  
Born Killers'' and ``Pulp Fiction.'' But, he said, he didn't want 
anyone to blame a particular work for his behavior, because ``I had 
a pre-existing interest in this subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American public seems to set dual standards about what is  
acceptable, condemning real-life killers while glamorizing murders 
in films, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody seems to have a problem about two hit men killing  
people, possibly because it is fictionalized,'' he said. ``There's 
not a whole lot of difference between contemplating an act and 
actually going through with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By planning his own shooting spree, Merritt said, he was ``more  
or less making fun of America, I guess. Making fun of what 
everybody finds interest in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, in a way, I was mocking it, saying well, `If you find  
interest in a murder happening in a somewhat stereotypical lawless 
town, what will you do if it actually happens?' Just kind of sit 
back in the corner and watch everything as it unfolded,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Quiet at Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associate Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imagine a newly minted senator, of which there  
are eight. He or she reports for the first full day at work, and is 
prevented -- barred ``on pain of imprisonment'' -- from saying a word 
except two: ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a chamber where oratory is the currency, the stuff of  
life, but on this occasion it rings with the words ``Hear ye! Hear 
ye!'' and the message: No oratory permitted this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in front is the chief justice of the United States,  
resplendent in a robe of his own design, four stripes of gold braid 
up each arm. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the attendance is good: All 100 senators -- the eight  
newcomers and the 92 veterans -- seated at their polished 
schoolhouse seats. 
</P>
<P>
	So it went Thursday on the first day of the impeachment trial:  
the U.S. House of Representatives vs. William Jefferson Clinton, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	This was historic. None of the senators -- not even Strom  
Thurmond, 96, who was first elected to the Senate 45 years ago, 
when Dwight Eisenhower was in office -- had ever taken part in an 
attempt to oust a president. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other attempt occurred in 1868, against Andrew Johnson,  
the Democratic successor to the martyred Republican, Abraham 
Lincoln. Johnson, a Tennessean, was soft on the post-Civil War 
South when the Senate had an appetite for vengeance. He survived by 
a single vote. Most historians now consider his impeachment a 
mistake, born of zealotry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate majority leader, Republican Trent Lott of Mississippi  
-- still uncertain where this proceeding was headed or whether it 
would last a few days, a few weeks or months -- was the only senator 
permitted to speak, and then only on procedural matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He flubbed once, addressing Chief Justice William Rehnquist as  
``Mr. Presiding Officer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Presiding Officer did not flinch, and Lott got it right the  
next time. He called Rehnquist ``Mr. Chief Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Supreme Court, across the street, Rehnquist is a stickler  
for orderly procedure. He abides no television cameras in his 
courthouse. A lawyer who argues before him beyond the allotted time 
is likely to be cut off in mid-bon mot. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate kept him waiting for 18 minutes and when he  
walked in, escorted by six senators, there were those pesky TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sergeant-at-arms, James Ziglar, who got all the good  
lines. Not only did he get to say, ``Hear ye!'' three times in the 
morning, and three more times in the afternoon, he got to admonish 
the senators -- his bosses -- against talking ``on pain of 
imprisonment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond administered the oath to Rehnquist, asking him to swear  
he would ``do impartial justice'' in ``all things appertaining to 
the trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do,'' said Rehnquist, and then he administered the same oath  
to the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, they rose when their names were called, raised an  
arm and said, ``I do.'' Those were the only words they could speak 
in the Senate, all day. 
</P>
<P>
	After saying them, they lined up and went to a table in front  
and signed the ``oath book,'' sure to be a historic artifact, maybe 
to be displayed under glass to schoolchildren who will come to 
study it as part of their studies of the impeachment of William J. 
Clinton, however it comes out. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators got to keep the pens they signed with. Most stuffed  
them in a pocket, another artifact of history, the political 
equivalent to a Mark McGwire home run ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist got in his Cadillac limousine to cross the street and  
the Senate's leaders met privately to consider how to end this 
proceeding, so that they can start orating again.

<HEADLINE> A Small-Stock Comeback in 1999? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you're the sort of investor who insists on  
getting a bargain when you buy mutual fund shares, small-cap and 
mid-cap stock funds are bound to catch your eye right now. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when most types of stock investments carry high price  
tags, the small- to mid-cap sector of the stock market stands out 
as a notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless they put their money on Internet stocks, funds that  
specialize in stocks of newer and smaller companies made little 
progress in 1998, while the bull market for blue chips continued at 
full force. Big stocks have been hogging the spotlight throughout 
the latter half of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no predicting when this trend might reverse -- and no  
guarantee, for that matter, that it ever will. But measured on the 
basis of relative value, small and medium-sized stocks look 
unusually attractive to many people who follow them regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm highly bullish on the investment prospects for small- and  
mid-cap growth stocks,'' says Keith Mullins, an analyst who 
specializes in emerging growth companies at the investment firm of 
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. ``My optimistic outlook reflects three 
fundamental factors which, collectively, should allow the group to 
substantially outperform the broader market averages throughout 
1999 and into the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins argues, in sum, that prices of small stocks are  
unusually cheap, that their earnings prospects are brighter than 
those for larger companies, and that many investment managers are 
under-committed to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, managers of quite a few small-cap funds share  
Mullins' views. ``We believe our small-cap portfolios are chock 
full of bargains -- solid businesses selling at low prices to 
earnings,'' say Bill Nasgovitz and Eric Miller at the fund firm of 
Heartland Advisors in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Michael Mufson, manager of Putnam Investments' OTC &AMP;  
Emerging Growth Fund in Boston, ``Strong fundamentals and 
attractive valuations among aggressive-growth small-cap stocks 
point toward improving performance in coming months. Investor 
sentiment, dampened by recent market volatility, is currently the 
only thing blocking these stocks from rising strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Valuations in the sector are the lowest they have been in a  
decade, down to a 1:1 ratio to the Standard &AMP; Poor's index from a 
typical ratio of 1.5:1. These levels indicate a strong buying 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, any investor who keeps a close watch on the markets  
has heard all these arguments before. ``The current trends have 
been in place for two years,'' acknowledges Mullins. ``They are 
only more dramatic today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, the underperformance by small- and mid-cap growth  
stocks over the past two years has left many investors 
disillusioned. Despite discounted valuations and strong earnings, 
emerging growth portfolios failed to match the returns realized by 
the popular large-cap indexes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big problem for small stocks, many of their partisans  
believe, has been investors' increasing emphasis on top quality and 
maximum liquidity in the stocks they own, as the markets face 
repeated headlines about worldwide currency and debt problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And as long as blue-chip stocks keep performing so well, why  
bother even thinking about the lesser names? 
</P>
<P>
	But small-cap partisans say this psychology cannot prevail  
forever. Sooner or later, they say, the markets will have to go 
back to recognizing smaller companies' special ability to deliver 
earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mufson's words, ``Investor sentiment has leaned toward  
large-cap index funds as a 'flight to quality' strategy. But strong 
fundamentals and attractive valuations may make the argument for a 
shift as concerns about the global economy dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trigger for this shift in investor sentiments is twofold:  
Lower interest rates increase investor confidence, encouraging more 
aggressive positions, and decreased market volatility may lead 
investors away from large caps and make them willing to invest more 
aggressively again.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Seals Trial Deal in Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Venerable, silver-haired Sen. Robert C. Byrd  
stood before Democrats and Republicans, urging them to take stock 
of their place in history and reminding them that great statesmen 
of the past did not cling stubbornly to partisan positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set the tenor for what we have achieved,'' said Sen. Phil  
Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than two hours, two senators of widely disparate  
philosophy -- conservative Gramm and Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts -- suggested a way to resolve the knotty problem of 
how to run the impeachment trial of President Clinton. Cries of 
``hear, hear!'' greeted the compromise plan fashioned in secret in 
the Old Senate Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an extraordinary event that we just took part in,''  
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorn of microphones, sitting on folding chairs and with no  
television cameras watching, the 100 senators and a few senior 
staffers met Friday morning in a last-ditch effort to avoid highly 
partisan votes on competing trial plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not having the modern conveniences reminded us of where we  
were,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The intimate room, rarely used by the Senate since 1859, is  
where American giants like Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John C. 
Calhoun conducted titanic debates over slavery and states' rights 
in an attempt to avert the Civil War. A large portrait of George 
Washington gazes down from the wall; a gilt eagle and a shield 
adorn the Senate president's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a palpable sense in that room of the magnitude of  
these events and their importance to the nation,'' said Sen. Kent 
Conrad, D-N.D. ``You had the feeling there of the weight of 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a prayer focused on ``love of country, love of the  
institution'' by Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii that 
moistened a few eyes, Byrd spent about 20 minutes reminding 
senators of the dignity of their jobs, discussed the meaning of the 
Federalist papers that serve as a bedrock of American democracy and 
recounted events of the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew 
Johnson, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd told colleagues the White House had ``sullied itself'' and  
that the House had fallen into ``the black pit of partisan 
self-indulgence,'' according to a transcript issued later by Byrd's 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask everyone here who might harbor such feelings to abandon  
any thought of mean-spirited, destructive, vengeful, partisan 
warfare,'' Byrd said. ``I implore us all to lift our eyes to higher 
things. We can perform some much-needed healing on the body 
politic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Byrd laid a foundation ... to approach this issue with  
an open and temperate mind,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's speech was followed by descriptions of the competing  
plans. Participants said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., told a 
famous parable to illustrate the damage partisan politics can do. 
</P>
<P>
	In the story, a scorpion asks a frog for a ride across a river.  
The frog refuses. ``You'll just sting me,'' the frog says. ``No, I 
won't,'' the scorpion responds. 
</P>
<P>
	So the frog agrees. But halfway across, the scorpion does sting  
the frog, and they both begin to sink. ``Why did you sting me?'' 
the frog cries. ``It's in my nature,'' says the scorpion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point was, it's in our nature to be partisan, but we have  
to rise above that,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., conveyed a similar message by  
telling colleagues they could take one of two paths: the high road 
marked by great pre-Civil War compromises or the low road 
illustrated by the vicious 1856 caning of Sen. Charles Sumner of 
Massachusetts by South Carolina Rep. Preston Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Gramm stood and noted that the biggest sticking point  
between the two sides -- the question of calling witnesses -- was 
already addressed by Senate rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``His point was that if someone wanted to insist on a witness,  
they could, and we'd have to vote,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy quickly seconded Gramm's idea, saying ``We can get to  
second base together,'' a participant said. Suddenly, as Dodd put 
it, ``The spirits of compromise were in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested the deal be  
labeled the Gramm-Kennedy plan and sought to quell any further 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Let's not talk ourselves out of something,''' said  
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Cries of ``hear, hear'' and ``seal the deal'' quickly ensued,  
``even some old-fashioned thumping of desks,'' Warner said. ``That 
was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators said they learned some valuable lessons in this  
rare secret session. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're speaking to each other and not to the television  
cameras, there's less of a hard edge,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, 
R-Utah.

<HEADLINE> Devils Left Wing Has Ankle Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Devils left wing Dave  
Andreychuk underwent surgery Friday to have pins inserted into a 
broken right ankle after X-rays showed the injury was more serious 
than the team thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk broke his ankle in the first period of Tuesday's game  
against the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was initially not thought to be as severe as the  
displaced fracture of his left ankle Andreychuk sustained in April 
1997 on the final day of the regular season. But X-rays showed this 
injury was also a displaced fracture, and the ankle needed to be 
stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk had 11 goals and 11 assists in 29 games this season.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Capital Thrown Into Tizzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leon Locke, his jacket open over light medical  
scrubs, watched with amazement Friday as downtown traffic crawled 
past -- slowed by a couple of inches of snow and slush. 
</P>
<P>
	As Friday's storm demonstrated, it doesn't take much snow to  
throw the nation's capital into a weather frazzle. Some offices and 
most suburban schools closed. Meetings were canceled. Otherwise 
sensible suburbanites lined up at grocery stores for milk, bread 
and other staples. 
</P>
<P>
	It's worse in bigger storms. Four inches or more can cause  
absolute gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	To Locke, and probably to much of the rest of the country,  
Washington's helplessness in the face of a little winter weather is 
unfathomable. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not bad at all, but they don't know how to drive in  
it,'' said Locke, a radiation therapist who originally hails from 
snowy western Pennsylvania ``They don't have winter tires. They 
don't even know what winter tires are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, neither northern nor southern, typically gets a  
handful of snowstorms each winter. Most of the time, a few inches 
accumulate, then disappear within a few days. Two or three inches 
fell in the capital Friday, before turning to freezing rain at 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
	The city does not deal well with even that moderate winter  
weather. There are relatively few snowplows, and the trucks that 
pour sand and salt on the roads can take hours or days to reach 
smaller streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow canceled a meeting Friday between U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky and the Japanese trade minister, who was unable 
to fly into Washington from New York. Federal government offices 
remained open, as did city schools. But nearly every suburban 
school system shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Water mains froze and broke Friday and earlier in the week, when  
temperatures were in the 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people outside the (Capital) Beltway understand  
how awful the commute here can be, even on the best day,'' said 
Bruce Milhans, spokesman for the federal Office of Personnel 
Management. ``Snow absolutely affects people's commutes and their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Milhans, whose agency decides whether the approximately  
270,000 federal workers in the Washington area get a snow day, also 
chuckles at the local fascination with weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A child of Rapid City, S.D., who came to Washington via a stint  
in Alaska, Milhans said he was amazed by the intense news coverage 
that a fairly ordinary storm can generate. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow got equal billing with the unfolding impeachment trial in  
some Washington media Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this kind of prophesying of doom when you hear that  
it's going to snow an inch. We understand very well what the 
concern is ... but an inch of snow in January is not really 
something to get worked up about.''

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Loses on Wireless Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today rejected efforts  
by BellSouth Corp. to overturn a limit on licensed airwaves space a 
company can use for cellular, paging and other wireless services. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld  
the Federal Communications Commission's 1997 decision not to give 
BellSouth a waiver of the spectrum cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the waiver, BellSouth couldn't bid for potentially  
lucrative licenses for a new mobile phone service, called personal 
communications, at a government auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC adopted the cap to promote competition in the market for  
mobile services, including voice and data. 
</P>
<P>
	The court concluded that the FCC fairly considered BellSouth's  
request, adding that BellSouth never explained to the commission 
why a waiver of the cap would serve the public.

<HEADLINE> Jennifer Capriati on Comeback Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At 22, Jennifer Capriati takes a  
philosophic view of the troubles that brought her down and 
tarnished one of tennis world's brightest young stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she's on her comeback tour and and a key stop is at next  
week's Sydney International tournament, where Capriati -- once 
ranked No. 6 in the world -- must play in qualification rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe what doesn't kill you, makes you a stronger  
person,'' she said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati seemed destined for greatness when she joined the  
women's tour in 1990 at 13. She became the youngest Grand Slam 
semifinalist and beat five top-10 players in her first year. At the 
1992 Olympics in Barcelona, she beat Steffi Graf to capture the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all fell apart: Capriati was arrested on drug charges in  
1994 and went into rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she is ranked 100 and believes she can get her game back on  
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone through a lot with my experiences, but everyone has  
troubles. In my life I may have had a little more than others. I'm 
a deeper person for sure. There's a lot more to me now,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Reconciliation Process Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It is time for the NBA to undo some of the  
damage, and the league wasted no time getting started. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the first moves toward appeasing fans, commissioner David  
Stern announced that there will be free exhibition games this 
season and $10 seats at all games next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be more than just a slogan,'' Atlanta Hawks  
president Stan Kasten said. ``Hopefully by next season we can get 
the fans back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day after the lockout was settled, Thursday was a day for  
the owners to have the deal explained to them, for the players to 
begin preparing for the season and for the league as a whole to 
reach out to the apathetic masses. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Board of Governors approved the settlement 29-0, and  
Stern said the league hopes to start the season Feb. 5, with each 
team playing 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some winning back of fans to do, and we're going to do  
it,'' Stern said at a news conference where he was joined by union 
director Billy Hunter and deputy commissioner Russ Granik. ``Most 
important to us is that basketball games will be upon us again, and 
as a basketball fan and particularly a fan of the NBA, I am 
elated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will play two exhibition games -- one home and one away  
-- and admission will be free. Preseason scrimmages also will be 
open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin, who took an active part in  
the negotiations as the league's senior owner, said tougher drug 
policy and player conduct clauses in the new deal were ``at least 
as important'' to him as the more publicized issue of how to split 
billions among players and owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find that the players have changed,'' said the  
75-year-old owner, who bought the then-Baltimore Bullets in 1964. 
``I think players will realize that fans are the ones who pay their 
salaries and therefore are the people we have to look to. I told 
them, you may or may not want to be role models, but you are role 
models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-month lockout ended early Wednesday following an  
all-night bargaining session between Stern and Hunter. An agreement 
was reached just one day before the Board of Governors would have 
voted whether to cancel what was left of the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, meantime, lifted its gag order on coaches, general  
managers and owners, all of whom were eager to get back to the 
business of playing ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the beginning stages of being able to start to do  
the work that all of us enjoy,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. 
``Obviously, we're happy about the lockout being over. Happy is an 
understatement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players can start using team facilities beginning Monday,  
although coaches will be prohibited from working with them until 
the lockout is officially over. And that won't happen until the 
agreement is put into writing and signed by both sides -- a process 
that should take a week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked they think they can get it done in 10 days,'' said  
Kasten, noting that lawyers have a tendency to bring the process to 
a halt once they start fighting over contract language. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, however, even the opposing attorneys mingled and  
joked with each other, joining in on the collective sense of relief 
at having a settlement at last. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter talked about repairing the partnership between the  
opposing sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad this is over,'' he said. ``Our players are anxious  
to play, and we're anxious to join hands with David, Russ and the 
owners of the 29 teams to really create a strong and familial 
relationship -- one that will take the NBA to another level and to 
bring back the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only regret I have is that is took us so long to get where  
we are,'' Hunter said. ``We're glad to be back, and we'll do 
whatever we have to do in order to demonstrate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik opened Thursday's Board of Governors meeting by  
addressing representatives from each of the 29 teams, and league 
attorney Joel Litvin explained the details of the new pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous vote by the Board of Governors was taken by a show  
of hands, rather than secret ballot, and Hunter then was brought 
into the room and as given a chance to speak to the owners -- just 
as Stern was permitted to speak to the players a day earlier when 
they ratified the deal 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``No applause was asked for or offered,'' New Jersey Nets  
president Michael Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Granik said the agreement should be in written form by Jan. 18,  
after which training camps will open and teams will be permitted to 
sign free agents and make trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season will last through the end of April, and the  
playoff format will remain unchanged. The NBA Finals should 
conclude by June 29 or 30.

<HEADLINE> Mentor Drops Bid for Quickturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mentor Graphics Corp. ended its bitter  
five-month takeover battle for Quickturn Design Systems Inc. today, 
clearing the way for Quickturn to be sold to its white-knight 
bidder Cadence Design Systems Inc. for $271.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor Graphics withdrew its $15 a share offer for Quickturn and  
canceled the special shareholders' meeting scheduled today after it 
became clear Mentor didn't have enough support to oust Quickturn's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor Graphics and Cadence both make computer software to  
design chips for the electronic and semiconductor industries. The 
two companies wanted to buy Quickturn because it makes the software 
that lets companies test the chip designs before putting them into 
finished products. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor Graphics competes in Quickturn's business overseas, but  
has been prevented from going head-to-head with Quickturn in the 
United States because of a patent dispute, which is currently being 
resolved through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor Graphics, which first offered $12.12 1/2 a share for  
Quickturn in August, and later tried increasing its price three 
times and filed two lawsuits against Quickturn, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, San Jose, Calif.-based Quickturn said it had agreed  
to be acquired by Cadence for $14 a share. Mentor and Cadence 
entered a brief bidding war, but Cadence, which is based San Diego, 
Calif., always had the support of Quickturn management. 
</P>
<P>
	Quickturn's stock fell 56 1/4 cents to $14.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where Mentor Graphics' shares rose 37 1/2 cents to $10.37 1/2. On 
the New York Stock Exchange, Cadence's shares rose 31 1/4 cents to 
$30.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Two Shot at Georgia High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- Two high school students were wounded  
this morning in a shooting at a high school, possibly in a double 
suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy, both students at  
Central High School in Carrollton, were in critical condition, 
sheriff's spokesman Mark Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting took place in the boys' bathroom around 9:30 a.m.,  
said T. Walker, a secretary for the assistant superintendent of the 
Carroll County school system. 
</P>
<P>
	It was being investigated as a potential double suicide attempt,  
Ms. Walker said. She wasn't sure whether a note was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were dismissed 15 minutes after the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	Carrollton is about 40 miles west of Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Riot in Indonesian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of people rampaged through  
an Indonesian town today, hurling stones at police stations and 
looting shops. Police fired plastic bullets at the mobs, killing at 
least one person and injuring nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rioters in Karawang, on the main island of Java, banged drums,  
burned a motorcycle, taunted security forces and threw bricks. They 
smashed the windows of a bank, a hotel, two Protestant churches and 
attacked the home of an ethnic Chinese businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is because of the government,'' one man said, reflecting  
the deep public mistrust of the state that has emerged in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the violence lacked any political motive, with  
looters cheering and grabbing shoes, candles and umbrellas from 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of rioters were arrested, including one soldier dressed  
in civilian clothing, said police chief Col. Ahmad Hidayat. He did 
not say why the soldier was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil unrest plagued the Southeast Asian nation of 210 million  
last year and shows no signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, deadly riots and student protests helped oust President  
Suharto after 32 years of iron-handed rule, and authorities fear an 
escalation of violence ahead of national elections in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Riots broke out early today in Karawang, 40 miles east of the  
capital, Jakarta, after rumors spread that police had mistreated 
motorcycle drivers who ferry passengers for a living. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobs broke down the door of a department store and looted goods,  
Hidayat told the private Sonora radio news station. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd swelled and attacked the police headquarters and other  
posts, forcing police to fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-year-old high school student was shot and killed, said  
Rosid, a medic in the emergency room at the main town hospital. 
Nine people were wounded by gunfire and mobs beat two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The city center was quiet by late afternoon, but police fired  
warning shots and chased small bands of rioters after dark. 
Officers patrolled with megaphones, urging people to stay in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said looters did not single out shops owned by ethnic  
Chinese entrepreneurs. However, some rioters threw stones at a 
house owned by a Chinese businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the violence in Indonesia has been directed at the  
Chinese minority, which is resented partly because of its relative 
wealth. Many Chinese in predominately Muslim Indonesia are 
Christian or Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's persistent riots have been linked to economic  
hardship, ethnic and religious tensions and political turmoil. Many 
people also are suspicious of the armed forces, which have 
acknowledged human rights abuses during the Suharto era. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, is implementing  
political reforms but student activists say his measures fall far 
short of real democracy. One of their key complaints is that the 
military retains a prominent role in politics.

	Text of remarks by White House special counsel Greg Craig on the  
Senate impeachment trial rules that were approved by the Senate 
Friday: 
</P>
<P>
	Good afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has decided how it wants to proceed. We respect that.  
And in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Senate, we

and complete defense. 
</P>
<P>
	We are optimistic, we are confident, that the senators, once  
they see and hear this defense in this opening phase of the trial 
will conclude that the articles do not justify or warrant 
conviction or removal from office. 
</P>

	We remain hopeful that this matter can be resolved expeditiously

<HEADLINE> Ticker Symbols Are Marketing Tool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All those letters scrolling across the TV screen  
during your favorite financial-news program may look like nothing 
more than alphabet soup. But many companies use these letters -- 
their stock ticker symbols -- as a quickie marketing gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
	Does YUM pique your appetite for shares of restaurant company  
Tricon? Are you HOT on the trail of Starwood Lodging, a real-estate 
investment firm? Do you say AMEN when shares of Christian Internet 
company Didax Inc. rise? 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have embraced do-it-yourself investing, making ticker  
symbols -- once the lingo of traders and stockbrokers alone -- part 
of the vernacular. It isn't necessary to know a company's ticker 
symbol in order to buy stock, but telephone or online transactions 
can move a little faster if you do. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are easy to decipher: Dell Computer Corp. is DELL, CBS  
Corp. is CBS and Wang Laboratories is WANG. But who would guess 
that Venator Group, the former Woolworth Corp., is listed as Z? 
</P>
<P>
	Symbols were first created in 1844 by telegraph operators trying  
to transmit prices rapidly. One-letter symbols were assigned to the 
most heavily traded stocks and these still have a certain cachet, 
said Patrick Healy of the Issuer Network, a Washington-based firm 
that advises companies on stock listings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're easiest to remember and easiest to recognize,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A symbol of one, two or three letters means the stock trades on  
the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange. A 
four-letter code indicates a Nasdaq Stock Market listing. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies can request specific symbols, and if it isn't already  
taken, requests are generally granted, exchange officials say. The 
ticker symbol is not the same as the newspaper listing: General 
Motors Corp., known as GM on the NYSE, is listed as GnMotr in many 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies choose ticker symbols that identify their premier  
products. Anheuser-Busch Cos., maker of Budweiser beer, is BUD. A 
number of eye-care companies, like Vision Twenty-One Inc. (EYES), 
Sunglass Hut International (RAYS) and Oakley Inc. (OO) opted for 
clever symbols, too. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. spun off from PepsiCo Inc.  
in 1997, the company wanted its name to indicate it had three 
businesses: Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. For its ticker symbol, 
the company decided to have a little more fun, and chose YUM. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make people smile, and we wanted something that  
would be recognizable from country to country,'' said Lynn Tyson, 
Tricon's vice president of investor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon isn't the only company banking on investors' hunger.  
Brinker International, the owner of Chili's restaurants, is listed 
as EAT. The Smithfield Cos., producer of Smithfield hams, is HAMS. 
Western Beef Inc. is BEEF, and Cheesecake Factory is CAKE. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that a company's ticker symbol would affect its  
success on the stock market. James Bell, a senior partner at 
Lippincott &AMP; Margulies, a New York corporate image consultancy, 
said most companies consider the symbols an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just coming up with a good name is tough enough,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ugly Duckling, a used-car sales and financing company that  
targets people with credit problems, has one of the most 
distinctive names in business. When the company went public in June 
1996, officials toyed with several possible symbols before gambling 
that UGLY wouldn't repel investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ugly Duckling has never become a stock-market swan. Its  
shares, held mostly by institutional investors, are currently 
trading at around $4.75, near its 52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Darak, chief financial officer of the Phoenix-based  
company, isn't afraid to poke fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that someday, UGLY will be beautiful,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> S.C., La. Perform Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A man who killed a woman by suffocating  
her with a plastic bag while stealing her car was executed by 
injection Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second execution Friday, a Louisiana man received a lethal  
injection for stabbing a woman to death while her husband tried to 
save her. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Ronnie Howard, 40 had argued that he was  
condemned by a jury skewed by racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, who was black, was convicted in the 1985 killing of  
Chinh Thi Nguyen Le, 34, after he and another man stopped her to 
steal her car. 
</P>
<P>
	He said only, ``I'm on my way,'' before he was put to death.  
</P>
<P>
	A co-defendant, Dana Weldon, 39, remains on Death Row.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Howard and Weldon were driving around looking  
for a car to steal one night when they spotted Le driving home from 
work on a secluded road. They used their car to bump her 1978 Ford 
Granada and fake an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The men put a plastic bag over Le's head to keep her quiet but  
suffocated her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, prosecutors dismissed six of seven black potential  
jurors and four of 35 whites at the trial of Howard and Weldon, who 
is also black. When alternates were selected, prosecutors dismissed 
only blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after one of Howard's first appeals was turned down by  
the state Supreme Court in 1989, the court adopted a rule requiring 
the comparison of the ratio of dismissed black jurors to accepted 
whites as part of the appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
	In Angola, La., Dobie Gillis Williams was executed for the 1984  
murder of Sonja Knippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 38, was on a prison furlough when he cornered Mrs.  
Knippers in her bathroom and stabbed her while her husband tried to 
break down the door and save her. Police claim he was trying to 
rape her.

<HEADLINE> Dentist Admits Molesting Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A dentist accused of blindfolding and then  
photographing dozens of his young female patients performing sex 
acts on him has admitted molesting five girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald C. Johnson pleaded guilty Friday to five counts of lewd  
molestation in exchange for a recommendation from prosecutors that 
he receive a 70-year prison sentence. Sex abuse charges that 
carried possible life terms were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 48, spent a week as a fugitive after employees at his  
Tulsa dental office discovered a box full of Polaroid photographs 
of blindfolded girls, mostly between the ages of 8 to 16. They 
appeared to be anaesthetized while performing oral sex on a man. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities identified the man as Johnson based on a distinctive  
ring appearing in the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Tim Harris said the families of the victims  
support the plea bargain, in part to spare the girls from having to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It serves the community. It serves the victims. It serves the  
families,'' Harris said. ``We believe he'll be in there until he's 
in his 70s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associate District Judge Bill Beasley said he would follow the  
recommendation and sentence Johnson to 70 years on Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Durbin, Johnson's lawyer, said his client wanted to  
protect the identity of the victims and avoid ``revictimizing 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he surrendered in August, he knew he would be facing the  
music someday,'' said Durbin. ``And that day is today. ... He is 
extremely remorseful -- and contrite.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Is Pressured by Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. says he puts pressure on  
himself when he fights in front of his hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure, however, was not evident in Jones' first two  
championship appearances in Pensacola. He stopped Antoine Byrd in 
the first round and Tony Thornton in the third round of IBF super 
middleweight title defenses in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, one week before his 30th birthday, Jones is not  
expected to have much difficulty defending the WBC-WBA light 
heavyweight titles against light-hitting Rick Frazier, a 
39-year-old New York City cop. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will follow Shane Mosley's IBF lightweight  
championship defense against Golden Johnson on an HBO doubleheader 
at the Civic Center. The telecast will begin at 10 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed Frazier, a police officer for 17 years, is the  
WBC's No. 1-ranked contender on the strength of a six-fight winning 
streak over opponents no-better known generally than he is. His 
record is 18-3-1, with seven knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier is a good boxer, but he certainly isn't quicker than  
Jones and cannot match Jones' blazing hand speed. He also does not 
have the power to keep Jones (38-1-0, 32 knockouts) at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' loss came when he was disqualified in the ninth round on  
March 21, 1997, for twice hitting Montell Griffin when Griffin was 
down. In the rematch Aug. 7 of that year, Jones knocked out Griffin 
in the first round., 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Johnson (15-2-2, 10 knockouts), of Killeen,  
Texas, who lost his last fight Oct. 16 on a disputed decision to 
Israel Cardona, was called three weeks ago to challenge the 
27-year-old Mosley (30-0, 28 knockouts), of Pomona, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was summoned to replace Justin Rowsley of Australia.  
Rowsley elected to take a fight he didn't need and got knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones elected to fight in the 8,500-seat Civic Center to mark  
his birthday. He wanted to fight on Jan. 16, but had to settle for 
tonight because Mike Tyson will begin his latest comeback against 
Francois Botha on Jan. 16 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Mosley have the talent and the power to make it short  
celebration.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues Boss Over Claustrophobia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- An office with a window was more than just a  
perk for Linda Burris. It was the only the way she said she could 
work without feeling claustrophobic. 
</P>
<P>
	But when a new boss put her in an office without a view she  
began having panic attacks and had to quit, she said in a lawsuit 
seeking $2 million and back pay. She also wants her secretarial job 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would start feeling panicky or shaky,'' she said Friday.  
``After awhile, I felt like I couldn't breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burris, 49, sued North Western Electric Cooperative Inc. of  
Bryan, alleging the company violated federal law that protects the 
disabled from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	William Clevenger, president of North Western, acknowledged that  
he had Burris moved to an office that had no window so she could be 
closer to her supervisor. But he wouldn't comment extensively on 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've done anything wrong,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Burris said the trouble began when Clevenger came to the company  
in 1997. She had worked there for 14 years as a secretary and 
receptionist. Burris said she's always had claustrophobia and 
always had been accommodated with an office that had a window. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been able to get my job done,'' she said. ``I've  
never had any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move, though, to a windowless work space cluttered with  
stacks of paper caused friction between her and Clevenger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't handle it,'' she said, adding that she began  
suffering from high blood pressure and migraine headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, her desk was moved into a hallway for two months,  
then into another enclosed office, she said. She quit about four 
months later, in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was real clear they wanted her out,'' said Burris' attorney  
James Weinandy. ``This was a real slap in the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No hearing dates have been set in the lawsuit, which was filed  
in U.S. District Court in Toledo last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge David Katz will have to decide whether Burris'  
claustrophobia limits a ``major life activity.'' If it doesn't, she 
wouldn't be considered a person with a disability and not protected 
by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The company provides electricity in rural areas of northwest  
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney insisted that this was not a frivolous lawsuit.  
``This is not someone who's playing games with the system,'' 
Weinandy said.

<HEADLINE> Some NBA Teams Must Vie for Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With the gag order lifted and the start of training camps more  
than a week away, the previously muzzled masses -- also known as 
coaches and general managers -- start talking Friday about the 
upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumors floating around, jokes being told about the  
most out-of-shape players and ruminations on what it's like to sit 
around for six months with basically nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy recalled his toughest decision each  
day: 
</P>
<P>
	``Chocolate chip or vanilla wafers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The decisions will be slightly more important in the coming days  
as teams begin setting out their game plans for going into an 
abbreviated 50-game season that could start Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word yet from Michael Jordan as to whether he'll  
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I'm) just as anxious as all of you are,'' Chicago Bulls  
coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd said. ``And really looking forward to 
hearing what his intentions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agent for Scottie Pippen said there is a possibility his  
client will return to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team and so, if we can work a  
deal out that works for Scottie, I think he would like to stay 
there,'' agent Jimmy Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout will not officially end until the agreement reached  
Wednesday is put into writing, and training camps are not expected 
to open until Jan. 18. All trades and free agent signings are on 
hold until then, too. 
</P>
<P>
	At least everyone around the league had something positive to  
look forward to after months of being cooped up without being 
allowed to say anything about it. League employees were forbidden 
from speaking about their players or the details of the work 
stoppage during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been awful. It's been the worst time of my life,''  
Indiana Pacers president Donnie Walsh said. ``I was all right until 
the games started getting missed, and then I was coming in, and I 
was worried, because usually at that time of the year I am worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I realized I didn't have anything to worry about because  
I didn't have any games. That was a very confusing time in my life. 
I had holidays that were supposed to be joyous, and I wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh has the advantage of bringing almost his entire team back,  
meaning he won't have to scramble to fill a roster the way some 
teams will. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls, Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets have only  
four players apiece under contract, while the Phoenix Suns have 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're behind the eight-ball in about every way we can be,''  
Hawks president Stan Kasten said. ``Let's face it, the rest of the 
year is going to be rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams are prohibited from negotiating with free agents until the  
labor agreement is formally signed. Kasten said he was suspicious 
that other teams were getting a jump on negotiations in violation 
of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	He already has spoken with commissioner David Stern about the  
situation and vowed to turn in any team that breaks the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the teams that also should be worried about free agent  
tampering is the Charlotte Hornets, who could lose both of their 
big men -- Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Kings are said to be very interested in Divac,  
while Geiger should also draw plenty of interest from teams that 
need a center. 
</P>
<P>
	``With or without a `quote' center, we will put together a  
competitive team,'' Hornets coach Dave Cowens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac is playing with Red Star Belgrade under a contract that  
allows him to return to the NBA at the conclusion of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cowens nor general manager Bob Bass would predict  
whether Divac would be wearing a Hornets uniform at the start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is conditioning.  
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing, who as union president spent the summer, fall and  
early part of winter locked inside office buildings because of the 
lockout, is at least 20 pounds overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp of the Cleveland Cavaliers was the butt of endless  
jokes in Atlantic City last month when he showed up for an 
exhibition game carrying at least 20 extra pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	One coach who is not worried is Miami's Pat Riley.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard from people in Miami that our guys are working  
out. Our guys are in a culture of conditioning,'' he said. ``If our 
guys walk through that door today, without me, they could probably 
run through 70 to 80 percent of our stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Rick Pitino said once fans realize how exciting and  
competitive the 50-game NBA schedule will be, any bitterness they 
harbor about the lockout will fade away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we're disappointed in the strike, but disappointed in an  
economic sense that the vendors, restaurants, hotels, and fans were 
out. ... We feel for them but now we're going to bring it back 
better than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino likened the abbreviated schedule to that of a college  
basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's possible for all teams to compete,'' Pitino said,  
adding that does not expect to trade Antoine Walker as had been 
rumored throughout the offseason.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Top Tax List at $3.1M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After spending the most money on salaries and finishing with a  
mediocre fourth-place record, the Baltimore Orioles must pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore was socked Friday for the largest luxury tax bill in  
the major leagues: $3,138,621. The money must be paid to the 
commissioner's office by Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which finished 79-83 and 35 games behind the  
first-place New York Yankees in the AL East, had a final payroll of 
$79,468,674 for luxury tax purposes, according to figures received 
by teams Friday and obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike conventional payroll figures, these are computed by using  
the average annual value of contracts instead of salaries for 
single seasons. They also include the entire 40-man roster plus 
$5,576,415 per team in benefits paid to players. 
</P>
<P>
	The luxury tax was adopted as part of the settlement following  
the 1994-95 strike and was designed to discourage spending by 
high-revenue teams. For the teams with the five highest payrolls, 
the tax is assessed at a 35 percent rate on the amount above the 
midpoint between teams Nos. 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees, who paid the highest 1997 tax at  
$4,431,180, lowered their tax bill to $684,390 but still managed to 
win the World Series and set a record for combined regular- and 
postseason wins, going 125-50. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had the third-highest tax, finishing behind Boston,  
which will pay $2,184,734 after winning the AL wild-card spot with 
a 92-70 record, 22 games behind the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which advanced to the NL championship series for the  
seventh straight time, has the fourth-highest tax at $495,625, 
followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, taken over by one of Rupert Murdoch's companies  
before the season, rose from 11th to fifth and will pay $49,593. 
The Dodgers' payroll was about $283,000 above the Cleveland 
Indians, who finished sixth in the payroll standings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first season of the tax, the Yankees were followed by  
Baltimore ($4,030,228), Cleveland ($2,065,496), Atlanta 
($1,299,957) and Florida ($139,607). 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will combine to pay $6,552,963 in tax, down from  
$11,966,468 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the top four or five spenders probably spent less on  
payroll than they would have without the tax, high-revenue teams 
are continuing to pull away from baseball's middle and lower class. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the tax is relatively ineffective as long as  
there are six high-spending teams, since the threshold 
automatically adjusts to the midpoint between the fifth and six 
teams. Owners originally hoped it would be $55 million last season, 
but it wound up at $70,501,185. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, owners originally hoped the threshold would be $58.9  
million, but it will be at least $75,506,769 because of the 
automatic adjustment contained in the collective bargaining 
agreement. The tax rate drops to 34 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is scheduled to be the final year of the tax, some  
lawyers among both the players' association and management appear 
open to extending the tax as part of an overall extension of the 
labor agreement.

<HEADLINE> Vikes Try To Lose 4 Decades of Woe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- It seems like yesterday to Fred Zamberletti.  
</P>
<P>
	Sammy White's helmet tumbling through the air and across the  
Rose Bowl turf. Brent McClanahan fumbling near the Oakland Raiders' 
goal line. Willie Brown chugging 75 yards with the longest 
interception return in Super Bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Jan. 9, 1977, the last time the Minnesota Vikings  
played in a Super Bowl, their fourth -- and last -- loss in four 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember so much of that day,'' Zamberletti, the Vikings'  
trainer since their inception in 1961, said Friday. ``It doesn't 
seem like 22 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of trips to the NFC championship game after  
the 1977 and 1987 seasons, the Vikings are as close to the Super 
Bowl as they've been since that long afternoon in Pasadena, Calif. 
And that's very dangerous for the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are the Cardinals 15 1/2-point underdogs and playing the  
highest-scoring team in NFL history, but they will face a team 
carrying nearly four decades of frustration and the expectations of 
a long-suffering football town into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is certainly an opportunity for them to surpass  
our records and our accomplishments, but I don't think at any point 
are we apologizing for what we accomplished,'' said Carl Eller, a 
standout defensive end on all four of Minnesota's Super Bowl teams. 
``And they're trying to measure up to that at this point, and 
that's a pretty steep climb. But they've got an opportunity to also 
go past it, which I think is exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be one of the biggest upsets in NFL playoff history if  
the Vikings do not advance to the conference title game, and nearly 
as big a surprise if Minnesota struggles on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Cardinals (10-7) see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cinderella was a girl who had a fairy godmother who came to  
give her something,'' said linebacker Jamir Miller, who had two of 
Arizona's four sacks in last weekend's upset victory at Dallas. 
``Nothing was given to us, and I want people to understand that. 
There's no Cinderella to this, there's no mystery to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the games we needed to win to get where we are. So  
that's what it boils down to -- we worked hard to get it, and we got 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Cardinals get with their four-game winning streak --  
modest next to the eight-game streak in which the Vikings have 
outscored their last seven opponents by at least 10 points -- is a 
chance to visit a stadium filled with more than 64,000 delirious 
fans who will be nearly as hungry as the home team for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings were 8-0 at the Metrodome this season for the first  
time since 1989, winning those games by an average of nearly 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think our offense is going to have to go out and score  
45 to 70 points,'' said Arizona receiver Frank Sanders. ``I mean, 
this is not a BYU-San Diego State-Arizona State game. ... We 
believe that our defense can shut them down, we really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good luck.  
</P>
<P>
	No one has done that to Minnesota this season. Even in their one  
loss, 27-24 at Tampa Bay on Nov. 1, the Vikings scored the first 
four times they had the ball. They might have had a perfect season 
if they could have forced the Buccaneers to punt just once in that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings will have their dangerous receiving trio of Cris  
Carter, Randy Moss and Jake Reed healthy and together for the first 
time in over a month, and they are intent on making the game as 
one-sided as the oddsmakers envision. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they're playing for history -- to make up for the  
organization's past disappointments and to stamp their own mark on 
the league's future. Pile a Super Bowl title on top of their 
regular-season accomplishments, and the Vikings will be regarded as 
one of the best teams ever in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can (win the Super Bowl),'' said offensive coordinator  
Brian Billick, ``these guys are going to look back and it's going 
to be great fodder for them when they're sitting around the bar 
with a beer and the buddies when they're old and over the hill like 
I am and going, `My, God ...'''

<HEADLINE> Olympics Officials May Step Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two officials involved in the city's  
successful bid to be host of the 2002 Winter Olympics were 
reportedly expected to step aside today in the midst of a 
wide-ranging bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, were involved in the  
bid that is now the target of four investigations into hundreds of 
thousands of dollars that went into scholarships and gifts for 
International Olympic Committee members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, is  
expected to leave voluntarily while Johnson, the panel's vice 
president, will be asked to resign, The Salt Lake Tribune reported 
today. KTVX-TV also quoted unidentified sources as saying Joklik 
and Johnson will step down. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known if the moves would be permanent.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a heck of a lot to say. The final decisions have  
not been made,'' Joklik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Associated Press learned Thursday that an African  
member of the IOC made $60,000 buying Utah property in an 
arrangement aided by a member of the Salt Lake organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo bought three luxury  
home parcels in Pleasant View, about 20 miles from the Olympic 
downhill race course. The September 1995 purchases of $25,000 each 
came three months after the IOC awarded Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was introduced to the seller, a home builder, by Bennie  
Smith, a bid committee and SLOC member who spent eight years wooing 
African IOC members whose votes were considered crucial for Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Brent Keller, a Weber County home builder, said he built a  
road to Ganga's land, put in utilities and a storm basin, and Ganga 
sold the lots for $45,000 each, one in 1997 and the other two in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics panel is trying to determine the source of the  
cash for Ganga's investment, a source close to the investigation 
said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Ganga in Paris, Brazzaville and Cameroon were  
unsuccessful. Smith did not return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Former U.S. Olympic Committee member Howard Peterson told USA  
Today that Salt Lake's gift-giving began in the 1980s, before the 
international bidding campaign, with at least three USOC board 
members receiving ``ski vacations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times today quoted unidentified investigators as  
saying Salt Lake Olympic officials made individual cash payments 
between $5,000 and $70,000 to IOC members from Africa and Latin 
America. It said investigators still were attempting to determine 
the exact number of payments, the amounts and the recipients and 
that some of the payments may have been legitimate reimbursement 
for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Tribune reported that at least three relatives of IOC  
members were hired by Salt Lake companies during the bid, with the 
bid committee largely paying the salary of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Olympics sponsor U S West said it will withhold a $5 million  
payment to SLOC until it answers questions about the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Pound, the International Olympic Committee vice president  
who is heading that organization's inquiry into the scandal, said 
it has the bulk of the evidence it needs. He said the panel could 
complete its investigation by the Jan. 23-24 target date. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it will not strip Salt Lake City of the Games.

<HEADLINE> Jury Reportedly Probing Alaska Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is being investigated by a  
federal grand jury over alleged irregularities in maintenance and 
repair records for some jetliners, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal investigation involving the federal Department of  
Transportation is centered around allegations that maintenance and 
repair work was recorded as having been done when it was not, 
according to the copyright story, which cites unidentified sources 
close the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury, which is meeting in the Northern District of  
California, also is looking into allegations that unauthorized 
employees signed off on maintenance work, the sources said. It was 
not clear where the jury was seated within the district. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based airline, which has 500 daily departures from  
40 cities in the Western United States and Mexico, has never had a 
crash or passenger fatality related to its operations since its 
founding in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal investigations of airline practices are rare, and it is  
has not been established what prompted the investigation of Alaska 
Airlines, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Corrigan in Oakland, Calif., who  
is heading the investigation, declined to comment, citing grand 
jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the airline say that they have not been given  
specifics of the inquiry, but the Federal Aviation Administration 
has assured them that it is not related to air safety or 
airworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply do not know what the Department of Transportation is  
alleging,'' spokesman Lou Cancelmi said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be understood that the federal government has  
unlimited access to all of our maintenance and flight operations 
records, on demand, and at all times,'' he told the newspaper. 
``Alaska Airlines always has been forthcoming regarding any request 
from the government, just as we have been in this investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No formal charges have been brought against the airline or its  
employees, and Cancelmi said he wasn't aware of any employees 
subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents searched company facilities in Oakland and  
Seattle late last month, seizing maintenance records relating to 
three of the airline's MD-80 jetliners. The airline has 40 of the 
planes, or nearly half of its 85-plane fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Eastern Airlines pleaded guilty to conspiracy and  
falsifying maintenance records in a plea agreement and paid $3.5 
million in fines. None of the violations caused accidents or 
injuries. Eastern has since gone bankrupt.

<HEADLINE> Holmgren To Coach Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren wanted total control. The  
Seattle Seahawks gave it to him, not to mention $4 million a year, 
to become their coach and general manager on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren got an eight-year contract that reportedly will pay him  
$4 million a season, making him the highest-paid coach in the NFL. 
George Seifert received $2.5 million in his contract to become 
coach of the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bob LaMonte, Holmgren's agent, nor the Seahawks would  
confirm the amount of Holmgren's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks, a franchise that has missed the playoffs for 10  
straight seasons, got their man and they paid a high price for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the NBA lockout, I wasn't in midseason form with these  
agents,'' said Bob Whitsitt, who also is president of owner Paul 
Allen's Portland Trail Blazers. ``I should have been in better form 
at this time of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who took the Packers to the last two Super Bowls, told  
team president Bob Whitsitt on Friday morning that he was accepting 
the job and canceled trips to Baltimore and Philadelphia for job 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Packers to tell them they'd have to find a new  
coach to work with Green Bay GM Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren was accompanied to Seattle by his wife, Kathy, and the  
youngest of four daughters, Gretchen, a high school teacher. He 
said he reached a decision to accept the Seattle job Thursday night 
after having dinner with Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the commitment is here,'' Holmgren said, referring  
to Allen, who has spent lavishly on free agents the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Whitsitt at team headquarters for five hours  
Thursday, he spent Thursday night at Allen's house for a private 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first impression was awesome,'' Holmgren said of Allen, who  
is listed as the third-richest American behind Bill Gates and 
Warren Buffett with a total worth of $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time last night. He's a very interesting  
man, interested in a lot of things. I knew right away that I had 
all the support I could ever need or ask for right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most important for Holmgren, 50, was becoming general manager as  
well as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be in charge of the football operations,'' he said during  
a news conference. ``Decision-making, personnel, all football 
decisions. Now, I'll have both (GM and coach) those 
responsiblities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in charge of Randy Mueller, vice president of  
football operations for the Seahawks for four seasons. In effect, 
Mueller has been Seattle's de facto general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren compiled a 75-37 record as coach of the Packers,  
leading them to a victory over New England in the Super Bowl after 
the 1996 season. In 1997, Green Bay lost in the Super Bowl to 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's decision came less than a week after the Packers were  
eliminated by the 49ers 30-27 in a first-round playoff game in San 
Francisco last Sunday. Green Bay lost with three seconds to go when 
Terrell Owens caught a 25-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Green Bay, Holmgren coached his teams into the playoffs six  
years in a row. In order, the Packers went 9-7, 9-7, 9-7, 11-5, 
13-3, 13-3 and 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers felt all season they probably would lose Holmgren.  
It turned out they were right, although Holmgren said it still was 
a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans in Green Bay are wonderful,'' he said. ``Our time  
there was wonderful. Our kids grew up there. It was a time period 
in our lives as a family professionally that I will always look 
back at a wonderful time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the fans know that I gave it everything that I possibly  
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lure of having total control of a franchise, like  
Jimmy Johnson at Miami and Bill Parcells with the New York Jets, 
was too strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you like to have control, as much control as possible,  
over your personnel,'' Holmgren said. ``Who you pick. How you form 
your team. Things like that. I just think it makes things easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having control and a contract reportedly worth  
$32 million, Holmgren's new team will be playing in a new outdoor 
stadium with grass in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should make everybody very happy because my record on  
turf isn't very good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, Holmgren will take over a franchise that went 31-33  
the last four seasons under Dennis Erickson. Erickson was fired 
Dec. 28, one day after the Seahawks ended their disappointing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said he didn't know when he would form a coaching  
staff.

<HEADLINE> In New Role, Falcons Seek Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It's time to forget about the Cheeseheads.  
</P>
<P>
	After vanquishing a familiar nemesis, the San Francisco 49ers  
face a team they're not used to seeing at this time of year. All 
conditions are ripe for a letdown, which isn't a good state of mind 
when you're two victories from the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``As big as the game was last week, this game becomes even  
bigger,'' said coach Steve Mariucci, whose 49ers meet the Atlanta 
Falcons in a divisional playoff Saturday at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, which finished two games behind the Falcons in  
the NFC West, earned another trip to Atlanta by surviving a 
wild-card match against Green Bay last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Owens caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young  
with three seconds remaining for a 30-27 victory, ending a streak 
of three straight postseason losses to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the hurdles this organization needed to get  
over,'' Mariucci said. ``It was a physical drain and an emotional 
drain and I think we were all spent when that thing was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's how it is in the playoffs. Every game is big and  
emotional. You empty the tank, then refill it as the week goes 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 49ers have won more Super Bowls (five) than Atlanta  
has won playoff games (two), the Falcons are hungry for respect and 
revved up after winning their first division title since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dirty Birds moved into first place with a 31-19 victory over  
San Francisco in mid-November and wouldn't let go, finishing the 
regular season with a nine-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chased them for two months and they didn't blink,'' Young  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, only six days after their most emotional victory of the  
season, the 49ers face the rested, healthy Falcons for the third 
time in 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked any coach if he had his druthers, he'd rather  
have a bye week and freshen up, rather than play a physical and 
emotional game, then have a short week and travel,'' Mariucci said. 
``That's a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``But while the bye week can freshen you up physically, it's not  
bad playing a game, either, especially with all the things that 
came from that (Green Bay) game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confidence is the main thing. Now that an albatross has been  
lifted from their backs, the 49ers feel like this could be their 
year to return to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a wild card, you've got to get on a roll,'' Young said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons hope their 14-2 season is the first step toward  
escaping a pitiful history. This is only the eighth winning season 
and sixth playoff appearance since the team joined the NFL in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach of the year Dan Reeves, who plans to be back on the  
sideline less than a month after heart bypass surgery, has 
assembled his roster with low-round draft picks, brilliant trades 
and older players who weren't wanted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some steals on our team,'' running back Jamal Anderson  
said. ``Think about some of the guys who start. Go across the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl quarterback Chris Chandler was acquired for two  
low-round draft picks. Anderson, also a Pro Bowler, was a 
seventh-round pick. Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson was signed as a 
free agent after Green Bay decided he was too old at age 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the Falcons, you're looking at a bunch of  
guys who were low-round picks for the most part,'' Anderson said. 
``We love to play the game, but for one reason or another someone 
else didn't want us. Now, they all want us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta will try to set the tempo and keep San Francisco's  
high-powered offense off the field by handing off to Anderson, who 
set a Falcons record with 1,846 yards rushing and an NFL mark with 
410 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson ran for 123 yards in a 31-20 loss at San Francisco in  
Week 4, then had 100 yards in the return match at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to keep him under 100 yards,'' linebacker Ken Norton  
said. ``If we keep the big plays down from him and make someone 
else beat us, I think it makes our chances better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, the NFL's third-rated passer, is surrounded by strong  
offensive weapons. Owens, Jerry Rice and J.J. Stokes all caught at 
least 63 passes, while Garrison Hearst finished second to Anderson 
in the NFC with 1,570 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers defensive line is so battered that Charles Haley  
was coaxed out of retirement for the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Boys Accused of Mutilating Roosters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Four boys stole several roosters and  
used pliers to rip off their beaks and claws, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old were charged with burglary  
and animal cruelty. Another 12-year-old awaited charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police the boys stole about six of the birds and  
took them to a garage at the home of one of the boys. Police said 
the boys tortured the birds and forced them to fight. Two roosters 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was horrible, completely cruel,'' said police Officer L.E.  
Moran. ``There was blood on the wall, feathers everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> CBS News Fights Military Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is fighting a U.S. military subpoena for  
unaired interviews with two Marine aviators about the cable-car 
tragedy in the Italian Alps last year that killed 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men were interviewed in recent weeks by Mike Wallace for  
a ``60 Minutes'' report being prepared about the case, in which a 
Marine jet sliced through a cable and sent a ski gondola plunging 
to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P.  
Schweitzer, the navigator, are scheduled to stand trial next month 
on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide and could spend 
the rest of their lives in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace interviewed Ashby and Capt. Chandler P. Seagraves, one  
of the jet's two back-seat officers. Charges against Seagraves were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has retained First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams to fight  
the Marine prosecutor's subpoena, which asks CBS to turn over all 
tapes of interviews with the two aviators. On Friday, Abrams asked 
a military court in North Carolina to quash the subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams characterized the subpoena as highly unusual, since the  
story has not been broadcast or even completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is a particularly egregious violation to require  
`60 Minutes' to produce to the government interviews when those 
interviews may well be critical of the government itself,'' Abrams 
said. ``The notion of making CBS the conduit to the government for 
those interviews is inconsistent with First Amendment principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a decision for the Marine Corps to make,'' said  
Marines spokeswoman Lt. Col. Katie Haddock. ``The final decision on 
whether or not the materials will be released rests with the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, vacationing in Mexico, said he was astonished by the  
subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be asked for this kind of material before the piece has  
been broadcast!'' he said. ``And they have no idea what we intend 
to use. They want all of it.'' He added, ``Why do they need us to 
help them make their case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said ``60 Minutes'' is continuing to work on the story  
and plans to put it on the air the Sunday before the trial begins.

<HEADLINE> Jennifer Capriati on Comeback Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At 22, Jennifer Capriati takes a  
philosophic view of the troubles that brought her down and 
tarnished one of tennis world's brightest young stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she's on her comeback tour and and a key stop is at next  
week's Sydney International tournament, where Capriati -- once 
ranked No. 6 in the world -- must play in qualification rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe what doesn't kill you, makes you a stronger  
person,'' she said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati seemed destined for greatness when she joined the  
women's tour in 1990 at 13. She became the youngest Grand Slam 
semifinalist and beat five top-10 players in her first year. At the 
1992 Olympics in Barcelona, she beat Steffi Graf to capture the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all fell apart: Capriati was arrested on drug charges in  
1994 and went into rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she is ranked 100 and believes she can get her game back on  
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone through a lot with my experiences, but everyone has  
troubles. In my life I may have had a little more than others. I'm 
a deeper person for sure. There's a lot more to me now,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Drops to 4.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A hiring surge at construction sites,  
department stores and restaurants cut the nation's unemployment 
rate to 4.3 percent in December and helped make last year's job 
market the strongest during peacetime in 41 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.4 percent in November,  
returned to the level reached in April and before that in 1970, the 
Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, unemployment averaged 4.5 percent, the lowest  
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. Last year's mark 
was the lowest peacetime rate since 1957, when it averaged 4.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a striking testimonial to the strength and resilience of  
the U.S. economy,'' said economist Allen Sinai of Primark Decision 
Economics in Boston. ``These are really good times for American 
workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rallied to a new record on the news, which  
implied corporate profits might not weaken as much as anticipated. 
The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 106 points to 9,643. 
</P>
<P>
	And President Clinton celebrated the report during a luncheon  
speech to the Detroit Economic Club, even as the Senate prepared to 
proceed with his impeachment trial. Clinton noted that the 1998 
rates for blacks, 8.9 percent, and Hispanics, 7.2 percent, were the 
lowest since the government began tracking them in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats,'' the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists predict the labor market will weaken somewhat  
this year, with the unemployment rate rising toward 5 percent -- 
still quite healthy by historical standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Rivlin, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Fed  
policymakers lowered interest rates last fall because ``we do 
expect the economy to slow down. We don't want it to slow down too 
much,'' she said in an interview Friday on the cable financial 
station CNNfn. She refused to say what policymakers will do at 
their next meeting in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin also said she has concerns about the stock market --  
``that maybe the surge in stock prices is out of line with future 
earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, employers added 378,000 jobs to their payrolls --  
the most in 15 months and nearly double what analysts had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the gain reflected abnormally warm weather, which  
produced a huge seasonally adjusted 104,000-job increase in 
construction, the largest in almost 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of it reflected the resistance of the service side of  
the U.S. economy to the global slump that began in Asia a year and 
a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, employers added 2.9 million jobs, compared with  
3.4 million in 1997. That growth was achieved despite 234,000 job 
losses in manufacturing and 35,000 in mining, principally 
oil-drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers of products used in construction, such as glass  
and plumbing fixtures, are still hiring. And the overall loss at 
factories in December, 13,000 jobs, wasn't as bad as the 63,000 in 
November and 59,000 from October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have seen the worst in manufacturing,'' said economist  
William Dunkelberg of the National Association for Independent 
Businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to favorable weather, construction also has been  
propelled by low interest rates. And payrolls in related businesses 
have grown strongly. Real estate firms added 5,000 jobs in December 
and 57,000 jobs in 1998, double the gain of 1997, and mortgage 
brokerages added 4,000 in December and 52,000 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Low rates also fueled spending by U.S. consumers, offsetting a  
drop in export sales to foreigners. Separately, the Federal Reserve 
said Friday that consumers increased their outstanding debt at a 
3.6 percent annual rate in November after adding to it at a rapid 
11 percent rate in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers expanded their payrolls by 53,000 in December,  
reflecting big increases at restaurants, department stores and 
building-supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of brisk job growth last year included temporary  
help firms and computer services. However, job growth slowed in 
health care because a crack-down on Medicare spending led to 
declines in home health care services. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists who believe the jobless rate will rise somewhat this  
year point to a report Thursday from the outplacement firm 
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc. that layoff announcements doubled 
to 103,000 in December from November. 
</P>
<P>
	But Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said companies don't always  
follow through on planned job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recently Boeing Co. projected 48,000 layoffs over the next two  
years,'' Herman said. ``We now know that the actual number is going 
to be about 40 percent of what was anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, strong labor demand coupled with low inflation has  
increased Americans' buying power. Average hourly wages for 
nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers rose 5 cents in December to $12.98, 
up 3.8 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE>  Senators OK Blueprint for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators today unanimously approved a  
blueprint for President Clinton's impeachment trial calling for 
lawyers to begin their presentations next week but limiting them to 
the evidence made public in the House. During an extraordinary 
private session, senators agreed to decide later whether to call 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist, the senators voted, one-by-one from their desks, to 
approve the plan that was reached earlier in the day during an 
informal meeting of all senators in the Old Senate Chamber. The 
vote ended days of uncertainty over the format of the first 
presidential impeachment trial since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think today we have acted in the very best tradition of the  
Senate, and it is an appropriate approach for this historic, very 
solemn event,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Special Counsel Gregory Craig vowed a ``vigorous,  
successful and complete defense'' on behalf of Clinton. ``We are 
optimistic that senators, once they see and hear this defense ... 
will conclude the articles do not justify or warrant conviction or 
removal from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Henry  
Hyde, said he was ready to present a ``compelling case'' under the 
new procedures and hoped ``with Senate concurrence -- to call 
witnesses in support of the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan the trial would begin next Wednesday with motions  
by the two sides, followed the next day by opening presentations. 
House prosecutors and presidential lawyers would be given until 5 
p.m. EST on Monday to file any pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for giving House prosecutors and Clinton's legal  
team 24 hours each -- over several days -- to make their 
presentations. Senators would then have 16 hours -- again spread 
over more than one day -- to ask questions through Rehnquist, who 
presides over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how long the first phase of the trial might take  
although some senators had suggested before the vote an end date 
around Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors, who have been pressing to call witnesses to  
make their case, would have to wait until after the opening 
presentations and questions to learn whether senators would permit 
any such witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the question period, senators would be free to make  
motions -- either to adjourn the trial and move to censure or to 
call witnesses and produce evidence not in the House record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said that ``ultimately, there will be a  
vote on witnesses,'' indicating that it would be up to the full 
Senate to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A partisan disagreement over rules had clouded the opening of  
the trial on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were sworn in as jurors, in an oath administered by  
Rehnquist. But moments later, the trial was recessed so senators 
could attempt to fashion a bipartisan accord that both parties said 
they wanted to serve as a contrast to the highly partisan 
impeachment proceedings in the House last year. The two sides 
agreed to a meeting this morning in the Old Senate Chamber, the 
site of great debates in the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful, called the  
meeting ``an extraordinary event'' and said its most important 
byproduct was ``we did not begin this process with a partisan 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott indicated that the breakthrough came when two senators of  
vastly different political persuasions, Massachusetts liberal 
Democrat Edward M. Kennedy and Texas conservative Republican Phil 
Gramm made back-to-back suggestions. Lott did not offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle, each with his own plans for a trial, invited  
rank-and-file members to the room that was the Senate's chamber 
between 1810 and 1859. Security officers guarded the doors to the 
chamber, and extra chairs had to be brought in -- there weren't a 
hundred senators back in the 19th century when the chamber was in 
use. Outside, the Capitol was blanketed by a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators gathered, members of the House prosecution  
team also met and considered adding Kathleen Willey, the woman who 
alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in the White House, 
to the list of witnesses they would like to call, GOP sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey would not be questioned about the alleged sexual  
advance but about any possible attempts to intimidate her, one 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, R-Ill., and House GOP colleagues have prepared a list of  
potential witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan and Clinton secretary Betty Currie. Today, Hyde 
issued a statement renewing his plea for witnesses but sidestepping 
any mention of the emerging Senate plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in any court proceeding, witnesses are necessary during a  
trial so that evidence may be thoroughly weighed and tested before 
a conviction,'' Hyde said 
</P>
<P>
	Away from Washington, the president visited Detroit to make a  
speech giving a rosy assessment of the economy. ``I feel good about 
the future,'' Clinton said after attending an auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment, both  
related to his attempts to conceal his extramarital affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. One article charges the president with perjury before a 
federal grand jury, the second with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers were ``ready to go'' and  
ready to accept Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's evidence in the 
Lewinsky matter in exchange for a ban on witnesses. But, he added, 
if the House insisted on calling witnesses it would cause a delay, 
``because bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record 
opens up a whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And 
that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him.

	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- A 25-year-old man has been arrested for  
the shooting deaths of two security guards and the wounding of two 
others outside an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	David ``Goldie'' Livingston was taken into custody Friday at a

<HEADLINE> Pope, Porn Web Site Ordered Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A Web site featuring information about Pope  
John Paul II's visit to St. Louis, along with erotic pictures, was 
ordered removed Friday from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese of St. Louis said a Web site by Internet  
Entertainment Group was confusing Internet users seeking 
information on the Jan. 26-27 visit, the pope's only scheduled U.S. 
stop this year. It also infringed on the Archdiocese's trademark, 
their lawyers told a federal judge 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inappropriate. It's degrading. It's deceptive. And it's  
wrong,'' archdiocese spokesman Steve Mamanella said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told Seattle-based IEG to dismantle its site  
immediately. A Wednesday hearing was scheduled to determine whether 
the order should be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	IEG spokeswoman John Dalton said the company plans to fight the  
restraining order. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The site does include a message in bold letters advising  
parental discretion. It also notes that neither IEG nor the Web

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Questions Gov't Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During contentious questioning of the  
government's final witness in the Microsoft antitrust case, an 
economist warned of living ``in a Microsoft world'' unless the 
judge intervenes to restrain the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft battled with the economist over the company's promise  
to make its Internet software ``forever free.'' Its lawyer even 
offered to pause Thursday so the witness -- economist Franklin 
Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- could control 
his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The most contentious moments came during questions about  
Microsoft bundling its browser free into newer versions of Windows 
to undercut rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be driving black  
cars,'' Fisher said, his voice rising. ``That's not what 
competition is about. That's not what helping consumers is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you seem agitated, sir,'' Microsoft lawyer Michael  
Lacovara responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am agitated. I feel very strongly about this,'' Fisher said.  
``We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It might be a nice 
world, but it's not a competitive world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara offered to take a short break, but Fisher said his  
blood pressure was not cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, Fisher paused after Lacovara asked about his  
previous testimony that Microsoft ``studied and tried to implement 
ways to disable Netscape and reduce total browser sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara began to speak again when Fisher replied: ``I'm just  
dumbfounded by the question. It's not that I can't answer it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher then recounted government allegations that Microsoft  
bundled its own browser into Windows, promised the browser would 
remain free and used its influence to discourage others from 
distributing Netscape's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal antitrust law, a claim of predatory pricing  
includes the expectation that Microsoft eventually would raise its 
prices once it dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier testimony, Fisher told the judge that Microsoft spent  
``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to develop its browser and set 
its pricing ``for the explicit purpose of depriving rivals of 
revenues needed to be viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that it never planned to earn money selling  
its browser, but did plan to profit from advertising fees. The 
company's chairman, Bill Gates, previously said in an interview 
that advertising fees from a browser and from the search page and 
the home page far exceed the cost of development. ``So, clearly, 
the browser should be free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara, for example, said companies with tools to search for  
specific information on the Internet -- such as Lycos and AltaVista 
-- pay Microsoft $15 million annually for prominent placement on its 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher said: ``That (explanation) appears to have been  
invented in the middle of this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, a Microsoft spokesman cited a single line  
in a May 1995 e-mail from Gates discussing what he called ``a very 
powerful deal of some kind we can do with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates suggested in the e-mail that Netscape be told that  
browsers ``make no money.'' Netscape earned roughly $8.2 million 
selling its browser during the second fiscal quarter that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher acknowledged to Lacovara that many software companies  
distribute products free in order to sell related products or 
services, or to gain a foothold in a market. But Microsoft went 
further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with MIT  
economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week.

<HEADLINE>  Senators OK Blueprint for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators today unanimously approved a  
blueprint for President Clinton's impeachment trial calling for 
lawyers to begin their presentations next week but limiting them to 
the evidence made public in the House. During an extraordinary 
private session, senators agreed to decide later whether to call 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist, the senators voted, one-by-one from their desks, to 
approve the plan that was reached earlier in the day during an 
informal meeting of all senators in the Old Senate Chamber. The 
vote ended days of uncertainty over the format of the first 
presidential impeachment trial since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think today we have acted in the very best tradition of the  
Senate, and it is an appropriate approach for this historic, very 
solemn event,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Special Counsel Gregory Craig vowed a ``vigorous,  
successful and complete defense'' on behalf of Clinton. ``We are 
optimistic that senators, once they see and hear this defense ... 
will conclude the articles do not justify or warrant conviction or 
removal from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Henry  
Hyde, said he was ready to present a ``compelling case'' under the 
new procedures and hoped ``with Senate concurrence -- to call 
witnesses in support of the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan the trial would begin next Wednesday with motions  
by the two sides, followed the next day by opening presentations. 
House prosecutors and presidential lawyers would be given until 5 
p.m. EST on Monday to file any pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for giving House prosecutors and Clinton's legal  
team 24 hours each -- over several days -- to make their 
presentations. Senators would then have 16 hours -- again spread 
over more than one day -- to ask questions through Rehnquist, who 
presides over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how long the first phase of the trial might take  
although some senators had suggested before the vote an end date 
around Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors, who have been pressing to call witnesses to  
make their case, would have to wait until after the opening 
presentations and questions to learn whether senators would permit 
any such witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the question period, senators would be free to make  
motions -- either to adjourn the trial and move to censure or to 
call witnesses and produce evidence not in the House record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said that ``ultimately, there will be a  
vote on witnesses,'' indicating that it would be up to the full 
Senate to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A partisan disagreement over rules had clouded the opening of  
the trial on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were sworn in as jurors, in an oath administered by  
Rehnquist. But moments later, the trial was recessed so senators 
could attempt to fashion a bipartisan accord that both parties said 
they wanted to serve as a contrast to the highly partisan 
impeachment proceedings in the House last year. The two sides 
agreed to a meeting this morning in the Old Senate Chamber, the 
site of great debates in the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful, called the  
meeting ``an extraordinary event'' and said its most important 
byproduct was ``we did not begin this process with a partisan 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott indicated that the breakthrough came when two senators of  
vastly different political persuasions, Massachusetts liberal 
Democrat Edward M. Kennedy and Texas conservative Republican Phil 
Gramm made back-to-back suggestions. Lott did not offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle, each with his own plans for a trial, invited  
rank-and-file members to the room that was the Senate's chamber 
between 1810 and 1859. Security officers guarded the doors to the 
chamber, and extra chairs had to be brought in -- there weren't a 
hundred senators back in the 19th century when the chamber was in 
use. Outside, the Capitol was blanketed by a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the senators gathered, members of the House prosecution  
team also met and considered adding Kathleen Willey, the woman who 
alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in the White House, 
to the list of witnesses they would like to call, GOP sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey would not be questioned about the alleged sexual  
advance but about any possible attempts to intimidate her, one 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, R-Ill., and House GOP colleagues have prepared a list of  
potential witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan and Clinton secretary Betty Currie. Today, Hyde 
issued a statement renewing his plea for witnesses but sidestepping 
any mention of the emerging Senate plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in any court proceeding, witnesses are necessary during a  
trial so that evidence may be thoroughly weighed and tested before 
a conviction,'' Hyde said 
</P>
<P>
	Away from Washington, the president visited Detroit to make a  
speech giving a rosy assessment of the economy. ``I feel good about 
the future,'' Clinton said after attending an auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is charged under two articles of impeachment, both  
related to his attempts to conceal his extramarital affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. One article charges the president with perjury before a 
federal grand jury, the second with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers were ``ready to go'' and  
ready to accept Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's evidence in the 
Lewinsky matter in exchange for a ban on witnesses. But, he added, 
if the House insisted on calling witnesses it would cause a delay, 
``because bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record 
opens up a whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And 
that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him.

<HEADLINE> Records of Capitol Shooter Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors gained access Friday to  
the medical and psychiatric records of the man charged with killing 
two U.S. Capitol police officers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan granted the request of  
government lawyers who asked to review extensive documentation 
related to the mental health history of Russell Weston Jr., who 
allegedly gunned down officers John Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge cleared the way for prosecutors to review records  
related to Weston's diagnoses and treatment for mental illness in 
Illinois and Montana over the past 20 years. The ruling also gives 
them access to the transcripts from court proceedings that led to 
his involuntary commitment to Montana State Hospital in 1996. 
Weston has been diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan's ruling also covers the diagnostic notes made by Dr.  
Sally Johnson, the chief psychiatrist at the federal prison 
hospital in Butner, N.C., who has recommended Weston be 
hospitalized indefinitely without trial. Johnson, who evaluated 
Weston for several weeks last fall, also wrote the psychiatric 
report that argued Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski was mentally 
competent for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys withdrew their objections to government  
efforts to obtain Weston's medical records after they were assured 
access to key prosecution witness statements. But Weston's lawyers 
continued to oppose efforts by prosecutors to obtain another 
psychiatric evaluation before a February competency hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to do a videotaped psychiatric exam, and there is no  
support in the statute for that,'' said Barry Boss, a member of 
Weston's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan tentatively set a Tuesday hearing on the prosecution's  
request for another mental evaluation of Weston, but that could be 
delayed until Jan. 20 because of legal haggling over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that those doctors have the time to do  
what they must do,'' said Sullivan, who noted that should he grant 
the request, he still planned to hold the competency hearing Feb. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	That hearing could determine whether Weston is held indefinitely  
without trial in a mental hospital, or tried on murder charges in 
connection with the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you satisfied with the services of your attorneys?''  
Sullivan asked Weston in the only direct exchange with the 
defendant during the 10-minute hearing. Weston, wearing a red 
institutional jumpsuit replied, ``Yes, sir.'' He remains confined 
to a wheelchair with one leg immobilized and one arm in a sling 
because of injuries related to the shootings.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Touts Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Far from the political chill of Washington,  
President Clinton basked Friday in the statistical sunshine of a 
historic economic boom and vowed to press ahead with an agenda to 
expand trade, improve schools and reform Social Security and 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again,'' he declared in a speech to the  
Economic Club of Detroit in which he touted his administration's 
economic record but cautioned against assuming prosperity will 
persist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced that his Council of Economic Advisers has  
calculated the economy's continued growth over the last 93 months 
as the nation's longest peacetime expansion. The previous record 
was 92 months for the economic expansion that followed the 1982 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department presented Clinton with more cheery news: a  
national unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in December -- the lowest 
since it stood at 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War. It is 
the lowest peacetime jobless rate since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gather today at a time of American economic renaissance,''  
he told an audience of nearly 2,000 at the Cobo Center in downtown 
Detroit. No mention was made of the Senate impeachment trial, 
either in his speech or in audience questions to which he responded 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks introducing Clinton, Detroit's Democratic Mayor  
Dennis Archer said it was no mystery in Michigan why Clinton's poll 
ratings have remained high despite his political trouble: ``We 
respect and appreciate a president whose policies put people 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside on the snowy streets, protesters for and against  
Clinton's impeachment rallied. Ollie Williams, 64, of Detroit held 
two signs: ``Stop the Insanity'' and ``We love Bill.'' Signs held 
by others took the opposite view: ``Fire the Liar'' and ``Clinton 
Must Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before delivering his speech, Clinton toured the North American  
International Auto Show in the cavernous Cobo Center. He peeked 
under the hood of a silver Jeep Commander, listened intently to a 
General Motors executive's explanation of an experimental fuel-cell 
technology and tugged gently at a seat belt in Ford's exhibit of 
its latest passenger safety system. 
</P>
<P>
	In warming up his audience at the Economic Club, Clinton said  
gawking at the shiny new cars ``made me feel like a kid again -- I 
wanted to leave with 10 of the cars myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing themes he intends to feature in his State of the  
Union address Jan. 19, Clinton said the key to the economic 
progress recorded during his six years in office is a combination 
of balancing the federal budget, investing in education and worker 
training and expanding trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has enabled the United States, the businesses and the  
people working here, to create a truly new, global, high-tech 
economy,'' Clinton said. Yet more must be done, he said, to prepare 
America's younger generation for a lifetime of job competition in 
the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my upcoming State of the Union address, I will propose  
further reforms and improvements in our public schools, and I will 
also advance a new training agenda'' for workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cautioned against a return to what he called the ``drift  
into a low-growth, hard-work, low-wage future'' that marked the 
American economy before he took office in 1993, when ``foreign 
competitors actually described America as another great power in a 
state of inevitable decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, he criticized Japan and Russia for exporting  
hot-rolled steel to the United States at prices below their 
production costs. He said the Commerce Department had not yet 
formally determined that this amounted to ``dumping,'' but he 
warned that if Japan's steel exports don't slow down soon, he will 
``look at anti-dumping action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said a ``major focus'' of his foreign policy in 1999  
would be to push for a modernization of the international financial 
system, which was shaken in 1998 by the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seek Public Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Senate Democrats said Friday they plan to  
urge colleagues to suspend the rules for the presidential 
impeachment trial so the public can watch the entire proceeding, 
including on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must let the sun shine in,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules, key decisions to establish trial procedures  
would take place in private, Harkin said. Important testimony also 
may be given in secret, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the public can watch only those portions of the trial  
that are conducted when senators are seated and silent, as the 
rules require them to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said presentations by House lawmakers who will act as  
prosecutors and from White House defense lawyers can be closed to 
the public by a simple majority vote. The rules also require 
procedural issues to be resolved in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Final deliberations by the senators on whether President Clinton  
should be removed from office also would be behind closed doors 
under the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone said it would be a mistake for any  
part of the first presidential impeachment trial since 1868 to take 
place behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people deserve better from the Senate of the United States  
than deliberations cloaked in secrecy on the eve of such a 
momentous decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the C-SPAN public affairs network asked Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to change the rules so it 
could broadcast the entire proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Network spokesman John Maynard said it had not yet received a  
reply. C-SPAN covers House and Senate floor proceedings and 
committee activity. It also broadcast the House Judiciary 
Committee's impeachment hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they've had lots of other decisions to be working  
on,'' Maynard said. ``We do hope the senators decide to keep these 
deliberations open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's office did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE>  S. African Cops Fire at Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African police fired tear  
gas and bird shot at a handful of Muslim protesters today, minutes 
before British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived for a scheduled 
event, witnesses said. One journalist was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair was not hurt and proceeded with the event in downtown Cape  
Town -- the awarding of medals to British soldiers who are assisting 
the South African military. The shootings occurred outside the 
Castle, a monument in downtown Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had ordered the demonstrators to disperse, then opened  
fire with shotguns loaded with birdshot and tear gas on those who 
did not leave, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	One South African journalist working for the South African  
Broadcasting Corp. was wounded in the legs and was taken to a 
hospital. There were unconfirmed reports some protesters were also 
hit, but those reports could not immediately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a Cape Town group called Muslims Against Global  
Oppression began protesting last month's U.S.-British attack on 
Iraq on Thursday. The protesters burned U.S., British and Israeli 
flags and clashed with police. They vowed to dog Blair during his 
stay in Cape Town, where he arrived today on the third day of his 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 men and women, some wearing Islamic scarves, waved  
placards at the airport condemning Blair's visit. ``Death to 
Blair'' read one, while another said: ``Tony go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair, arriving from Johannesburg, managed to bypass that  
peaceful demonstration by taking another route.

<HEADLINE>  S. African Cops Fire at Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African police fired tear  
gas and bird shot at a handful of Muslim protesters today, minutes 
before British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived for a scheduled 
event, witnesses said. One journalist was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair was not hurt and proceeded with the event in downtown Cape  
Town -- the awarding of medals to British soldiers who are assisting 
the South African military. The shootings occurred outside the 
Castle, a monument in downtown Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had ordered the demonstrators to disperse, then opened  
fire with shotguns loaded with birdshot and tear gas on those who 
did not leave, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	One South African journalist working for the South African  
Broadcasting Corp. was wounded in the legs and was taken to a 
hospital. There were unconfirmed reports some protesters were also 
hit, but those reports could not immediately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a Cape Town group called Muslims Against Global  
Oppression began protesting last month's U.S.-British attack on 
Iraq on Thursday. The protesters burned U.S., British and Israeli 
flags and clashed with police. They vowed to dog Blair during his 
stay in Cape Town, where he arrived today on the third day of his 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 men and women, some wearing Islamic scarves, waved  
placards at the airport condemning Blair's visit. ``Death to 
Blair'' read one, while another said: ``Tony go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair, arriving from Johannesburg, managed to bypass that  
peaceful demonstration by taking another route. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Blair and his wife, Cherie, visited a group of  
children living at Nazareth House, a care center run by Roman 
Catholic nuns, where he played with HIV-infected children.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Senator Faces Double Jury Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Rick Santorum may have a unique excuse  
for getting out of jury duty: He's already serving on a panel 
trying President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum, R-Pa., recently got a summons from the Allegheny  
County Common Pleas Court. He had to mail back a response card 
answering questions on availability for jury duty and other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just laughed over the holidays,'' he said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Santorum and 99 other senators were sworn in Thursday to serve  
as jurors in Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator mailed back the response card earlier this week,  
although he does not recall when he might have to serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may call me, though I may be otherwise occupied,''  
Santorum said. ``I'm already doing jury duty someplace else.''

<HEADLINE> Two More Godzilla Movies Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You just can't keep an angry lizard down.  
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Godzilla'' was widely characterized as a  
disappointment at the summer box office, the big-budget film ended 
up grossing enough money worldwide and stirring up enough nostalgia 
in Japan to warrant at least one more Godzilla movie -- maybe two. 
</P>
<P>
	Toho Co. Ltd. of Japan plans to start filming ``Godzilla  
Millennium'' in April for a December 1999 release, featuring a 
monster that likely will look more like the guy-in-a-rubber-suit 
model seen in 22 Japanese films since 1954 than the sleek 
computer-generated lizard of the American version. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Centropolis Entertainment, the production company  
that created last summer's ``Godzilla,'' intends to make a sequel 
for Sony's film arm Columbia-TriStar, Centropolis spokeswoman 
Suzanne Fritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	American audiences may not be able to see ``Godzilla  
Millenium,'' at least not immediately. Toho doesn't hold the 
distribution rights for a new Godzilla movie outside Japan, while 
Sony has the non-Japanese, worldwide Godzilla rights, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film projects come despite the fact that the Godzilla  
monster seemed to have been on its last scaly legs, having died 
twice in recent years on film -- and a third time at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	A monster destroyed Godzilla in the 1995 Japanese film  
``Godzilla vs. Destoroyah'' and the U.S. military shot Godzilla 
down at the end of last summer's film from Centropolis (though the 
ending strongly suggested a sequel featuring one of Godzilla's 
offspring). 
</P>
<P>
	``Godzilla'' also was widely reported to be the summer's big  
loser, failing to live up to a year's worth of hype with the 
ubiquitous ``size does matter'' campaign. Prospects of a sequel 
were said to be grim. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when all the receipts were counted, ``Godzilla'' ended up  
grossing nearly $400 million worldwide and stands to makes millions 
more in video. It also created renewed interest in the beast in its 
native Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports last month that suggested Toho was  
dissatisfied with what Hollywood had done to its creature. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman was reported in numerous publications as  
saying that because the American Godzilla was ``so different from 
the Japanese version'' there was a ``clamor'' among fans and 
company officials to create a Godzilla ``unique to Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this week Toho released a new statement saying that its  
official was misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to have two kinds of Godzillas in the future, both a  
Toho Godzilla and TriStar Godzilla,'' said Toho spokesman Masaharu 
Ina in an interview. ``Both are very important for us.''

<HEADLINE>  Senators OK Blueprint for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenged to avoid ``the black pit'' of  
partisanship, the Senate unanimously sealed an elusive accord 
Friday on rules for President Clinton's impeachment trial. Opening 
arguments were set for next week with the possibility of witnesses 
still open. 
</P>
<P>
	After an unprecedented closed-door meeting in the ornate Old  
Senate Chamber -- where great issues in American history once were 
thrashed out -- lawmakers formally ratified the rules on a vote of 
100-0. Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided over the brief, 
solemn session. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal summons was dispatched to the White House moments  
later, commanding Clinton to ``abide by, obey and perform such 
orders, directions and judgments'' that the Senate dictates in the 
name of the Constitution. ``Hereof you are not to fail,'' it 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Gregory Craig pledged a  
``vigorous, successful and complete defense. ... We are optimistic 
that senators, once they see and hear this defense ... will 
conclude the articles do not justify or warrant conviction or 
removal from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Republican House Judiciary Chairman Henry  
Hyde, said he was ready to present a ``compelling case'' and added 
that he hoped the Senate would agree to his request for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After the agreement was struck for ground rules, Sen. Joseph  
Biden, D-Del., said, ``The idea that the Senate would degenerate 
into a pit bull ring ... was something we thought would reflect 
incredibly badly on this institution.'' Biden and other senators in 
both parties stressed a determination to shatter the precedent set 
in the House during last year's pitched impeachment battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``I think today  
we have acted in the very best tradition of the Senate, and it is 
an appropriate approach for this historic, very solemn event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of two articles of impeachment, perjury  
and obstruction of justice, in connection with his effort to 
conceal a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He is only the 
second president in history to be subjected to a trial, after 
Andrew Johnson in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Clinton maintained a  
business-as-usual demeanor, traveling to Detroit for an auto show 
and touting the current economic expansion, at 93 months the 
longest in peacetime in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again. It's working -- not just the economy.  
The crime rate's the lowest in 25 years. A lot of our social 
problems are receding. It's working again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was working, too, but on a subject Clinton would just  
as soon have disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the timetable approved, it will likely be the last week in  
January before presentations are concluded and the Senate takes its 
first substantive votes on Clinton's fate -- deciding whether to 
adjourn the trial or proceed further with witnesses. It takes a 
two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove him from office, 
but a simple majority is sufficient to adjourn the trial without a 
vote, or to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers began their day in an extraordinary bipartisan caucus,  
a closed-door session of the Senate in everything but name. There, 
they thrashed out their differences, capping several days of 
behind-the-scenes struggle in which Republicans had sought room for 
witnesses in the schedule and Democrats objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise left it up to the Senate to decide after hearing  
opening arguments and the presentation of evidence over the next 
few weeks. Either the House or the White House, may then seek to 
have witnesses called, and the full Senate will make the decision 
on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, though, the president's allies will have a chance  
to gain a vote to adjourn the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, according to lawmakers in both parties, senators  
peered into the abyss of ceaseless partisan struggle -- in the first 
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years -- and opted for dignity 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker, Democrat Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a  
41-year veteran of the Senate and scholar of its history, appealed 
to his colleagues to think of ``higher things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has sullied itself,'' he said in remarks later  
released by his office. ``The House has fallen into the black pit 
of partisan self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink 
of that same black pit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, said afterward  
he had told his colleagues they had a chance to emulate the giants 
in Senate history, men like Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and Henry 
Clay, known as the Great Compromiser. Alternatively, Dodd said, 
they could wind up in a brawl reminiscent of 1856 when one 
congressman caned a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretrial preparations continued.  
</P>
<P>
	House Republican officials said consideration was being given to  
trying to have Kathleen Willey summoned as a witness. She is a 
former White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted 
sexual pass at her in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential witnesses include Ms. Lewinsky, presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan, White House Secretary Betty Currie and a 
clutch of present and former presidential aides and advisers, chief 
of staff John Podesta among them. 
</P>
<P>
	As drafted, the agreement gives the White House until Monday to  
file an answer to the summons, and the House will have until 
Wednesday to file required papers and deliver evidence to the 
Senate, some of it presumably the voluminous material that 
Independent Counel Kenneth Starr turned over in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial would resume on Wednesday for the Senate to rule on  
any motions filed by either side. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, the House will have 24 hours -- three,  
eight-hour days, for example -- to present its case, based solely on 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning the following day, the White House will have the same  
time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step would be for senators to question both sides for  
16 hours, with the queries posed through Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of that process, motions would be allowed. Any motion  
to adjourn would be voted on first. If it failed, a motion for 
witnesses would be voted on. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate agreed to allow witnesses, they would be  
questioned in closed session and senators would then decide who 
would be permitted to testify.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Air Sued by Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Happy New Year, Northwest Airlines -- 1999 has  
brought a barrage of complaints and a lawsuit over delays during 
last weekend's huge snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's fourth-largest carrier, coming off a 1998 that  
included a costly 15-day pilots strike, was sued Thursday by two 
travelers frustrated by Northwest's performance at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport during and after the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Larry Charfoos on Thursday filed the lawsuit in Wayne  
County Circuit Court on behalf of Timothy and Susan Koczara of 
Grosse Pointe, who said they were on a plane detained for eight 
hours. The airline at one point this week said more than 1,100 
flights systemwide were canceled because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Charfoos said he plans to seek class-action status for the  
lawsuit, allowing other disgruntled passengers to join. Although 
the county and the airport are named as co-defendants, he contends 
Northwest was primarily at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Northwest has hit a new low ... keeping people prisoner in  
their little containers,'' Charfoos said. ``No passengers have ever 
been locked into airplanes for that long unless there was a hostage 
taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest insists it did the best it could, and blamed some of  
the woes on the airport, its snow removal contractor and the city 
of Detroit, whose policy of not plowing residential streets may 
have prevented some Northwest employees from getting to work. About 
half of the airline's workers didn't show up Sunday, when Northwest 
resumed incoming flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at any employer over the weekend, they had the  
same problems,'' Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said. ``This was a 
blizzard-of-the-decade kind of event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the complaints were not what Northwest had hoped for to  
open the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	From April through September of last year, the Eagan,  
Minn.-based airline was rated the least likely major carrier to 
arrive on time, according to the government's Air Travel Consumer 
Report. It improved to No. 3 in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest also regularly placed near the bottom in handling  
baggage and consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials blamed the poor showing on bad weather and  
labor slowdowns, including the pilots' strike last summer, which 
produced a third-quarter loss of $223.8 million.
