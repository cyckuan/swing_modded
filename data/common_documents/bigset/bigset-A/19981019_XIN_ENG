<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens to Recognize Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has said the U.S. will recognize a Palestinian state next year if
Isrealis fail to reach an agreement with Palestinians at the
Mideast summit in the U.S., Israel's army radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Clinton is pressuring Israel to reach an agreement
on Israel's withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinian security cooperation, the report quoted
an unidentified American official as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister's office here issued a statement to
deny such a report as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The on-going Mideast summit involving Clinton, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
started in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a
Palestinian state next May, despite whatever the peace talks
slated to expire at that time may bring about. But Netanyahu has
warned to annex the West Bank territories if Arafat does so.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai also arrived in the U.S. Sunday. Upon their
arrival, Netanyahu convened a special session of the inner cabinet
at the Wye Plantation, Maryland, where the talks are holding,
Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and another
inner cabinet member had already been at the plantation for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Wide gaps still remain on security issues in the talks,
Israel's press reports said.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Turkey Urged to Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Egyptian General
Investment Authority Ibrahim Fawzi Sunday called for the easing of
tensions between Syria and Turkey to smooth the way for trade and
investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of a symposium attended by
officials and businessmen from Egypt and Turkey, Fawzi said the
Syrian-Turkish tensions are not in the interest of investment flow
to the region and does not help cooperation among the countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-Damascus relations became tense after Turkey
reportedly massed troops in its border with Syria over alleged
Syria's support for Turkey's Kurdish rebels. Egypt has been
striving to mediate a political solution to the disputes.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, the Egyptian and Turkish participants
stressed the importance of bilateral cooperation in investment and
trade as Turkey leads to the Commonwealth of Independent States
while Egypt is a gate to Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili told the
symposium that Egypt and Turkey are seeking ways to increase the
trade exchange to 1 billion U.S. dollars from 700 million dollars
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have the wishes to enhance the economic
cooperation to the level of the outstanding political
relationship, Gowaili said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dramatic Parliament Session in Nepal Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The summer session of the
Nepali parliament concluded here Sunday after experiencing a
number of dramatic events in nearly four months.
</P>
<P>
The session made a record since it is the longest of the 14
sessions since 1990 when multiparty parliamentary system was
restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
Known as the budget session, the summer session, which opened
on June 28, passed the budget and policies and programs tabled by
the minority government of the Nepali Congress for the 1998/99
fiscal year which began in mid-July with the help of the Communist
Party of Nepal (Marxism, Leninism, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML joined the government in late August, turning it
into a majority coalition.
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 bills were passed in the summer session with the
passage of the Local Autonomy Bill leading to serious
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
When the opposition MPs were voicing their protest over the
bill at the Lower House on September 17, Speaker Ram Chandra
Poudel conducted voice voting on it and declared its passage in
the House.
</P>
<P>
The move led to never-seen-before manhandling between MPs of
the two sides which caused seven MPs injured and property worth
500,000 rupees (7,350 U.S. dollars) damaged in the House.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post daily said that the lawmakers "proved better
boxers at this session."
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move to vent their anger, the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML) and its allies on September 23 tabled a motion against
Speaker Poudel from the Nepali Congress (NC), accusing him of
partisan conduct.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the NC and the CPN-ML tabled a motion against
Deputy Speaker Lila Subba Shrestha from the CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
As Speaker Poudel had refused to apologize or step down and the
opposition had rejected compromise to withdraw its motion, Deputy
Speaker Shrestha had to resign on October 10 to avoid the
humiliation of forced resignation.
</P>
<P>
Her party could not garner a two-thirds majority in the Lower
House to defeat the motion against her while Poudel's party and
its allies easily defeated the motion against him on October 16.
</P>
<P>
The death of MP Mirza Dilshad Beg was another dramatic event
for this parliament session.
</P>
<P>
He was gunned down here on the night of June 29, one day after
the session opened.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that he had been wanted in India on a
number of criminal charges. An Indian underworld don had claimed
the responsibility for his death.
</P>
<P>
MP Khobari Raya made the headlines because he was detained by
the police on September 19 on charges of illegal arms possession
and attempt to kill a gatekeeper in a drunken state at a disco in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on September 28 ordered the release of him
because the police failed to inform the Speaker of his arrest on
the second charge of attempt to murder.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit Enters Fourth Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli foreign and defense
ministers joined the Israel-Palestine summit while U.S. President
Bill Clinton is also expected to be back as the summit enters its
fourth day in the Wye Plantation, Maryland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. hopes to push Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat towards an
agreement by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister and Palestinian president have been
at the plantation, 110 kilometers east of Washington, since
Thursday to break a 19-month impasse.
</P>
<P>
The central issue is a plan proposed by the U.S. on the next
stages of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Israel's
security demands.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and newly appointed
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon flew into nearby Easton airport on
Sunday morning to join Netanyahu's team. Mordechai told reporters
he was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Clinton, extending his personal shuttle
diplomacy, would go to the country estate in the mid-morning, his
third trip there in four days.
</P>
<P>
The United States had hoped to wrap up the summit by Sunday
evening but both Israeli and Palestinian officials said they may
have to extend it by one or more days.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian negotiator said that if they do not finish by
Monday, Clinton could ask them to stay till Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis would agree with a partial agreement but the
Palestinians reject this approach, delegation sources said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on most details of a second Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, but Israel is trying
to get out of an earlier deal to make a third withdrawal.

PORTO, Portugal, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China has played a

support to the countries which are actively fighting against the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Guterres also called on developed countries, such as Japan and
the United States, to coordinate their policies, intervene in the
world financial markets and take effective measures, such as
lowering interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Meets Former Bulgarian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD October 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz met Sunday with former Bulgarian Prime Minister Reneta
Indzhova, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the pre-1991 Iraqi-Bulgarian relations of
cooperation and friendship and expressed the wish to restore the
ties in the interests of the two sides, the official news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz cautioned that the interests of Bulgaria and other East
European countries lie in the relations with Iraq and the other
Arab states rather than with the United States and the West.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the international embargo on Iraq will be
lifted as it proves its failure.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed sweeping economic
sanctions on Iraq, banning export of oil, its main revenue earner,
in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. The invasion led to the 1991
Gulf War driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Indzhova, chairwoman of the Bulgarian Progressive Party for
Real Reform, praised the pre-1991 relations between Bulgaria and
Iraq, stressing the importance of bringing the bilateral relations
back to that level.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan met with
her and expressed Iraq's intention to enhance cooperation with
Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Iran Starts Oil Production in Persian Gulf's Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Sunday that it
has started oil production in the Sirri A oil field in the Persian
Gulf in cooperation with the French company Total of France.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Jalilian, director in charge of offshore affairs of the
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), said that the operation
started on October 7 with a daily production of 7,000
barrels, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the production was launched under the NIOC's
contract on "buy-back" basis signed with Total of France and
Petronas of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Jalalian said that with the drilling of eight more wells in
the region, the daily production would reach 24,000 barrels and
some 50 million barrels would be produced in the coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Total signed the contract of 600 million U.S. dollars with the
NIOC in 1996 to develop the Sirri A and E oil fields in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
It was the first contract signed by foreign companies with
Iran. They defied the U.S. economic embargo announced in 1995 on
any foreign company which invests more than 20 million dollars in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jalilian said that so far six wells have been drilled in the
Sirri E oil fields and three more were under drilling operations.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the drilling, Iran will start
production in the region early 1999 with a daily production of
55,000 barrels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia in
the world with a daily production of about 3.3 million barrels at
present.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Summit Faces Obstacles: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Obstacles are standing in the
way of the Palestinian-Israeli summit currently held in the United
States, the Voice of Palestine (VOP) radio reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
VOP quoted Palestinian reliable sources close to the summit as
saying that the summit has made no significant breakthrough over
key issues.
</P>
<P>
Differences exist between the Palestinians and Israel over
Israel's troop withdrawal from the West Bank in the third phase
and bilateral security cooperation, the sources said, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demanded that Israel's unilateral actions,
including expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories, and the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails be discussed. But Israel has rejected the requests.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said the two sides have narrowed down the
gaps over the establishment of an industrial park in the
Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip and the opening of an airport and
a seaport in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu started Thursday and is
continuing at the Wye Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Major topics of the summit include Israel's further troop
pullback from the West Bank, security cooperation, the creation of
a safe passage linking the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip and
the West Bank, the opening of the Gaza airport and seaport.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also wanted the summit to address the
prisoner's issue, asking Israel to release about 3,500 Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, Palestinians, particularly relatives
of the Palestinian prisoners in Israel, held demonstrations in the
cities in the Palestinian territories, demanding Israel to free
their beloved.

<HEADLINE> Azeri President Pledges "Constructive Dialogue" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Geidar Aliyev, the re-elected
Azeri president who was sworn in Sunday, pledged "constructive
dialogue" with the central Asian republic's opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the inauguration ceremony, Aliyev described the
existence of an opposition in a country as an "important attribute
of democracy," the Interfax news agency reported in a dispatch
from Baku, the Azeri capital.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said the leadership of Azerbaijan is drafting amnesty
decrees and in the past few years, some 40,000 convicts have been
completely or partially pardoned.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest presidential election, held last Sunday, was
a stage in Azerbaijan's democratic progress and the
democratization will continue.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev vowed to pay more attention to social policy during his
new five-year term and to stick to his current economic policy,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Citing the economic growth over the last two years, he said the
government's policy has shielded the country from the world
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Aliyev said his country will continue to
develop friendly relations with all countries, especially the
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Azerbaijan wants and will promote peace in the whole world,
primarily in the Caucasus," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Armenia, Aliyev said
Baku attaches priority to a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Despite a truce brokered by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe four years ago, sporadic violence has
persisted in the enclave, where the majority of ethnic Armenians
are pressing for independence from Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev stressed that a peaceful solution to the conflict must
be based on the principles of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity
and the inviolability of its borders.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Baku's opposition to Nagorno-Karabakh's secession
from Azerbaijan and vowed to liberate what he called occupied
Azeri lands.
</P>
<P>
"We must in any event achieve the liberation of all occupied
territories in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) Executive Secretary Boris Berezovsky and
leaders of Russia's North Caucasian republics attended the
ceremony, where Aliyev took an oath on the constitution and the
Koran.

<HEADLINE> Kirghiz Referendum Endorses Private Land Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Kirghiz voters have given
overwhelming support in a referendum for the country's
constitutional amendments that would allow private land ownership.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, proposed by President Askar Akayev, got more
than 90 percent of the votes in the Saturday plebiscite, the
Interfax news agency reported Sunday, quoting initial reports.
</P>
<P>
Over 96 percent of the central Asian republic's 2.254 million
registered voters turned out in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
Akayev Sunday described the referendum as "a great success for
democracy."
</P>
<P>
The president described his private land ownership proposal as
the "key issue of the referendum," an issue that "has caused a
fierce debate in the republic and has nearly grown into a
conflict."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to introduce private land ownership "without any
radicalism" with due respect for farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Akayev said that if the amendments were passed,
land plots would also be given to doctors, school teachers and
social workers in the villages in order to avoid public
discontent.
</P>
<P>
"We should do our best to form a middle class not only in the
cities but also in the villages," he added.
</P>
<P>
The amendments also provide for a reform of the structure of
and the election system to the parliament, limitation of
parliamentarians' absolute immunity.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Progress in Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore joined Israeli and Palestinian leaders
at the Wye Plantation, Maryland, to break the impasse of the
Middle East Summit on a crucial day.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat have been at the plantation, 110 km east of
Washington, since Thursday to break a 19-month deadlock in the
process.
</P>
<P>
"There's important work being done here," White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart told reporters after Clinton and Gore arrived on
separate helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Gore was included because he has good relations
with leaders of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
There could be a partial agreement while completing a final
deal could take weeks or longer, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, reiterated the
American position that "our goal continues to be to do all the
work that needs to be done by today."
</P>
<P>
He said he had not "heard any serious discussion about a
multiweek extension" of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also denied an Israeli army radio report that Clinton had
warned the Israelis he would support a Palestinian state if no
West Bank agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
He said that did not "resemble any account that I've heard at
the Wye talks, and I find it difficult to imagine."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon also joined the Israeli team for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The central issue is still a plan proposed by the U.S. on the
next stages of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Israel's
security demands.
</P>
<P>
The United States had hoped to wrap the summit up by Sunday
evening but Israeli and Palestinian officials both say they may
have to extend it by one or more days.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian negotiator said that if they did not finish by
Monday, Clinton could ask them to stay till Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to most details of a second Israeli
withdrawal, from 13 percent of the West Bank, but Israel is trying
to get out of an earlier deal to make a third withdrawal, except
as part of a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that they informed the American side
that without these issues there would be no agreement.

<HEADLINE> Train Derailed in Egypt, High Toll Expected </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An express train derailed in
northern Egypt on Sunday due to the engineer's failure to stop it,
with officials expecting high toll of deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
There are reports saying at least 50 people died in the
incident at the Kafr Al Dawar station, about 30 kilometers
southest of Alexandria, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) said the injured have
been rushed to hospitals and the deceased are being counted.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Egyptian Railways Chairman Mohamed Mar'ei as saying
certain people had tampered with the brakes' air pressure knob
between the locomotive and the coaches, so the driver was unable
to stop the train.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive and two passenger coaches capsized and reports
said they rammed into some houses near the station.
</P>
<P>
The train was on its way from Alexandria to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ei expected a high toll of deaths and injuries as a large
number of people were lying on top of the coaches and in the space
between the locomotive and the first coach.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Not Satisfied With Serbian Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke said Sunday that the United States is still not
satisfied with Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remains ready to act.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the show "This Week" of the American Broadcasting
Company (ABC), Holbrooke admitted that there have been withdrawals
of Serbia's troops from Kosovo, but he stressed "we are not
satisfied yet."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke reiterated U.S. denials that NATO had extended a
deadline for the removal of Serb forces from Kosovo. He said that
"the NATO trigger remains cocked" with aircraft ready to launch
strikes in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, NATO gave Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 10
more days to pull combat troops out of Kosovo, extending until
October 27 the suspension of an "activation order" that was to
have ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's been misinterpreted by some reporters. We
didn't extend the deadline. We kept the threat. And I was a little
surprised to see it interpreted the way you just said," said
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
"It's been portrayed as NATO blinking, when in fact it's been
NATO keeping the trigger cocked and held over the Serbs' heads,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO didn't blink. Milosevic and the Serbs have been desperate
to get this activation order... lifted. We refused to lift it."
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Milosevic allows NATO to send 2,000
"verifiers" into the province, where a civil war between Serbians
and ethnic Albanians has intensified since last February. It also
allows foreign air surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs fully know the consequences if they don't comply.
And this is not a bluff. When our team left for the region two
weeks ago today, we were on a glide path to a war, an aerial war
in Yugoslavia," said the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
"We found an alternative which is far better for the people of
the region and gives us an alternative that can turn around
history. But if the Serbs don't comply, the threat will remain.
And it is real," he added.

<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 40 people were killed
and 80 others injured when a passenger train derailed in northern
Egypt on Sunday due to the engineer's failure to stop it, local TV
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at the Kafr Al Dawar station, about 30
kilometers southeast of Alexandria, in the afternoon as the train
was on its way from Alexandria to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) said the injured have
been rushed to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive and two passenger coaches capsized and reports
said they rammed into some houses near the station.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Railways Chairman Mohamed Mar'ei was quoted by MENA as
saying certain people had tampered with the brakes' air pressure
knob between the locomotive and the coaches, so the driver was
unable to stop the train.
</P>
<P>
The assistant driver who was injured in the incident said the
automatic control system in the locomotive failed to work because
the air pressure was rendered ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ei said many people were lying on top of the coaches and in
the space between the locomotive and the first coach when the
incident took place.
</P>
<P>
The chairman and other senior officials who rushed to scene of
the incident said the main Cairo-Alexandria rails are not affected
by the incident, adding that the cranes have arrived to clear the
scene.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Health Ismail Sallam also rushed to the
scene of the incident together with a team of medical doctors.

<P>
The two premiers spoke highly of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation and discussed ways to further promote such
cooperation. Both expressed a willingness to explore potentials in
a bid to bolster bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As to border negotiations between the two countries, Zhu noted
that General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee Jiang Zemin and General Secretary of the Communist Party
of Vietnam Do Muoi, from a strategic perspective and proceeding
from the general situation of Sino-Vietnamese relations, reached
an important agreement that the two countries should settle
boundary issues and demarcation of the Beibu Gulf by year
2000. This has guided a clear direction, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that an early settlement of remaining issues complies
with the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Phan Van Khai echoed Zhu's remarks, saying that the Vietnamese
side has the resolve to achieve the objectives set by the two top
leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers agreed to speed up related negotiations to
settle both border and Beibu Gulf demarcations in the set period
of time so as to bring a peaceful, friendly and stable boundary
into a new century, which will contribute to the friendship of the
two countries for coming generations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed Phan Van Khai on China's financial and
state-owned enterprise reforms. In return, Phan Van Khai briefed
Zhu on Vietnam's situation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu highly praised the progress Vietnam has made in reform and
opening-up. He expressed the conviction that the Vietnamese people
will, under the leadership of the Vietnamese government and party,
overcome temporary difficulties and realize the objectives of
national industrialization and modernization, which was declared
at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two leaders attended a signing ceremony
for three documents: a treaty of mutual judicial assistance on
civilian and criminal affairs, an agreement on border trade, and a
consular treaty.

<HEADLINE> Two Tanjug Reporters Missing in Kosovo, Sporadic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Two journalists
from Yugoslav news agency Tanjug disappeared Sunday in the Magura
region, 20 kilometers southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital,
Serb Media Center in Pristina said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The center said in a news release that the two journalists,
Nebojsa Radosevic and Vladimir Dobricic, went to Magura with their
car to cover news but did not came back on Sunday as they were
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
Local police confirmed the missing of the two journalists.
</P>
<P>
Two employees of Radio Pristina -- a journalist and his driver
-- have been missing since August.
</P>
<P>
Although there was a ceasefire in Kosovo, sporadic fighting
seems going on. Last Saturday, three policemen were killed by
"extremists" and two others badly wounded at a police station in
Orlate, 30 kilometers southwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The Serb officials said that Serb forces and police have been
attacked a dozen times over the past few days and blamed the
stepped up violence on the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional government,
said: "These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realisation of the
agreement."
</P>
<P>
But the KLA says its soldiers have come under fire from the
Serb forces and they have to respond.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns U.S., South Korean Joint Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Monday condemned the impending
U.S. and South Korean joint military exercise, calling it a "wanton
and shameless violation" of DPRK-U.S. agreements.
</P>
<P>
The game, which would be commanded from Japan and and would
include a series of mock drills simulating the launch of ballistic
missiles by the DPRK, showed the U.S. intention of containing the
DPRK by strengthening the coordinative military moves among the
U.S., Japan and South Korea, a foreign ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the drills, scheduled from October 24 to November 2,
will coincide with the resuming of the third "four-way talks" in
Geneva, he said.
</P>
<P>
This has put greater doubt upon the authenticity of
U.S. intentions to improve its relations with the DPRK and
"protect the peace in the Korea Peninsula," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. made use of the "four-way talks" and other
negotiations to cover up its armed buildup and war preparations
against the DPRK, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises, to be held under the simulated
condition of an "emergency on the Korean Peninsula," will involve
the U.S. armed forces stationed in South Korea and Japan, and the
South Korean army.
</P>
<P>
Warships, including aircraft carriers, a missile cruiser, and
other military equipment will be involved, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals to Hong Kong Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong
in September this year were up by 0.2 percent, compared with the
same month last year, to a total of 733,813, according to figures
released by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKYA) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from China's mainland rose by 12.5 percent in
September, those from Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific
were up by 9.8 percent, those from North Asia were up by 7.6
percent, and those from Europe, Africa and the Middle East rose by
0.8 percent, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Japan came out as the individual market which recorded a 21.4
percent rise for the month, due mainly to a very attractive Hong
Kong travel package available. Arrivals from Britain rose by 23.7
percent, encouraged by an additional Cathay Pacific Airline's
daily flight between London and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Arrival increases were also recorded for such other markets as
Australia (11.2 percent) and New Zealand (9.5 percent), due to
relatively low base in the same month last year. Canada and
Germany also showed an increase in arrivals of 5.4 percent and 3.4
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Market regions registering a drop in arrivals for the month
were South and Southeast Asia (14.0 percent), Taiwan (5.3 percent)
and the Americas (2.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from most market regions continued to show negative
growth over the year-to-date period, reflecting the unprecedented
upsurge in arrivals in the first half of 1997 and the continuing
economic slowdown and currency devaluation in key Asian source
markets, the HKTA said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet to Oppose Spanish Extradition Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean president Augusto
Pinochet said Monday that he was confident of successfully
opposing attempts to extradite him from Britain to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who is receiving medical treatment in Britain, was
detained by British police last Saturday for alleged involvement
in the torture and murder of 79 Spanish citizens in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
A British law firm said in a statement issued on behalf of
Pinochet: "Any attempt to extradite him (Pinochet) from the
United Kingdom will be resolutely opposed. Both he and his family
are confident of success."
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Michael Caplan noted that Pinochet had entered Britain
with the full prior knowledge of the British government and with
the approval of the British Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
"Upon his arrival he was treated as a VIP. Permission for him
to enter and stay in this country was stamped in his diplomatic
passport."
</P>
<P>
"Over recent years General Pinochet has travelled without
hindrance to the UK on several occasions with the approval of Her
Majesty's Government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Monday: "General
Pinochet's record is well known and so far as my position is
concerned I will treat his extradition request by Spain in the
same way as I treat any other extradition request."
</P>
<P>
Straw said that Pinochet would appear before a London
magistrate's court in due course and would have the right of
appeal to the House of Lords and the highest court in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Then after very considerable process it ends up on my desk I
will act in this way as in any other -- in a very quasi-judicial
way on the facts of the case," Straw said.

<HEADLINE> Stollmann Rejects Economic Minister's Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder suffered a surprise setback on Monday after his
designated Economics Minister Jost Stollmann suddenly rejected the
offer to join his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Stollmann, a millionaire computer entrepreneur who has no party
affiliation, said his move was a protest to an apparent attempt of
Schroeder's party to downsize the Economics Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The press here reported that Oskar Lafontaine, chairman of
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the designated
Finance Minister in the new government, apparently won a battle to
move some key divisions of the future Economics Ministry to his
own Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Economics Ministry could lose divisions responsible for
economic forecasts and jobs in order to keep their connection with
the European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), reports said.
</P>
<P>
Stollmann also expressed his opposition to parts of a coalition
deal reached between the SPD and its coalition partner, the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Stollmann, who founded his own computer company, was recruited
by Schroeder during his election campaign to represent a political
"new center" as he attempts to move his traditional leftist party
to the more pro-business direction.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who is due to announce the lineup of his cabinet
later, expressed "great regret" over Stollmann's rejection.
</P>
<P>
According to SPD officials, Werner Mueller, an ex-executive of
the VEBA energy and telecommunication concern, is set to become
Stollmann's replacement.

<HEADLINE> GCC Seeks to Introduce Culture as Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states are seeking to introduce culture as a primary
element in development plans, Kuwaiti Information Minister Youssef
Al-Sumait said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait was speaking at the opening session of the two-day
meeting of GCC culture ministers, the Kuwait News Agency (Kuna)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Kuwaiti minister reviewed the march of
cultural cooperation among GCC states during the past few years,
stressing that culture was the basis of development and
advancement.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait said that culture was a form of national wealth and
a symbol of civilization.
</P>
<P>
The basis of culture, he said, was "openness, pluralism
and resilience in addressing various cultural issues in order to
better understand and deal with the world we live in..."
</P>
<P>
For his part, GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan
underlined the necessity to promote cultural awareness in the
Gulf communities and bring up the youth sound to cope with the
living conditions in light of the technological openness and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the importance of this meeting lay in the fact that it
represents an opportunity to bring into effect all the ambitions
and plans prepared and put forward in previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuna, the GCC culture ministers will tackle
several issues on culture and joint cultural projects, including
the organization of a cultural children week, a singing festival
and producing a joint documentary film.
</P>
<P>
The officials will also propose the GCC culture prize and the
organization of collective activities such as the theater
festival and poetic seminars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Syria to Stop Supporting PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel reiterated Monday his call that Syria stops supporting
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"We tried all the peaceful methods and we tried them with
patience. The thing we wanted from Syria was to make Syria stop
supporting terrorism," Demirel told a ceremony in the southern
province of Hatay bordering Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said that 5,000 Turkish soldiers have died and 5,000
civilians have been killed by Kurdish rebels, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish nation can not stand this pain anymore," Demirel
said, stressing that "our state and our nation are powerful enough
to abolish all kinds of evil that troubles our country. This has
to be known by everyone."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of backing the PKK, which has been
fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. It has
massed troops along the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has denied the charge and called for political
solution to the disputes.

Ali's planned appearance at the public meeting -- he won't

<P>
NANCHANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts should be
made to crack down on criminal activities in areas devastated
by this year's summer floods, the worst in China since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a panel discussion held Monday in Nanchang, the
capital of Jiangxi Province in east China, called on local
authorities to deal with theft, robbery, cheating and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
Those who have been involved in driving up market prices and
profiteering by bullying other merchants should also be
punished.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan and
Jiangxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
attended the meeting and shared their views on the security
situation in these areas during the rebuilding period.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, local police in these seven
provinces and region and Chongqing Municipality in the southwest
uncovered 5,827 criminal cases in September. In most of these
cases, the criminals carried out their activities while others were
coping with the floods.

JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- After a three-month recess,

without the government's policy address by the prime minister
required by the houses rules.
</P>
<P>
All party factions agreed to postpone the address by Prime

Apart from Netanyahu's address on Wednesday, votes on two

Bills calling for early elections and the abolition of the
direct election system for prime minister are also expected to

<HEADLINE> First Twin Lung Transplants Successful in Saudi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi doctors have
successfully carried out a twin lung transplant surgery for a
Saudi patient, the first of its kind accomplished by a Saudi
hospital, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted in King Faisal Specialized
Hospital in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, recently, SPA said.
</P>
<P>
An expatriate living in Kuwait donated his two lungs to the
43-year-old Saudi patient.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Khalid Al-Gattan, head of the medical team conducting
the surgery, was quoted by SPA as saying that the patient's
condition is stable and is currently under supervision in the
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
However, SPA did not give the time of the surgery.
</P>
<P>
This is the first surgery for two complete lung transplants in
Saudi Arabia, SPA said.
</P>
<P>
In two previous similar surgeries, only one lung was
transplanted in each case. The first operation was conducted
six years ago in King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah and the second one
in April 1996 in King Faisal Specialized Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Adopts Flexible Policies for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has already adopted
"fairly open and flexible policies" for easing flow of direct
foreign investment (DFI), an official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Farooq Sobhan, executive chairman of the
Board of Investment (BOI), while exchanging views on the DFI
situation in Bangladesh with European diplomats and leading
investors in Dhaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If needed, the country is ready to welcome more ingenuous
steps," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official BSS news agency reported that present on the
occasion were diplomats and leading businessmen from Britain, the
European Commission, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
France, Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The BOI chief said that apart from creating more facilities in
the export processing zones in Dhaka and Chittagong, the
government will build some industrial parks across the country.
</P>
<P>
On the success of the cement sector, he said, more cement
factories will be established in the northeast district of Sylhet
and limestone and other raw materials will be brought from a
neighboring state of India.
</P>
<P>
Projecting salient features of business in Bangladesh, he
stated that the agro-based industries and the sea-food industries
have a lot of potentials.
</P>
<P>
The government is also keen to attract investments for the ring
road which will encircle the greater Dhaka city, he added.
</P>
<P>
About the power sector, he said, "Power generation situation in
the country has improved considerably, and hopefully by the end of
year 2000 the power situation in Bangladesh will mark significant
improvement."

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Women Face Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 19 (Xinhua) -- While Cambodian women play
an active role in society, they continue to face discrimination in
many areas, according to the 1998 Cambodian Human Development
Report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report is the second in a series of human development
reports produced by the Ministry of Planning in cooperation with
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). This year, the
report focuses on the situation of women and gender inequality.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that even though Cambodia has the highest
female share of labor forces in any country in Southeast Asia,
they earn 30 to 40 percent less in wages than men with similar
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
It reveals that around 42 percent of women above the age 15
have never attended school. Although girls and boys have similar
enrollment rates when they begin school, by age 18 the gap has
widened further. As a result there are far more illiterate women
than men.
</P>
<P>
Although females constitute 52 percent of the population and 53
percent of the labor force, they are poorly represented in the
higher levels of administration and politics. For example, the
newly sworn-in National Assembly has only 10 women out of 122
members.
</P>
<P>
Shortcomings in health services also impact severely on women.
Out of 100,000 live births, 473 mothers die, the highest maternal
mortality rate in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that to improve its human development
situation, Cambodia needs to create more schooling opportunities
for girls, increase public spending on social services, and above
all, to speed up the enforcement of laws that determine the actual
status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia remains among the world's poorest countries. It ranks
140 out of 174 on UNDP's Human Development Index this year and
nearly 40 percent of Cambodians live below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
by 2020, Cambodia's population could nearly double, reaching 19
million from the present 10.5 million, far outstripping the
country's ability to support the people, according to the UN
Population Fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Three civilians have been
killed in a mine explosion in northwest Iraq, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three victims were grazing sheep in the desert in Anbar
Province, 100 kilometers northwest of the capital Baghdad, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
They were killed by a mine planted by the multinational forces
which fought the 1991 Gulf War to oust Iraqi troops out of Kuwait,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual that Iraqis died in mine blasts. The
multinational forces sowed a great number of mines on the border
areas of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bomb disposal squads have defused more than 56,000 bombs,
missiles and different projectiles dropped by the multinational
forces in the Gulf War, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, statistics released by a United Nations agency in
Baghdad last month show that 2,400 people have been killed in more
than 7,000 mine explosions in northern Iraq since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Officials Don't Want Tyson to Get License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Nevada's governor and other
influential state politicians have lobbied against Mike Tyson's
licensing, a newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources close to the Nevada athletic commission, the
Las Vegas Review-Jouranl reported that Govenor Bob Miller, U.S.
Senate Richard Bryan, and state attorney general Frankie Sue Del
Papa have told all five commissioners they don't want Tyson
relicensed today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also listed political consultant and former
commission member Sig Rogich, an ally of promoter Don King, as
anti-Tyson.
</P>
<P>
Commission executive director Marc Ratner describes the former
heavyweight champion's bid to be reinstated as "more saga than
story".
</P>
<P>
Even Monica will appear -- Monica Tyson, the fighter's wife.
So could would-be promoter Earvin "Magic" Johnson. Ditto MGM
President Alex Yemenidjian, who wants to sign Tyson to a new deal.
</P>
<P>
Others will take a lower profile, including Tyson adviser
Shelly Finkel. The commission is wary of Finkel's alleged
attempts at lining up a fight in Europe for Tyson, fearing that
even if it grants the fighter a license, he might go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's original lead legal counsel, Los Angeles celebrity
attorney Dale Kinsella, has been replaced by local counsel Jim
Jimmerson, who lost an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court to keep
Tyson's medical records confidential.
</P>
<P>
Finkel and Kinsella riled commissioner James Nave, a local
veterinarian who has proved to be a bulldog with aggressive
questioning. Tyson needs three votes to secure his license.
</P>
<P>
If it turned down, he's not eligible to reapply for another
year.
</P>
<P>
Commissioners are expected to question Tyson about three chief
areas: the fighter's recent psychiatric evaluation, two pending
assault charges in Maryland and a Playboy interview where Tyson
predicted he'll "blow one day".
</P>
<P>
Tyson generally kept his cool during a grueling six-hour
session on September 19, though he was alternately amused and
agitated, animated and bored, humble and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
Commissioners will monitor the fighter's reactions, which
could vary "depending upon which Tyson shows up," commissioner
Luther Mack said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Step up Coordination with Candidate Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
step up coordination with countries applying for EU membership in
order to enhance "multilateral cooperation" in their trade policy,
senior EU officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an EU trade conference here, EU Vice-President Leon
Brittan stressed that an "outward look" was needed to achieve a
coordinated trade policy in the process of EU's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Brittan told the meeting, which was also attended by trade
ministers of all 12 candidate states, the EU had already embodied
a powerful voice in the global trading system and EU's enlargement
will reinforce this position.
</P>
<P>
An enlarged EU will have more than 540 million citizens, a
gross domestic product of around 7.4 trillion ECU, and a share of
over 20 percent of world trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that EU senior officials have met
ministers of all candidate countries to discuss the impact of
enlargement on world trade.
</P>
<P>
Discussions were focused at the meeting on future developments
in the multilateral system, including further trade
liberalization, the role of regional trading agreements, trade and
investment, and trade and competition issues.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the meeting, EU commissioner Hans Van den Broek
said that preparing for accession means taking on the EU
community's trade policy commitments.
</P>
<P>
The EU can not afford to neglect the links between enlargement
and the union's future role in the global economy, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the enlargement process is taking place at a time
when the multilateral trading system is confronting a number of
challenges, he said, "Where issues affect us all, we need to use
opportunities -- such as this one today -- to exchange views and
information on multilateral issues."
</P>
<P>
Enlargement is an outward looking exercise, which will lead to
intensification of economic relations between the union and its
new neighbors, as well as an enhancement of the union's role in
world trade, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Unions Active in Guarding Workers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade unions at all
levels have played an active role in safeguarding the democratic
rights and interests as well as helping poor workers and factory
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
This was remarked by Zhang Dinghua, vice president of the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions at today's opening of the
Thirteenth National Congress of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
He said that to protect workers' rights and interests mainly
relies on the setting-up of the workers' representative system in
enterprises, firmly implementing the Law of Labor, carrying out
the Warmth-Sending Program for the layoffs, and establishing
massive grass-root trade union bodies.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the workers' representative system has been adopted
by 320,000 enterprises and institutions, which have conducted
democratic assessments on 600,000 leaders of these units.
</P>
<P>
So far, 60 million employees have signed labor contracts with
240,000 enterprises under the Law of Labor, while 290,000 units
have set up their own regulatory committee on labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the federation has been involved in
drafting more than 100 state laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang emphasized that the Warmth-Sending Program is playing a
big role in helping maintain the country's unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions have been formed in some 150,000 foreign-funded
firms to help the employees guard their own rights, said the union
leader, adding that the unions have to make greater efforts to
protect the rights and interests of workers.

</P>
<P>
The approval was given at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime

Five percent tax on the bills of telex, fax, telephone and
E-mail;
</P>
<P>
Two percent tax on the interest or profit from saving
certificates;
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Thai Banks Rule Out Joint Ventures with Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Farmers Bank and Siam
City Bank have ruled out a plan to form a joint venture
respectively with Myanmar, citing lack of transparency in the
country's foreign exchange system.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank's first executive vice-president Siripongs
Kalayanarooj said Monday that the bank has canceled a memorandum
of understanding to set up a bank in Myanmar, as there is so far
no transparency in exchange rate of Myanmar's local currency.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that currently the Myanmar currency is traded
at four Myanmar kyat against one Thai baht on the black market,
while the official rate is at one kyat against four baht. This
attracts growing black markets resulting in uncertainty in
investment.
</P>
<P>
Siripongs said another major reason was that the bank has no
plan for any new investment abroad for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Thai Farmers Bank had
closed down many branches with poor performance abroad to reduce
costs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Siam City Bank executive said the bank has also
canceled a memorandum of understanding to form a joint venture
with May Flower Bank of Burma, citing the same reason as the Thai
Farmers Bank.

WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives is not likely to begin hearings
in its impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton until late
November, USA Today said in its Monday edition.
</P>
<P>
Still, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde believed he
could complete the investigation by the end of the year, the
report quoted Republican congressional sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The House authorized the impeachment inquiry earlier this
month. Congressional aides said that Hyde hoped to convene public
hearings soon after the November 3 elections, perhaps within a
week.
</P>
<P>
The first important meeting between lawyers from the White
House and the committee is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Republicans hope the White House will formally acknowledge the
accuracy of the grand jury testimony of former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky so she won't have to be called as a witness, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Democrats want to hear about the Republicans' "plans
and procedures," said Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' chief investigative counsel to the
committee, said that there are only five significant witnesses,
Clinton and Lewinsky among them, and that the panel should be able
to finish by the end of the year, the report said.

forcefully by the Yemeni government, are available. But each
plane arriving from Yemen brings in at least 30 deportees on each
flight which is three times a week, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The pouring in of refugees at Ballidogle airport has increased
in particular after the local authorities of Somaliland and
Puntland of northwestern and northeastern regions of Somalia had
rejected the forceful repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
A chief security officer of Ballidogle airport has expressed
concern over the humanitarian situation of the refugees whom many
of them at the airport do not even know where to go to.
</P>
<P>
Abdukarim Mohamud Mohamed, the officer in charge of the
security at the airport, has characterized the deportation as
"intolerable and inhumane", calling on the concerned parties to
look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Osman Mohamed Abukar, 32, and Ms. Faduma Muhyadin, 25,
have been among a group of refugees who had spent more than a
week at the airport knowing nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
The controversy of the Somalis being repatriated from abroad
has recently brought about the detention of a Djiboutian pilot
together with his plane after bringing in 15 Somali refugees from
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Despite the claim of the pilot that he obtained permission to
bring in the refugees, he had to pay 3,000 U.S. Dollars before
being released together with his plane three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are arriving here in southern Somalia at a time
when the international aid agencies are yet to bring back their
expatriates after they pulled out since 10 international red
cross aid workers were kidnaped by gunmen in north Mogadishu in
mid April.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Closer Trade Ties with Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Commerce Minister Pravit
Ratanapien has urged Thai investors to cash in on the opportunity
to forge closer ties with Laos which has been given a generalized
system of preference (GSP) on garment by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Pravit was quoted by the Thai News Agency as suggesting that
Thai investors step up building credibility to Laotian
counterparts, as the EU has allowed Laos to import not over 70
percent of raw materials such as textile and fabrics from other
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
He said Laos' garment production capacity increases by about
30-40 percent a year. Laos now imports raw materials largely from
Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand has better chance than other countries to increase
the export of raw materials to Laos, given its better quality
textile and fabrics," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the main problem at present is that letters of credit
held by Laotian importers are unable to place as guarantee to Thai
exporters. Only cash guarantee is allowed.
</P>
<P>
Pongsak Assakul, president of the Thai Weaving Industry
Association, said that apart from GSP given by the EU, Laos is
likely to be given a most-favored-nation (MFN) privileges from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the two privileges in Laos, and relatively
low production costs particularly on labor, Thai investors should
use Laos as garment production base for export to third nations,"
he said.

of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
urged all workers across the country to contribute to the reform
and development of China's state-owned large- and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the policy of "relying on the working class
wholeheartedly" will be better carried out in the country's
political, economic and social fields by necessary political,
economic, legal, media and administrative means, which will

Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and president of the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), presided over the opening

unions which have arisen in the course of reforms, opening up and
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and

The conference will deal with several major agenda items on
October 24, the final day, including electing new top leadership
of the Chinese trade unions -- the 13th ACFTU Executive Committee
-- examining and approving the work report submitted by the 12th
ACFTU Executive Committee, and revising the Constitution of
Chinese Trade Unions.

<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- As the world marks the 50th
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, a group of Chinese experts said they have made rapid
progress in studying the theory and practice of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"China plays an instinctive role in the course of promoting
human rights in the world. And China blazes its own trails for
protecting human rights," Li Yunlong, an associate professor with
the Human Rights Studies Center of the Chinese Communist Party's
Central Party School, said in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"China highly values state sovereignty which is the important
ingredient of the human rights," said Li, who has specialized in
the field for many years.
</P>
<P>
As the most important and inseparable part of overall human
rights, state sovereignty has been listed at the top of the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have learned from their bitter history that all
basic human rights must depend on state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Li stressed the importance of mankind's right
to subsistence, which is the prerequisite of the other rights.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people cherish this right very much, and
they are still faced with challenges in this area," he said.

Although the Chinese government has made great achievements in
improving the people's living standard, more than 50 million
Chinese still live in poverty without sufficient food or clothing.
</P>
<P>
Different traditions bring about different notions of human
rights. European countries emphasize individual rights while the
Chinese people value collective human rights and family
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Shukong, member of the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, said, "At present,
the world urgently needs the realization of the development rights
of human beings."
</P>
<P>
The development right is the necessary basis for civil and
political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Development and social stability support each other in any
country," Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Any nation should take social and economic development,
especially sustainable development, as a priority, he said.

"However," he said, "many countries are making light of the

<HEADLINE> Angolan Deputy Chief of General Staff Dies in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Deputy Chief of the
General Staff Arlindo Chenda Issac Pena "Ben Ben" died in South
Africa Monday at the age of 43, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a member of the Unitas Hospital in suburban
Pretoria as saying that Ben Ben died of cerebral malaria early
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Pena felt unwell and was sent to a
hospital in Angolan capital Luanda last Wednesday. But because
his condition turned worse, Pena was sent to South Africa for
treatment last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pena was the son of Judite Malheiro, the elder sister of the
Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 13, he joined the struggle for the independence
of his country under the banner of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi, its
president. In 1975, together with some youths, he was sent to
Europe for training and in 1984 the young guerrilla commander
became a general in the opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
Pena or Ben Ben had been UNITA's Chief of the General Staff
before joining a government of national unity and reconciliation
in line with the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed by the two warring
sides in 1994. He was appointed deputy chief of an integrated
army.
</P>
<P>
Pena commanded UNITA forces for most of the 19-year civil war
against Luanda, which the Lusaka accord was supposed to end. He
was a key negotiator in Angola's now troubled peace process, a
popular guerrilla leader and trusted nephew of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
He became a member of the UNITA Renovation Committee set up in
September this year, a breakaway group which calls on all UNITA
members to stick to the peace process and dismiss Savimbi from
the leadership.
</P>
<P>
Along with other UNITA generals, Ben Ben issued a statement on
September 15, urging UNITA troops to surrender to the Angolan
government for the sake of peace in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos last month disbanded
the national unity government and expelled UNITA members of
parliament, but kept the integrated army intact.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, UNITA cried foul over Pena's death, alleging
he had been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said a full post mortem would be carried
out to determine the cause of his death.

<HEADLINE> Talks with Pakistan "Sincere Beginning": Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The recent foreign secretary
level talks between India and Pakistan were a "sincere beginning"
to solve their outstanding problems including the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by two Indian journalists here in a program of
the Pakistani Television, reported the official Associated Press
of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
Ms. Barkha Dutt, correspondent of Star News, and K.
Subrahmanyam of Deccan Herald, who were here covering recent
Pak-India foreign secretary level talks that ended Sunday
afternoon, said the decision of both governments to continue the
dialogue to resolve their outstanding issues was a "breakthrough",
the APP said.
</P>
<P>
Dutt said the people of India were giving importance to
dialogue between India and Pakistan and most of the Indians want
to improve relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
She said that it was not possible to resolve Kashmir issue in
four hours of discussion between the two countries which is a
lingering dispute between the two countries for 50 years, adding
both foreign secretaries said that one should not expect
"miracles" from these talks.
</P>
<P>
Subrahmanyam said one can look at these talks in two ways.
"Problems are so complicated that even if both sides are very
sincere it cannot be solved overnight," he said. "It takes time."
</P>
<P>
He said that on the other hand one could make a meaningful
beginning to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that there has been a sincere beginning after 50 years
and this time both sides appear to be sincere and are aware of the
complexity of the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If they are really sincere and make a good beginning, then
nothing can stop them from carrying it forward," Subrahmanyam
added.
</P>
<P>
"I think that both sides have made a good beginning and have
agreed to carry the talks further and in this way it is a positive
dialogue", he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the people of India are fed up with tensions with
Pakistan and want good relations with Pakistan. He called for
better interaction between the peoples of the two countries for a
better understanding.

</P>
<P>
Hu urged Party committees at all levels to take necessary

<P>
"Workers at non-state-owned enterprises should also be
protected from being violated in terms of legal rights and

He also asked governments at different levels to fully support
the work of trade unions, such as heeding the opinions of trade
unions and workers when formulating key reform policies and laws
which may affect the immediate interests of workers.
</P>
<P>
China has 147 million workers in urban areas, almost half of

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Returning Home, UNHCR Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand refugees and
displaced persons in Kosovo have returned home since the fighting
ended a week ago, an official with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A few thousand displaced people have returned, but the
majority are still living in temporary shelters or in the open,"
said Laura Boldrini, press officer for the Pristina office of
UNHCR, during a Xinhua interview.
</P>
<P>
A deal was reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke last Tuesday that
averted the threat of air strikes by NATO and provided conditions
for thousands of refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
Boldrini said it was hard to provide an exact figure at the
moment since people were still moving around and information has
to be compiled.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, nearly 300,000 people have been driven out
of their homes. About two-thirds remained in Kosovo and one third
moved to other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is improving, but for those who are still living
out in the open, it gets more serious as winter approaches," she
said, adding that many of the refugees were tired and exhausted
due to constantly being on the move in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Boldrini urged the conflicting sides in Kosovo to comply with
the agreement reached last week so that the refugees and
displaced persons can end their plight and return home.
</P>
<P>
Until last week, Serb forces were still fighting with the
Kosovo Liberation Army which is demanding full independence for
Kosovo where 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Boldrini said some refugees are scared to return home. They
fear new shelling or fighting, so it is important for both
sides to provide them with the confidence and security to return.
</P>
<P>
Although the fighting has been going on for seven months, the
UNHCR aid work has never stopped. They have managed to provide
food, clothing, blankets, medicine, hygienic items, heating oil
and shelters to many displaced people in the areas.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was reached a week ago, UNHCR -- which has
offices in four cities in Kosovo -- and other international aid
agencies launched a new round of massive relief efforts to help
those who are in dire need, Boldrini said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are fewer obstructions these days in sending
convoys to different places, and relief work is carried out
without interference, she said.
</P>
<P>
Boldrini also said the UNHCR needs 17 million U.S. dollars to
provide Kosovo refugees and displaced persons with food,
logistical assistance and other relief items. She appealed to the
international community to donate as much as it could to save the
lives of thousands of Kosovo refugees.

<HEADLINE> S'pore, German Airlines Cooperate in Indonesian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Airlines (SIA) and
Lufthansa have established cooperation to work in the Indonesian
market along with Singapore, Australia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation which is based on a 'code-sharing' system is
expected to give value-added benefit for the airline passengers as
they will get special discounts, more convenient transits, smooth
luggage handling, connecting more than 60 cities in Europe," SIA
General Manager Vijendran Alfreds said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here Monday, Alfreds said the cooperation
enables passengers from Jakarta to go to Germany or 60 cities in
Europe with only 510 U.S. dollars (return).
</P>
<P>
They can fly to Europe every day as Lufthansa will fly every
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and SIA every Wednesday,
Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, Lufthansa's passengers from Europe can
continue their trip to Australian cities like Melbourne, Brisbane,
Sydney, Perth and Adelaide using SIA via Singapore since Lufthansa
stopped its flights to Australia three years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, SIA would fly the passengers to 11 cities in
Germany via Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Munich, Stuttgart, Koln, Bonn,
Nuremberg, Leipzig, Bremen, Hannover and Dresden every day with
transit in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, SIA would fly every day to Brussels and Geneva
and four times a week to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines have been operating their cooperation since
November last year after they paved the way for the cooperation in
September 1989 when the two airlines started cargo services
between Singapore and Frankfurt.

<HEADLINE> OAU's Focus on Internally Displaced People in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Monday called for attention, protection and
assistance to the internally displaced population in Africa.
</P>
<P>
OAU Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Daniel
Antonio made the call when he opened a two-day workshop on the
internal displacement in Africa at the United Nations Conference
Center here.
</P>
<P>
Antonio noted that Africa has an estimated population of 20
million displaced people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "this issue of displaced persons pose
great problems to the countries concerned since there is no
organization which is directly assigned to deal with this
vulnerable group."
</P>
<P>
The internally displaced persons live in very miserable
conditions, the OAU official said, adding that "in some cases,
the conditions of such displaced persons are worse than those of
refugees as they do not receive the same attention from the
international community."
</P>
<P>
Antonio stated that "the OAU wishes to renew its appreciation
for the adoption of the Guiding Principles which represent a very
important step in the efforts aiming at resolving the problem of
internally displaced persons and providing assistance and
protection to them."
</P>
<P>
"Also, the OAU stands ready to associate itself to the efforts
to be deployed to give wide dissemination to the principles, so
as to increase international awareness of the needs and rights of
internally displaced persons and of the legal standards pertinent
to their needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Francis M. Deng,
Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General on Internally
Displaced Persons, pointed out that the problem of internal
displacement is one of the most challenging problems facing the
international community today.
</P>
<P>
"Although the problem is truly global, Africa, with an
estimated internally displaced population of 20 million, is by
far the worst affected region," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 African countries are faced with serious problems
of internally displaced persons. The population of internally
displaced persons is more than double that of the refugees who
fled their original countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop is attended by representatives from
international organizations, regional bodies, non-governmental
organizations and research institutions engaged with the
internationally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
The three objectives of the workshop are:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, to promote the application in Africa of the Guilding
Principles on internal displacement, which were presented to the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights this year;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to explore the role of regional and sub-regional
organizations in dealing with internal displacement;
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, to formulate conclusions and recommendations on
internal displacement in Africa to submit to the OAU Ministerial
Meeting on Refugees, Returnees and Displaced persons, to be held
in Khartoum, Sudan in December 1998.

technology and other new developments.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to continue to enhance teachers and
students' access to IT and connectivity to the Internet and
provide diversity and flexibility for schools in the development

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Report on King's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh has denied a Israeli media report that King Hussein was
"terminally ill" and not likely to resume his full duties as head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Terming the report carried by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth
Aharonot as "untrue," Tarawneh said he was "assured and very
optimistic" about the king's health, the official news agency
Petra reported late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh conceded that the latest stage of chemotherapy for the
king's lymphatic cancer was delayed. But he said it was just for
medical reasons because the doctors wanted to ensure that the king
was "totally free (of cancer after the treatment)" and "will not
be more vulnerable or subject to relapse in a short period of
time."
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh visited the king 10 days ago at the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, Minnesota, where the king has been hospitalized since
July 14,
</P>
<P>
The Israeli newspaper said the king`s illness could lead to
political disturbances in the region, and the kingdom's new
leadership might be unable to deal with the difficulties that
ensue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin also rejected the report, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 62, has been staying in the U.S. clinic for three
months for his non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, which can be cured
by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
He has planned to receive chemotherapy intravenously once
every 20 days over a period between four to five months in six
stages. Four stages have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 46 years on the throne, is the longest-reigning ruler
in the Middle East. Crown Prince Hassan, his brother, is his legal
successor.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Breaks Through 8,000 Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rupiah broke through
the 8,000 level, closing at 7,870/7,970 against the U.S. dollar at
the Jakarta inter-bank spot market Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah gave an impressive performance last week, and closed
at 8,000/8,100 to the U.S. dollar last Friday compared to
9,250/9,350 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency is now trading below the government and
International Monetary Fund's year-end target of 10,000 rupiah per
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Money market analyst Farial Anwar attributed the gains to
internal factors, saying external factors are no longer dominant
since the rupiah has strengthened since early September from
10,500 to the current 7,870.
</P>
<P>
Dominant factors included a sharp fall in corporate as well as
government demand for U.S. dollars because of foreign debt
rescheduling and slowing imports.
</P>
<P>
"Routine supply by the central bank, amounting to between 10
million and 15 million U.S. dollars daily also helped support the
currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the rise should be "steady but firm".
</P>
<P>
A forex analyst with a regional bank said the impact of the
U.S. rate cut as well as strong regional sentiment also buoyed the
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the expected slowing inflation and interest rate
will also play a major role in the market. But I think it is the
external factors that will move the market," he added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Growth Best in Poorest States: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's manufacturing growth
is the highest among the 28 least developed countries (LDC) in
the world, a recent United Nations report has said.
</P>
<P>
The achievement was contained in the 1998 Least Developed
Countries Report issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development, said the Monday published East African weekly,
which is based in Nairobi but is printed in Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Despite various problems the country faces, Uganda is one of
the few poor developing countries which have proved successful in
diversifying away from an almost total reliance on primary
commodities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the report showed that the manufacturing growth in
Uganda has risen from 15.1 percent in 1994 to 19.7 in 1996.
Manufacturing now makes up over eight percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP), double that for 1980.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the few African countries with the highest
levels of investment, the report said, adding that the increase
in investment is due to the growing of manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
It warned the countries that diversification remains vital if
these countries are to continue with their economic revival and
that they may soon be affected by the chronic economic crisis in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report encourages poor countries to continue to
reintegrate their economies into the world economy. In 1996, the
output of the LDCs represented less than one percent of world GDP
and their export share was 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Smoking Bill Proposed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A new version of the
proposed anti-tobacco law in South Africa, the third this month,
has been proposed in parliament, national daily the Citizen
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill,
smokers will not be allowed to nip into toilets or stairwells for
a quick puff, as smoking will be banned in any "common area" at
any palace of employment or any public place.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the earlier versions, the latest bill places the
responsibility on local authorities to enforce the national ban
on smoking in public places and on tobacco advertizing.
</P>
<P>
This is the first version which places a total ban on smoking
in any public place anywhere in South Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although the new bill has been approved by the National
Council of Provinces (NCOP), the National Assembly's Portfolio
Committee on Health will hold its public hearings on the bill in
Cape Town Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 90 organizations and individuals, including
representatives of the tobacco and advertizing industries,
medical bodies and Health Non-Governmental Organizations, are
scheduled to give evidence to the portfolio committee.
</P>
<P>
The South African Health Department has been making great
efforts for years to impose an effective law to guard against
smoking harm in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimated that over the next 27
years, about 500 million people worldwide would die of
tobacco-related disease.

</P>
<P>
The report, titled as 1998/99 World Development Report, showed
that Uganda's figure is higher than that for Kenya (23 percent)
and lower than that for Tanzania and Rwanda (29 percent).
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of children under five in Uganda stands at
141 deaths per 1,000 children and the country's infant mortality
rate is 99 deaths per 1,000 live births, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report called for more government investment in the health
sector. Between 1990 to 1995, the Ugandan government's
expenditure on health was a meager 1.6 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Some 55 percent and 34 percent of its population had access to
sanitation and safe water respectively, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- August 1998 saw a lower
turnover in all retail sales and catering trade in Singapore over
a year ago, according to a press release Monday by the Department
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Compared with August 1997, the overall retail sales index was

million Singapore dollars (1,000 million U.S. dollars) compared
with 1,862 million Singapore dollars (1,090 million U.S. dollars)
in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles led the declines registering a 19.9 percent drop
in sales in August 1998 following a rise of 41.4 percent in July
1998.
</P>
<P>

percent.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. President Hails China's World Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President George
Bush said here today that China is a "key factor" in building
peace in the world, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Like many others, I am encouraged by the growing role of China
as a leader," he told a luncheon sponsored by Chinese's People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs and the John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Company of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that China has shown great responsibility in
international affairs, which was demonstrated by its adherence to
the policy of non-devaluation of the Chinese yuan, and signing of the
International Covenant for Civil Rights and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Internationally, China has earned and is earning high marks
for resisting pressure to devalue its currency," he said. "As your
economy is so strong and growing fast, devaluation of the currency
here would cause new despair throughout the ASEAN nations."
</P>
<P>
He added that the signing of the human rights covenant nearly
two weeks ago made the Chinese government give its citizens more
political rights, as it "joined 140 other nations who share this
commitment to fundamental human rights."
</P>
<P>
The former president criticized some in the United States and
other countries for ignoring the efforts and achievements China
has made in the reform of its political structure and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"These people don't appreciate the fact that there are far more
liberties in China today than when we signed the Shanghai
Communique over 20 years ago," he said. He added that these people
should come to visit China and see China's reality with their own
eyes.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-U.S. relations, Bush said he was very glad to see
President Bill Clinton visit China this summer as an effort
to consolidate important bilateral ties. The visit offered a
good opportunity for the leaders and the peoples of the two
countries to deepen mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that effective measures will be found to
solve the trade imbalance between the two countries, because many
people in the United States are deeply concerned about this
problem.
</P>
<P>
Bush also spoke highly of the recent meeting between Wang
Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan
Straits, and Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits
Exchange Foundation. He said that the progress of the meeting and
the peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue would have "a positive
impact across the entire world."

<HEADLINE> No Foreign Pressure to Deter Myanmar's Chosen Path: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- No amount of pressure from the
United Kingdom, the European Union or the United Nations will
deter Myanmar from its chosen path, an official Information Sheet
quoted a government statement as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar today is seeking its own equilibrium in order to
propel it into the ranks of the developed countries in the
shortest possible period," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"If the British Government decides to impose sanctions on
Myanmar, it will merely be following down the infamous path laid
down by the Americans," it warned, pointing out that "sanctions
are not only blunt but immoral, invariably hurting the poorest
segment of the population, not least the infants, the sick and
the elderly among them."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in May 1997,
banning new investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement recalled that "the people of Myanmar who for
decades suffered under the yoke of colonialism have a long memory
with distaste of the abhorrent British policy of divide and rule,"
and said that Myanmar is resolved never again to allow history to
repeat itself and it will not brook any fresh attempt to drive a
wedge between them.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed, "Myanmar does not seek the cold
isolation. Myanmar seeks the warmth of international cooperation
but one without strings. At the very least, we must be given the
opportunity to fashion our own destiny in our way. That is our
inalienable right."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the National League for Democracy (NLD), a major
opposition political party in the country, the statement said,
"The government has not been unwilling to extend the olive branch
to the NLD. It is the NLD that has spurned the government's offer
to meet and it is Aung San Suu Kyi who seeks to confront the
authorities at every turn."
</P>
<P>
The NLD repeatedly called for a dialogue, including Aung San
Suu Kyi's presence, with the government. However, the government's
several offers for the move excluded Aung San Suu Kyi.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba castigates debt owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- president Frederick Chiluba has
strongly criticized foreign debt owners for not canceling
Zambia's debt, which he said has choked the economy of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He hurled the criticism at the debt owners at its 34th
independence anniversary thanksgiving and re-dedication worship
service here Sunday, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying that Zambia and other African
countries have been turned into slaves because of the substantial
amounts owed to donors in external debts.
</P>
<P>
It is not possible for Zambia or any other African country to
repay the money which they have borrowed because the sums are too
colossal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the mortality rate has increased and the
government is unable to implement development projects because of
the need to service the debts every month.
</P>
<P>
"External debt is the worst form of slavery ever inflicted on
Zambia. How can we claim to have our own destiny when all our
decisions are dependent on the people who give us money?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged the donor countries to stop claiming they are
civilized when they have left people to die of poverty because of
hunger.
</P>
<P>
"I wish people knew how much we are paying in form of debts
every day. We are spending a lot of money to pay people who are
already rich," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that poverty, lack of drugs and falling
standards in education will continue for as long as Zambia
continued to be indebted.
</P>
<P>
He praised the church for joining the fight for the
cancellation of Zambia's debt.
</P>
<P>
Church representatives from Zambia recently traveled to
Britain to lobby the G7 countries to cancel debts for the Third
World Countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman Meets Israeli Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
today he hopes China and Israel will enhance exchanges
in legal matters in order to promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a meeting with Aharon Barak, president of
the Supreme Court of Israel, and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, China and Israel have common ground in the legal
field despite different social systems.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the guests on the development of China's democracy
and legal system, and said that China is establishing a legal
system in conformity with its national conditions, though the
Chinese legislative sector still has responsibility for meeting
the needs of the socialist market economic system.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that China and Israel have supreme courts with
identical functions, although the legal systems are different, and
he hopes the courts and judges of the two countries will increase
exchanges and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Two Grenades Explode, Injuring 64 Israelis  (by Qi Deliang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An assailant threw two hand
grenades into the central bus station in the south city of
Beersheba Monday morning, injuring 64 people, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, President Ezer Weizman went to
Beersheba to visit the injured people, two of them in serious
conditions.
</P>
<P>
This was a sad incident for the Israelis, but it is not
necessary to stop the Wye Plantation peace talks between Israelis
and Palestinians because of this incident, Weizman told the
injured at Beersheba's Sorokka Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hospital said most of the injured were released after
receiving treatment at the Hospital, and 21 remained hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel condemned the criminal
act, saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "was sad and
concerned" after being informed about this incident.
</P>
<P>
This incident "underscores out concerns about the security
issues and peace talks in Washington now, basically, have not
succeeded because the Palestinians are dragging their feet in
fighting terrorism," Fogel said shortly after the incident.
</P>
<P>
At Wye Plantation outside Washington, Netanyahu, who is there
holding summit talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, convened his inner cabinet meeting
Monday to discuss the impact of the incident on the peace
process, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The inner security cabinet consists of Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told them that the incident justified Israel's
demands that Arafat must fight terrorism, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
There will be no agreement unless the Palestinian side fights
terrorism, but the Israeli side has no plan to stop the Wye
Plantation summit, Netanyahu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his delegation issued a statement after being
informed of the incident, sharply condemning the act, the radio
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opposition Labor Party also criticized the act, but
said this kind of incident can't be allowed to disrupt the
already troubled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at the morning rush hours. Beersheba is
Israel's southern desert city with most of its residents being
immigrants from the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The assailant was overpowered by passers-by and handed over to
police. Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani confirmed that
the attacker was a Palestinian coming from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The man, already arrested by Israeli police, has reportedly
confessed and said he acted on his own. But Israeli police has
sent out helicopters to scour nearby areas of Beersheba amid
reports that a car was seen speeding away from the bus station
after the two explosions with only second apart.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani telephoned Netanyahu to update him on the development
of incident and encouraged him to stay for the peace talks in the
U.S., Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as the Middle East peace talks at Wye
Plantation were hanging in the balance. A key issue on the agenda
is Israel's demand that the Palestinians do more to fight
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Mutineers to Be Prosecuted: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government
has vowed to prosecute 30 soldiers who were allegedly involved in
a coup against Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and the current
military leadership, a South African newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Business Day quoted Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom Thabane
as saying lately that his government would Monday formally
request the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
assist in expediting the court hearings process of the mutineers,
which would be conducted in line with the Lesotho Defense Act.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the kingdom's defense act, any person found to
have been involved in mutiny or have intended to joint it, could
be charged with treason, punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
Junior Lesotho soldiers launched a mutiny in early September,
accusing Lesotho Defense Force chief Makhule Mosaken and 28 other
senior army officers of being puppets of the ruling Leostho
Congress for Democracy (LCD). Mosaken and the senior officers
were forced to resign at gun point.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho army chief Tank Mothae said last week that an
investigation into the alleged involvement of those arrested had
been launched, but he said it was too early to say what charges
they would face.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties have asked the leaders of South
Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe to intervene following
the arrest of 30 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Says He Won't Be Roadblock to Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Monday denied he would be a roadblock to the republic issue
and said he expected up to four of his senior colleagues to
campaign in favor of the change to the republic.
</P>
<P>
Howard, a monarchist, said the republic was not the most
important political issue facing Australia, although it would be
"a fascinating exercise in participatory democracy".
</P>
<P>
"It's not the most important issue on the political horizon but
it does have to be dealt with," he told Adelaide radio 5DN.
</P>
<P>
Howard accused the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) of
trying to verbal him into supporting the shift to the republic at
the referendum on the issue to be held before 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a column published in The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper
Monday, ARM chairman Malcolm Turnbull said he expected John Howard
to reluctantly embrace an unenthusiastic form of republicanism at
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Howard said, "He is trying to verbal me into becoming a
republican, that is not going to happen. I would expect some of my
senior colleagues in the government will campaign yes and some the
no case."
</P>
<P>
"That is their right, as it is the right of people to campaign
for the yes case," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will stay aloof from the day-to-day campaigning but people
will know what my view is, but it's not a party issue," Howard
added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am not going to advocate something I don't believe
in but I am certainly not going to be a roadblock to a republic -
I won't be that."
</P>
<P>
Howard told the radio, if Australians voted for a republic, he
would provide the mechanism to facilitate the change "while at the
same time reserving my right as an Australian citizen, as well as
a prime minister, to express a personal point of view".

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Communist Party Chief On National Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Communist Party of
Vietnam (CPV) Le Kha Phieu has called for greater efforts by the
party and people to accelerate the current national renovation
process and industrialize agriculture and rural development,
according to official media here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CPV general secretary made his call in a speech to close a
five-day meeting (phase 1) of the Sixth Plenum of the CPV last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed the implementation of socio-economic
targets set for 1998, defined major development goals and
orientations, and devised solutions to obtain targets for next
year.
</P>
<P>
Phieu said despite severe difficulty and challenges caused by
the current financial-monetary turmoil in Southeast Asia and
natural disasters, Vietnam has striven and worked creatively to
obtain success.
</P>
<P>
The party leader noted there remains great potential in labor
and intellectual capacity, relatively large idle capital and
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The party leader pointed to "major shortcomings and mistakes in
leadership and management in all branches of activities at all
levels".
</P>
<P>
He said that "party members have not fully grasped the concept
of, and reached high consensus about, liberation of the production
force, mobilization of internal strength, and the important role
of agriculture and rural development in the national
industrialization and modernization process."
</P>
<P>
The party leader said that "bureaucracy was seen in the
administration and management of many branches and at different
levels while inspection and supervision activities were not
strictly carried out."
</P>
<P>
"The enactment of regulations and disciplines was of low
efficiency while corruption, wastefulness, and other negative
phenomena were still common," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to unpredictable developments of the socio-economic
situation in 1999, Phieu said, the current regional
monetary-financial crisis may turn into a political-economic
crisis rendering more severe widespread impacts in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In any case, we must stay active, resolved, confident,
enthusiastic and creative to overcome difficulties," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In any situation, he said, "We are determined to continue with
renovation, stepping up the cause of national industrialization
and modernization, first of all that of agriculture and rural
development."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the party's resolution to "march forward, bringing
into play the utmost efforts of the party and people to overcome
all difficulties and challenges, halting the decline in growth
rates and maintaining socio-economic stability".
</P>
<P>
The general secretary said selections should be made in order
to focus investment on promising branches, fields and products,
and create necessary prerequisites for further development when
possible.
</P>
<P>
Policies and mechanism should be really open, and obstacles be
removed in time to liberate the production force and mobilize to
the utmost internal strength, and at the same time attract and
effectively utilize foreign investment, Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
The party leader also called for better awareness of the
important role of agriculture and rural development which involve
the majority of the population, labor force and land, a great
source of strength and advantage of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said more investment should be concentrated on practical
projects, and a large percentage of mobilized capital is needed to
speed up industrialization and modernization of agriculture and
rural areas, and alleviate poverty, thus strengthening stability
and sustainable development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Phieu said policies should be updated, and obstacles removed to
truly liberate production force in rural area, and mobilize all
sources of strength for a comprehensive and sustainable
development.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Streamline Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is moving toward
setting up a national council to monitor and harmonize standards
of higher education in the country.
</P>
<P>
This move comes amid growing concern about educational
standards following the proliferation of private universities and
tertiary institutions to cater for those who fail to be enrolled
in public universities, the Nairobi-based East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the Ugandan Ministry of Education and
Sports said that most private universities and colleges are short
of room for expansion and accommodation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Given this situation, the Ugandan government has decided to
establish a national council responsible for licensing
universities and other tertiary institutions. The bill for the
establishment of the council is to be tabled in parliament soon,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming council is to address academic programs,
examination schedules, management tiers, sources of funding, as
well as the background and objectives of the founders of the
various institutions.
</P>
<P>
It will also inspect the physical facilities of private
universities and revoke the charter of any which fails to meet
required standards.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20,000 Ugandan students complete university
entrance examinations each year. But only 10 to 15 percent of
them can go further to public universities under government
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
To cater for those who qualify but fail to go to university,
Ugandan universities began to take in private students. Makerere
University planned to enroll some 8,000 private students this
year, but a much smaller number of private students were
registered due to the high cost the university demanded.
</P>
<P>
With this large number of dropouts in mind, private
universities began to mushroom and call for students to be
educated in the relatively poorly-equipped institutions.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt to Change Economic Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government would make carefully-considered adjustments to its
macro-economic Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR)
strategy, a South African minister has said.
</P>
<P>
The policy-making National Executive Committee (NEC) of the
ruling African National Congress had agreed to fine-tune the
ambitious policy in view of the fact that the objectives of GEAR
has not been met, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a media conference, Erwin emphasized that policies would
not be changed in a manner that altered GEAR's structural
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The NEC agreed that detailed work needed to be done to
address the economic crisis, while retaining the coherence and
strength of our policies," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African government would do everything in
its power to maintain the current levels of spending on
socio-economic upliftment.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do anything that would send the inflation
rate sky-rocketing, or the exchange rate plummeting... We want to
find ways of using government money more efficiently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said that South Africa had to make social adjustments
because of the international economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said proposals were expected to emerge on the government's
job summit on October 30.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to discuss and agree upon approximately 40 projects
aimed at providing short-to-medium-term measures for job creation
while structural changes are implemented in the economy," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The GEAR, which was announced by government in June 1996, was
aimed at securing fast economic growth, creating jobs for the
poor and providing basic health care and education for the whole
society.

<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 4.4 points to 2,515.8,
overlooking a rate cut inspired rise on Wall Street last Friday
and a rally in Japanese stocks Monday.
</P>
<P>

weekly rise in 14 years and we were up one day, Tokyo was having
huge gains and we were doing nothing," Craig Sharpe from Hartley
Poynton said.
</P>
<P>
"It just looks like people are still a bit undecided about our
markets. We've got really low volume, people are just prepared to
wait," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was just 225.19 million shares traded at a value of
728.68 million Australian dollars (462.71 million U.S. dollars),

</P>
<P>
The all industrials index edged up 7.5 points to 4,368.1 with
banking stocks moving roughly in line with the broader trend as
opinions remained divided on when any local interest rate cut
would be announced.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 24 cents as its chief executive
Don Argus argued against lowering rates until the U.S. made a
further cut.
</P>
<P>
Of the other major banks, ANZ shed a cent, while Commonwealth
rose 25.5 cents and Westpac added 15.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications concern Telstra climbed eight cents after it
was sold down last week ahead of next month's due date for second
payment on the installment receipts.
</P>
<P>
Retailer Woolworths dropped 17 cents despite revealing first
quarter sales were up nine percent on the previous year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 500 in Nigerian Pipeline Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 inhabitants were
burnt to death at the weekend in a ferocious fire from burst oil
pipeline at Jesse village in Ethiope West Local Government area
of Delta State, local media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
One Punch reporter who visited the scene Saturday night said
that several hundred charred bodies of men, women and children
littered the area as well as jerry cans, plastic wares, cups and
metal bowls used in the illegal tapping of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that more than 1,500 people were involved in
the illegal drawing of fuel in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
When Shell Petroleum Development Company officials got to know
about the drawing of fuel by so many people, a helicopter was
deployed to the scene to warn the people on the implication of an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
However, the people tapping fuel from the cassava farms in the
area were said to have ignored the warning.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was believed to have occurred when an unknown
person struck a match to light a cigarette only to set afire the
pit where hundreds of people were still tapping fuel from the
broken pipe.
</P>
<P>
But, E.A. Akhihiero, a maintenance superintendent of the
Pipeline and Products Marketing Company, said that the fire could
have been sparked by a clash of two metals from among the
hundreds of buckets, basins and other containers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that nearly all the hospitals in the area were
now overflowing with victims while scores of the victims were
taken to hospitals in Eku and Warri.
</P>
<P>
Delta State fire servicemen's efforts to combat the inferno
were not successful because of the thick smokes which obstructed
their vision.
</P>
<P>
According to Akhihiero, it might take a day or two to
completely extinguish the fire.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the scene, Delta State Administrator Navy
Commander Walter Feghabo felt terribly bad, saying that it was
"unbelievable", and ordered a mass burial for all the bodies
burnt beyond recognition by the local government authorities.
</P>
<P>
With this development, the acute fuel supply situation in the
country, especially in the northern part, may worsen in the days
ahead as the incident might lead to the closure of the Warri
Refinery to give room for repairs.
</P>
<P>
The refinery is the only one of the four in the country that
resumed a normal supply of petroleum products late last week
following a temporary closure as a result of reported breakdown
of its power generating system.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Marine police of Macao seized
more than 97,000 pirated compact discs hidden in some
building materials which were heading for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The pirated CDs were discovered Sunday noon in a freight truck
which was loaded with 16 barrels of glue. Marine police suspected
the weight of the barrels and poked into the glue with an iron
pole, only to find that pirated CDs were concealed under the glue.
</P>
<P>
A police officer said it was the first time for Macao marine
police to detect pirated CDs to be smuggled to Hong Kong. In fact,
 Hong Kong customs police had seized 300,000 illegal CDs
transported from Macao.
</P>
<P>
The officer said police are trying to find the sites of
production lines for making pirated CDs.
</P>
<P>
Marine police in Macao cracked two major cases of pirated CD
smuggling in August and October this year, confiscating a total of

<HEADLINE> A Lot to Be Done for Peace in Afghanistan: Brahimi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi Monday said "there is still a lot to be done to end war in
Afghanistan and a lot more (to be done) to build peace" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last week's release of Iranian prisoners by the Taliban will
help defuse the tension between Tehran and the student militia but
"a lot needs to be done to end war in Afghanistan," Brahimi said
while briefing reporters about his recent mission in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
"This part of the job (securing release of Iranian prisoners)
is behind us but there is no peace in Afghanistan - there is still
a lot to be done to end the war in Afghanistan and a lot more (to
be done) to build peace in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy, who flies to Tehran on Tuesday, said, the
release of Iranian prisoners will "definitely make a difference"
in his mission to end peacefully the stand-off resulting from the
killing of Iranian personnel in Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who met with Taliban's supreme leader Mullah Mohammad
Omar in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, said he will also visit
the Central Asian neighbors of Afghanistan "in the coming few
days".
</P>
<P>
"The last two day's fighting has reminded us that Afghanistan
has been at peace only when all the communities recognize
themselves really in the political system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban and forces loyal to former Afghan military chief Ahmad
Masood have been fighting around the strategic northeastern town
of Taloqan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy hoped that the Taliban will respond to the
international community's emphasis that "a political system,
representative of all Afghan communities" is required for durable
peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who is in the region following last month's Six Plus
Two meeting in New York and on the basis of points of
understanding reached at the meeting, has been holding talks with
representatives of Afghan factions and its immediate neighbors.

(MILF) guerrillas Sunday stormed a village in Pikit, Cotabato, the
southern Philippines, killing six people and wounding 17 others,

<TEXT>

HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate for the July-September period was five
percent, the same as the June-August period, Hong Kong government
announced Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The provisional underemployment rate was 2.6 percent, the same
as the revised figure for the June-August period, according to the
Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the July-September period with the June-August
period, an increase in the unemployment rate was seen in the
construction sector but some decrease was seen in the clothing and
footwear sector.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference unveiling the latest unemployment
situation, Government Economist K Y Tang expressed satisfaction
with the "notable" stabilization in both unemployment and
underemployment rates after the sharp surge in the earlier months.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, lay-offs and wage-cuts were still reported most
recently, and the adjustment to the adversities in the labor
market was expected to continue for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph W P Wong reiterated
that the government will continue to spare no efforts in helping
the unemployed rejoin the workforce as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that a stabilizing property market,
rebounding tourism industry, and a quarter-point interest rate cut
effective from Monday, will have a positive effect on local
sentiment and hence possibly the employment situation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President to Attend APEC Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will "definitely" attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Conference (APEC) meeting to be held in Malaysia next month,
presidential Spokesman Ferdinand Barican said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular press conference, Barican made the remark
in response to early news reports that President Estrada may
boycott the APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur for the arrest of former
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested two weeks ago and would be tried for
violating the Internal Security Act of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Estrada called for "due process" and "the respect of human
rights" for the trial of Anwar. Last week, he also received
Anwar's daughter at his residence in Manila.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada said that the bilateral relations between the
two countries were not bruised since his words over Anwar's arrest
were only "personal opinions" and were not government policies.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Barican said that although there has been no
official communications received yet, President Estrada welcomes
the reported invitation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the
Malaysian government for him to visit Anwar during his trip to
Kuala Lumpur for the APEC meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
"The president will definitely attend APEC and if the occasion
arises and there are no legal obstacles, the president is
interested in seeing Mr. Ibrahim," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said that the Malaysian government has asked for postponement of
the Philippine-Malaysian border patrol exercises scheduled this
month.

<HEADLINE> International Cooperation Among Asian Countries Can </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Monday said that a social, economic and political
cooperation among Asian countries could avert conflict from
arising in the region.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other choice for Asian countries except to set up
close cooperation in their social, economic and political sectors
based on the spirit of understanding and togetherness," Habibie
said.
</P>
<P>
When receiving youths participating in the two-month
ASEAN-Japan Youth Ship Program which started October 10, Habibie
said that in the past, Asian nations frequently faced conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We should thank God however that these conflicts were solved
one by one," he said, adding that peace is vital to economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Smooth economic development promotes educational, health and
cultural development, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, these cooperations need not only be formed by the
governments of the Asian countries but by their people as well, he
said, noting that the ASEAN-Japan Youth Ship Program is an example
of such a cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that by attending the Youth Ship
Program, it is hoped that the participants could contribute a
positive synergy to the future of the relations between the ASEAN
(the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Youth Ship Program has been held annually since 1974. Each
of the nine ASEAN countries sent 32 representatives and a leader,
and Cambodia sent only three representatives.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Currency Falters Despite Rescue Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Shilling continues to
depreciate for the sixth week running despite the rescue efforts
by the Bank of Uganda, the central bank of the country, to shore
up confidence in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between Ugandan Shilling and U.S. Dollar
stood at 1,315 over the weekend following the hefty but
ineffective injections of foreign currency into the market by the
central bank, the Nairobi-based East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers said that the depreciating Shilling had
started to affect their business but they did not pass on the
increased cost to the customers.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the bank has pumped in some 36 million Dollars
into the foreign exchange market to prop up the Shilling. The
efforts, however, did not bear much fruit.
</P>
<P>
Economists here in Kampala attributed this continued
depreciation of Shilling to the shortage of hard currency caused
by shrinking exports and to the volatile situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
As a result of last year's bad weather, coffee exports, which
account for some 60 percent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings, dropped to three million bags (60 kilograms per bag)
worth 274 million Dollars in the 1997-1998 coffee year from last
year's 4.2 million bags worth 355 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The eruption of armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Uganda's alleged involvement drove many investors and
businessmen to get their money out of Uganda, leaving the local
economy to fend for itself.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Rail Toll Rises as Search Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 53 people have been
confirmed dead and 101 others injured in a train crash in northern
Egypt, as rescue teams ended their search for survivors Monday
morning, police said.
</P>
<P>
After a night-long strenuous research, the last wrecked car of
the train was hoisted by a mobile crane Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The train, which was traveling south from Egyptian northern
port city of Alexandria, derailed and rushed into a square in Kafr
el-Dawar, a town about 30 kilometers southeast of Alexandria at
5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the driver lost
control of the train when he changed tracks at high speed because
the brakes between the locomotive and the carriages were broken by
some hitchhikers on the train.
</P>
<P>
A senior railway official, Mahoud Marei, said that the driver
was speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon in Egypt for people to hitch a ride on the
roof and between the carriages of such commuter trains.
</P>
<P>
The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war
memorial in the square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Nabih Yousef Shaltout, head of health care in the local
province of Buheira, said most of the dead were bystanders in the
town, while most of the injured were passengers on the train.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic Al-Ahram daily, quoting residents of Kafr el-Dawar
who helped in the rescue work, put the casualties at well over
200, including about 100 fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian railway has suffered a series of accidents in recent
years. Three weeks ago, a driver and his assistant were killed
when their train bumped into a truck on the Alex-Cairo line.
</P>
<P>
The most deadly was in December 1995 when two trains collided
in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people and injuring 76 others.

<HEADLINE> Trade Union Official on Leadership of Working Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Dinghua, Vice-chairman of
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized the
leadership of the working class in state and social affairs today
and said that building socialism must depend on the working
class.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told the 13th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
that opened today in Beijing that the Chinese working class are
the representatives of the advanced productive forces and should
take a lead in today's economic progress and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"The erroneous idea that we will no longer depend on the
working class in building socialist market economy should be
corrected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese working class and the work of trade unions should
be directed by Deng Xiaoping Theory, which calls on trade unions
to make a greater effort to protect the rights and interests of
the Chinese workforce, he said, and trade unions of all levels
must accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and
help those money-losing large and medium-sized enterprises
extricate themselves from the predicament.
</P>
<P>
The goals and tasks for the Chinese trade unions for the next
five years include safeguarding interests and democratic rights of
the laboring classes, helping unemployed people find jobs, and
giving training to the working class to improve them in science,
culture and technology, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has nearly 590,000 trade
union organizations at the grassroots level with over 100 million
members, accounting for 91.3 percent of China's total
workforce.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Rejects Japanese Protests Over Fishing Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Monday rejected recent Japanese protests
over fishing operations by DPRK boats near disputed waters.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has been authorized by Russia to fish south of the
Kurile Islands, which is a matter between the two countries, an
official newspaper commentary said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's intervention in this matter is tantamount to "minding
other people's business," said the newspaper Rodong Sinmun.
</P>
<P>
DPRK's fishing in the waters south of Russian Kurile Islands --
specificly four islands of Kunashiri, Shikotan, Etorofu and
Habomai -- is in keeping with an agreement signed by the two
countries in 1997, which came into force on September 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Japan's "concern" over the matter, "protests" against Russia
and its refusal to allow the DPRK boats to fish in the disputed
waters are ridiculous, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The four islands, which Japan also claims sovereignty, were
occupied by the former Soviet Union army at the end of World War
II. Japan has officially lodged its protests against Russia's
authorization.

<HEADLINE> Two Grenades Explode, Injuring 47 Israelis  (by Qi Deliang, Tan Xinmu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An assailant threw two hand
grenades into the central bus station in the southern city of
Beersheba monday morning, injuring 47 people, the Prime
Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel condemned
the criminal act, saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
"was sad and concerned" after being informed about this incident.
</P>
<P>
This incident "underscores out concerns about the security
issues and peace talks in Washington now, basically, have not
succeeded because the Palestinians are dragging their feet in
fighting terrorism," Fogel said shortly after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opposition Labor Party also raped this act, but said
this kind of incident can't be allowed to disrupt the already
troubled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at the morning rush hours. Beersheba is
Israel's southern desert city with most of its residents being
immigrants from the former Soviet Union and other Eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured, two were in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The assailant was overpowered by passers-by and handed to
police. He has reportedly confessed to police, saying he acted on
his own.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani confirmed that the
attacker was a Palestinian coming from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The man, already arrested by Israeli police, said he acted
alone, but Israeli police has sent out helicopters to scour
nearby areas of Beersheba amid reports that a car has been seen
speeding away from the bus station after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani telephoned Netanyahu to update him on the development
of incident and encouraged him to stay for the peace talks in the
U.S., Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
It said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is at Wye
Plantation for the peace talks, has also been informed of the
incident. The Palestinian delegation has issued a statement
condemning the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as the Middle East peace talks was hanging in
the balance. A key issue on the agenda is Israel's demand that the
Palestinians do more to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Fogel said the injured people were sent to Beersheba's Sorokka
Hospital for treatment. Most of them suffered minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Population Tops 40 Million: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African
population should be 40.9 million, about three million more
people than indicated by the preliminary census results last
year, local daily Business Day reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics South Africa is due to make an official
announcement Tuesday about the population in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary results, the total number of
South African population was about 37.9 million, about five
million lower than previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
The latest report said that it was understood the 1996 census
mostly under-counted people in the rural areas of the Northern
Province and KwaZulu-Natal Province, as a result of
administrative and logistical problems, and that private agencies
were contracted at short notice to collect data there.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary figures suggested that South Africans had a
higher life expectancy and had experienced much more rapid
urbanization than previously thought. These findings could also
change in the final results, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Housing Reconstruction Sped Up for China's Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction work in
flood-ravaged areas in east China's Fujian Province is going
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Work on housing for more than 50,800 families was underway by
August 31, to help 95.5 percent of the families affected by the
flooding, a provincial official said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The serious flooding started in mid-June and lasted nearly two
months, causing heavy losses in the northern and central parts of
Fujian and destroying the houses of some 53,200 families.
</P>
<P>
Relief funds for housing reconstruction included 59.5 million
yuan from civil affairs departments and 34 million yuan in
donations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The flooded areas have introduced fee and tax exemptions to aid
the reconstruction work.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists in Peking Man Fossil Search (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Zheng and Chen Jie
</P>
<P>
Some entrepreneurs even offered to finance the search for the
missing bones, and Liu Dongsheng of CAS's Institute of Geology,
and Hao Yichun of China Mining University, along with a prominent
paleoanthropologist, Wu Rukang, have signed the letter.
</P>
<P>
They say in the letter, "The disappearance of the Peking Man
fossils involves people from many countries. As time went by, many
important clues may have spread scattered among common people."
</P>
<P>
Although the searching by Chinese and foreigners has never
really stopped, they say, the number of people is too limited and
they need whatever clues are available and support from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1941, some Americans attempted to transport the tops of six
skulls and other valuable fossils to a safer place when the
Japanese army invaded China, but the attempt failed and the
fossils were never recovered after they left Peking Union Medical
College. Many believe that they were taken abroad.
</P>
<P>
The scientist say that even if their efforts fail in this
attempt, they will leave behind some clues and records that may be
used for any later search.
</P>
<P>
It is not only the fossils they are looking for, they conclude,
but the conscience of human beings and a belief in scientific
development and world peace.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Create More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Monday that pump-priming the economy and
attracting foreign investments will be his administration's main
weapons in fighting unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Singapore-based CNBC Asia, Estrada said
these two strategies should address the unemployment problem which
he traced to the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I am trying my best to generate jobs for them (the Filipinos)
by attracting foreign investors to come in and of course, we are
trying to release money as soon as possible to start different
projects to pump-prime our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Estrada took one step further towards attracting
foreign investments by delivering a keynote address at the East
Asia Economic Summit in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The summit, sponsored by the World Economic Forum, was attended
by some 150 chieftains of the world's top corporations, as well as
delegates from the governments of various countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada pointed out that the Philippines will
not impose foreign exchange control and the country is more
politically and economically stable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Estrada administration has also started an all-out
drive against crimes in a bid to assure foreign investors that the
Philippines is a safe investment area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration is trying to pump-prime the
economy by concentrating government resources on agriculture and
housing.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ill effects of the currency crisis, the Department
of Labor and Employment had earlier reported that employment
posted a minimal growth of 1.2 percent during the period from
July, 1997 to July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The department said some 325,000 people were able to find jobs
during this period, making the number of employed workers to rise
to 27,856 million from 27,53 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippines' unemployment rate still stands at a
higher level of 10 percent, the department reported earlier.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Euro's Impact on Czech Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The January 1, 1999 launch of
the single European currency, the euro, will mean both
opportunities and challenges for the Czech Republic, which has
been actively bidding for entry into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Once the euro is launched, Czech banks will provide
euro-related services. They are setting up euro information
centers, holding seminars, training employees and offering
consulting service to customers.
</P>
<P>
As the country is increasingly integrated with the 15 EU
countries in economy and trade, the euro launch will definitely
have a profound impact on its economy.
</P>
<P>
The impact will be felt first and foremost in trade. The EU
has become the country's largest trade partner, replacing the
former Soviet Union, since it began switching to the system of
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in bilateral trade
between the Czech Republic and the EU. In 1997, it hit 961.8
billion korunas (about 33.16 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for
up to 61.3 percent of the country's total foreign trade. And the
figure is expected to rise further this year.
</P>
<P>
The Czech koruna, which has been pegged with German mark, will
switch to the euro after the launch. The switched pegging will
bring more benefits than harms to Czech businesses. Fewer
currencies used in foreign trade can make pricing much simpler and
account settlements much easier, thus reducing both financial
costs and exchange rate risks. A strong euro will help boost
Czech exports.
</P>
<P>
Financially, the euro launch is unlikely to have negative
impact on the deposits or debts of Czech businesses. If they have
foreign exchange accounts or deposits, there will be no
fundamental changes during the three-year transitional period.
These accounts or deposits will continue to exist in their
original currencies and be expressed in the euro based on fixed
exchange rates. If the businesses convert their deposits into
euro-based ones, the interest rates will be higher.
</P>
<P>
To individual Czech citizens or tourists, euro-based accounts
will mean more benefits. For one thing, they can withdraw money
from their euro accounts in whatever currencies they need with
credit cards or tourist cheques when they travel in the EU
nations. For another, euro accounts will make non-cash payments
more convenient, because all stores or institutions in the EU
nations are obliged to accept payments in the euro.
</P>
<P>
Another benefit arising from the launch is that a single large
capital market formed by the EU nations by pooling their scattered
resources will make borrowing easier and cheaper for the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
As the country is a traditionally low-risk investment place and
its interest rates will be higher than the EU's uniform interest
rates, it will naturally become one of the first choices for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
However, an influx of short-term capital will force up the
supply of koruna and increase inflationary pressure. Uncontrolled
inflow and outflow of such funds will expose the Czech economy to
potential threats, like those that have prompted the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia countries.
</P>
<P>
To minimize such risks, certain measures will be needed to curb
the inflow of short-term capital. But this will be a move
contrary to the EU requirements for an aspiring member nation.
The government will have to strike a balance between the two.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists in Peking Man Fossil Search (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Zheng and Chen Jie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen prominent Chinese
scientists recently published a letter in a global appeal for help
in locating parts of skulls of Peking Man that disappeared more
than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The search was started by Jia Lanpo, a senior academic at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology
and Paleoanthropology who is now 89 and has more than six decades
of paleoanthropological research under his belt.
</P>
<P>
"I myself witnessed the discovery of the Peking Man fossils and
have helped to develop studies in the field, so I hope I still
have a chance to see the recovery of the treasures that I myself
excavated along with other scientists," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Peking Man discovery in the early 1920s at Zhoukoudian in
the southwestern suburbs of Beijing stunned the world. But Jia
said in the letter, "it is distressing that the most precious part
of this great discovery, the tops of six hominid skulls and other
valuable primate fossils, disappeared without a trace near the end
of World War II."
</P>
<P>
Jia dug up the tops of three skulls of Peking Man in 1936 and
says that because these cultural relics were in good shape before
their disappearance, therefore, they may have survived the
intervening years.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they were destroyed during wartime, we should still do
our best to clear things up," he says. "As the new century
approaches, because most of the key members have passed away or
too old to do anything, our wishes to search for the Peking Man
fossils grow," he writes in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists and those from abroad can only rely on a
broken Peking Man skull, which is the only piece left at CAS, for
research.

<HEADLINE> 17 Die of Cholera in N. Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people have died of
cholera in Kalokol bordering on Lake Turkana in northern Kenya
within one month, said a media report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenyan government now is taking measures to curb
the outbreak of the epidemic in the region, the report quoted
Rift Valley Provincial Medical Officer Dr Kenneth Chebet as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Chebet had just ended a tour of the cholera-hit areas in the
north to check the situation and spread cholera prevention
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"Medical personnel and health workers had been sent to the
area to contain the outbreak," he said, adding that adequate
medical supplies had also been taken to the cholera-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
He called on the residents there to boil drinking water, use
pit latrines and make proper waste disposal to prevent spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The medical official also advised that only transportation of
dried and smoked fish, instead of fresh fish produce, be allowed
out of Kalokol and other cholera-spreading areas around Lake
Turkana until the killing disease is under control.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Report on King's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh has denied a Israeli media report that King Hussein was
"terminally ill" and not likely to resume his full duties as head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Terming the report carried by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth
Aharonot as "untrue," Tarawneh said he was "assured and very
optimistic" about the king's health, the official news agency
Petra reported late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh conceded that the latest stage of chemotherapy for the
king's lymphatic cancer was delayed. But he said it was just for
medical reasons because the doctors wanted to ensure that the king
was "totally free (of cancer after the treatment)" and "will not
be more vulnerable or subject to relapse in a short period of
time."
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh visited the king 10 days ago at the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, Minnesota, where the king has been hospitalized since
July 14,
</P>
<P>
The Israeli newspaper said the king`s illness could lead to
political disturbances in the region, and the kingdom's new
leadership might be unable to deal with the difficulties that
ensue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli Defense
Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin also rejected the report, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 62, has been staying in the U.S. clinic for three
months for his non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, which can be cured
by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
He has planned to receive chemotherapy intravenously once
every 20 days over a period between four to five months in six
stages. Four stages have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 46 years on the throne, is the longest-reigning ruler
in the Middle East. Crown Prince Hassan, his brother, is his legal
successor.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Increase Loans to Medium-Sized, Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's commercial banks have
increased loans to medium-sized and small businesses in need of
operating capital to allow them to contribute to national economic
growth and easing unemployment pressure.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources say that over the past few months all four of the
state-owned commercial banks have established special loan offices
for medium-sized and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
This year, the China Industrial and Commercial Bank has
arranged some 30 billion yuan in loans to support medium-sized and
small enterprises. The China Agricultural Bank has planned loans
of 25 billion yuan to township enterprises, up five billion yuan
from last year, and by the end of June the amount of loans of the
China Communications Bank for medium-sized and small enterprises
was 39.07 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China has over 10 million officially registered medium-sized
and small enterprises, which account for 60 percent and 40 percent
of the country's industrial output and profits, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, these enterprises have missed a lot of development
opportunities because of a lack of funds. So, the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, has asked all commercial banks to
increase loans to medium-sized and small enterprises and high-tech
businesses.

XIAMEN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A special economic zone in
China's Fujian Province at Xiamen did 5.21 billion U.S. dollars
worth of foreign trade in the first eight months of this year, up
6.23 percent from the same period of last year, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Exports for the eight-month period were worth 2.8 billion U.S.
dollars, up 4.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute Xiamen's continued growth amidst the ill
effects of the Asian financial crisis to increased financing for
state-owned foreign trade companies and an effort to diversify the
export market and develop the processing trade.
</P>

Xiamen's exports to Europe, America and Africa grew by more

basis to 25.5 billion yuan in the first eight months and revenue
grew 20.6 percent to 3.95 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Fresh U.N. Peace Effort in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus
Kenneth Brill Monday expressed his country's support to the
renewed U.N. peace effort in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides,
Brill said, "we talked about our strong support for the
U.N. effort. I am not going to say anything about that, obviously,
but we do support very much what the U.N. Secretary-General and
what Dame Ann Hercus are trying to do."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resident Representative Dame Ann Hercus began shuttle
talks with the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on Friday, with
meeting with President Clerides. She is scheduled to meet Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Wednesday and again President
Clerides on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. goal is to reduce tensions and promote progress toward
a just and lasting settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Brill also said the U.S. has a "very robust dialog on the
Cyprus issue with all players".
</P>
<P>
"We are very consistent and direct in our discussions and we
will continue to be," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the island under a bizonal, bicommunal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of U.S.-made weapons in Cyprus, Brill
said the U.S. administration would report to Congress on the
outcome of the investigation to establish if there were American
arms in Cyprus, in violation of the U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to be reporting to the Congress as soon as we can
and we are trying to do everything we can to make sure our law is
being upheld," the U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law which was passed in December 1987, forbids the
transfer of American weapons if it furthers the severance or
division of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surges in Tokyo on Rising Index Futures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo closed
higher across the board Monday due to the unexpected rise in
Nikkei index futures prices.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 286.66 points, or 2.16
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 13,567.20. The index
briefly rose 500 points in the afternoon, but profit-taking pared
the gains toward the close.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 16.24 points or 1.61 percent to
1,022.92.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to an estimated 470 million
shares, unchanged from Friday.
</P>

Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily
traded issue.

The sudden jump in Nikkei index futures prices in Osaka left
some traders speechless, as the near-term December contract hit a
session high of 13,810. In the end, it drifted back to 13,540,
but was still up 310 points to give investors an opportunity to
gain profits through arbitrage-linked buying.

Traders guessed the government is seeking to give the market an
extra boost before the shares of NTT Mobile Communications Network
Inc. (NTT DoCoMo), the country's leading mobile phone operator,

<HEADLINE> Poor Performance in S. Africa's Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The eight percent fall in
output of South Africa's manufacturing sector in the first eight
months of the year was the worst performance in that sector since
the recession of 1992, The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year output fell 4.4 percent in the second
quarter, which made the three months to June the worst quarter
for manufacturing since the 1992 recession, the paper quoted an
economics consultancy, Econometrix, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Worst hit were the fabricated metals, machinery and motor
industries.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the currency since late May did not seem to
have boosted exports in the sector by August, Econometrix said.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of manufacturing sectors indicates that output of
glass products fell 31 percent in August while footware fell 21
percent in the same month, after a 28 percent fall in July. Among
the few sectors in which output rose was leather, which increased
production by 18 percent in August after a seven percent rise in
July.
</P>
<P>
"Although the strike in the metals and motor industries
clearly affected output, one cannot escape from the fact that the
economy weakened significantly in August," said Econometrix.
</P>
<P>
It said interest rates would have to fall before it was too
late to save some of the businesses in the sector.

<HEADLINE> Small Banks' Checks Denied by Kenyan Blue Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's troubled banking
sector is facing a new crisis following a decision by a number of
blue-chip firms to reject payment checks from small banks making
up a majority of the country's 55 commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The measure will further weaken the customer confidence in
small commercial banks which have been battling panic withdrawals
since four of them came under statutory management by the Central
Bank of Kenya last month, the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new system of payment was introduced recently by, among
others, British American Tobacco (BAT) Kenya, Kenya Breweries,
SmithKline Beecham, Kenya Shell and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying that the small banks, most of
them locally-owned, have protested against the action through the
Kenya Bankers Association, fearing that the checks policy will
drive their customers to the big banks.
</P>
<P>
The new system also presents the customers of the small banks
with a dilemma as they have to abandon financiers who had granted
them overdraft facilities and open accounts with others who may
treat them differently.
</P>
<P>
Some clients of small banks also complained that the new
policy had placed them at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
"We have overdraft arrangements with these banks, which makes
it tricky to start a new business arrangement with the big
banks," said a distributor of a recreational product.
</P>
<P>
Certain small banks have reportedly imposed restrictions on
withdrawals.

<HEADLINE> Two Grenades Exploded in Israel's Bus Station (by Qi Deliang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An assailant threw two hand
grenades into the central bus station in Beersheba monday morning,
injuring at least 40 people, the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel condemned
the criminal act, saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
"was sad and concerned" after being informed about this incident.
</P>
<P>
This incident "underscores our concerns about the security
issues and peace talks in Washington now, basically, have not
succeeded because the Palestinians are dragging their feet in
fighting terrorism," Fogel said shortly after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at the morning rush hours and Beersheba
is Israel's southern desert city with most of its residents being
immigrants from the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured, one was in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The assailant, reportedly a Palestinians from near the West
Bank town of Hebron, was overpowered by passers-by and handed over
to police.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as the on-going Middle East peace talks at Wye
Plantation outside Washington were hanging in the balance. A key
issue on the agenda is Israel's demand that the Palestinians do
more to fight terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Fogel said the injured people were sent to Beersheba's
Sorokka Hospital for treatment. Most suffered minor injuries but
one was in serious condition.

<HEADLINE> 12,296 Congolese Refugees Flee into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 12,000
refugees from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo have fled
into neighboring Tanzania, Tanzanian Home Ministry sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry working in the western region of
Kigoma, where the refugees are accommodated, told Xinhua by
telephone that by Sunday, the number of Congolese refugees had
reached 12,296.
</P>
<P>
Of late, most of the refugees have come from Uvira and Kalemie
in the eastern part of Congo (K), said the official who declined
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir
Mohamed was quoted by Monday's The Guardian newspaper as saying
that the government has granted refugee status to 117 rebel
soldiers who fled into Tanzania last month.
</P>
<P>
These soldiers fled into Tanzania in mid-September after
allegedly running short of ammunition in fightings against
government troops loyal to Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the paper last week that the Tanzanian
government cannot send the soldiers back because they might
rejoin their armed colleagues in Congo, leading to hostility
between Tanzania and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Tanzanian government has treated these soldiers
like refugees but at the same time asked them to abide by laws,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the leaders of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania held a
meeting in Nairobi, calling for an immediate cease-fire and the
withdrawal of all foreign troops in the vast central African
nation.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Increasing in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the only inland
municipality directly under the central government, has become a
rising attraction to foreign investors, Vice-Mayor Xu Zhongmin
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a trade fair in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, Xu said
that Chongqing now has over 2,300 overseas-funded enterprises,
with more than four billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which was separated from Sichuan Province as a
municipality in March 1997, has brought to the trade fair about
350 projects in the fields of infrastructure, agriculture, and
tourism that need overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has a population of over 30 million. The Yangtze
River runs through it, making it a transportation hub for
southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
A huge market of 300 million people is formed when the city and
neighboring provinces are considered as a whole, and the
resettlement of the 1.2 million people who need to be moved for
the construction of the Three Gorges Dam Project, also needs huge
investment. All these make Chongqing attractive to overseas
investors, according to municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
To date, people from over 40 countries and regions have
invested in Chongqing's motor vehicle, machinery, real estate and
light industry sectors. A number of multinationals, including
Suzuki, Honda, Mitsui, Isuzu, Pepsi-Cola, Glaxo Wellcome and
Siemens, have offices in Chongqing.

JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An assailant threw two hand
grenades into the central bus station in Beersheba monday
morning, and at least 40 people were injured by the blasts, the
Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at the morning rush hours and Beersheba
is Israel's southern desert city with most of its residents being
immigrants from the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured, one was in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The assailant, apparently an Arab, was overpowered by
passers-by and handed over to police.
</P>
<P>
The attack came as the Middle East peace talks at Wye
Plantation outside Washington was hanging in the balance. A key
issue on the agenda is Israel's demand that the Palestinians do
more to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was informed about the
incident, his office said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Issue Small-Denominated Treasury Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of
Treasury will issue small-denominated treasury bills and bonds
that are affordable to the ordinary public, an official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
National Treasurer Leonor Briones said that starting November
5, the government will make available to ordinary Filipinos
treasury bills and bonds in denominations ranging from 5,000 to
25,000 pesos (from 116 to 582 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bills and bonds will have interest rates higher than
deposits in private banks, she added.
</P>
<P>
Briones said treasury bills and bonds are usually denominated
in hundreds of thousands of or millions of pesos, making them
affordable only to banks and rich individuals.
</P>
<P>
By lowering the denominations of treasury bills and bonds, more
private citizens will be able to buy them and, thus they can
become direct partners of the government in its efforts to finance
the country's economic development, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that treasury bills and bonds subscribers are assured
of a secure investment because the government, regardless of the
state of the economy, always honors the treasury notes.

BOGOTA -- At least 45 people were burned to death and 70 others
seriously wounded when a pipeline exploded Sunday about 300
kilometers north of this Colombian capital.
</P>
<P>
The incident took the victims, many of them women and children
in two nearby villages, by surprise as they were asleep when the
blast occurred, followed by spill-over of crude oil into their
houses and then an ensuing fire. Police blamed the explosion on
the National Liberation Army, the second-largest guerrilla group
in Colombia, which launched tentative peace talks with the
government last week. (Colombia-Pipeline Explosion)

JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With an unofficial deadline coming up on Monday, the United
States is pushing the peace talks at the Wye Plantation into high
gear and increasing pressure on the Palestinian and Israeli sides
in an effort to forge an agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, President Bill Clinton told both
sides on Sunday that if the talks were to fall apart, the U.S.
would consider taking a whole new, less involved approach to the
region affairs.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Due to wide gaps between Israel and the Palestinians at the
Wye Plantation summit, hopes for an early success to the talks
have faded. But sources at the summit said that three options
remain: either prolong the summit, announce agreement on a limited
agenda with an understanding that there is no overall pullback
deal until all issues are resolved, or have the summit end in
failure.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Opposition Labor Party hold a meeting on Sunday to
discuss whether to grant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a
"safety net" if he presents the Knesset (parliament) an agreement
on the second West Bank pullback.
</P>
<P>
A statement released after the meeting said that Labor will
make the decision on the issue only after Netanyahu achieves a
deal with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Deng Pufang Reelected Head of China Disabled Persons' Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Deng Pufang, the eldest son of
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, was reelected chairman of
the China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF) today.
</P>
<P>
Deng's first term at CDPF with 60 million members, the world's
biggest disable persons' organization, started in 1993. He is also
vice-chairman of the State Council Coordinating Committee for Work
for Disabled Persons and chairman of the China Welfare Fund for
the Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
CDPF has invited Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress, and State
Councillor Ismail Amat to be honorary chairman and vice-chairman
respectively.
</P>
<P>
More disabled persons and their family members play a role in
the new CDPF leadership, Deng told the closing ceremony of CDPF's
Third National Congress here today.
</P>
<P>
The congress has a plan for the future work of people with
disabilities to help poor handicapped people get out of poverty by
the year 2000, and to further improve their living conditions by
2010, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
CDPF will place greater importance on compulsory education for
handicapped children, occupation training, and rehabilitation
services for people in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
There were 540 delegates at the four-day congress, 65 percent
of whom suffer from various disabilities.

YINCHUAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Housing space for the people
of Yinchuan, the capital of China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
has more than doubled in the past two decades, recent studies
indicate.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the city has built 6.6 million square meters of new
housing, bringing the total to 8.43 million square meters, and the
per capita living space to 8.79 square meters, compared with 4.2
square meters for each person in 1980.
</P>
<P>
City officials say that flexible government policies have
encouraged housing developers a great deal. In the past few years,
250,000 square meters of new dwellings were completed each year,
with government-funded development only accounting for a fifth of
that.
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing housing construction, the city has
demolished 910,000 square meters of old houses to pave the way for
new construction, allowing 20,000 families to move from old homes
to new, well-equipped housing.

<HEADLINE> Researches Offer Hope for Malaria Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A new anti-malaria vaccine
based on the DNA of the disease-causing parasites carried by
malarial mosquitos has shown promising results in preliminary
tests, the Nairobi-based East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A vaccine using DNA, the genetic building block, should prove
faster and cheaper to manufacture than conventional vaccines,
Navy Captain Stephen Hoffman, the leader of a U.S. military
research team, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trial formula also appears easier to handle in the field
and is less likely than standard vaccines to produce the very
diseases it is designed to prevent, he said at a Pentagon
briefing on the first DNA-based vaccine ever tested on healthy
human subjects.
</P>
<P>
None of the volunteers injected with the vaccine exhibited ill
effects, and some of them developed the "Killer T-cells" that
help the body fight off malaria.
</P>
<P>
Researchers will be testing a more sophisticated version of
the DNA vaccine next to see whether it works on volunteers who
are to be bitten by malaria-carrying mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
Another more sophisticated and powerful form of the DNA
vaccine is scheduled to undergo testing in about two years. It
is the variety that would eventually be used in those areas where
malaria is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
Medical scientists have been striving for years to develop a
vaccine that safeguards against malaria but thwarted by the
complexity of the virus.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is identified by the World Health Organization as the
single biggest killer disease which kills nearly three million
people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The disease proved even more effective than hostile militias
in removing U.S. soldiers from active service during the 1993
intervention in Somalia.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has decided to
issue a 1.6-billion-Shilling (26.66 million U.S. Dollars) grant
to help Kenya develop early childhood education in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to improve pre-school teacher performance,
and enhance community capacity building and mobilization, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marito, a World Bank official in charge of regional
Early Childhood Development Project, said that other targets
include health and nutrition, community support grant, pre-school
to primary school transition, and sound early childhood education
monitoring and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
World Bank's intervention has been necessitated by a strong
need for well-trained pre-school teachers in this east African
country, said Marito.
</P>
<P>
This has also been necessitated by the need to harmonize
pre-school education programs to accord near uniform pre-school
to primary school transition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the sub-sector has a teaching force of 36,129. Out
of them, only 16,500 are fully trained.
</P>
<P>
According to the data from the Kenyan Ministry of Education
and Human Resources, the enrollment rose to the current 1,064,053
pupils from 844,796 in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Submits Information to Refute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita
Monday came to the Attorney General's Office to submit information
to refute the corruption charge made against him by a U.S.
academician.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I intend to clarify this case as soon as possible,
otherwise it will bother my duties and my family. It is a burden
but I am determined to solve it soon," he told reporters here
after meeting with Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he brought files on the gold and copper
mining operations of PT Freport Indonesia company in Irian Jaya
province.
</P>
<P>
He said he acted on his own initiative to submit information he
had on Freeport's working contract.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to provide all information needed by the Attorney
General to help clear up this case," he said, expressing his
readiness to come anytime he is summoned by the Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
PT Freeport was at the epicenter of heated debates last week
after American scholar Jeffrey A. Winters alleged corruption and
collusion in the renewal of its contract in 1991 and implicated
Ginandjar in the scandals.
</P>
<P>
PT Freeport, a subsidiary of the United States giant copper and
gold producer Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold, which is listed in
New York, received its first contract of works in 1967 for the
development of copper reserves in Irian Jaya. It renewed the
contract of works in December 1991 after finding the world's
largest copper and gold reserves in the province's Grasberg area.
</P>
<P>
The government has banned Winters from entering Indonesia
following his statement. Winters, a professor of Northwestern
University, has said that although he did not directly say that
Ginandjar is corrupt, he will not withdraw his statement as this
was based on a report of the ECONIT, a reputable economic research
institute in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Junior Attorney for Special Crime Cases Anton Sujata
said his office will compare the data given by Ginandjar with
those collected by the Attorney General's Office and those from
relevant institutions.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Seeks Help for Gas-Based Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is seeking assistance
from western donors to set up gas-based power plants and other
industries, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday appealed for
the assistance during a meeting with diplomatic envoys of the
United States, Britain and the Netherlands at her office.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats thanked the prime minister for giving the chance
to Unocal (U.S.), Cairn (Britain) and Shell (Netherlands) to work
jointly in gas block 10 in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hasina gave green light to the three oil companies'
cooperation proposal for the development of a gas pipeline system
under the Western Region Integrated Project which has been
conceived on the basis of Shahbajpur gas-field.
</P>
<P>
Hasina sought more foreign investment in the power sector
because she has felt the urgency of setting up more gas-based
power plants in the country, particularly in the western zone to
meet the growing demand of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, a gas resource-rich country in South Asia, has been
divided into 23 blocks and these blocks have been offered for
investment by local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The current proven gas reserve stand at 10.3 trillion cubic
feet, and the country is currently producing around 750-800
million cubic feet per day. The country's potential gas reserve
may be as high as 80 trillion cubic feet, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
Till June 1998, Bangladesh has signed agreements with four
foreign companies for production in eight blocks, and work in
these blocks is going on in full swing. Negotiations are underway
for the signing of contracts for another 12 blocks, according to
official sources.

BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A canyon of the Yarlung Zangbo

The 496-kilometer-long canyon is in the southeastern part of
the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau and has a depth of 5,382 meters.
</P>

According to the paper, Chinese scientists and journalists
jointly made field studies of the region in 1994 and found that it
was the world's largest canyon, a conclusion that was affirmed by
scientific studys a few months later.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Monday is the last date for
John Feerick to decide whether more than 200 players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
If the players win, the owners will be liable for about 800
U.S. dollars salaries, although they have vowed to appeal if they
lose. The league already has sued the players over Feerick's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
"If we win, I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve
of the players," union director Billy Hunter said. "But I don't
think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no
guaranteed that it will end the lockout.
</P>
<P>
"It only means they have to pay some 200 players, and they've
indicated to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take
it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment.
</P>
<P>
"So even if he does rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow
victory. The players aren't going to get paid on November 15 in
any circumstance," Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
If the owners win, it will remove the last wild card the
players had been holding.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Eager To Introduce Y2K Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is eager to
introduce Y2K experts into the country.
</P>
<P>
Government officials will meet here this week to discuss
whether immigration regulations should be short-circuited to
accelerate migration of such talents, the Dominion reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said the meeting follows
concerns by Maurice Williamson, Information Technology Minister
with special responsibility for Year 2000 Information Risk
Management, that the current immigration regulations are
preventing overseas experts from reaching New Zealand quickly.
</P>
<P>
He has asked Immigration Minister Tuariki John Delamere to
consider making the necessary changes in the regulations
expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Immigration and Commerce ministries will
attend the meeting to discuss issues arising from the request.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Basil Logan, chairman of the Government's Y2K
Readiness Commission, as saying that the potential skills shortage
now looks "worse than previously feared".
</P>
<P>
Tim Miles, executive member of the Information Technology
Association of New Zealand (ITANZ), said that the ITANZ would like
the process to be more expeditious, with more emphasis on speeding
up the procedure.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is speed, not just qualifications," he said.

WELLINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Severe gales have been
lashing the Wellington region and South Island of New Zealand in
the past 24 hours, causing havoc on the roads and disrupting
travel.
</P>
<P>
Several roads were closed after cars were blown into barrier
rails and trees fell, flights were delayed or canceled and fast
ferry sailing were stopped as winds gusted up to 112km/h, the TV
New Zealand reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fire services were called out time and again to assist with
fences, doors and roofs that had been blown loose. Motorists were
warned to avoid hill roads.
</P>
<P>
"It is hair-raising driving on any hill in Wellington where
conditions are terrible," police inspector Brend Craig of
Wellington was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Greg Pearson, a forecaster of meteorological service, said wind
gusts of up to 110km/h would continue until this evening.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Fate to be Decided Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nevada Athletic
Commission will decide whether to give Mike Tyson his license
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
All Tyson needs is just three votes among five commissioners.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, but I'm hopeful," Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel
said. "I think our chances are better than they were before."
</P>
<P>
Tyson has to convince a majority of the boxing authority that
he has paid his price for biting Evander Holyfield's ears and
deserves a chance to fight again.
</P>
<P>
A psychological report says he is mentally fit to box again.
But he has to answer questions about a Maryland traffic
altercation.
</P>
<P>
"I want to hear about Maryland directly from Mike,"
commissioner Luther Mack said. "That is going to be the test.
Mike is going to have to explain what happened there and explain
it in his own words."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are going to give me back my license,"
Tyson said after a workout last week in Phoenix. "I'm not sure of
anything, especially anything nice happening to me."
</P>
<P>
Tyson appears to have support from at least two of the
commissioners, and his advisers privately say they believe they
can pick up at least one more vote if Tyson is able to explain
why he allegedly punched and kicked two men following a traffic
accident on August 31 in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was to have undergone trial Monday on criminal charges
in the case, but they were postponed until on December 1 at the
request of his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
If a settlement isn't reached before Monday's meeting, Tyson's
advisers are hoping that Tyson can proclaim his innocence and be
given a license with the understanding that it would be stripped
from him if he were convicted of the charges.

<HEADLINE> 300 Nigerians Killed in Oil Pipeline Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- About 300 people were killed in
a petrol pipeline fire Sunday at the village of Apawor near the
oil town of Warri in Delta State of Nigeria, a report reaching
here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted witnesses as saying that the death toll was
rising as efforts were being made to bring the blaze under
control and no proper rescue effort had been organized for
victims of the fire ripped through the area around the village
which has an estimated 2,000 villagers.
</P>
<P>
No official death toll has been announced for the disaster.
</P>
<P>
One witness said that "hundreds of people rushed to the scene
to scoop up petrol when suddenly there was a fire and all the
people there got burnt."
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Akhihicro, Maintenance Superintendent of the
Pipelines and Products Marketing Company, told the military
governor of Delta State, Navy Commander Walter Feghabor who
visited the scene that "it was an act of sabotage."
</P>
<P>
The burst pipeline transports fuel from the oil refinery in
Warri to the northern city of Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
Acts of sabotage against oil installations in Delta State have
been on the rise recently as local residents have forced
multi-national petroleum companies like Chevron, Shell and Agip
to stop their oil production.
</P>
<P>
The disrupting action by the local people has reduced the
nation's oil export by one third of more than two million barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the crisis in the oil-producing areas
is a threat not only to the budget but to the on-going
democratization process by General Abdulsalam Abubakar's
government.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a major oil exporting country in the world and
relies on oil for 90 percent of its export revenue.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's rebel Zapatista
Army for National Liberation (EZLN) on Sunday said it wanted to
restart peace talks with federal legislators, raising new hope to
settle the conflicts dragging on in the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to retake the path (of peace) with the
legislative commission right where we left off," EZLN military
chief, known as Subcommander Marcos, said in a statement to the
Mexican Congress.
</P>
<P>
He offered talks with the congressional mediation group -- the
Commission for Peace and Reconciliation (COCOPA) -- and a meeting
with representatives of the "civil society" in Chiapas state but
accused the government of "not wanting peace."
</P>
<P>
The EZLN took up arms in Mexico's poorest state of Chiapas on
the New Year's Day in 1994, demanding more right for Mayan Indians
who form the majority of the population there.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire has been maintained shortly after the uprising but
hundreds have been killed in initial fighting and subsequent
violence.
</P>
<P>
The EZLN's negotiations with the government failed in September
1996 and its talks with the multi-party COCOPA also bogged down in
January 1997.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 50 Injured in Bangladesh Hartal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and 50 others were injured on Sunday during the dawn-to-dusk
hartal here sponsored by the seven-party opposition alliance led
by the major opposition -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The BNP claimed the death of two party activists and injury of
200 others, but police confirmed one death only and said the death
was not relevant to the hartal, press reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, in an emergency meeting on Sunday, announced a
fresh eight-hour countrywide hartal slated for Thursday, October
22, in protest against the alleged death of two activists.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League brought out anti-hartal processions on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 people were injured in a series of clashes between
activist of the ruling Awami League and the BNP-led alliance, and
police picked up over 100 opposition activists during picketing at
different points of the city. Some 4,000-strong police and
Bangladesh Rifles were deployed across the city by the government.
</P>
<P>
All motorized vehicles were off the roads, and richshaws became
the sole means of transport in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Business houses were closed, banks carried out restricted
financial transactions for security reasons, and schools were
given an unscheduled holiday.
</P>
<P>
But flights of the national Biman Bangladesh Airlines and train
services were normal, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The day-long shutdown was called by the opposition when the
government refused to allow holding of mass hunger strike at
Paltan Maidan on Sunday, in support of such demands as
interest-free loans for flood-hit farmers, freeing political
prisoners, and withdrawal of "fabricated" cases filed against
opposition leaders and activists.
</P>
<P>
The government rejected the request of the opposition on the
ground that the hunger strike program at the Paltan Maidan would
adversely affect the on-going arrangements for the Wills
International Cricket Cup tournament, scheduled to begin at the
adjacent Bangabandhu Stadium on October 24.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike would not affect the sports event, the
opposition argued, as it would be held six days ahead of the
sports program at a different place.
</P>
<P>
It was the first hartal in the city after the
over-two-month-long floods, which hit 52 out of the country's 64
districts from July to September, affecting about half of its
127-million population, killing over 1,000 people and causing an
estimated loss of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.

according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Joining the protest at Austin, capital of the southern
U.S. state of Texas, were three members of Mexico's Juarez City
Council.
</P>
<P>
They would stay in front of Texas Governor George W. Bush's
residence until at least Thursday, when a state commission would
have final say on building the dump 25 kilometers off the Mexican
border.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear waste facility is a U.S. federal government project
that, as alleged by Carlos Camacho -- a Mexican deputy on strike,
would pose as a threat for residents on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
The chosen site at the Sierra Blanca region is seismically
active, and a radioactive leak from the facility could turn into
an ecological disaster and risk the safety of people around.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1983 Mexican-U.S. agreement banning all projects
potentially harmful to environment or health within 100 kilometers
from the border, Camacho said, the project should be canceled.
</P>
<P>
However, regardless of the bilateral accord, U.S. President
Bill Clinton approved the project last month, and left the final
decision whether to go ahead in the hand of Texas state.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike is one of the last-ditch efforts planned by
Mexican and U.S. environmentalist and citizen groups to impact on
the state commission's meeting scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration through Austin and a 24-hour sit-in at the
governor's residence thereafter are planned for Wednesday, the
reports said.

<HEADLINE> India Opposes EC's Anti-Dumping Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- India opposes the
anti-dumping duty imposed on its unbleached cotton grey fabrics by
the European Commission (EC), Commerce Ministry sources said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
India would prefer to let its case against EC at the World
Trade Organization (WTO) on anti-dumping duty stay since EC has
been repeatedly resorting to non-tariff barriers since 1994. The
move to let the case stay was to raise the issue again at WTO if
EC were to resort to the measure again.
</P>
<P>
India had presented its case at WTO last month during the
consultations before the organization's director-general.
</P>
<P>
Special Secretary N. N. Khanna, who is in charge of WTO affairs
in the Commerce Ministry of India, told an industry meeting last
week that EC had made it a habit to resort to anti-dumping measure
on unbleached cotton grey fabrics time and again.
</P>
<P>
"We viewed it as a sort of repeated harassment since EC would
drop the proceedings one day and take up a fresh case the very
next morning," he said.

<HEADLINE> FIIs Cut Their Weigtage in Indian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The sentiment of foreign
institutional investors (FIIs) towards India has turned negative
and most FIIs are reducing their weightage in the Indian markets,
Business Standard said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three biggest FIIs -- Morgan Stanley Asset Management,
Schroders Capital Management and Capital International -- which
together account for 60 percent of total FIIs investments in
India, have decided to reduce their indian portfolio weightages.
</P>
<P>
"These three biggest investors have been the biggest sellers
and it looks like they will continue to sell in the near term,"
said dealers at a foreign brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
While some of the selling has been caused by redemption
pressure, it is learnt that discretionary funds invested in India
are being allocated to other Southeast Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The reason for FIIs to cut their weightage in India is that the
crisis of the Unit Trust of India (UTI), the largest financial
institution in the country, has eroded FIIs confidence at a time
when Southeast Asian economies look like bouncing back, making
valuations there seem increasingly attractive, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Rural Market Reconstruction Begins in Northernmost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The rehabilitation of a vital
rural market in the Jaffna Peninsula at the northernmost of Sri
Lanka  has begun at an estimated cost of 600,000 U.S. dollars,
according to reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the once bustling Pandaterripu market,
funded by the United National Development under the Jaffna
Rehabilitation Program, is expected to be finished by mid-January
next year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels, who have been waging a 15-year war for a separate state
in the country. Government troops recaptured the peninsula in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of preparatory activities for the
rehabilitation of the market, traders have begun returning from
other markets to trade in Pandaterripu again, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that it is expected that this project will
revive the once bustling market and in turn revitalize the whole
city of Jaffna.

BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chen Lei, a middle school
student in a remote part of Beijing's suburbs, sent a bit of
information over the Internet a month ago, and some 4,000 tourists
have visited her small village since then.
</P>
<P>
The information super-highway has made the world a smaller
place, and an increasing number of Chinese have become aware of
the importance of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
China's first E-mail called "Crossing the Great Wall to the
World", was sent over a local network, the China Computer
Technology Net, to a German university net and finally to the
International Science Net in September 1987.
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, China got connected to the Internet, and as
computer and network technology develop, the number of Chinese
Internet users increases. At the beginning of this year, China had
670,000 users, and by the end of this June the number had grown to
1.17 million, according to the China Internet Information Center.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has become part of my life, and I can't imagine
living without it," says He Ping, a 31-year-old senior staff
member at a foreign-funded company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Young people enjoy the Internet most. A recent survey shows
that 84 percent of the Chinese Internet users are below the age of
35. About 69 percent of them spend one to ten hours on the
Internet every week, and 20 percent spend more than 10
hours. China has 542,000 computers connected with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 media organizations in China that are connected
with the Internet, like People's Daily, the Xinhua News Agency,
China Daily, and China Central Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Guangdong and Shanghai lead the country in the number
of Internet users, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Local governments of 17 provinces, municipalities and ethnic
autonomous regions have also been providing local information to
the outside world via the net.

<P>
HANOI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai left here Monday morning for Beijing for a five-day
official visit to China at the invitation of his Chinese
counterpart Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first by a Vietnamese prime minister since
1991 when China and Vietnam normalized their diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, the prime minister told Xinhua that his
visit is aimed at deepening mutual understanding, strengthening
friendship and reinforcing bilateral cooperation between the two
countries, especially in trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Khai said he believes that his visit to China will surely be
successful.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
and meet other Chinese top leaders.

on cross-border trade, a pact on consular cooperation and an
accord on mutual judicial assistance, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Beijing, Khai will also visit Su Zhou in Jiang Su
province, Hang Zhou in Zhe Jiang province, and Guang Xi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Ciampi Agrees to Join New Team to Form Italian Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian caretaker Treasury
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Sunday agreed to join the team of
leftist leader Massimo D'Alema, giving him a key leverage needed
to secure support for a new government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed a formal appeal by D'Alema, saying
Ciampi was "the person whom the government and the country cannot
do without."
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Ministry responded with a one-sentence statement,
announcing "Ciampi has thanked Massimo D'Alema for his comments
and expressed his willingness to serve."
</P>
<P>
The prestigious treasury minister, widely credited for his
major role in Italy's entry into the euro bloc, had been rumored
unwilling to join the new administration after criticism by
D'Alema's ally Francesco Cossiga.
</P>
<P>
Cossiga, ex-president of Italy heading the former Christian
Democrat (DC) party before it fell in corruption scandals, had
reportedly called Ciampi an enemy of the DC.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president, who now leads the center-right Democratic
Union for the Republic with a key role in the negotiations for a
new cabinet, Sunday made a public apology to Ciampi, saying "if I
offended him, I'm duty-bound to apologize."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, chief of the Democratic Party of the Left, is expected
to report on Monday to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the
feasibility of his heading a new government after Romano Prodi's
center-left Olive Tree coalition fell at the loss of a confidence
vote in the lower house on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Italy's cabinet crisis began last month when the Communist
Refoundation party withdrew its crucial backing for the
government's 1999 budget bill, breaking a 28-month alliance with
Prodi's Olive Tree.

COLOMBO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Health and

<HEADLINE> Thailand's 1st Human Resource Master Plan Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's first ever master
plan on human resource development in the production and service
industries has taken shape, The Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Thailand Development Research Institute was commissioned by
the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry to put together the plan
which emphasizes quality-enhancement of the workforce population.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan has been finalized and will be submitted to the
ministry for consideration before it translates into concrete
action to be implemented by related agencies such as the education
and industry ministries.
</P>
<P>
Yongyuth Chalaemwong, director of the master plan, was quoted
as saying that in the past, a human resources master plan was
non-existent. And now that there is one, it should be tailor-made
to help flagging industries survive the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The overriding priority should go into preventing further
contraction of the employment training for workers so as to
increase their career opportunity and better their job-seeking
prospects should they be made redundant.
</P>
<P>
Yongyuth also urged the government to support human
resource-oriented research to enable the industries to be more
reliant on local production technology.
</P>
<P>
Large industries have had to import anything from know-how to
machinery while smaller businesses are mostly family-run and
incapable of inventing the needed technology to spur productivity.
</P>
<P>
He said the lack of technological initiatives contributed to
the brain drain.
</P>
<P>
He explained that when there was no technology to accommodate
expertise, people with skills migrate to other countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Commander Vows to Probe Killings in E. Java </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto vowed to get to the bottom of the killings
in East Java province which over the past two months have claimed
the lives of at least 142 people, national newspapers reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who was on a one-day visit to the province on Sunday,
appealed to the public not to suspect the armed forces of
involvement in the killings.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI have conducted internal reforms in several areas, so do
not judge ABRI by the old paradigm," he said during a meeting with
50 Muslim preachers in Banyuwangi in the eastern part of the
province.
</P>
<P>
He said ABRI would seek out the mastermind, if there were any,
behind the murders, and asked the public to be patient.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also minister of defense, refused to comment on
a statement by Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, who on Saturday
alleged that cabinet ministers may be involved in the killing
spree.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to send the country toward disintegration,"
Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman, who chairs the country's largest Islamic
organization Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), told a group of government
critics that members of the cabinet and several "non-structural
officers" were behind the murders.
</P>
<P>
He declined to mention any names, saying to do so would only
create a furor. He also refused to explain how he came to the
conclusion that senior politicians were involved in the killing.
</P>
<P>
He, however, dismissed speculation that the killings were
linked to a reported conflict between NU and the ABRI.
</P>
<P>
"The move (killing spree) is meant to paralyze NU," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also meant to trigger civil war between NU and
Muhammadiyah," he said in reference to the second largest Muslim
organization.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the killing spree has spread to central
Java province.
</P>
<P>
Highly organized groups of men clad in black "ninja turtle"
style costumes have ridden vigilante-style into a series of small
towns in the Banyuwangi and Jember regions, attacking so-called
black magic practitioners, as well as scores of Muslim clerics
from NU. Terrified residents have banded together to try to defend
themselves against the marauding "ninjas."

CHANGSHA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- After a two-year slow-down,
foreign investment involved in contracts China signed from January
to August rose to 31.7 billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year
increase of eight percent, according to Sun Guangxiang,
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This means that China has survived some of the fallout from the
Asian financial crisis, Sun told a recent forum on foreign
investment in western and central parts of China.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will continue to focus on direct foreign
investment by opening up more competitive industries like
petrochemicals and construction, and experiment with domestic
commerce, foreign trade, accounting, legal consulting and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the Chinese government will make an effort to improve
its legal system relating to foreign investment and take steps to
stop illegal levies imposed on foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the western and central regions have their own
advantages and for foreign investment like cheap labor and
potential markets.

<HEADLINE> German Swimmers Say Doping Test Could Easily be Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- German swimmers Chris Carol
Bremer and Mark Warnecke said doping tests could be easily passed
even if a swimmer is on banned drugs, German television ARD
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bremer and Warnecke, who are also medical students, added they
thought doping was widespread in their sport today.
</P>
<P>
"In the bags of swimmers everywhere you will find testosterone
and EPO (erythropoietin)," said Bremer, who won a bronze in the
200 meters butterfly at the world championships in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Bremer said as long as a swimmer could control his or her
intakes of the banned drugs carefully, he or she could stay under
the 6 to 1 ratio in testing steroids.
</P>
<P>
A urine sample indicating a ratio above that would be regarded
as positive.
</P>
<P>
Olympic 100 meters breaststroke bronze medallist Warnecke
agreed, saying "With the right prescription, you can stay under
six -- at 5.5 to 1 for example -- all the time."
</P>
<P>
Warnecke made a comparison to drink-driving tests in Germany,
in which the allowable upper limit is 0.5 grams.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a driver who would be found to have 0.4 (grams of
alcohol per liter of blood). He can say he didn't drink anything
but everybody knows that's not true."

<HEADLINE> Tourists Returning to Flooded Parts of Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province,
which was devastated by summer floods and suffered heavy losses in
the tourism business, is working hard to bring travelers back.
</P>
<P>
July to September, which used to be the high point for local
tourism, saw 100,000 scheduled visitors and over 2,100 groups
changing their travel plans to other holiday sites.
</P>
<P>
These withdrawals were attributed to fears of flooding and
disease, even though the floods did not cause a great deal of
damage or disease in tourist places like Lushan Mountain and the
old Communist revolutionary base in Jinggang Mountain.
</P>
<P>
To help the tourism sector recover from the aftermath of the
floods, local governments and travel agencies have held a series
of promotion activities inside and outside the province and these
have begun to pay off. In recent weeks, the number of tourists
visiting Jiangxi has begun to return to a normal level.

<P>
YANGON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar military government
claimed that it had made two astounding major achievements since
taking over state power in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
"The government has managed to bring 17 of the 18 armed
insurgent groups into the legal fold and has also achieved success
in bringing the drug warlord Khun Sa to surrender
unconditionally," said a latest report on the political situation
of Myanmar, issued by the Office of Strategic Studies of the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government armed groups, who have already made peace
with the government, include those of ethnic Kokang, Wa, Shan,
Kachin, Palaung, Kayan, Kayinni, Pa-O, Mon and Rakhine as well as
the 15,000-strong Khun-Sa-led drug trafficking Mong Tai Army who
surrendered in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Kayin National Union led by Bo Mya is the only largest
ethnic armed group still operating on the Myanmar-Thai border
against the government.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Explosion Kills 45 in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 45 people were burned
to death and 70 others seriously wounded when a pipeline exploded
Sunday about 300 kilometers north of this Colombian capital.
</P>
<P>
The incident took the victims, many of them women and children
in two nearby villages, by surprise as they were asleep when the
blast occurred, followed by spill-over of crude oil into their
houses and then an ensuing fire.
</P>
<P>
Police blamed the explosion on the National Liberation Army
(ELN), the second-largest guerrilla group in Colombia, which
launched tentative peace talks with the government last week.
</P>
<P>
The ELN is known to be active in the area hit by the blast.
</P>
<P>
If it was indeed the ELN's work, said some analysts, it would
likely hurt the talks to end Colombia's long-running civil war,
which has claimed at least 35,000 lives in the last decade alone.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, in Portugal for an
Ibero-American summit, condemned those behind the incident and
offered his sympathy to the victims.

SHENYANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- About 40,000 urban laid-off
workers in northeast China's Liaoning Province have found
new jobs in the province's rural areas since 1994, said local
sources.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are now engaged in planting and breeding work in
the countryside, and some have been reemployed by rural and
township enterprises as production, marketing and technological
management personnel.
</P>
<P>
Relevant provincial departments have instituted a range of
measures to encourage more laid-off workers to follow suit,
including offering tax cuts and credit privileges to
those who start businesses in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Local labor departments, trade unions and women's federations
at all levels are also sparing no effort to help more laid-off
workers find new jobs in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Another 10,000 of these workers are expected to find jobs in
rural areas over the next three years, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, one of China's old industrial bases, has one tenth of
the country's large and medium-sized enterprises. The province

SHENZHEN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's first
special economic zone in southern Guangdong province, is
modernizing agriculture with the help of a number of

<HEADLINE> China to Invest 136.8 Billion Yuan to Upgrade Rural Power Grids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to invest
136.8 billion yuan (about 16.48 billion US dollars) to build and
upgrade rural power grids in the next three years, sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Finance are ready to draw up favorable policies to encourage the
construction and upgrading of rural power grids.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to cut down rural power prices so as to match
the urban power levels in the next five years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The power price in rural China is usually much higher than in
the urban areas because of backward rural power grids and poor
management.
</P>
<P>
A China Central Television (CCTV) report said that the power
price in a northeast China village is five yuan (about 0.6 US
dollars) per KWH, more than 10 times the average price in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Farmers could not afford such a high price and had to light
candles at night.
</P>
<P>
The rural power management system is to be improved apart from
upgrading rural power grids.
</P>
<P>
County-level power power firms will be turned into shareholding
companies affiliated to provincial power firms.
</P>
<P>
Township power management stations would be reformed as
integral units of county-level companies. Surplus electricians and
other employees would be trained and reassigned.
</P>
<P>
Power firms should sell electricity and provide services to
rural households directly to avoid extra costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Sichuan Province has
been planting trees in more hillside farmland in an effort to
improve local ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
This year it earmarked 857 million yuan for comprehensive
agricultural development whose major task is to improve low-yield
farmland. By 2005, some 769,300 hectares of hillside farmland will
be used for growing trees instead of crops.
</P>
<P>
The province is trying to protect the environment close to the
middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River after it announced a
ban on logging on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural development in the next six months will change
about 113,300 hectares of low-yield farmland, add 290 million kg
of grain, 930,000 kg of cotton, 10.7 million kg of oil-bearing
crops.
</P>
<P>
The province has spent 3.32 billion yuan on improving 885,300
hectares of low-yield farmland since it began large-scale
development in 1986 and has added over 7 billion yuan in output,
2.43 billion kg of grain.

<HEADLINE> Oil Pipeline Fire Kills Some 300 Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An oil pipeline fire starting
Sunday has killed some 300 Nigerians in the village of Apawor near
the oil town of Warri in Delta State, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses were quoted as saying that the death toll was rising
as efforts were being made to bring the blaze under control and no
proper rescue efforts were organized for victims of the fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire, believed to be touched off by thieves sabotaging an
oil pipeline, ripped through the area around the village of about
2,000 inhabitants and destroyed a swath of surrounding crop land.
</P>
<P>
It started when "hundreds of people" were rushing to the scene
to scoop up petrol, one of the witnesses reportedly said, and
"suddenly there was a fire and all the people there got burnt."
</P>
<P>
But no official death toll has been announced so far.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Akhihicro, maintenance superintendent of the Pipelines
and Products Marketing Company, reported to Walter Feghabor,
military governor of Delta State, that "it was an act of sabotage."
</P>
<P>
The pipeline on fire was used to transport fuel from the oil
refinery in Warri to the northern city of Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
Acts of sabotage against oil facilities have been on the rise
in Delta State, where local residents have forced multi-national
companies such as Chevron, Shell and Agip to stop oil production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nigeria's oil exports, one of the biggest in the
world with over two million barrels per day to provide 90 percent
of the country's external revenues, have been down by one third.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the crisis in the oil-producing areas is a
threat not only to the budget but to the on-going democratization
process by General Abdulsalami Abubakar's government.

<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China's large bicycle producer,
Tianjin, plans to tackle the problem of overlapping in production,
in order to maintain the competitiveness of major producers,

</P>
<P>

association will work out regulations to reinforce control over
bicycle production. Right now the northern port city produces more
than 300 brands of bicycles, which has resulted in sub-standard
products and hampers the competitiveness of major enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics shows that Tianjin produces over six
million bicycles a year, 21.8 percent of the national output.
</P>
<P>
The city has 408 bicycle factories, 16 of which have an annual
output of more than 100,000 bicycles each. The state-owned Flying
Pigeon Bicycle Group maintains its leading position in the city,
in spite of the fact that private businesses that have made strong
inroads into the industry during the past 20 years.

<P>
VIENNA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
of the United States defeated Slovakia's Karol Kucera in the
final to win the CA-Trophy tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who entered for the competition as a wild card
holder, won 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 to come one step closer to his
goal of finishing the year at the top of the world rankings for a
record sixth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Sampras broke Kucera's service only once in the first set --
the third game -- to make a good start.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Sampras broke again in the opening game
before his form diminished to let the Slovak tie 4-4. But Kucera
made too many errors in the tie breaker to give the American the
set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras slammed some big serves in the third set and took the
third set with ease.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is going into his 242nd week at world number one. He
is third in the all-time list behind Ivan Lendl, who accumulated

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has leased 107
million square meters of land since land-use right leases in the
city began in August 1988.
</P>
<P>
This has been taken as a new way to attract overseas investment
and funds from outside Shanghai for urban construction and
improvements and industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
The commercialization of land-use rights has helped develop the
city's real estate sector, whose industrial added value increased
from 970 million yuan in 1992 to 14.8 billion yuan in 1997. The
real estate sector contributed 4.4 percent of the city's GDP last
year, compared with 0.9 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Demand for land in Shanghai is higher than the national
average, but the city's per capita land area is less than a
quarter of the national average.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to establish a sound mechanism for land supply
through open and fair competition at the market in the next eight
years, according to Cai Yutian, head of the Municipal Property and
Land Administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debt
rose to 45.777 billion U.S. dollars as of June this year, slightly
up by 0.25 percent from the level recorded in the first quarter,
Business World reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the foreign debt was pushed up by payment
of short-term accounts, negative foreign exchange revaluation
adjustments and increased holdings by Philippines residents debt
instruments issued offshore.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the amount published by the central
bank over the weekend excluded the private sector accounts worth
5.366 billion dollars which were monitored but not necessarily
registered with the central bank.

bank to include significant privately-held liabilities in the
computation of the country's external debt.
</P>

Of the total debt, those incurred by the public sector
accounted for 61 percent with an average term of about 21 years
while the private sector's share dropped to 39 percent, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Risk-Takers Break New Ground in Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Some people at Qinghua
University have learned how to get involved in risky investments
with their research developments and this may become a profitable
business in China.
</P>
<P>
The university was a cradle of technology and science in China
and held in May a business contest whose final event, a design for
a vegetable-cleaner company, brought the winner 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The student-run activity drew the attention of top government
officials. Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, wished the organizers, Qinghua's
Pathbreakers Association, success during an hour-long informal
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who is also chairman of the Democratic National
Construction Party, proposed a risky-investment motion at the
Ninth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March.
</P>
<P>
Some 320 students from Qinghua and Beijing universities
submitted 114 business plans to the contest with ideas ranging
from new materials, computer network services to new medical
devices and small household appliances, which were judged by a
14-member panel of professors and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Song Xuemeng, president of Shanghai Shihua International
Investment Co. Ltd, who was one of the panel members, said that
the winner's plan had been done professionally and was a mature
business idea.
</P>
<P>
Jim Cosh, of Peat Marwick Main and Co., said there was really
no loser in the competition because each of the entries had been
done in a professional way, using proper managerial skills for
technical advantages.
</P>
<P>
A Pathbreaker Association member said that a lot of good
entries did not make it to the finals and that some entrants are
negotiating with potential investors and others will be auctioned
in November.

ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) - The Taliban militia Sunday

The Taliban fighters entered Taloqan after a fierce day-long
fighting and they were in complete control of the city and its

</P>
<P>
He said that the guaranteed three month-deposit interest rate
was set at 61 percent, six-month interest rate at 49 percent, and
12-month interest rate at 30 percent.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua)-- Mark O'Meara claimed the title
of the World Matchplay on Sunday by holing a 15-foot birdie putt
at the last green to beat Tiger Woods by one shot.
</P>
<P>
Their fluctuating 36-hole battle in the first all-American
final in 23 years was effectively decided at the 16th hole of the
afternoon round.
</P>
<P>
O'Meara drove into trees but made a 15-foot par-saving putt
and then watched Woods three-putt from eight feet for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
That left O'Meara one ahead but Woods made a 10-footer for a
matching birdie at the 571-yard 17th to send the contest to the
last hole.
</P>
<P>
Both bunkered their drives, both escaped well and Wood hit his
third shot to 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
O'Meara's third hit past the pin but spun back some 25 feet to
finish up against a collar of rough off the green.
</P>
<P>
But he rolled in the putt to seal his victory, the ball
settling on the lip of the hole before finally dropping in.
</P>
<P>
O'Meara won 170,000 pounds (289,100 U.S. dollars), Woods
90,000 pounds.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unsure if Mideast Summit can Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Sunday it is unsure if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have the political will to
conclude a peace agreement at a weekend summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing at the summit venue, the Wye Plantation
in Maryland, State Department spokesman James Rubin refused to say
explicitly if U.S. mediators felt they had made progress in
intensive, high-risk negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin acknowledged that despite U.S. efforts to create
an environment in which two bitter adversaries might finally end
19 months of wrangling and reach an "interim" peace pact,
Netanyahu and Arafat had not met in more than 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
He also said some drafted documents were made and political
will to decide was needed.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly pieces of paper exist in the hands of various
delegations and others," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But whether there's a formal memorandum to reflect these
decisions, if they'are made, I'm just not prepared to speculate
at this time," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who spent 11 hours Saturday at the
secluded Wye Plantation 70 miles (110 km) outside of Washington,
returned again Sunday. Vice President Al Gore also joined the
talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is time to complete the work if the political will is
there to make the tough decisions," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added, "I think we do feel a sense of urgency.
Going into meetings, we felt very strongly that in the absence of
making these kinds of agreements and putting the peace process
back on track, there were serious dangers ahead for the people of
the Middle East."

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks in U.S. Extended to Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Sunday that the Palestine-Israel talks in Maryland will be
extended to Monday, one day more than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a group of reporters
that talks "almost certainly will go into tomorrow. We believe
it's in the best interests of the peace process to continue the
discussions."
</P>
<P>
A significant stumbling block involved security guarantees for
Israel as part of a deal to give up land on the West Bank to the
Palestinian Authority, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said it is unsure if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have the
political will to conclude an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rubin refused to say explicitly if U.S. mediators felt they had

JERUSALEM -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has said the U.S. will
recognize a Palestinian state next year if Israelis fail to reach
an agreement with Palestinians at the Mideast summit in the U.S.,
Israel's army radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Clinton is pressuring Israel to reach an agreement
on Israel's withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinian security cooperation, the report quoted
an unidentified American official as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister's office here issued a statement to
deny such a report as "baseless." (BC-Israel-Clinton-Palestinian
