<HEADLINE> India to Import Commodities to Control Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government decided
Saturday to import essential commodities including pulses and
onion to meet the short supply and control the price rise in most
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said here today that the
decision was made at a meeting of group of ministers on prices
presided over by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to lift 10 percent import duty on pulses
and abolish four percent special additional duty on imports of
these commodities imposed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of essential commodities especially onion, the favorable
vegetable for Indians, have been skyrocketing since May this year,
with the price of onion increasing by over 50 times in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that prices of primary articles under
the wholesale price index had increased by 12.82 percent during
the period till October 17 and 15.8 percent higher as compared to
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of State for Agriculture Sompal said that
main reason for the shortage of onion was the low production in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
He said that onion production was only 3.6 million tones in
1997-98 against 4.27 million tones in the previous year.

BONN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Richard Krajicek stunned world
number one Pete Sampras in a tight three-set battle on Saturday
to reach the final of the Eurocard Open in Stuggart, Germany, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 11th seeded Dutchman recovered from the loss of the first
set to snatch a 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 win and set up a final against the
winner of the second semifinal between Swede Jonas Bjorkman or
Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek has now won five of their seven encounters and has
not lost to the American since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, fighting to finish the year as number one for a
record sixth consecutive time, is still certain to retain his
lead in the next ATP Tour rankings to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
By reaching the final, Krajicek, who lost to Czech Petr Korda
in the final last year, boosted his chances of a berth in the
season-ending ATP Tour world championship for the top eight
players, which starts on November 23 in Hanover, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Snooker Star Hong Kong's Asian Game's Gold Medal Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sports Writer Zhou Zongxin
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- With his silver-medal
performance last week at the British Grand Prix final in his
professional debut, snooker rookie sensation Marco Fu Ka-chun has
become one of Hong Kong's best, if not the top, hope for a gold
medal at the 13th Asian Games this December in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has not won any gold medal at the Asian Games ever
since its bowling victory in the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Fu finished runner-up after losing 9-2 to
world number nine Stephen Lee in the title clash at the Preston
event, where he became the first ever Asian player to reach the
final.
</P>
<P>
Fu has now joined Hong Kong's Olympic champion woman
windsurfer Lee Lai Shan and star cyclist Wong Kam Bo and others
as medal hopefuls at the Bangkok Games.
</P>
<P>
But Fu obviously does not want to press himself too much. "I
am hoping to win a medal at the Asian Games, although I can't
really say what color," he said when arriving in the new Hong
Kong International Airport after the British event.
</P>
<P>
"There are some good players and it really depends on how well
I play on the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among other Asian notables at the Bangkok Asian Games would be
Malaysia's Sam Chong and Shaukat Ali from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fu became the world's first ever player to win both
amateur world championships and under-21 youth world
championships in a same year.
</P>
<P>
The local Happy Valley Club's sensation is projected to meet
his Asian Games arch rival and world number three James Watana
Pu-Ob-Orm of Thailand at next month's British Championships in
Bournemouth. The championships is generally thought to be only
second to the world championships in prestige.
</P>
<P>
Although Fu said that he has a chance if he plays to his best,
he had to admit Watana has an edge over him in experience. The
meeting between the two could well be taken as an Asian Games
warm-up for them. Fu has lost to Watana 3-2 in their only
previous meeting, an exhibition match in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Fu complained the restriction brought about by a law passed by
the legislature in 1995 which forbids those under the age of 16
from entering any snooker hall at any time. "Young players should
not be restricted from practicing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu began his touch of the game at the age of eight, with the h
elp of one of his father's friends.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Hong Kong Billiard and Snooker Council said
that to further promote the sport, they would propose to set up a
systematic coaching system for up-and-coming players, with a
qualified coach probably from overseas.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Rwanda Court 1st Convict Ends Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The first convict of the
United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),
Jean-Paul Akayesu, has ended his nine-day hunger strike by eating
dinner.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the ICTR said Saturday that Akayesu
affirmed, in a letter to the Registrar of the Tribunal, that he
was ending his hunger strike and would utilize "the established
procedures" of the Tribunal to pursue his request for a counsel.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 25 other detainees in United Nations Detention
Facilities (UNDF) on the outskirts of Arusha in northern Tanzania
concluded their three-day hunger strike, which was aimed at
showing solidarity with Akayesu.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu, former Taba Mayor of Rwanda who was sentenced to a
life imprisonment by the Tribunal earlier this month for his role
in Rwanda's 1994 massacre, embarked on the hunger strike on
October 22 to pressure the Tribunal to appoint a lawer as his
defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
The detainees protested alleged denial of their human rights
in the assignment of the lawyers by the ICTR Registry.
</P>
<P>
However, Agwu Ukiwe Okali, the Registrar of the Tribunal,
fired back Tuesday by saying that the assignment of counsel is
his responsibility under the Tribunal's rules.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 individuals are detained in the UNDF, awaiting
their trial or appeal for their roles in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ICTR has indicted a total of 35 suspects since its
foundation by the United Nations following the Rwanda massacre in
April 1994 soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died
when his plane was shot down over the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were
reportedly killed in the three-month slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Pay Rise for English Manager Hoddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- English manager Glenn Hoddle
agreed Saturday an improved contract with the Football
Association with pay bonuses linked to England's performance in
Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Some reports say the England coach's annual salary, widely t
hought to be about 250,000 pounds, could rise by up to 40%, about
100,000.
</P>
<P>
The new deal is the result of pay negotiations which were
planned before England's recent run of disappointing performances
in Euro 2000 qualifiers and the resulting media criticism of
Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
The FA appear to have stemmed any possible criticism of giving
an under-fire coach such a rise by making the majority of the
increase- possibly as much as 75% of the extra money - dependent
upon results.
</P>
<P>
An FA statement said: "His new financial package is related
success to success in Euro 2000. He has been promised new
financial rewards the further England progress."
</P>
<P>
The pressure on Hoddle grew following the goalless draw
against Bulgaria and the much-criticised performance in the 3-0
victory against the part-timers of Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
However, despite earlier indications that concerns had been
expressed by some members of the FA's international committee
about Hoddle's World Cup diary and his use of faith healer Eileen
Drewery,his employers have reaffirmed their support for him.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the FA Chief Executive, Graham Kelly said
that he understood the "sensitivities" of offering Hoddle a pay
rise designed to put him more in line with other international
coaches.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the new deal on Saturday he
said:"It's time for everybody to get behind Glenn and the England
players.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody pretends that recent results have been everything we
had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
"But we have a real chance of success in Euro 2000 and with
Glenn, everybody at the FA believes we can achieve that success,
"he added.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle also attempted to focus attention on the future rather
than the past as he said: "I'm glad to be able to get on with the
job of winning for England.
</P>
<P>
"I know how much it means to the country that we are
successful.Nobody is more determined to achieve that success than
I am."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle had previously defended his right to a pay rise despite
England's demise since the World Cup by revealing that he turned
down the chance to almost treble his salary just a couple of
months ago if he had accepted a longer-term deal.
</P>
<P>
However, he has already agreed with the FA that he will not
even consider extending his current contract, which runs to year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Dublin Fined for Refusing to Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Dion Dublin was fined two
weeks'wages for refusing to play for Coventry as the battle for
his signature hots up.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old England striker, who looks set to join Aston
Villa this weekend for more than 5 million pounds, would not risk
turning out against Luton Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was worried that a possible injury in the Worthington Cup
tie,which Coventry lost, would wreck his chances of a transfer.
</P>
<P>
As a result Coventry boss Gordon Strachan has docked him a
fortnight's pay - around 40,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Dublin has also been dropped from the team to play Arsenal on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If you play, you get paid. Simple enough, I don't think many
people will quibble with that," said Strachan.
</P>
<P>
"My main complaint is that I offered some sort of compromise.
I asked him to play at Luton or, at least, to tell the rest of
the players why he chose not to.
</P>
<P>
"Dion said he couldn't even think about playing because he
might pick up an injury that could jeopardise any move.
</P>
<P>
"That about says it all. With that in mind, the club felt it
reasonable to fine him two weeks' wages.
</P>
<P>
"This has all gone on a bit longer than I would have wanted. I
offered him the chance to play at Luton or, as skipper, explain
why he couldn't. He chose not to and I told him exactly what I
thought.
</P>
<P>
"The following morning. I spoke to him and told him not to
bother to turn up for training until everyone else had left.
</P>
<P>
"To me, he is not interested and he doesn't want to play. I
hate to get into this situation with a player like Dion, but what
can you do?" he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson has spoken about his
frustration at missing out on Dublin after he switched his
attention to Welsh international Nathan Blake, who joined Rovers
for 4.25m on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed because I had a very good feeling about
Dion and a very good conversation with him where he was extremely
positive, not about myself but the club in general," Hodgson
said.

<HEADLINE> Coventry Steward Died After Being Hit by Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The English premier league
match between Coventry and champions Arsenal was marred by
accident on Saturday when a steward was died in an accident
involving the Arsenal team coach.
</P>
<P>
The steward died from head injuries after being crushed as the
bus - with the Arsenal team on board - turned into Coventry
City's Highfield Road ground shortly before 2pm.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics tried to save the man - believed to be in his late
30s- by administering heart massage, before he was rushed to the
Coventry and Warwick Hospital.
</P>
<P>
A West Midlands Police spokesman said: "There was an incident
involving the Arsenal team coach and a full-time member of the
Coventry City Football Club security staff.
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances of this incident are still being
investigated by police but it appears there was a collision
between the coach and the man, who was taken to hospital with
serious head injuries and has subsequently died."
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Bob Minshull confirmed the Arsenal players were
on the coach when the tragedy happened.
</P>
<P>
But the officer said they were probably unaware of the
seriousness of the accident.
</P>
<P>
"It appears the coach was reversing into the main entrance
when it came into contact with the member of staff.
</P>
<P>
"He sustained a very serious head injury and despite being
treated both at the scene and in hospital, he died shortly before
3pm."
</P>
<P>
The victim's identity would not be release until his relatives
have been informed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Minshull said the driver of the coach would be interviewed in
due course along with witnesses at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Graham Hover, Coventry club secretary said: "We are treating
this seriously and are saddened by what has happened.
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to the relatives of this man, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Ken Fryer, director of current champions Arsenal, said another
coach would be arriving at the stadium after the match to take
the players back to London.
</P>
<P>
He said the coach involved in the accident would remain at the
scene to help with police investigations.

<HEADLINE> More Heavy Rain Coming At Weekend, Warn Forecasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Police are warning people living
near stretches of rivers in England and Wales to stand by for
evacuation, as more heavy rain is coming over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 flood warnings -- 10 of them in the serious red
category -- are in place and emergency services are gearing up for
the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Agency said that the situation would be
critical until after the weekend. The worst affected rivers
include the Severn and the Wye.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the Middlands and Wales are still under threat, and 62
warnings are in force, including 13 red warnings, with more than
half in the Midlands, it added.
</P>
<P>
The agency has also asked sightseers to keep away from the
Severn Valley for their own safety as locals struggle with some of
the worst floodings there since the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Met Office said its records showed that not since the
hurricane which battered much of Britain 11 years ago had the
country suffered such high rainfall in October.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend insurers in the City said the cost of floods in
South Wales alone wound be about 100 million pounds (160 million
U.S. dollars). But with the red flood warnings, insurers fear the
cost could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Tarling, a spokesman for the Association of British
Insurers, said, "It is hard to predict the final cost of these
floods. If the rains continue, then we can expect to see a lot
more claims coming in over the weekend."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Mbeki Denies Row With Mandela Over TRC (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Saturday denied a newspaper report that he
snubbed President Nelson Mandela on how to handle the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's ruling African National Congress (ANC) Thursday tried
in vain to block the publication of the TRC's final report,
sections of which blamed the ANC for gross human rights
violations in its struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Mbeki's office said at no point did Mbeki in
his capacity as ANC president interact with Mandela on the
intention of the ANC to interdict the TRC.
</P>
<P>
"The deputy president wishes to put on record that it was ANC
Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe who briefed President Nelson
Mandela, as a matter of courtesy, of the intention of the ANC to
interdict the TRC to ensure its views are heard before the
finalization of the report," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, President Nelson Mandela was not expected to
and did not express an opinion on the intentions of the ANC to
interdict the TRC. The suggestion therefore that President Nelson
Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki had differences of opinion on
this approach is devoid of all truths."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said it had always been the intention of the ANC and
other political parties to protect Mandela from interacting with
the TRC process from a party political platform.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday Star newspaper splashed a front page story
entitled "Mbeki 'Overruled" Mandela on TRC", saying Mbeki ignored
Mandela's feelings in handling the TRC issue.
</P>
<P>
It also said Mbeki's stand had alienated many of his comrades
in the organization's policy-making National Executive Committee,
a number of whom had phoned TRC chairman Desmond Tutu to
apologize for the ANC leader's conduct.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said: "As the country's future president, Mbeki
was seen to be trying to suppress sections of a public inquiry
because it would have damaged the image of his organization."
</P>
<P>
In receiving the TRC report, Mandela said he accepted it with
all its imperfections. But Mbeki harshly attacked the report
after its release, saying it was "wrong, wrong and misguided."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also denied allegations by the newspaper that ANC
National Chairman Patrick Lekota phoned Tutu to apologize. Mbeki
said he was informed by Lekota, who is overseas, that Lekota had
rather requested his office, as chairperson of the National
Council of Provinces, to express an appreciation to the TRC on
the completion of its work.

<P>
In the statement, Mbeki showed no sign of softening his
position on the TRC report.
</P>
<P>
"Deputy President Mbeki says no member of his organization,
the ANC, can ever concur with the scurrilous attempts to
criminalize the liberation struggle, by characterizing the heroic
struggles of the people of South Africa which brought about the
dawn of peace, democracy and justice, as gross human rights
violations."
</P>
<P>
The remarks are obviously referring to suggestions of the
Saturday Star report that the ANC leadership is divided over the
handling of the TRC report.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe on Saturday also denied that Mbeki had snubbed
Mandela. He said the ANC's decision to take the TRC to court was
actually sanctioned by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"There is no substance in allegations that Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki snubbed President Mandela... these reports that
attribute statements to anonymous persons are difficult to go by
as they might be a creation of the journalists themselves," South
African Press Association quoted Motlanthe as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe said the decision was made Wednesday when the party
received a letter from the TRC that its submissions in response
to the commission's detrimental findings against it were late and
would not be considered.
</P>
<P>
"At that point on Wednesday we put our heads together and
decided the only option we had was to go to court and argue on an
urgent basis so that the TRC could consider our submission.
</P>
<P>
"I telephoned the president (Mandela) and informed him of our
decision."
</P>
<P>
The president, Motlanthe said, okayed the move and said: "If
it doesn't work then we have to wait and see."
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe complained that his party had not been treated
fairly by the TRC.
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC's request for an audience with the TRC was
turned down. "Right up to October 26 (acting TRC chairman Dumisa)
Ntsebeza reassured us that they had also discovered those errors
(in the TRC report concerning the ANC) and these would be
corrected in the process of editing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released on October 29.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe said despite losing the court case, the ANC would
continue to fight for the correction of the inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the violations said to have been committed by us were
survival techniques which should have been taken in a historical
context.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to ensure that the glorious part of our
struggle should not be depicted in such a way that our future
generations will be ashamed of it. Our struggle must not be
equated to apartheid," said Motlanthe.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices up Sharply in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The price of leaded petrol in
Zimbabwe has shot up by 66.7 percent, while diesel has gone up by
67.9 percent with effect from Saturday due to the fall of the
Zimbabwean Dollar against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The national oil company said in a statement that the price of
diesel per liter went up from 4.86 Zimbabwean Dollars (0.13 U.S.
Dollar) to 8.10 Zimbabwean Dollars (0.22 Dollar), while leaded
petrol was up from 5.8 Zimbabwean Dollars (0.165 Dollar) to 9.67
Zimbabwean Dollars (0.27 Dollar).
</P>
<P>
The continued slide in the exchange rate, said the company,
"has had adverse effect on about 90 percent of the company's
elements which are denominated in foreign currency."
</P>
<P>
The company has for some time been accumulating losses due to
the fact that it has been selling its products at prices far
below the procurement costs, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the company's continued viability and to
restore operating cash flows which were required to service the
company's offshore facilities for fuel imports, the government
had also approved three-monthly price adjustments.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the Zimbabwean Dollar has been devalued about
90 percent against major currencies.

<HEADLINE> OAU Backs W.A. Mechanism for Conflict Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) supports the west African mechanism for conflict
resolution being considered at the on-going 21st summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said Friday at the
opening session of the summit being held in Nigerian capital
Abuja that the mechanism should emphasize nipping problems in the
bud before they bloom into full scale war, the Pan-African News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On conflicts in west Africa, Salim said the peace achieved in
Liberia after a seven-year civil war should be consolidated to
make "Liberia an African success."
</P>
<P>
He urged more international support for Sierra Leone where
remnants of an ousted junta are still fighting the legitimate
government.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief noted that the situation in Guinea Bissau
"remains of concern" because of its implications on regional
peace and security, and also because it is the "humanitarian
tragedy".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government sent two aircraft Friday to bring both
leaders of the conflict in Guinea Bissau to the two-day summit to
negotiate an end to the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the 16-nation ECOWAS entered its second day
Saturday with the crisis in Guinea Bissau as one of the major
issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Delegates said there had been consultations at various levels
since the arrival of the Bissau delegations to try to iron out
the ticking points including reaching another cease-fire after
the one reached in August collapsed three weeks ago, and the
withdrawal of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting said while Guinea appeared to accept
rebel leader General Ansumane Mane's call to withdraw its troops
from Bissau, Senegal is reluctant because of the secessionist
problem in southern Zuiguinchor region.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Senegal have sent troops to Guinea Bissau to
support President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government.

JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat will head a committee to
prepare for annulling the clauses in the Palestinian national
charter that call for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a Palestinian official as saying Saturday
that the decision was made during a Palestinian cabinet meeting
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the preparatory committee will also
include Palestinian National Council (PNC) Chairman Salem Zanoun,
and Secretary General of Palestinian Liberation Organization's
Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement signed last Friday between Israel and
the Palestinians, Israel will withdraw its troops from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank while the PNC and other Palestinian
groups meet to cancel anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 national
charter.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the meeting should be held within
six weeks after the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement won approvals among a majority of Palestinian
cabinet members on Friday night. But Israel has yet to ratify the
deal, which is scheduled to be implemented Monday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Making Deal with Germany over Hofer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday denied holding any
talk with Germany over the fate of German national Helmut Hofer
who was sentenced to death for having a relationship outside of
marriage with an Iranian Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told the official
news agency IRNA that Hofer's case is a judicial one and the
Iranian judiciary is the only competent body to deal with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Some reports have said that Iran was negotiating with Germany
linking Hofer's fate with an Iranian national Kazem Darabi who is
serving in a German jail. No reports were available about Darabi's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Iran is completely against politicization of
Hofer's case and German officials have been informed times and
again that efforts by certain circles in Germany to politicize
the case are merely aimed at further complicating the situation.
</P>
<P>
Hofer, a German businessman, was arrested in September, 1997
at Tehran international airport upon his arrival from Germany
with an Iranian woman who was waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to death by a local court in Tehran in January.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant Iranian laws, non-Muslim men are
forbidden to have any sexual relations with Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer lodge an appeal by claiming that he has
converted to Islam before meeting the Iranian woman and the
Iranian supreme court is reviewing the case.

<HEADLINE> Yavlinsky: Russia, One of Five Most Corrupt Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky
said Saturday that Russia ranks among the five most corrupt
countries in the world, and urged the government to work in
earnest to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of his movement, Yavlinsky said he "is
virtually ready" to submit a list of government officials with
evidence of links to commercial structures, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, whose accusation of government corruption earlier
this week drew fire from many politicians, said corruption in
Russia was common knowledge among its citizens. He cited official
statistics that 40 percent of the country's production output came
from the shadow economy.
</P>
<P>
"No economic reform is feasible with such a huge level of
corruption," Yavlinsky said. "If corruption is the main business
law, it does not matter what a government program says."
</P>
<P>
"What really matters is that it will never be put into action,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov
was among the government officials named as involved in
corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, Anto Surikov, Maslyukov's spokesman, said Yavlinsky's
remarks about corruption were "resolutely baseless" and "shallow,"
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In charging the Russian government with corruption and buying
of posts, Yavlinsky focused on government officials associated to
the left.
</P>
<P>
"It was precisely in this context that Maslyukov himself was
named," the spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky's accusations first appeared Wednesday in an
interview with Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said that key government officials bought their posts and
some of the most influential ministers had links with "corrupt
circles."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Govt Cars From Roaming Freely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Dar Regional Commander
Yusuf Makamba has directed local police to impound all unlabeled
government and public organization vehicles as well as those
found on streets after 6:00 p.m. without special permits.
</P>
<P>
Makamba's directive is in line with a presidential circular
which forbids government-owned vehicles to roam in the streets
freely for private use because it is a corrupt behavior.
</P>
<P>
The directive, which was given at the weekend, requires all
government and public organization vehicles to bear visible
labels on both sides and not to operate after the 6:00 p.m.
deadline or on Saturdays and Sundays unless they are authorized.
</P>
<P>
The directive also demands all government and public
organization vehicles have functioning speedometers.
</P>
<P>
Makamba directed the police to carry out the directive
permanently and urged district commissioners to supervise its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Benjamin Mkapa said excessive use of
government vehicles by officials in Tanzania, one of the poorest
countries in the world, is not understood by donors and common

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Permanent Cease-fire in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Saturday that Iran welcomes real and permanent
cease-fire in Afghanistan to give way to comprehensive talks
between belligerent sides.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran expects to see a broad-based government
representing all ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following reports said that the Afghan
Taliban militia, which have controlled over 90 percent of
Afghanistan, would likely agree to a cease-fire in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia force, ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani in 1996 after taking capital Kabul. The
fighting between the Taliban and the Rabbani-led North Alliance is
raging around the country.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed Iran has been harboring the opinion that war
in Afghanistan should come to a halt and the belligerent sides
should settle their differences through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's current stance towards the Taliban, he
noted that "we have some demands which have been made known
explicitly."
</P>
<P>
The demands include Taliban's all-out cooperation in speedy
identification and punishment of the murderers who killed eight
Iranian diplomats and a reporter, and the release of the
remaining Iranian nationals held by Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were captured by the Taliban after it seized
Afghan northern city of Mazari Sharif in August. The Taliban later
admitted that its men killed the diplomats and the reporter of the
official Iranian news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Following the killings, Iran massed more than 200,000 troops
along its eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that the Taliban's behavior is not at all
acceptable and Iran will not at all allow the Taliban to misuse
the patience and prudence of Iranian officials or delay
fulfilling the responsibility entrusted to the militia group.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend the Taliban to immediately meet the demands
of the international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran radio said that the Iranian army is to launch
military maneuvers in border areas near Afghanistan Saturday
night, the biggest one ever since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Earlier statements by the army have said that the maneuvers
will be carried out in a area of 5,000 square kilometers with
participation of 200,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers have been scheduled to start by end of September,
but were postponed after the U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi
succeeded in persuading the Taliban to return the remains of
killed Iranians and release 51 Iranians detained earlier this
month.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Kuwait Sign Agreement on Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Kuwait signed an
agreement here Saturday to expand cooperation in fighting drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the leader of a high-ranking
delegation from the Kuwaiti police and, Mohammad Fallah, secretary
of Iran's anti-drug headquarters, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not give further details about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the Kuwaiti delegation has called for the exchange of
information with Iran in combating drug smuggling while the
Iranian side voiced their readiness to cooperate with relevant
Kuwaiti officials in the field.
</P>
<P>
Iran started its strict campaign against drug trafficking in
1989 after the Iranian Majlis (Parliament) passed an anti-drug
law, which imposes capital punishment on those who were caught
with 30 grams of heroin or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Iran is facing raging drug trafficking as it is considered by
smugglers one of the best routes to transfer narcotics from
southwestern Afghanistan's "Golden Crescent", which borders
northeastern Iran, to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Separation of Delinquents, Adult Criminals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Prison Service of Zambia
warned here Saturday that crime will be out of control if the
juvenile delinquents who commit minor offenses continue being
mixed with the hard-core adult criminals in prison.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Prisons Philip Sinyangwe said at the opening
of a seminar on the status of juveniles that juveniles mixed with
adult prisoners do not reform in any way after serving their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
He said the Prison Service has no resources to transport
juveniles who commit crimes in various parts of the country to
Katombora reformatory school in Southern Province.
</P>
<P>
The juveniles hence end up in serving their sentences sharing
rooms in prisons with the adults due to lack of space, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also complained of poor conditions in the prisons, adding
that prison staff are made to face the same inhuman conditions
that prisoners confront such as lack of transport and food.
</P>
<P>
Sinyangwe called on the government to support prisons and not
to depend entirely on the donor community.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Iraqi Suspension of Inspection, Serious Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Saturday that Iraq's suspension of cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors was a "serious matter."
</P>
<P>
"We view this as a serious matter," said U.S. National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy. "The president's national security
team will meet this afternoon to review the situation and an
appropriate course of action."
</P>
<P>
Leavy said that the United States was currently consulting with
its allies and officials at the United Nations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it was suspending all cooperations with U.N. arms
inspectors and monitors until the United Nations Security Council
reviewed the lifting of sanctions and purges its teams of
"American spies and agents."
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it had made the decision because of "unjust" sweeping
trade sanctions imposed by the Security Council shortly after
Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq suspended cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), barring them from carrying out on-the-spot
inspections to new sites. However, their monitoring activities
were still allowed.
</P>
<P>
The new decision would not applied to the IAEA, Iraq said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Iraq
Liberation Act of 1998 that makes clear the United States supports
elements within the Iraqi opposition who advocate a democratic
future for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The United States wants Iraq to rejoin the family of nations
as a freedom-loving and law-abiding member," Clinton said in a
statement announcing he had signed the act.
</P>
<P>
Just days ago Clinton signed a spending bill that made eight
million U.S. dollars available for assistance to the Iraqi
democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
"The United States looks forward to a democratically supported
regime that would permit us to enter into a dialogue leading to
the reintegration of Iraq into normal international life," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the meantime, his administration would pursue
"active application of all relevant United Nations Security
Council resolutions."

<HEADLINE> Israel Holds Official Memorial Ceremony for Rabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel held memorial
activities, including a state ceremony, on Sunday to mark the third
anniversary of the killing of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
with the call for carrying on the peace process he pioneered.
</P>
<P>
"Rabin has contributed his whole life to the Mideast peace
process and we must carry on this process," said former Israeli
Defense Force's Chief of General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak while
addressing the state ceremony at Rabin's grave side at Mount Herzl.
</P>
<P>
"It was Rabin's wish that the peace process be moved forward
and we must continue this great cause left behind by Rabin," said
Lipkin-Shahak, who was personally chosen by Rabin's wife, Leah
Rabin, as the keynote speaker at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We really want peace instead of terrorism, and we will never
let such kind of assassination occur again," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
other cabinet ministers and military leader as well as major
political leaders and representatives of all walks of life,
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Other ceremonies were also held in Israel for Rabin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Student representatives from all high schools of Israel
gathered Sunday morning at Jerusalem Theater to discuss Rabin's
contributions to peace.
</P>
<P>
A memorial candle-lighting ceremony was held at the President's
residence, during which Weizman pledged to use his office to
continue the fight for peace.
</P>
<P>
Letters from Jordan's King Hussein and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat were read out at the candle-lighting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said in the letters that the peace for which Rabin
gave up his life will be attained.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Knesset (parliament) is to hold a special session
later on Sunday in honor of Rabin and Weizman. Netanyahu and
Knesset speaker Dan Tichon will address the session.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Israelis gathered Saturday evening at the
Rabin's Square in Tel Aviv, where Rabin was assassinated by a
right-wing extremist on November 4, 1995, to commemorate the slain
leader.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Shenhua Pocket First League Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Shenhua fulfilled a
dream to pocket home their first league cup title after they beat
Liaoning Tianrun 2-1 in a second leg match on Sunday here,
winning 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The victory made up Shenhua's league competition
disappointment wherein the defending champions Dalian Wanda
snatched the title with 17 points ahead of the Shanghai side, who
had to be content with second place.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, who will rejoin the first division next season two
years after their dropping from the top fleets, upset Dalian on
penalty shoot-out in a controversial semifinal match.
</P>
<P>
But the side from northeast of China found that they were not
a class against Shanghai either in technical or tactical skills
after they made the finals.
</P>
<P>
Xie Hui's 20-minute header easily found the net after Mao
Yijun cut inside from left flank and floated the ball into the
area.
</P>
<P>
The visitors defense line was in shatter when Shanghai's
defender Wu Chengying broke through to set a delicate cross to B
razilian Massilo, whose goal gave a 2-0 lead to the home side in
the 37th minute.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuyin put Liaoning back into the game after he scored in
the 48th minute and a disallowance of a goal in the 63rd minute
gave the "Northeast Tigers" a new hope, which they eventually
lost.
</P>
<P>
Referee awarded Liaoning a penalty in the 75 minutes which
cause a short suspension as Shanghai protested harshly. But the
shot was saved by Shanghai's goalkeeper Ou Chuliang and Shenhua
continued their feat to win the match.

<HEADLINE> Besenyei Triumphs as Aerobatics Grand Prix Ends in Farce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Peter Besenyei of Hungary
claimed the overall title as the FAI Chia Cup aerobatics grand
prix rang down the curtain on a farcical note here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drizzly weather, which forced the cancellation of the
first two days' competition of this leg, cleared up on Sunday,
allowing the competition to carry on with the last day of the
whole grand prix.
</P>
<P>
But only after the third contestant pilot took off, over
20,000 spectators rampaged onto the cordoned runway and defied
any police attempts to drive them away. The organizing committee
had no way but call off the competition.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people standing on the runway," said
competition press official Hu Dalin, "and they refused to leave,
obstructing the planes to take off. The organizing committee,
concerned with the security, had to cancel the competition. It is
the lookers-on that bust up a excellent performance for
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Besenyei, 42, who garnered a 54 overall tally points in the
first seven legs, was automatically crowned as the final champion.
</P>
<P>
The lanky Hungarian was followed by Russian Nikolay Timofeev
on 44, with another Russian Viktor Tchmal third on 42.
</P>
<P>
Besenyei,the inventor of knife-edge spin skill which is now
very popular in aerobatics, showed great edge in interpreting the
accompanying music in the whole competition.
</P>
<P>
The grand prix, hailed by FAI president Eilif Ness as the
greatest festival of competitive aerobatics ever held, covered an
odyssey of over 2,000 kilometers and drew the top 24 finishers of
the world championships held last August.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Makes First Direct Threat Against PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- In its first direct threat
against the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Hamas' military
wing warned Sunday that infighting has begun among the
Palestinians, calling on PNA President Yasser Arafat to spare the
Palestinians a "civil war."
</P>
<P>
This move came as the PNA is launching a campaign to round up
Hamas activists following a suicide bombing attack in Gaza last
week.
</P>
<P>
It raised concerns that a direct conflict between Arafat's
government and the Islamic militant group could make it difficult
to move ahead with the implementation of the newly-signed
land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security
apparatus have reached the point of treason," read a leaflet
signed by the Hamas military wing, the Izzedine al Qassem
brigades, and faxed to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The beginning of infighting has appeared, and no one can put
out its fire," the leaflet said, calling on Arafat to halt the
ongoing crackdown on Hamas so as to spare Palestinians "the
horrors...of a civil war."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials declined to comment on the
leaflet.
</P>
<P>
Since Thursday's terror attack outside a Jewish settlement in
Gaza, in which one Israeli soldier and the attacker were killed
when a Palestinian car loaded with explosives blew up after
hitting an Israeli military jeep, the PNA has launched an
unprecedented crackdown on Hamas.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Hamas activists, including several senior
members, have been arrested and Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin has been placed under a house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, holding Hamas responsible for the suicide bombing,
has vowed to confront any attempt to destroy the peace process by
violence.
</P>
<P>
Yassin has criticized Arafat for signing the interim
agreement, under which the PNA will take tougher measures to fight
terrorism in exchange for a 13 percent withdrawal from the West
Bank by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeated its demand in the last few days that
Palestinian security forces arrest Mohammed Deif, one of the
leaders of Hamas' military wing.
</P>
<P>
Israel believed that Deif, who it considered as Hamas No.1
fugitive, was behind the terror attack in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leaflet, however, warned that "anyone who allows
himself to plan or conspire against the hero Deif or any of our
holy warriors will pay a high price."

Kafelnikov 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 to win the Eurocard Open for the second

The victory made Krajicek one of the top favorites for one of

weeks of tennis before the championship.

Krajicek, who had ousted fifth-ranked Andre Agassi and No. 1
Pete Sampras en route to the final, was devastating against
Kafelnikov.
</P>

Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, entered the tournament
ranked 11th, but his second title of the year is likely to push
him into the top 10 when the new computer rankings come out
Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Monitoring Center Director to Leave Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Director of U.N. Baghdad
Monitoring and Verification Center Nels Karlstrom said Sunday that
he would leave Baghdad on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom told reporters that his departure had nothing to do
with the Iraqi decision to halt all cooperations with the United
Nations Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom, a Swedish, said he had been in Iraq for 18 months,
and that his third six-month contract with UNSCOM had come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom said his deputy Jaakko Ylitalo, a Finn who has
worked as U.N. arms inspector for six years, would be the acting
director before a new director is named.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Iraq on Sunday morning provided escorts for
two monitoring teams working for the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA). But no escort was available for UNSCOM monitoring
teams.
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom said that U.N. monitoring cameras and electronic
sensors continued to function, as Iraq announced on Saturday
evening that it would not dismantle these monitoring equipments.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on Saturday decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with UNSCOM as of Saturday, saying the decision will
not be rescinded before the U.N. Security Council considers the
lifting of sanctions imposed on it for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
It also set other conditions for revoking its decision,
including the removal of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler and
restructuring of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq will allow IAEA to continue its mission,
"should its activity be fully independent from activities of
UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned
the Iraqi decision and urged Iraq to rescind "immediately and
unconditionally" its decision and the decision of August 5 to
limit cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 suspended partial cooperation with UNSCOM
and IAEA, barring them from carrying out on-the-spot inspections
to new sites. However, their monitoring activities were then
still going on.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the United States and "its agents" in
UNSCOM for blocking the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian foreign ministry has
expressed "deep concern" over Iraq's decision Saturday to
terminate the U.N. Special Commission's activity on its territory.
</P>
<P>
In a press release circulated Sunday, the ministry said
Baghdad's move "can foil further efforts to settle the Iraqi
problem" and "goes against" its agreements with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, reached earlier in the year, "were opening
prospects for lifting (U.N.) sanctions on Iraq," it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expressed the hope that Baghdad will once again
scrupulously weigh all negative consequences of its decision.
</P>
<P>
"Only the resumption of constructive cooperation with the
United Nations, first of all its Special Commission, can settle
the Iraqi problem and bring life back to normal in that country,"
it said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Against Linking Cyprus Problem to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has warned that any
attempt to link a settlement of the Cyprus problem to the
country's European Union (EU) accession talks will make a solution
impossible.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides made the remarks
Sunday at Larnaca Airport before his departure for Greece, the
first stop of his four-nation European tour to discuss Cyprus'
efforts to join the EU and the developments in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
His words came in response to statements made by some EU
members that associate the Cyprus question to the country's EU
membership course.
</P>
<P>
"If the Cyprus problem and the EU accession course are
officially associated, this would constitute an invitation to
Turkey, but not allow a settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a move will also not facilitate EU's efforts to bring
Turkey closer to Europe, "as the EU itself has stated, the Cyprus
issue is one of the important obstacles in forging closer ties
with Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application to the EU for membership in
1990. The EU started accession talks with Cyprus in March of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal formula, but the Turkish Cypriots opted out
of the peace talks last year to protest against a EU decision to
begin accession talks with Cyprus while scrap Turkey from its
immediate membership candidates list.
</P>
<P>
Leader of Turkish Cypriot Rauf Denktash has vowed that he will
not resume talks with Greek Cypriot-dominated government unless it
withdraws from the accession course.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his talks with Greek officials, Kasoulides said the
two sides will discuss "the situation in the Cyprus problem and
Cyprus' EU accession course."
</P>
<P>
After his visit to Athens, Kasoulides will travel on to Spain,
Britain before flying to Brussels on November 8 to hold
substantive accession talks with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Newspapers Hail Decision over UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Newspapers Sunday hailed
their leadership's decision to freeze all activities in the
country of the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra Daily, organ of the ruling Arab Socialist Baath
Party, described the decision as "sound and great," saying the
Iraqi people have known well the dubious and filthy games
practicized by UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that the Iraqi people, who have been
suffering a lot under the eight-year U.N. embargo, are fully
supporting the decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will not lift the sanctions, imposed
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, unless UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq has eliminated all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of serving the U.S. interests and
trying to prolong the devastating sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The daily lashed out at the Security Council, saying "this
council is still subjected to the U.S. pressures and there is no
hope to emancipate itself from this pressure and to adopt a fair
position."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision to suspend all relations with UNSCOM Saturday
came a day after the Security Council decided to conduct a
"comprehensive review" of Iraq's progress on eliminating banned
weapons as soon as Baghdad resumes cooperation with weapon
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The council did not accede to Iraq's demand that the review
lead directly to the removal of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that the ban will continue "until the United Nations
looks at the issue in an honest and positive way, leading to
Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Al-Qadissiya Daily castigated the Security Council for "its
silence vis-a-vis the UNSCOM conducts and crocked styles hostile
to Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Such stand by the Security Council demonstrated a fact
which President Saddam Hussein had emphasized that the embargo
would never be lifted only by the will of Iraqis and not
by the normal path," said the daily.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects U.N. Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Sunday rejected the
presidential statement of the U.N. Security Council which
condemned Iraq's decision to halt all cooperations with the
U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan made the statement
after inaugurating the 31st Baghdad International Fair on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Ramadhan said Iraq would not allow arms
inspectors and monitors working for UNSCOM to enter any monitoring
sites.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that Iraq demands the lifting of
U.N. economic sanctions since Iraq has fulfilled all its
obligations toward U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning in front of the U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and
Verification Center, Iraq provided escorts only for monitors
working for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and no
escort was available to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on Saturday evening that it would not expel
U.N. weapons inspectors in spite of its decision to freeze all
the activities of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on Saturday decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with UNSCOM as of Saturday, saying the decision will
not be rescinded before the U.N. Security Council considers the
lifting of sanctions imposed on it more than eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
It also set other conditions for revoking its decision,
including the removal of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler and
restructuring of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the joint meeting said the decision
would not be applied to IAEA, "should its activity be fully
independent from activities of UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council convened an emergency session on
Saturday evening to discuss the Iraqi decision to halt all forms
of cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Council unanimously condemned the Iraqi move and urged
Iraq to rescind "immediately and unconditionally" its decision and
the decision of August 5 to limit cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 suspended partial cooperation with UNSCOM and
IAEA, barring them from carrying out on-the-spot inspections to
new sites. However, their monitoring activities through cameras
and electronic sensors in the old sites continued normally.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the United States and "its agents" in
UNSCOM for blocking the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Setup of Broad-based Government in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami underlined Sunday the need to establish a broad-based
government in Afghanistan to put an end to the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remarks in meeting with visiting Tajik Foreign
Minister Talbak Nazarov, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the only solution to end the (warring) situation
in Afghanistan is to establish a broad-based government
representing all ethnic groups in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The fightings between the Taliban militia and the Northern
Alliance led by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani that are
raging around Afghanistan have caused countless damage to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the crisis in Afghanistan is not only a cause
of concern for its neighbors, such as Iran and Tajikistan, what
the Taliban is doing in the name of Islam is also dangerous for
the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khatami highlighted cooperation between Iran and
Tajikistan in solving regional problems with the assistance of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the United Nations and
the Economic Cooperation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Given historical, cultural and linguistic ties between Iran and
Tajikistan, Khatami said that both countries, as guardians of
Persian language and culture, should try to attain a remarkable
position in international arena through cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran favors a strong, independent and
developed Tajikistan, saying that this will benefit the Tajik
nation and the whole region as well.
</P>
<P>
Nazarov, who arrived here Saturday afternoon, expressed
satisfaction with his talks with Iranian officials and called
for expansion and consolidation of ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Finance Corporation to Invest More in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) is looking to double its investment in private
sector projects in Sri Lanka from 25 million U.S. dollars to 50
million in two years, according to finance sources here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the target amount, 14 million dollars have already been made
in the 1998/99 financial year beginning June, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said future investment projects would be sourced
from sectors such as financial, infrastructure, information
technology and manufacturing and services sectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Housing finance, guaranteeing private sector bond issues,
investment in credit rating agency, commercial banking and in
institutions involved in developing the debt securities market are
sub-sectors under the broader financial sector, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Under infrastructure, investments would be sought in the
development of the Colombo Port and telecommunications while in
the information technology focus would be on software development.
</P>
<P>
Investments would also be made in viable private sector
projects involved in manufactured exports, business, healthcare
and education.
</P>
<P>
Despite internal and external constraints, significant growth
had taken place in Sri Lanka and conditions were stable enough to
continue their program of supporting the private sector, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The IFC has invested nearly 80 million U.S. dollars in Sri
Lanka since the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Commander Makes Flying Visit to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Afghan
government Ahmad Shah Masood made a flying visit to Iran, local
daily Tehran Times revealed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Masood arrived here Friday night and left on Saturday after
meeting several Iranian officials, including Iran's special envoy
on Afghan affairs Mohammad Ali Taherian, the report said.
</P>
<P>
No details were available about Masood's talks with Iranian
officials, the daily said, but quoting an informed source as
saying that "the talks were important given the current
development in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Masood came to Tehran just one day before Iran was to launch
military maneuvers, the biggest since Islamic revolution in 1979,
along the Afghan borders. About 200,000 military personnel are
taking part in the military exercises, apparently flexing muscles
to the hostile Afghan Taliban regime.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Masood's visit to Iran may also
be related to swaps of prisoners of wars (POW) between his forces
and the rival Taliban militia, which have occupied 90 percent
of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan commander under the ousted government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani has demanded to swap all POWs with the
Taliban, including senior officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Masood's side has submitted the Taliban a list of 650 POWs and
asked the Taliban to provide a similar list.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani diplomat residing in Iran told Xinhua correspondent
that several hundreds of Taliban POWs are being jailed in Mashhad,
the capital of Iran's northeastern province Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has demanded that Iran release their POWs after 51
Iranian hostages were set free during the past months with
mediation of the U.N. Secretary General's special envoy on Afghan
affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassador of Rabbani's government to Tehran denied
such a claim, saying that the Afghan government does not need
to keep the Taliban POWs in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Keep More Troops near Afghan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Sunday that the
majority of the troops participating in the ongoing maneuvers will
remain in its eastern region bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Iranian ground force Brig. Gen. Abdolali
Pourshasb made the remarks in Zabol in southeastern province of
Sistan-Baluchestan, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Pourshasb said these units will carry out special assignments,
but he did not say how many of them will remain in the border
area. "As long as security remains a concern in the region, the
troops will stay in the area with all might," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier statements by the army, some 200,000
troops will take part in the exercises starting Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, codenamed "Zulfaqar-2," had been scheduled for
late September amid tensions between Iran and the Afghan Taliban
forces triggered by the killing of nine Iranian diplomats and the
reporter in northern Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
The exercises were postponed after the U.N. special envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi succeeded in persuading the Taliban to return the
remains of the killed Iranians and release 51 others in its
captivity.
</P>
<P>
Pourshasb said that military activities in eastern Iran will
not stop after the ongoing war games end and more exercises will
be conducted in the future.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say how long the maneuvers will last.

<HEADLINE> Kampala Mayor's Wife Threatens Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Sarah Nabagesera Sebaggala,
wife of Kampala's embattled mayor Nasser Sebaggala, has
reportedly threatened a witness in the mayor case with death.
</P>
<P>
Richard Santo Apire, an official at Bank of Uganda, who is
expected to testify in the United States against the mayor,
had received threatening calls, Sunday Vision paper quoted Theodre
Chuang, assistant U.S. attorney as telling the court over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Kampala
shows that one of their witnesses there received threatening
calls from the accused's wife and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kelly, the defense counsel, however, did not respond to
the accusations by Chuang, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The court has sat for four hours to consider pre-trial motions
filed by both prosecution and defense. The motions related to the
selection of the jurors for the trial are to start on Monday, the
holding of separate trials for false declaration on the one hand
and other counts of band fraud on the other.
</P>
<P>
The wife of the mayor said she did not say anything to the
official in the bank and the bank spokesman Walugembe Musoke said
he had not heard about the threats either.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Sebaggala was arrested in the U.S. on June 13 for
making false customs declarations and using forged checks in a
Boston bank.
</P>
<P>
The mayor and his relatives have asked the court to release
the mayor so that he could perform his duties at home, a request
immediately denied by the court.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government was also asked to intervene for the his
release, but the government insisted that the case was based on a
private basis and therefore it could not do too much in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest of Sebaggala, his opponents have rekindled
another round of heated debate on his qualifications as mayor.
Sebaggala, who was elected mayor in April, is said to be short of
an A level certificate, a prerequisite for mayorship in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Coca Cola Plant to Be Built on Ugandan Army Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has agreed the construction of a new Coca Cola plant in
the southwestern district of Mbarara, which will be built on land
formerly owned by the army.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Vision reported that the Ugandan present persuaded the
Ministry of Defense to give away the larger chunk of the land
belonging to the barracks for the development of the plant. But
the report did not reveal when the work was done.
</P>
<P>
The army did not have to have so much land in the town,
Museveni was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni was critical of the use of town land for patty
farming, saying that it is a shame to see prisoners being used to
grow cassava and sweet potatoes on town land.
</P>
<P>
Land in town should be used for industrial development and not
for small time farming, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president congratulated the district leaders on
having successfully attracted such a largest and modern
investment to their area.
</P>
<P>
Mbarara is Museveni's home town and he said the new plant,
which will cost 15 million U.S. Dollars and employ some 300
workers, will push the district develop further.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also encouraged local leaders to stop bickering among
themselves and instead channel their energies into looking for
big ventures and attracting them to their district.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Faces Uphill Task in Champions Trophy Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan faces a daunting
task of resurrecting its hockey fortunes during the six-nation
20th Champions Trophy Hockey tournament which opened in Lahore on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's hockey has declined in the recent years, losing its
World Cup title at Utretch, the Nethelands this year, where it
finished fifth. It also put up a disappointing show at the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in September.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to regain its lost glory, Pakistan's Hockey
Federation has dropped several senior players like Shahbaz Ahmed,
Rahim Khan, Naveed Alam, Mohammad Shahbaz following the World Cup
debacle and has inducted new blood in the national team.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Khawaja Zakauddin has expressed confidence about
his team doing well in the eight-day tournament which has
attracted the top hockey playing nations of the Netherlands,
Spain, Australia, Germany and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, who initiated the Champions Trophy in 1978, lost its
first game against South Korea 3-4 on Saturday. It needs to win
the on-going tournament or it would be unable to contest the 21st
edition scheduled to be held in the Australian city of Brisbane
in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is hosting this event for the 10th time since 1978
and has won the trophy only three times, in 1978, 1980 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Olympic and world champions the Netherlands is aiming for a
unique triple crown in the on-going Champions Trophy Hockey
tournament. Since the initiation of this event, no team has ever
held three elite titles -- the Olympics, World Cup and Champions
Trophy, at one time.
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Roeland Oltmans said that "it will not be that
easy to achieve the triple crown and, although we have five top
players missing from the side that won the World Cup, I am sure
my team can do this."
</P>
<P>
All the participating teams are in rebuilding process after
the World Cup in May-June and are targetting the 2000 Olympics to
be held in Australia's largest city of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Australian coach Terry Walsh also agreed that all teams are
targetting the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Australia won the maiden
hockey title in the Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur in
September.
</P>
<P>
England opted out due to alleged security fears in Pakistan
and has been replaced by South Korea, who finished sixth in last
year's tournament. South Korea looks to gain rhythm before
defending their Asian title in Thailand next month.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Philippines to increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 tourists are
expected to arrive in the Philippines in the coming Christmas
season despite the currency crisis affecting the Philippines and
other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Sunday by the presidential office,
Daniel Corpuz, executive director of the Philippine Convention and
Visitors Corporation (PCVC), said the number of tourist arrivals
this year would exceed the 2.2 million mark posted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The expected increase in arrivals during the Christmas
holidays, Corpuz said, would offset the drop in the number of
tourists who visited the country at the height of the Philippine
Airlines (PAL) strike from June to August and its temporary
closure in September.
</P>
<P>
Corpuz said that from January to August 1998, the Department of
Tourism (DOT) posted a negative 1.26 percent growth in visitor
arrivals as compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse had it not been for "the good
performance we posted in the first and second quarter before the
PAL strike," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the regional currency crisis, the Philippine tourism
industry had achieved a five-year average growth rate of 12.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Admits Rift With Deputy President Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Saturday admitted that he and Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki had a difference of opinion over the findings of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), Sunday Times newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he backed the TRC's findings that the African
National Congress (ANC) was guilty of gross human rights
violations in the fight against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was speaking in a gathering of community leaders in
Kimberley, Northern Cape, as part of the ANC's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's remarks had contradicted ANC leadership denials that
the two leaders differed over the ANC's failed attempt to block
the publication of the TRC report.
</P>
<P>
Both Mbeki, who is ANC President, and ANC Secretary-General
Kgalema Motlanthe Saturday denied allegations that Mandela and
Mbeki have differences.
</P>
<P>
Mandela explained that he and Mbeki happened to respond
differently to the report depending on the information they had
when they prepared their responses. Whereas he had seen a full
copy of the report, Mbeki had only seen part of it.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy for me to be questioned about whether there is
a difference of opinion between me and Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki on the publishing of the report. There's no doubt that
Thabo Mbeki had good intentions and may have seen extracts of the
report. I am convinced my approach was correct and on the basis
that he may have not seen the report he responded on the
information he had."
</P>
<P>
In a damning indictment of the ANC's decision to take the
commission to court, Mandela said: "No doubt if the report had
been read, perhaps the responses of the ANC would have been
totally different."
</P>
<P>
He praised the work of the TRC, saying: "I am satisfied they
have done a good job, even if there are imperfections."
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said: "The ANC came out very well because the
truth commission says the primary responsibility for gross
violations of human rights falls squarely on the apartheid
government.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was fighting a just war, but in the course of fighting
the just war, it committed gross violations of human rights.
Nobody can deny that because some people died in our camps and
that's what the TRC said."
</P>
<P>
This is clearly contradict to what Mbeki said through his
office on Saturday: "Deputy President Mbeki says no member of his
organization, the ANC, can ever concur with the scurrilous
attempts to criminalize the liberation struggle, by
characterizing the heroic struggles of the people of South Africa
which brought about the dawn of peace, democracy and justice, as
gross human rights violations."
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe also shared Mbeki's opinion. "We will continue to
ensure that the glorious part of our struggle should not be
depicted in such a way that our future generations will be
ashamed of it. Our struggle must not be equated to apartheid," he
told South African Press Association Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe also said the ANC's decision to take the TRC to
court was actually sanctioned by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The ANC brought an urgent plea to the Cape Town High Court
Wednesday to try to prevent the publication of the TRC report
scheduled for Thursday. But the court ruled against it and the
report was released as scheduled in Pretoria.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Angola Call for Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Angola have called
on all the warring factions in Congo (K) to pursue a peaceful
solution to end the country's three-month long conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the 15th session of
the Angola-Zambia Joint Permanent Commission on Defense and
Security held Friday in Lusaka, the two countries regretted the
prevailing atmosphere of insecurity and instability in Congo (K),
said Zambia Daily Mail Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More and more African countries including Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia, Uganda and Chad have got involved in the Congo (K)
crisis. And both the Congolese government and the Tutsi-led
rebels vowed to continue fighting despite a draft ceasefire
adopted at the ministers meeting ended on October 27 in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission also noted with concern the precarious
security situation existing in Angola following the failure by
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
led by Jonas Savimbi to comply with the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol to end the country's two-decade civil war.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral issues, the commission stated with satisfaction
the progress that the two countries had continued to make in the
various areas of cooperation intended to eradicate, among others,
cross-border crime as well as drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The commission stressed the need to intensify regular contacts
among security organs in the two neighbors at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception hosted here Friday night for the
commission members, Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa
pledged his country's continued support for regional peace
efforts to resolve the Congo (K) crisis, according to the
paper.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President Granted Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Former South African state
president F W de Klerk was granted a divorce from his wife Marike in
Cape Town High Court Friday, Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The divorce paved the way for de Klerk to marry his new love, Elita
Georgiades.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now divorced... Let's take things once at a time. No date had
been set for marriage," de Klerk was quoted as saying. He added that
he and Elita would maintain for some time a low media profile.
</P>
<P>
Marike, who had been married to de Klerk for 38 years, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday Times, Marike will receive 10,000 Rand (1,750
U.S. Dollars) per month from de Klerk for the rest of her life or
until such a time as she remarries. This amount will escalate at eight
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
All Marike's medical bills, including prescription medicines,
consultations and treatment, whether physical or mental, will be paid
by de Klerk for the rest of her life or until she marries again.
</P>
<P>
Elita, 46, whose 27-year marriage to shipping tycoon Tony
Georgiades was ended in August, said it was difficult to express her
feelings.
</P>
<P>
"The last few months have been very hard for me and for all the
parties involved. There had been a lot of emotion because you're
dealing with people whose lives have been intertwined for so many
years.
</P>
<P>
"On the one side there has been a lot of pain, and on the other a
lot of spiritual growth... There are winners and there are losers, and
even the winners are losers. It's not a black and white thing."
</P>
<P>
The two couples were introduced in the 80s by former National Party
cabinet minister Dawie de Villiers and soon became friends.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between de Klerk and Elita was made public in
January this year and the de Klerks separated in March.
</P>
<P>
In a heart-rending book, "Marike: A Journey Through Summer and
Winter", published in June this year, Marike told of her pain at
losing the man she loved so much.
</P>
<P>
Of the day de Klerk left, March 2, 1998, she said: "He walked to
the front door with his suitcase and we stretched out our arms to one
another, hugged one another and shock like reeds in the north wind.
</P>
<P>
"He cried, so did I. I told him: 'If you change your mind, I'll
forgive everything, up to 70 times seven. I must accept that what has
happened comes from the hands of the Lord... It is possible to put
back the spark which you say has gone out of your marriage. Because I
love you.'"
</P>
<P>
"He whispered: 'I'm certain about my decision. Stop hoping."

<HEADLINE> ADB-Backed Drinking-Water Project in Fuzhou City Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) --Construction of a hydropower
station at Tangban Reservoir, a principal part of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB)-financed water supply project in Fuzhou,
Fujian Province, started last week.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the water project, which will
consist of three separate facilities for water drawing, supply and
conservancy, will cost 900 million yuan (about 108 million
U.S. dollars), including the use of 47 million U.S. dollars in
loans from the ADB.
</P>
<P>
When the project is finished, residents of Fuzhou, capital of
Fujian Province, will be able to obtain drinking water from the
nearby Aojiang River via the Tangban Reservoir instead of solely
depending on the Minjiang River as a source of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The Aojiang River is one of Fujian Province's major rivers, and
it has plenty of high-quality water.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study for opening this second source of
water for Fuzhou and the use of the ADB loans were approved by
the State Development Planning Commission in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The water supply project will also require construction of 21.3
kilometers of tunnels with a daily capacity of drawing and
transporting 700,000 tons of water.
</P>
<P>
It will be able to supply 300,000 tons of water daily to
household water taps upon completion of the first phase. The
entire water supply project will take four years to finish.

<HEADLINE> Banker: IMF Loan to Boost Confidence in Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approval of a 280-million-U.S.-dollar loan payment to the
Philippines will boost confidence in the country's economy,
Philippine Daily Inquirer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Washington Friday, the IMF approved an initial loan of 280
million dollars to the Philippines under a previously announced
1.37 billion dollar standby credit facility.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted by
the paper as saying that the loan payment will "enhance confidence
in the country, especially now that the (Asian) crisis might have
bottomed out."
</P>
<P>
"It (the approval) means that we have passed the (IMF) review
and that we have complied with all the quantitative performance
criteria under the program that made us eligible to draw from the
facility," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
"It (also) means that we have reached an agreement on (banking
sector reforms) with the World Bank. We signed the development
policy, (Friday)" he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF loan will beef up the country's gross international
reserves which stand at about 10.5 billion dollars now.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Deploy Observers in G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, (NIGERIA), November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has decided to deploy a
cease-fire observers team in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
This was decided by ECOWAS leaders at their 21st summit ending
in Nigerian capital Abuja in the deep night of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Togolese President and newly-elected ECOWAS
Chairman, Gnassingbe Eyadema, the conflicts in Guinea Bissau
occupied much of the leaders'time during the two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema told a press conference after the summit that after
face to face talks, Guinea Bissau's President Joao Bernardo
Vieira and uprising army leader Ansumane Mane had reached a
three-point agreement, which he said, would lead to the laying
down of arms and withdrawal of foreign intervention troops.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the summit said that the leaders
expressed grave concern over the armed conflict which erupted on
June 7, 1998 in Bissau, after President Vieira sacked Mane for
the involvement by army officers in arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reviewed the situation in Bissau and commended the
timely intervention by Senegal and Guinea, both of which sent
their troops to Bissau to support Vieira.
</P>
<P>
After a report by Gambian President Yahya Jammeh on the Guinea
Bissau situation, the summit heard accounts given by the
conflicting parties in that member country.
</P>
<P>
According the communique, the parties in Guinea Bissau agreed
to consolidate the cease-fire agreement signed on August 26 and
jointly brokered by the ECOWAS and the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP).
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to the deployment of a ceasefire observer
team.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to expand its Committee of Seven on Guinea
Bissau to include Niger and Togo, and to continue negotiations
with the warring parties during their stay in Abuja to find a
lasting solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the international community to render all
necessary assistance to the member states giving shelters to
large numbers of refugees.

JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
--Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill
Clinton separately signed a new strategic memorandum of
understanding Saturday night aimed at strengthening Israel's
deterrence capacity against the threat of long-range missiles and
non-conventional weapons. Netanyahu said this was a major step
forward in Israeli-American strategic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
--The Israeli cabinet is only going to vote on the Wye
Memorandum after the Palestinians hand over to the Americans a
document with operational plans to fight terror. But the U.S.
says the process is "on track" and is sending their top
negotiators to the region this week to lay the groundwork for
the final settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
--About 150,000 people gathered in Tel Aviv Saturday night
for a massive memorial rally to mark the third anniversary of
the assassination of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that the bullets killing Rabin
did not and will never kill his legacy of strengthening
Israel's security and promoting peace.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Cuts Diplomatic Posts to Save Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 84 diplomatic posts have
been abolished from Zimbabwe's foreign missions and this will
result in savings of about four million U.S. Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge told the Sunday Mail
in an interview that his ministry abolished the posts to comply
with the government's efforts to cut down on expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said a whole range of posts from deputy ambassador to
the lesser important posts have been abolished.
</P>
<P>
"We have also rationalized the remuneration and salaries of
our diplomats which made another huge saving on the budget of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the total financial resources committed by
Zimbabwe to its foreign missions are therefore far less than what
other countries spent here.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has 33 foreign missions and four consulates while
foreign missions accredited to Zimbabwe are twice that number.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge refuted suggestions that Zimbabwe's foreign policies
placed more emphasis on politics than on the economy of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's missions were doing a good job by way of
promoting business and trade outside the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the information dealt with by the
foreign missions is on trade and the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of economic interests is very high. We prepare
our ambassadors for that task from time to time and ambassadors
are very active in the promotion of business outside the
country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Family Laws Should Be Reformed: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi official has said
the role of the women entrepreneurs in accelerating the growth of
the national economy will remain fruitless without reforms in the
present family laws.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin Khan
Almgir while addressing a seminar on "Role of Women Entrepreneurs
in the National Economy" here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult for women to set up an industry in the
country because of various social and institutional barriers, he
stated, adding that support should be given to women who came
forward ignoring those barriers.
</P>
<P>
The fifth five-year plant (1997-2002) contains a proposal to
form the Prime Minister's Council on Private Enterprise, he said,
hoping that women entrepreneurs would support it through their
participation in the council.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 2.78 billion taka (about 57.3
million U.S. dollars) in the current five-year plan for women's
development.
</P>
<P>
The government was ready to extend all sorts of cooperation to
the women entrepreneurs in the country, he stated, adding that
development was not possible without the participation of
womenfolk since they represent half of the country's population.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Middle School Students Go Abroad to Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Dreams of studying abroad
have become closer for many middle school students in south
China's Guangdong Province whose parents can afford more than
100,000 yuan (over 12,000 U.S. dollars) a year to send them to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Guangzhou City Visiting Students
Service Center, the number of local middle students going abroad
has been increasing sharply over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
They said that 1,000 middle school students went abroad to
study this year, twice that of last year. Most of these students
are learning at middle schools in Australia, Canada, France and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth paying so much money, if your bank accounts allow
you to do that. This will help improve the independence of
your children," said a man who also plans to send his child abroad.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas middle schools have opened offices in Guangzhou
to introduce themselves to local parents.

<HEADLINE> Using Scientific Developments In Northern China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanxi province in north
China has used scientific and technological achievements on 8,333
projects over the past decade, generating 26 billion yuan in
output value and 6.8 billion yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
The province has come up with 4,386 scientific research
developments in the past decade, 37 of which won national science
prizes, and 2,204 won provincial prizes.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of these have been used for production and 30
percent for popular use.
</P>
<P>
Agronomy and technology now account for almost 40 percent of
the province's rural economic growth, compared with 25.6 percent a
decade ago. Agronomists have developed 335 new crop varieties.
</P>
<P>
This has helped increase per-unit grain output and farmers' per
capita income. Last year, the per capita income of local farmers
was 1,738 yuan as against 438 yuan in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Some 117,000 scientists and technicians in the province have
participated in training organized by large and medium-sized
enterprises and made 630,000 suggestions, 293,000 of which have
been adopted, adding 630 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 million farmers have attended training courses and
100,000 farmers have obtained course certificates. Now 98 percent
of the province's rural townships have associations for spreading
the use of scientific developments, and 80 percent of its large
and medium-sized factories and coal mines have similar scientific
and technological associations.

<P>
SUZUKA, Japan, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Mika Hakkinen of Finland
won the Formula One championship here on Sunday as chief rival
Michael Schumacher retired from the Japanese Grand Prix with a
blown tire.
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari driver of Germany, aiming for his third world
title, retired after 31 laps when his right rear tire blew out.
Early, his engine stalled and Schumacher lost the pole position
in the season-ending race.
</P>
<P>
Driving a McLaren, Hakkinen took the checkered flag after 51
laps over the 5.864-kilometer Suzuka Circuit and held the lead
throughout the race for his eighth victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was second and
Hakkinen' teammate Coulthard third.
</P>
<P>
The championship was the first for the 30-year-old Hakkinen
who many thought would never race again after a near-fatal crash
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's car trouble also gave Hakkinen's McLaren team a
lock on the constructor's title, its eighth.

<P>
ABUJA (NIGERIA), November 1 (Xinhua) -- The 21st summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ended Saturday
night in the Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by leaders from all the 16 ECOWAS member
countries, adopted a mechanism for the prevention, management and
resolution of conflicts within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It urged conflicting parites in Guinea Bissau to consolidate
the existing ceasefire agreement and decided to send a ceasefire
observer team to that troubled member country.
</P>
<P>
The summit urged true reconciliation in Sierra Leone and
Liberia to achieve a lasting peace and appealed to the

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- To meet this year's economic
growth target, Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, has dramatically increased its investment in urban
infrastructure construction in the first eight months.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, Guangzhou invested 5.75 billion yuan
(694 million U.S. dollars), up 92.5 percent from the same period
last year, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of infrastructure investment in the total social
fixed assets investment rose from last year's 14 percent to the

Infrastructure investment, focusing on the construction of
urban communications and the Guangzhou New Airport, has effectively
stimulated the growth of total investment.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, Guangzhou invested 25.8 billion
yuan in fixed assets, up 14.7 percent from the same period last
year and 6.7 percentage points higher than planned.
</P>
<P>
To further stimulate domestic demand, Guangzhou has built a
number of large wholesale markets and farm produce markets, which
helped bring about a growth in retails.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the total retail sales in Guangzhou
amounted to 57.59 billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the
corresponding period last year.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Naseem Hamed retained his
World Boxing Organisation (WBO) featherweight title by winning a
unanimous points decision over Irishman Wayne McCullough in
Atlantic City, New Jersey on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Hamed failed to improve his streak of 18 consecutive
knockout victories as McCullough survived the 12 rounds and
reluctantly admitted: "I have to hand it to Wayne. He was quite
strong."
</P>
<P>
The judges scored for Hamed 116-112, 117-111 and 118-110.
</P>
<P>
The latest win stretched Hamed's unbeaten record to 31 while
McCullough, a former World Boxing Council (WBC) bantamweight
champion has now lost two of his 24 bouts.
</P>
<P>
Hamed evaded McCullough's best shots from the start, but his
arrogant movement and constant mocking of his opponent won him
few friends in the arena.
</P>
<P>
Hamed had predicted a third-round knockout of McCullough but
once that did not happen he concentrated on inflicting punishment.
</P>
<P>
His next opponent is likely to be Mexico's Marco Antonio
Barrera, who stopped England's Richie Wenton in the third-round
to take the vacant WBO junior-featherweight title.

NEW DELHI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Equities gave up major part
of its early gains on the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE) during the
week as the economic package announced last Saturday by the
Government failed to keep up the tempo for long.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index initially spurted to 2,895.84 but later
moved downwards to close the week at 2,812.49 as against last
weekend close of 2,784.46, netting a small gain of 28.03 points.

The national index moved up by 14.78 points to end the week at
1,260.78 from the previous weekend close of 1,246.00 points.

The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted marginally up at
the weekend at 293.73 and 115.42 compared with last weekend close
of 290.50 and 114.37 respectively.
</P>

Initially, the market responded positively with a strong rally
to the announcement of a number of measures, including an
assurance of early decision on buyback of shares, by Prime
Minister A.B. Vajpayee, to boost the sagging economy and restore
the depressed capital market. However, brokers were interrupted in
early clearance of buyback of shares and other measures.

Though domestic institutions picked up stock in small quantity,
foreign funds turned net sellers.

the majority of which are said to be "dens of crime" in the

<P>
There are over 5,000 video parlors in business islandwide, most

Social evils such as drugs, gambling and prostitution are also
reported to be flourishing under the umbrella of these parlors
which are not confined only to Colombo and other major towns, but
are now flourishing in rural areas of the country.

As these parlors do not operate under any Act, the parlor
owners screen obscene films to even school children, the report

Under a directive of president Chandrika Kumaratunga, the
Justice ministry is now in the process of enacting regulations to

ALMA ATA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan
Saturday signed seven treaties and cooperative agreements in
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The pacts, signed on the second day of Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev's official visit to Tashkent, ranged from on
maintaining permanent friendship and deepening economic
cooperation in the 1998-2005 period to jointly fighting crimes.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Nazarbayev met with his Uzbek
counterpart Islam Karimov and exchanged views on bilateral
relations, issues of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
and other international affairs of common concerns, and reached
consensus on a wide range of matters, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Following a signing ceremony of the agreements, the two
presidents held a joint press conference, at which Karimov called
the signing of the accords a solid foundation for the two
countries to develop their 21st century-oriented relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two countries have had no political, border or
military conflicts in the past, Nazarbayev said the treaty on
friendship stipulates that the two countries would support each
other when either comes under outside invasion. The clause
indicates that the pact has a nature of an alliance treaty.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Evidence: Thomas Jefferson Fathered Slave Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Thomas
Jefferson fathered a child of one of his slaves, but not the one
who historians had thought, researchers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to historical conventional wisdom, Thomas Woodson,
the first son of Jefferson's slave Sally Hemings, was fathered by
Jefferson, the third U.S. president between 1801 and 1809.
</P>
<P>
But in a report carried on the scientific journal Nature, Dr
Eugene Foster, a retired pathology professor from Virginia, the
United States, said genetic evidence showed that Jefferson was not
Woodson's father.
</P>
<P>
From an analysis of genetic variations on the Y-chromosome,
which is inherited exclusively through the male line, the
researchers presented compelling evidence that the president
fathered another of Sally Hemings' children -- her last son, Eston
Hemings Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
The study also disproved the belief of some historians that the
Woodson family had been fathered by Jefferson's nephews, Samuel
and Peter Carr.

Official statistics show that prices of 177 articles rose in

The government hopes to control total inflation under 45
percent by the year-end. However, it seems to be no easy job as

It said the government would have to struggle to reach a

crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that, even so, "employment will continue to
stagnate."
</P>
<P>
However, the report said the Italian public finances would stay
on track for the government's goals despite the
lower-than-expected growth.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said earlier this week
that he was hoping for a 1.8-percent growth this year, but noted
that it was "not a foregone conclusion."

MANAGUA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Rains and floods brought by
hurricane Mitch continued their lash on Nicaragua, with at least
120 people killed and 177 missing in the country so far, the
National Civil Defense Committee said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Strong currents overwhelmed large areas of farm land and
destroyed at least 10 bridges and 43 road segments, causing losses
exceeding 25 million U.S. dollars, according to the Transports and
Infrastructure Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of the Central Bank of Nicaragua on Friday met with
representatives of the Inter-American Development Bank and World
Bank for talks over possible financial assistance for Nicaragua to
reconstruct roads and bridges.

</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, the National Emergency Commission reported
that at least 231 people were confirmed killed by Mitch in
Honduras, bringing the tropical storm's death toll in the region
to 357.
</P>
<P>
Mitch, one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the Caribbean,
has been downgraded to the tropical depression status but
continued to dump heavy rains on the region, causing extensive
flooding.
</P>
<P>
In the Honduran capital city of Tegucigalpa, dozens of houses
were washed away, seven of the city's 10 bridges were knocked out
and patients up on the third floor of a major hospital had to be

<HEADLINE> NBA Sides to Talk Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Collective bargaining
between the NBA and its players' union will resume Monday when
lawyers and support staff for the two sides meet at a New York
law firm.
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks, including team owners and players, was
scheduled for Wednesday, also in New York. However, union
spokesman Dan Wasserman said his side would not bring in its full
20-member negotiating team unless progress was made on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The season was scheduled to begin Tuesday. Last Wednesday, the
league cancelled all games through the end of November and the
season is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Union chief Billy Hunter there was no formal boycott but that
union members had discussed the issue in Las Vegas and
"reiterated their feelings" this week.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said by paying the NBA 470 million US dollars in
national television rights fee despite a lockout, NBC and TNT
Sports "created greater bargaining leverage for the league"
during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
He said the league has been inconsistent by not opening the
network television contracts to bidding and then pleading lack of
profitability when it negotiates with the union.
</P>
<P>
NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said the league has included "a
work-stoppage provision as a condition" of all national
television contracts that it has negotiated since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Most sports contracts have had some sort of language about
work stoppages," said Kevin O'Malley, senior vice president for
programming at TNT Sports, holder of NBA cable rights for the
past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"The leagues have a good deal of leverage because they know
there are multiple bidders. ESPN and FOX were interested and, if
we weren't interested in agreement to it, somebody else would
have. This is something that you live with."
</P>
<P>
NBC Sports spokesman Ed Markey said the network would have no
comment on the issue.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Transportation In Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- One of the most noticeable change
in China's Tibet Autonomous Region in recent years has been
greater convenience in transportation, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa is the only provincial or regional capital in China that
does not have government-operated transportation services, but
local transportation today is better than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The 57-square k.m. city with a population of 137,000 now has
570 mini-buses, over 1,100 taxis and more than 510 tricycles. It
only costs two yuan to travel from the city's downtown area to
suburbs by mini-bus and three or five yuan to go to any place
within the city proper by tricycle and less than 10 yuan by taxi.
</P>
<P>
Transportation in the 1980s was very backward and people mainly
depended on bicycles. It was not uncommon for many people to go to
some fairly remote areas on foot, and there were only several
mini-buses in the urban area.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of construction work and reforms and opening up,
traffic in Lhasa has taken on a totally different look and improved
transportation has accelerated the development of the region's
business and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-China Border Trade Reaches 129m U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The border trade volume between
Myanmar and China reached 129 million U.S. dollars in the first
eight months of this year, according to a latest issue of the
local International Economic Journal.
</P>
<P>
Of the total volume, Myanmar's exports to China amounted to 63
million dollars, while its imports from that country reached 66
million dollars. Services charges obtained from the border trade
were 4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, Myanmar adjusted its border trade policy to
turn the trade into a normal one, using U.S. dollar as settling
accounts instead of the Chinese currency Renminbi. The practice is
also applied to other neighboring countries such as Thailand and
India.
</P>
<P>
From February this year, Myanmar exempted the commercial tax,
which was previously levied at 5 percent, reduced border trade
services charges to 8 percent from 10 percent, and raised the rate
of income tax on imported goods from 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, Myanmar has opened six trade points along the two
countries' common border. They are Muse, Kyuhkok, Lwaigyai,
Namhkam, Kunlong and Mongla, of which the first three trade points
are designated as state-level ones.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's foreign trade in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending in
March totaled 3.24 billion dollars, of which its exports amounted
to one billion dollars, registering a trade deficit of 1.24
billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman don't want to
leave the Chicago Bulls when the NBA lockout comes to end.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time NBA rebounding champion said he's ready to
return to the Bulls when the next season starts. He said: "It's
very difficult for me to listen to anybody but I was real
comfortable with Phil Jackson."
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine Tim Floyd won't have to do too much coaching
-- we already know what to do. But I'm not really interested in
the man's background. I'm interested in just playing basketball
and winning championships."
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old had a base salary of roughly 4.5 million
U.S.dollars with plenty of incentive clauses for good behavior.
He averaged 15 rebounds a game and played in 80 of 82
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
Rodman is one of nine free agents in the Bulls roster this
season. He spent the offseason making a movie.
</P>
<P>
The "worm" doesn't care about the lockout much. "The owners
are right and the players are right. There is no happy medium.
They should just cancel the whole season and let everybody get a
real job. Then you'll see how they really feel," he said. "I bet
then they'll come to an agreement real quick."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Iraq to Rescind Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Saturday unanimously condemned Iraq's decision to cease
all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The 15 council members "considered this decision a flagrant
violation of relevant council resolutions and of the Memorandum of
Understanding" signed in February between Secretary General Kofi
Annan and the Iraqi government, said this month's council
president, British Representative Jeremy Greenstock.
</P>
<P>
The council urged Iraq to rescind "immediately and
unconditionally" its decision and the decision of August 5 to
limit cooperation with the UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission for
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA stands for the International Atomic Energy Agency
which carries the mandate of eliminating Iraq's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq leadership "must resume immediate, complete and
unconditional cooperation with the Special Commission and the
IAEA, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Once Iraq has rescinded its decisions and has re-established
full cooperation with the Special Commission and the IAEA, they
remain ready to implement a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with its obligations under all relevant resolutions,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Council members expressed their full support for the secretary
general in seeking to fully implement the Memorandum of
Understanding and for the Special Commission and the IAEA in
implementing their mandates, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Saturday that it has decided to suspend all its
relations with the Special Commission until the commission has
been restructured and its Chairman Richard Butler has been
removed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 suspended cooperation with the UNSCOM and the
IAEA, barring them from carrying out on-the-spot inspections to
new sites. However, their monitoring activities are still allowed.
</P>
<P>
According to the new decision, the UNSCOM must stop all their
activities inside Iraq aimed at destroying biological and chemical
weapons and long-range missiles, with only IAEA monitors allowed
to continue working.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that it has complied with all related
Security Council resolutions and blamed the United States and "its
agents" for blocking the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers Response to Iraqi Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday summoned his national security advisers to the White
House to shape a response to Iraq's decision to resist U.N.
efforts on weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials from the State Department, the Pentagon
and the intelligence community convened at the White House to
discuss U.S. options in light of the new show of Iraqi defiance,
according to National Security Council spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not attend, but Leavy said national security
adviser Sandy Berger would brief Clinton after the session.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton team met shortly after the president signed
legislation instructing the government to support political
opposition inside Iraq to President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said that the United States was currently consulting with
its allies and officials at the United Nations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We take the latest action by the Baghdad regime as a serious
threat to the international community," said Leavy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it was suspending all cooperations with U.N. arms
inspectors and monitors until the United Nations Security Council
reviewed the lifting of sanctions and purges its teams of
"American spies and agents."
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it had made the decision because of "unjust" sweeping
trade sanctions imposed by the Security Council shortly after
Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq suspended cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), barring them from carrying out on-the-spot
inspections to new sites. However, their monitoring activities
were still allowed.
</P>
<P>
The new decision would not be applied to the IAEA, Iraq said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Iraq
Liberation Act of 1998 that makes clear the United States supports
elements within the Iraqi opposition who advocate a democratic
future for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The United States wants Iraq to rejoin the family of nations
as a freedom-loving and law-abiding member," Clinton said in a
statement announcing he had signed the act.
</P>
<P>
Just days ago Clinton signed a spending bill that made 8
million U.S. dollars available for assistance to the Iraqi
democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
"The United States looks forward to a democratically supported
regime that would permit us to enter into a dialogue leading to
the reintegration of Iraq into normal international life," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the meantime, his administration would pursue
"active application of all relevant United Nations Security
Council resolutions."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iraq Freezes UNSCOM to Unfreeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq apparently alarmed the
world again by freezing all the activities of the U.N. Special
Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), but it is a desperate
thrust to unfreeze itself from the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The move came a day after a U.N. Security Council decision to
review Iraq's progress on eliminating banned weapons. Many believe
that the U.N. decision can make Iraq resume cooperation with
UNSCOM that suspended on August 5.
</P>
<P>
But observers said that Iraq, which is desperate for removing
the sanctions and pessimistic about the outcome of the
U.N. review, has reheated its tricks it repeatedly used before to
create attentions of the world on the sanctions and draw sympathy.
</P>
<P>
Although the Security Council has pledged a "comprehensive
review," it did not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead
directly to the removal of the sweeping economic sanctions imposed
after Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the ban on UNSCOM will continue "until the United
Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way, leading
to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. and Britain have linked the lift of
sanctions not only to the weapons destruction, but also to many
time-consuming issues, such as the release of Kuwaiti prisoners
captured by Iraq in the 1990 war.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq's decision also came as the Baghdad International Fair
is to open on November 1, in which 30 countries, including Russia,
France and China, permanent members of the Security Council and
Iraq's sympathizers, will take part.
</P>
<P>
In confrontations with the U.S.-led alliances, Iraq always
yield in the end, but it was not always the loser.
</P>
<P>
Last February, Iraq's intransigence in banning the UNSCOM
inspectors from entering presidential palaces triggered a
crisis. The U.S. and Britain were to launch air strikes against
Iraq to force it into obedience.
</P>
<P>
Though, Iraq at last bowed to the pressure and had to agree to
allow inspectors' access to the palaces, it drew the sympathy of
the world as many countries expressed the hope that the
U.N. sanctions should be lifted soon to ease the sufferings of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision in early August to bar UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from carrying out
on-the-spot inspections of suspected new sites drew little
reaction from the Security Council, but now it is difficult for
the council to ignore.
</P>
<P>
The latest decision of Iraq to suspend all relations with
UNSCOM has incurred strong reactions from the U.S., France and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council
said "we view this as a serious matter and we are currently
consulting with allies and the officials at the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry said it "deplores" Iraq's
decision. "French insists that Iraq resume its full and total
cooperation with the United Nations," a statement issue by the
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In London, A Foreign Office spokesman said that such a ban will
be "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Iraq this time may yield to threat of
the West as it did before, but its objective is clear: to do
everything possible for the removal of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israel Sign Pact Against Ballistic Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Israel
signed a strategic cooperation agreement Saturday to protect the
Jewish state against ballistic missiles from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed respectively by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a joint written statement, Clinton and Netanyahu said that
the development of medium and long range missiles and weapons of
mass destruction "has been of great concern to both governments
for some time."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a joint strategic planning committee will
be established to recommend how to upgrade the "U.S.-Israeli
strategic and military relationships as well as technological
cooperation," the leaders' statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries already are working jointly on a missile
defense project, the Arrow 2, that has been successfully tested
once in Israel, but the leaders said the new memo of understanding
will enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the agreement at the White House with Israel's
ambassador to the United States, Zalman Shoval, on hand.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council at the
White House, said the memo of understanding is partly aimed at
dealing with the Iran threat.
</P>
<P>
"This new effort will bring both sides together in a systematic
way," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who signed the agreement in Jerusalem with the U.S.
ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, said the pact demonstrat xJXJZU.S. is committed to
strengthening Israel's defensive and
deterrent capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"This is additional proof of the tight alliance on all matters
concerning our vital interests," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The United States will consider the regional deployment of
ballistic missiles of intermediate or greater range in the event
of a threat to Israel's security, according to the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Netanyahu decided to sign the pact during bilateral
meetings at a Middle East summit in the Wye Plantation in Maryland
in October.
