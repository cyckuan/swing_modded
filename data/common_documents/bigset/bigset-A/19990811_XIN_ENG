<HEADLINE> Cypriot Ambassador to Egypt Suspended for Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot ambassador to Egypt
Charalambos Kapsos was suspended Tuesday by the government for
allegedly charging entrance fees and importing wine into Egypt
when holding a party.
</P>
<P>
An official announcement said Cyprus' Public Service
Commission, responsible for hiring civil servants, took the
decision following a proposal by Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides.
</P>
<P>
The allegation against Charalambos Kapsos were carried in
Cyprus' Politis daily last week, which said the ambassador charged
a 60 U.S. dollar entrance fee for each gust, imported dozens of
cases of wine and invited Romanian dancers when holding a
"bouzouki night" party in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Following the allegation, Kasoulides recalled the ambassador
and ordered an inquiry although Kapsos has denied the accusations
in letters to the press.
</P>
<P>
As for the 372 cartons of wine he is reported to have taken to
Cairo, Kapsos argued that they were for long-term use, adding that
some bottles have been used for Cyprus nights while the rest are
stored at his residence.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Hostage Drama Meets Its Happy End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone rebel kidnappers have
freed the rest of their captives Tuesday, ending a five-day
hostage crisis, according to information reaching here from
Freetown, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's Information Minister Julius Spencer said at a
press conference that the former junta soldiers had freed 15 west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) along with a U.N. military
observer and some 200 civilians Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were heading toward Freetown and "the hostage
drama is over in Sierra Leone," said Spencer.
</P>
<P>
The release came shortly after the capture of Idriss Kamara, a
high ranking official of the former military junta led by Johnny
Koroma who had ruled the country for 10 months before being driven
out by the Nigeria-led ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Kamara was captured by his former junta colleagues in their
camp Friday after he tried to negotiate a hostage release. He was
freed Sunday morning with five U.N. drivers, but returned that
night to help negotiate the release of 13 more hostages.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, believed to be followers of Koroma, released
Sunday 19 people out of a jungle hideaway where one freed hostage
said as many as 2, 000 disenchanted members of the former junta
are based.
</P>
<P>
"They treated us fine," said Chernor Bangura, a journalist for
Sierra Leone state television Sunday. "We were given one meal a
day and tea in the morning," he added.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappings of the about 35 people took place last
Wednesday during what was to have been a handover of some
civilians seized by the gunmen during the civil war. The hostages
includes U.N. observers, ECOMOG soldiers, aid workers and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers freed last Thursday the first batch of their
captives and let them carry messages demanding food and medical
supplies and the release of Koroma, who they claimed had been
detained by the Foday Sankoh-led Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
rebel faction.
</P>
<P>
But Koroma denied later that he was a prisoner of the RUF and
promised to personally intervene to dissolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the RUF and the former junta soldiers has
been straining, though Sankoh keeps calling Koroma the "number two
figure" of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Many of Koroma's men might feel excluded when the RUF signed
the July 7 Lome peace accord on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, a former officer of government force, claiming himself
the head of state of Sierra Leone in 1997 through a coup, allied
himself with the RUF, which has been fighting successive
governments since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But 10 months later, he was flushed out by the Nigeria-led
ECOMOG and the unseated President Tejan Kabbah was reinstated.
Since then the two factions of the rebels had fought against
Kabbah's government joint- handedly until the ceasefire in June
this year and the ensuing peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Solar Eclipse-Observing Camp Bombed by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi camp for observing
total solar eclipse in the north of the country was bombed by
U.S. and British warplanes on Tuesday, in which a number of
civilians were killed or injured, the Iraqi News Agency INA
reported.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted a spokesman for the preparatory committee
supervising the observation of total solar eclipse as saying
that U.S. and British warplanes fired three missiles at the
camp which is located to the north of Mosul, some 500 kilometers
north of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:30 (0630 GMT), formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace flew over Mosul and
bombed the camp while some satellite channels witnessed and
filmed the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"This criminal act represents the aggressors' hatred against
the Iraqi people and their persistence on preventing Iraq from
covering this natural scientific phenomenon," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that on August 11, total solar eclipse can
be observed in the northern Iraqi province of Neineva, where,
as they say, is an ideal location for observing this phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many foreign and Arab astronomers, satellite
channels and news reporters gathered in Mosul, capital city of
Neineva province, to witness this phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman said earlier Tuesday that U.S.
and British warplanes bombed civilian installations in northern
and southern Iraq, injuring three civilians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges India, Pakistan to Restrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
called on India and Pakistan to restrain themselves and to solve
differences through dialogue after a Pakistani plane was shot down
by India.
</P>
<P>
"In ascertaining the facts, the message that we will be sending
and probably have sent by now is to urge restrait, because we
don't want to see the situation grow and we want the two sides to
resolve their differences through dialogue," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
India said earlier that one of its air force combat jets shot
down the Pakistani anti-submarine and reconnaissance aircraft with
a missile off the coast of the western state of Gujarat at 11:15
a.m. (0545 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said the unarmed plane was brought down within its own
territory while on a routine training flight. It accused India of
"cold-blooded murder" of the 16 people aboard and took reporters
to see the wreckage inside Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it could not tell which version of
events was correct and might not announce its findings even if it
did come to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"Such incidents, regardless of the precise details of how it
occurred, illustrate the continued high state of tension between
India and Pakistan, the need for the two countries to resolve
their differences through dialogue," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said
that the White House was monitoring reports about the downing of
the aircraft but had no independent confirmation of the shoot
down.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about an increase in tensions," he said.

WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has

retaliation of the Taliban movement for its protection of
Saudi-born guerrilla leader Osama bin Laden, the White House

network," he said.

NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Orthodox Church has

in an effort to discourage sex before marriage, the Cyprus News

The decision was taken by the Church's highest body, the Holy

</P>
<P>
The Church decided to scrap the engagement ceremonies because
it found people use the engagements as an excuse for cohabitation,
something it strongly rejects.
</P>
<P>
The Synod also learned that some people also use engagements as
a way of raising money since it is customary, just as it is at

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Protest Against MP Allowances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- the Umbrella Labor Union (ULU) for
Nigerian workers Tuesday staged a demonstration in front of the
national legislature here in the capital to protest the
"outrageous" furniture allowances approved for the 469-member
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The union, representing a diversity of the country's labor
unions, disrupted the sitting of the lower chamber to protest the
award announced last week in the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, each of the 109-member Senate is
to get 3.5 million naira (about 37,000 US dollars) while their
counterparts in the 360-member House would get 2.5 million naira
(26,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Union President Adams Oshiomole led the workers, who were
originally barred by armed policemen who restricted the
demonstrators to the first gate to the sprawling complex.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's demonstration added to the growing pressure on
members of the two-chamber legislature to reject the allowances to
furnish their residence, vacated last month by civil servants to
pave way for the legislators.
</P>
<P>
Branding the awards "repulsive, provocative and princely
lifestyles in the midst of pervasive and abject poverty," the
Union president said it could not be justified with the country's
economic realities. He dismissed the parliamentarians as living
in "an illusory ivory tower", and reminded them of the realities
of the Nigerian economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is today a poverty afflicted nation, per capita income
is about 260 dollars per annum and the minimum wage is 3,000
naira," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oshiomole warned that labor may be forced to abandon its
assumption that government finances could not sustain increased
public sector wages.
</P>
<P>
The unions, which settled for the 3,000 naira (about 32 US
dollars) minimum wage early this year after claims the government
would not afford a higher wage, would review "appeals for
sacrifice and belt tightening as hypocrisy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Sets Deficit, Inflation Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- After consulting with
treasury and central bank heads, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Tuesday set next year's deficit target at 2.5 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product and annual inflation at 3-4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Barak decided that the government's economic policy goals
would be "the achievement of sustainable growth and ending the
current deep and lengthy recession," the prime minister's office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Barak met with Finance Minister Avraham Shochat and Governor
of the Bank of Israel Yaakov Frenkel before convening his cabinet
to discuss the budgetary framework for 2000. The ongoing cabinet
meeting will last late into the night.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5 percent deficit target is lower than the expected
3-3.25 percent for 1999, but it is still above the legal target of
2 percent, which is also mandated by the European Union for its
members.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has said the 0.5 percentage increase of
the deficit target over the original 2 percent stems primarily
from an overly-optimistic tax-revenue forecast.
</P>
<P>
Barak decided that the deficit will be gradually decreased to
no more than 1.5 percent of the GDP, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The budget will emphasize investment in infrastructure and
implementing necessary structural reforms," it said, adding that
the objective is to reduce the public sector share in the economy
while encouraging private sector's involvement to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The budget includes a proposed 5.8 billion shekels (about 1.4
billion dollars) cut in the budgets for various ministries, which
has customarily raised objection among cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers charged that the budget contains no
innovations, pointing to the fact that the proposal foresees no
significant drop in unemployment next year.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to create 300,000 new jobs over the next
four years. The Treasury said 55,000 new jobs would be created
next year under the new budget, reducing the jobless rate to 8.7
percent from an expected 8.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
But Labor Minister Eli Yishai said this was not enough. "If the
government doesn't take steps now to create jobs and solve the
unemployment problem, the economy will have to grow at a rate of
more than 7 percent in 2001 - and this is a completely impossible
task," he told the Haaretz daily.
</P>
<P>
The budget target for deficit and inflation was an apparent
compromise between Shochat and Frenkel, who have been at odds
over the monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Shochat has urged Frenkel to lower the interest rate, which
stands at 11 percent after cutting twice this year, to stimulate
economic growth. He cited the expected inflation rate of 2-3
percent in 1999 as a good environment for the interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Israeli economy grew by 1.5 percent in 1998, the lowest growth
rate in the past decade. The Finance Ministry has proposed a 3
percent growth for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Frenkel has maintained that a tight monetary policy is
needed to restrict inflation, which soared to 8.6 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued by his office, Barak said that he
attaches great importance to coordination between "the two
economic policy arms," referring to the Treasury and the central
bank.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
injured on Tuesday in U.S.-British warplanes attacks on civilian
facilities in northern and southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:00 (0600 GMT) seven
formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces and attacked some civilian facilities in the region,
injuring two civilians.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired
missiles at the enemy planes and repulsed them to their base
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 10:55 (0655 GMT) 12 formations of U.S.
and British warplanes coming from the Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana and
Misan provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy warplanes bombed some civilian installations in
the region and injured another civilian, he said, adding that
Iraqi anti-aircraft units repulsed the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 11,220 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

fields in Yemeni Massila region has made remarkable production in
the second quarter of 1999, reaching 210,000 barrels per day.
</P>

program in the region helped increase about 40 million barrels of
oil per day in Yemen at a cost of two dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The company also said that confirmed reserves in Massila region
would suffice exploitation for over five years, the Alam Al Yom
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Al Gof company of Saudi Arabia on agricultural
development has completed the feasibility studies for the

about 13,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by Tuesday's Alam Al Yom said the
company will officially announced to break ground for the plant
this month.
</P>
<P>
The statement said half of the construction fund of the plant,
which needs 600 million rials (160 million dollars), will depend
on a loan from the Saudi industrial development fund. The
remaining 50 percent will be provided by Saudi businessmen and
investors and several local banks.
</P>
<P>
It added that raw materials for the plant will come from the
company's sugar beet plantations.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and the World Bank Tuesday signed an
agreement to allow the latter to officially open a permanent
office in Beirut in a bid to facilitate economic assistance to the
country .
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Lebanese Finance Minister George
Korom and Inder Sud, the World Bank director of North Africa
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Korom said the setting-up of
office will speed up the utilization of World Banks loans and aid
provided to Lebanon for its on-going administrative and tax
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The office will also help make easy the communication and
coordination between Lebanese government and the bank, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The European Union (EU) has pledged 425,000 Euro
(roughly 400,000 dollars) to finance a Lebanese Finance Ministry's
program for administrative, financial and tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
EU Ambassador in Beirut Dimitri Kourkoulas and Lebanese
Finance Minister Georges Korom signed the memorandum of
understanding Monday, under which the ministry will receive the
EU donation.

</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Trans-Mediterranean Airways (TMA), Lebanon's only air
cargo company, has announced that it would begin a regular flight
to Doha, Qatar, at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Iran of Politicalizing POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday accused Iran of trying to politicalize the issue of
prisoners of war (POWs) and use it as a pressing card over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the foreign ministry said in a
statement that Iraq dealt with the POWs issue according to the
Islamic rules and the international law and claimed that Iraq had
released all Iranian POWs according to the 1949 Geneva Treaty
concerning the POWs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused Iranian officials of "resorting to lies
to cover facts" regarding the issue of POWs and linking it with
other issues, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian government tried to cover up lies it had
said to Iranians that those Iranians missing in actions were POWs
in Iraq in order to lessen the real numbers of the Iranians killed
during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iranian officials asked to exchange Iraqi POWs
for ordinary Iranian prisoners including women and the elderly in
order to give Iranian media the impression that these ordinary
prisoners were POWs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraq's firm policy on the POWs issue is not
to link it with other issues, which was proved by the release of
318 Iranian POWs in April 1998 and 53 others in March 1999 under
the observation of the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been an outstanding obstacle that stands
in the way of normalizing ties between the two former foes.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors fought a bitter eight-year war in the 1980s
in which some 1 million people were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses Iran of still retaining 13,000 Iraqi POWs while
Iran says there are 5,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq's prisons.

NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- India lodged a strong protest
Tuesday night with Pakistan for the "provocative activity" carried
out by a Pakistan military aircraft by intruding into the Indian
territory.
</P>
<P>
It also asserted that Pakistan was "entirely responsible" for
the incident including deaths of those on board.

</P>
<P>
He also indicated that there had been at least eight incidents
of airspace violations since July this year in Gujarat region.
</P>
<P>
All the incidents were in violation of the agreement between
the two countries on prevention of airspace violations signed in

<HEADLINE> South African, Zambian Officials to Visit Eastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- South African and Zambian
officials are expected in Congo's third largest city Kisangani
with a mandate of verifying the problems of leadership within the
main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), rebel
sources in Kisangani said.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and
Zambian State House Minister Eric Silwamba are visiting the area
at a time when tension has mounted between Ugandan People's
Defense Forces (UPDF) and the RCD rebels based in the town, the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, as Silwamba was getting ready to return to
Kisangani he had visited early on Thursday to assess the balance
of power between the RCD- Goma of Emile Ilunga, and his rival
ousted rebel leader professor Wamba dia Wamba, the UPDF had
mobilized the residents of that city to come out to show their
support for Wamba.
</P>
<P>
The RCD rebels said that the population refused, prompting the
UPDF to deploy tanks, APCs, and heavy artillery before attacking
rebel positions. The UPDF was fought back, losing a dozen of its
soldiers, while RCD rebels deplored five wounded, among whom was
the head of intelligence, Commander Slyvain Mbuki.
</P>
<P>
According to RCD rebels, the UPDF is in control of two hotels
in the town, and the local bank, but the other sections in the
town are firmly in the hands of RCD rebels including the Kisangani
main airport.
</P>
<P>
"This new verification mission is just useless because Silwamba
had noticed himself that Wamba was just a mere creation of some
regional powers whose aim is to torpedo the peace process," Emile
Ilunga, RCD leader told RNA from the rebel stronghold of Goma in
eastern Congo bordering Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the RCD rebels have accused Uganda of
fostering territorial ambitions over the eastern part of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. "These people (Ugandans) came
pretending to support our struggle, but now they have shown their
true colors. They are just a force of occupation," Ilunga further
charged.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in eastern Congo alleged that the UPDF is
openly looting the riches of that rich area of the congo, where
timber, coffee, diamonds, and customs revenues go into the pockets
of some senior civil and military officials of President Yoweri
Museveni's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the Rwandan government has expressed
outrage following a continued campaign against Rwandan troops
stationed in northeastern Congo fuelled by Ugandan media.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has denied reports by the state-run New Vision of Monday
claiming that 12 Rwandan soldiers and over 35 rebels had died in
Saturday clashes.
</P>
<P>
''We never engaged the UPDF during its fighting with RCD
rebels,'' Rwandan government spokesman, Lt Col. Wilson Rutayisire
told RNA, explaining that just four of Rwandan soldiers were
slightly injured by a fragment from UPDF's shellings.
</P>
<P>
RCD rebels have also refuted New Vision's report that 35 of
their men were killed and the RCD-Goma Deputy-Commander, along
with over 200 others were arrested by Wamba's forces.
</P>
<P>
''This is mere fabrication,'' said Rutayisire. ''It is an
attempt by UPDF commanders to create confusion in Kisangani with
the aim of confusing the verification mission which was expected
to visit Kisangani over the week- end,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
According to a Rwandan army officers in Kisangani, the reality
is that the UPDF suffered heavy losses on the contrary. The bodies
which were seen on the spot amounted to 12, but many more could
have been carried away by UPDF soldiers in disarray.

<HEADLINE> Conflicts to Dominate SADC Summit in Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The conflicts in Angola and the
Democratic Republic of Congo are expected to dominate the agenda
of the summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
in Mozambican capital Maputo next week.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuend revealed this in Maputo
tuesday at a briefing on the 1999 summit of the heads of state or
government of the SADC.
</P>
<P>
Mbuend noted that the theme of this year's summit is "SADC in
the Next Millennium: Working Together for Peace, Progress and
Prosperity."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Angola and Zambia, the issue of Lesotho
and general elections in the region are also to be discussed at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo meeting will review performance of the member states
in the past year, the executive secretary said, adding that the
SADC growth rate of 1.7 percent in 1998 was quite disappointing
when compared with the sound growth of 2.7 percent in 1997 and
over four percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mbuend pointed out that the continuation of the armed conflicts
in Angola and the DRC has impact negatively on the economic
stability, macro- economic management and investor confidence in
the directly involved countries as well as the region at large.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit, there will be meetings of Standing Committee
of Senior Officials, Finance Committee and Council of Ministers
from Tuesday to Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, the regional leaders will celebrate the SADC
Day, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community now has 14 members,
namely Angola, Botswana, Democratic Congo, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says 55,438 Iraqi POWs Released Since 1981 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Tuesday that the latest
talks on prisoners of war (POWs) with Iraq put the number of
registered Iraqi POWs in Iran at two, with the fate of three
others being under investigation.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Brigadier General Abdullah Najafi, head of the Commission on
Iranian POWs, told reporters that the number was "eventually"
decided by the two sides during the talks in Baghdad from July 24
to August 3.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has released 55,438 Iraqi prisoners of war
since 1981 on 103 occasions, while Iraq freed 39,417 Iranian POWs
in the same period on 70 occasions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides started to resolve the issue of POWs long after
the end of their eight-year bloody war from 1980 to 1988, in which
some 1 million people were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said their talks were marked by two phases. In the
first, between 1994 and 1997, no progress was made, but Iran
unilaterally released Iraqi POWs five times to show its good will.
</P>
<P>
He said fundamental steps were taken for removal of
disagreements between the two countries in the second phase from
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
A Red Cross list puts the number of unregistered Iraqi POWs in
Iran at 972, of whom some have sought asylum in Iran, some have
died and the fate of 666 others is under investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
As to a list presented to the Red Cross by Iraq, Najafi said it
contained 3,146 names, but only 2,525 were actual. But he said
fate of 2,283 of them is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq reduced the number of Iranian POWs as mentioned in
the Red Cross list to 2,923 from 3,100. The list is under
investigation and Iraq should clarify the fate of those POWs, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Burundian, Tanzanian Defense Ministers to Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of
Burundi and Tanzania are expected to meet in Kigoma, northwest of
Tanzania, Wednesday to discuss security issues along the 230-km
long common border, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Burundi's state-owned Radio Bujumbura as
saying Tuesday afternoon that military experts from both countries
are already in discussions to prepare for the ministerial meeting,
which Burundi has been calling for over a year.
</P>
<P>
The Burundians attributed the delay of the ministerial meeting
to Tanzania's failure to keep its promised schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi government has continued to complain about deadly
incursions by armed people from Tanzania and back to their bases
after the army has crushed them.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is urgently necessary to avoid dangerous
escalation.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the issue of security which will feature high
on the agenda is linked to the presence of thousands of Burundi
refugees in Tanzania where Burundian rebels recruit fighters.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Burundi Hutu refugees live in refugee camps
in the region of Kigoma in west Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months the repatriation has slackened down, but
now it is gaining momentum in areas northeast of Burundi.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Issues Bulletin Guiding Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretariat Tuesday issued a bulletin in a bid to set out
"fundamental principles and rules of international humanitarian
law" applicable to U.N. peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin, entitled "Secretary-General's Bulletin Observance
by United Nations Forces of International Humanitarian Law," will
go into effect starting August 12, which coincides with the 50th
anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, a senior U.N. official
said.
</P>
<P>
The nine-page and 10-section bulletin said, "The fundamental
principles and rules of international humanitarian law set out in
this bulletin are applicable to United Nations forces when in
situation of armed conflict they are actively engaged therein as
combatants, to the extent for the duration of their engagement."
</P>
<P>
The senior U.N. official told a press conference here that the
bulletin provisions are only applicable to U.N. peacekeepers, who
are involved in a combat situation, rather than U.N. civilian
police, who "are normally unarmed."
</P>
<P>
"The places like Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia demonstrate that
even peacekeepers, in certain situations, unavoidably became
involved in a combat situation," said the senior official.
</P>
<P>
"In case of violations of international humanitarian law,
members of the military personnel of a United Nations Force are
subject to prosecution in their national courts," the bulletin
said.
</P>
<P>
"The violators will be tried in their own national courts
because there is no U.N. tribunal which has jurisdiction over the
members of peacekeeping operations," he said, adding that the
trial will be conducted in accordance with the national
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Force shall make a clear distinction at all
times between civilians and combatants and between civilian
objects and military objectives," the bulletin said. "Military
operations shall be directed against combatants and military
objectives."
</P>
<P>
"Attacks on civilians or civilian objectives are prohibited,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General sees the document as a necessary
evolution of the United Nations peacekeeping practices," he said,
adding that the origin of this document goes back to 1995, when
the International Commission of Red Cross raised an initiative in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
However, some languages and contents contained in this bulletin
remain controversial to a number of countries, he said. Some
Northern countries have "philosophical difficulties" with the
document "because for them, it is very difficult to conceive the
U.N. peacekeeping operations, by their very nature, can have its
members involved in a combat situation."
</P>
<P>
Anyway, "the document will be effective as the
Secretary-General has the very authority to promulgate it," he
added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls on India, Pakistan to Exercise Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday expressed regret at the loss of life resulting
from India's downing of a Pakistani plane and called on both
countries to "exercise maximum restraint."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general regrets the loss of life following the
downing of a Pakistani aircraft by the Indian Air Force," Annan
said in a statement issued through his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in response to the shooting down by an
Indian combat aircraft of a Pakistani maritime patrol aircraft
that India said had strayed into its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said the unarmed plane was shot down well within its
territory and that all 16 aboard had been killed. It reserved the
right "to make an appropriate response in self-defence."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman said Annan was "increasingly concerned at
the repeated incidents between India and Pakistan and urges that
the differences between them be resolved by peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
"He calls on both countries to exercise maximum restraint," the
satement said, "The secretary-general looks forward to an early
resumption of the bilateral dialogue between the two countries in
the spirit of the Lahore Declaration."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani and Indian prime ministers promised in Lahore in
February this year to intensify efforts to resolve all issues
between them.

<HEADLINE> Four Independent MPs Re-join Malawi's Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- All four independent members of
parliament (MPs) of Malawi have re-joined the ruling United
Democratic Front (UDF), the Malawi News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the National Assembly Sam Mpasu disclosed this in
parliament Monday as Malawi's parliamentary budget session
1999/2000 deliberations continued.
</P>
<P>
The MPs are Martha Nasho, Friday Kalisinje, Justin Mokowa and
Roy Commcy who went to parliament as independents.
</P>
<P>
They ran as independent in the June 15 parliamentary and
presidential elections after they lost in UDF's primaries.
</P>
<P>
Mpasu explained that the development has come in the work of
letters which were submitted to his office from the MPs in which
they expressed their wish to join the ruling party again.
</P>
<P>
There is no legal barrier to prevent them from joining the UDF
since they didn't belong to any political party, said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
Mpasu then formally welcomed them back to the ruling party and
requested them to leave opposition bench and sit on the
government's side.

TOKYO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's largest opposition party,
the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) on Tuesday night submitted a
no confidence motion to the House of Representatives (lower house)
against the Cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The motion was filed at 11:50 p.m. (local time), Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ's move came after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (
LDP) and its partners on Monday forced through a House of
Councilors (upper house) committee a set of bills to allow
wiretapping in investigations of organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The forcible passage of the bills by the LDP, its coalition
partner Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito party during DPJ
questions was an act of hostility, Shoji Motooka, head of the DPJ'
s upper house members said.
</P>
<P>
DPJ leader Naoto Kan said Monday that his party would submit a
no confidence motion against the cabinet to force a dissolution of
the lower house and scrap the bills.

<HEADLINE> Malawi, Zambia to Re-draw Boundaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Survey departments of Malawi and
Zambia will this week re-demarcate land starting from where Zambia
borders Malawi in Mchinji, a central district, the Malawi News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There has been no proper boundary between the two countries and
as a result disputes have arisen among the people along the area
popularly known as no man's land, District Surveyor in Mchinji,
Ekinal Gonkho, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At present we are using a watershed following a line of
highland separating river systems between the two countries as our
boundary," said Gonkho.
</P>
<P>
The surveyor said that people from both countries along this
watershed cultivate in the area, claiming that they belong to
nobody's.
</P>
<P>
"It is this situation that has forced us to physically
demarcate the land so that people along the watershed should know
where they exactly belong to," Gonkho said, adding that the new
boundary will be recognized by pillars or beacons to be built one
kilometer apart if the area is forest and 500 meters if it is
within settlement areas.
</P>
<P>
The surveyor said that bilateral talks on the demarcation
exercise started in 1994 and the two governments came to an
agreement early this year to start the exercise in the second week
of August.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Indian Forces on Alert After Downing Pakistan Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian armed forces were put
in a "state of alert" in the entire western sector bordering
Pakistan following the shooting down of an "intruding" Pakistani
naval aircraft Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister George Fernandes warned neighboring Pakistan
that any violation of the Indian air space would be treated as a
"hostile act" and any intruding Pakistani aircraft would be shot
down.
</P>
<P>
He gave details of the air incident, saying that the Pakistani
pilot had "indulged in a hostile act by taking a turn towards the
Indian fighter aircraft and challenging it."
</P>
<P>
"The moment this happened the IAF (Indian Air Force) fighter
fired an air-to-air missile, hitting one of the engines of the
intruding Pakistani plane," Fernandes told the press here.
</P>
<P>
"Since the area was covered with thick clouds, the fighter
could not see where the Pakistani plane went down," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that IAF choppers had now reached the crash site and
were trying to extricate the wreckage which lay in the marshy area
in the Sir Creek region of Kutch in India's Western state of
Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the Pakistani plane had fallen within Indian
territory, Fernandes said his country would not allow any
Pakistani aircraft to reach the area or violate its airspace.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that about three Pakistani helicopters had
attempted to approach the area carrying what Islamabad described
as international observers but had to return after IAF warnings.
But he did not say when.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he considered that the incident had led to an
escalation of tension between the two neighbors, Fernandes said,
"I will not say there is any escalation. The aircraft intruded
without notice and was shot down."
</P>
<P>
He said efforts were on to find out with what motive the
aircraft had violated the Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
An Indian Air Force official said that the Pakistani aircraft,
a French-made Breguet Atlantique which has a range of about 9,000
kilometers, was capable of carrying two "AS 12 or AM 39" Exocet
missiles, besides torpedoes and depth charges.
</P>
<P>
With one of its Atlantique being shot down, Pakistan now has
three of these aircraft along with three long-range U.S.-made P3C
Orion planes for maritime reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a spokesman of the Defense Ministry announced that IAF
combat planes shot down a Pakistan navy's anti-submarine and
reconnaissance aircraft after it intruded into the Indian air
space at 11:25 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The intruding Pakistani aircraft was detected by IAF ground
radar at 10:57 a.m. and was immediately intercepted by two MiG-21
aircraft, which took off from Naliya airbase in Gujarat, 10
kilometers south of the international border inside the Indian
territory, the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
When the IAF fighters closed in to identify and signal the
Pakistani aircraft to land at an Indian base nearby, the
four-engine French-built Atlantique aircraft acted "in a hostile
manner by turning into our fighters," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At that stage, the Atlantique was shot down by an air-to-air
missile which hit it on the port engine which caught fire," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
While India said the wreckage of the Pakistan plane was found
by IAF helicopters two kilometers inside the Indian border,
Pakistan reportedly claimed that it had been located within their
area near Badin, some 300 kilometers northeast of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Highly-placed Indian Navy sources said that the navy had been
put in a "state of enhanced vigilance" and was keeping a watch on
possible Pakistani reaction following the shooting down of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), the Directors
General for Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two countries spoke
to each other on the hotline after the downing of the Pakistani
plane.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks between the two DGMOs in the afternoon,
Fernandes said the Indian DGMO, Lt. Gen. N. C. Bij, who informed
his Pakistani counterpart Lt. Gen. Tauquir Zia of the incident,
was told that Pakistan was aware that its aircraft had been shot
down.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Pakistan said the aircraft was
carrying 16 navy personnel comprising six under-training officers
and 10 sailors, all of whom were confirmed dead by Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an unnamed Pakistani Naval official as saying
that the plane went missing at 11:30 a.m. Pakistan time and
helicopters sent out to search it sighted the wreckage on the
ground near Badin "inside the international border on the
Pakistani side."

<HEADLINE> France Reaffirms Its Attachment to Status Quo of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- France reaffirmed on Tuesday its
attachment to the status quo of Jerusalem, after Israel walled up
a new window opened by Palestinians in the Muslim holy site of
Haram al-Sharif in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Our position on the holy city is known: No change of status
quo by any side before a solution is found in the talks on the
final status (of Jerusalem)," said French Foreign Ministry
assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that anything which touches Jerusalem is serious,
adding that "Any action which may by nature increase the tension
should be carefully avoided."
</P>
<P>
Under cover of darkness, Israeli police blocked early Tuesday
morning a window opened by WAQF, the charitable organization in
charge of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, to provide air and light
to basement rooms of Mosque Al-Aqsa, which is located at one end
of Haram al-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The action provoked angry protests from the Palestinians and a
suicide attack on Tuesday near Jerusalem, in which the Palestinian
driver of an automobile was killed.

professional diplomat Francisco Madeira as the special envoy to
the Comoros as part of effort to secure an early solution to the
two-year crisis in the archipelago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angola to Sell Foreign Pirate Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A foreign pirate ship apprehended
by the Angolan government will be sold through "particular
negotiations" after two unsuccessful auctions without potential
buyers, a source of the Maritime Tribunal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal, responsible for the auction of the ship "Han
Nam-7", made such a decision due to the considerable cost of ship
maintenance caused by the delay of acquisition, said Evaristo
Quemba, head of the Maritime Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Quemba said that the tribunal will designate a person for
negotiating with anybody interested in buying the ship.
</P>
<P>
"Han Nam-7", a ship belonging to a South Korean fishing company
 registered in Spain, was apprehended by the Angolan government on
October 22, 1998, when it stealthily entered the Angolan
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan tribunal tried and expelled the captain, and
imposed an over-four-million-U.S.-dollar fine on the fishing
company for illegal fishing in Angolan waters. The fishing
company gave up the ship due to the big amount of the fine.
</P>
<P>
"Han Nam-7" was twice put up at auction since the end of July,
at the prices of 4.437 million dollars and some two million
dollars respectively. But there were nobody interested in a ship
at that price.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Reports Progress to Reaching Goal in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Exactly eight weeks after
the international community arrived in Kosovo, a Serbian province,
to help rebuild the war-torn region, leaders of the main
components of the United Nations Interim Administrative Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) said that despite formidable challenges, the U.N.
mission was on track towards fulfilling its key tasks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference in the provincial capital
of Pristina, representatives of UNMIK's "four pillars" -- civil
administration, humanitarian affairs, institution building and
reconstruction -- reported on their efforts to make tangible
progress on all four fronts, U.N. officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Vian, deputy U.N. special representative for civil
administration, said the goal of having a U.N. presence in all
municipalities was on its way to being fulfilled, either with U.N.
officials in advisory positions or in direct administrative roles,
as in the case of Pristina, Prizren and Pec.
</P>
<P>
"Now, life has come back to relative normalcy, services are
functioning, although in limited manner," Vian said.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. regional administrators had been in place for a month,
guiding efforts to rebuild civil service structures and establish
mechanisms for democratization, he said. Some 30 judges had been
appointed by the u.N. and were already working.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the growing U.N. civilian police presence in
Kosovo, Vian said 602 officers were already on the ground. UNMIK
civilian police had begun joint patrols with the international
peacekeepers, known as KFOR, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
As for the progress in institution building, another U.N.
deputy special representative, Daan Everts, said that the opening
of a police academy in Vucitrn was one of the main priorities.
</P>
<P>
The first courses for 200 local police cadets was scheduled to
begin on August 30, said Everts, who, as the U.N. deputy special
representative for institution building, heads the UNMIK component
led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dennis McNamara, the U.N. deputy special representative for
humanitarian affairs, said with more than 90 percent of the
Kosovar refugees having returned home, UNMIK was now focusing on
providing adequate shelter.
</P>
<P>
To address the enormous need before the onset of winter, the
humanitarian community was providing thousands of tons of shelter
material, including nearly 80,000 shelter kits, said McNamara, The
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights coordinates the UNMIK
humanitarian "pillar."
</P>
<P>
Joan Pearce of the European Union (EU) said that the EU, as
coordinator of the UNMIK reconstruction component, was also
concerned with ensuring adequate housing, as well as water and
power supply before winter.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK's advance party arrived in Kosovo on June 15, five days
after the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution which
authorizes the UNMIK's position as the supreme civilian
administration before an elected autonomous authorities takes
office.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Foresees Tangible Progress in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said here Tuesday he was confident the Middle East
peace process would be back on its right track with tangible
progress.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his meeting with Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein to discuss bilateral ties and the latest
developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed tangible progress would be achieved in
the coming stage in Israeli-Arab peace talks on all tracks. But he
did not eleborate.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Abdullah called on Israel to abide by all
agreements it signed with the Palestinians to move forward the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah described, in particular, the "Wye River accord,
signed in October 1998, as a basic issue to rebuild confidence in
the peace process and to resume peace talks between Israel and
other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Accord, under which Israel should have pulled out its
troops from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three stages
by the end of January, was suspended in early December only after
the first phase was implemented.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on Syrian and Lebanese tracks have been stalled
since 1996 after hardline Israeli former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu took office.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also called on parties concerned to take advantage of
what he saw as positive atmosphere which arose from the May
election victory of Ehud Barak in Israel to create a new momentum
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the new Israeli government headed by Barak valued the
active role played by Jordan through King Abdullah`s efforts and
wide-ranging contacts with parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting, Levy held talks with his Jordanian
counterpart Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib on the peace process in the
region and bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Their talks touched upon bilateral ties in all fields,
especially economic, trade, water cooperation, Jordan's official
news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khatib also called on Israel to comply
with all agreements it signed with parties concerned to achieve a
just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed to continue their
consultations on bilateral ties and the Middle East peace process
in future meetings.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been playing as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace
talks since he signed peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rejects Saudi Mad Cow Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
rejected reported Saudi Arabian claims that its beef products
could be infected with mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have mad cow disease in South Africa -- we never
have," South African Press Association quoted an Agriculture
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gideon Bruckner, director of food safety and veterinary public
health in Agriculture Ministry, said his country could not confirm
media reports that Saudi Arabia had banned beef imports from South
Africa because of concerns over the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said the Saudi government had over the past three or four
months been refusing to accept South African beef imports.
</P>
<P>
"They have made all sorts of claims, including that our meat is
infected with rinderpest -- which has been eradicated at the turn
of the century," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They can give no scientific reasons. There is a snake in the
grass."
</P>
<P>
Bruckner said Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Thoko
Didiza has been asked to take up the matter at a political level.
</P>
<P>
"We are not so much concerned about our Saudi Arabian exports,
as these are but a fraction of our international exports. What
concerns us more is the message going out to other importing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bruckner said South Africa had very strict controls over
imports from countries affected by mad cow disease, and
continuously monitored its own cattle for signs of the sickness.

<HEADLINE> All Remaining Hostages in Sierra Leone Released - UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) - Rebels in Sierra Leone has
released all remaining civilian and military hostages on Tuesday,
a British Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased everyone has come out safely," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said United Nations officials had told Britain's High
Commission in Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone, that
around 200 civilians, 20 Nigerian peacekeepers and a U.N. military
observer had been freed.
</P>
<P>
All the released hostages had reached a control post run by the
West African peacekeeping force on the road to Freetown, he said.
</P>
<P>
The release ended a week-long crisis triggered by last week's
capture of around 40 foreigners who had set out to secure the
release of the Sierra Leone civilians.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, part of a United Nations-led negotiating team,
were seized on Wednesday. They had gone to the Okra Hills, about
60 kilometres from Freetown, to try to persuade the rebels to
release about 100 children abducted earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, who said they were members of Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, former members of the government army who
rebelled and took control of the country in a military coup in
1997, demanded a stake in the peace settlement and to be
readmitted to the Sierra Leonean army.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Banks Increase Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Both Barclays Bank and
Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart) in Botswana have reported
significantly increased earnings in the first six months of 1999,
South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two banks largely underpin the Botswana Stock Exchange, and
account for 48.52 percent of market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax profits were 46.1 million pula (10.1 million U.S.
dollars) for Barclays from 39.0 million (8.5 million dollars) and
for StanChart 46.4 million pula (10.2 million dollars) against
34.2 million pula (7.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Barclays increased its dividend by 29.4 percent to a net 11
thebe, but StanChart held its at 50.5 thebe net because of
increased retention of profit to fund continuing growth. One pula
equals 100 thebe.
</P>
<P>
Both banks increased their loan base substantially. Barclays'
loans and advances were up 68.9 percent to 1,315 million pula
(287.7 million dollars) and StanChart up 29.8 percent to 878
million pula (192 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Transport and Communication Committee of the
Alexandria Local Council has denied any recession in Egyptian
ports.
</P>
<P>
A recent report indicated Egyptian ports handled 52 million
tons of cargo in 1998, an increase of 17 million tons from 1997,
local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said big increase, both in passengers and cargo,
prompted the government to embark on the development of Egyptian
ports and the establishment of national projects aimed at
increasing traffic capability.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The third phase of a food aid project in north Sinai
will be carried out soon, with an investment of 14 million
Egyptian pounds (4.1 million U.S. dollars) and 1 million dollars
donated by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Hassan Shahti, the official in charge of the project,
said Monday that the new phase will last five years from 1999 to
2004, the Arabic Alam Al Yom newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It envisages the construction of 300 houses for bedouins, the
reclamation of 600 feddans (252 hectares) in central Sinai, and
the distribution of food among bedouins at 15 percent of the
market price.
</P>
<P>
The first and second phases, which began in 1986, had been
completed at a total cost of about 75 million pounds (22 million
dollars) for the building of houses for bedouins and the
construction of water dams and outlets in the region.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The third international exhibition of furniture and
internal design will be held in Cairo during the first week of
September.
</P>
<P>
The show in the Cairo International Conference Center on
September 2-5 will group together manufacturers of furniture in
Egypt, the Alam Al Yom said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The organizing company Chairman Mohsin Ghozzi said Monday that
the exhibition would display local and imported furniture for
bathroom, bedroom, garden, swimming pool as well as hotel and
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 130 companies will take part in the
exhibition and no less than 25,000 people from Egypt, other Middle
East countries and Africa will visit the show.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Speaker of Yemeni Consultative Council Abdul Aziz
Abdul Ghani has said the Yemeni economic reforms have helped bring
the foreign debts down to 4.76 billion dollars by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at Sunday's Council meeting, he said Yemen's
external debts in 1994 reached 9.013 billion dollars, the Alam Al
Yom said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Council began its session Sunday to discuss
the issue of loans, assistance and development.
</P>
<P>
TRIPOLI -- Libya will host an international conference on
subterranean water reservoirs in drought areas on November 20-24
to seek proper means to preserve water in such areas.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly organized by the Libyan Ministry of
Agriculture and U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization is also designed to explore sound managing methods
and policies and review environmental impacts on the exploitation
of such reservoirs, the Alam Al Yom reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Euthanasia Not Punishable in Netherlands: Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Euthanasia, or requested
assistance with suicide, may become not punishable in the
Netherlands as the country considered to change its law concerning
the act.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Justice Minister Benk Korthais and Health Minister Els
Borst tabled on Tuesday to the lower house of the parliament a
proposal to exempt the act from criminal law, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
When approved by the legislators, a new provision will be added
to the Dutch Criminal Code to exempt the termination of life on
request and assistance with suicide if two conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
The two conditions under which a doctor will not be liable to
criminal prosecution are: he or she must have fulfilled the
requirements of due care as laid down in a separate act, the
Termination of Life on Request and Assistance with Suicide Act and
he or she must notify his or her actions to the municipal coroner
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Burial and
Cremation Act.
</P>
<P>
But government officials warned that the two conditions are
important and that the general proposition that euthanasia and
assistance with suicide are no longer punishable offenses is not a
correct representation of the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
Regional review committees will continue to exist, however, to
review as before whether the conditions of due care have been met
in terminating life on request and assisting with suicide.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Embassy Presents "White Book" on NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Embassy to Zambia
presented here Tuesday a "White Book" on crimes committed by NATO
during the first month of aggression against its country.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the book to the press, Yugoslav Charge d'Affaires
Dusan Zupan said Serbian and Yugoslav authorities have been
fighting the Albanian separatist guerrillas and terrorists who
killed not only the Serbs but also their fellow Albanians loyal to
the Yugoslav state.
</P>
<P>
"NATO planes struck targets several hundred kilometers away
from Kosovo, and all these targets were civilian: bridges,
refineries, houses, schools, hospitals, heating plants, power
plants, even churches and monasteries. All these objects were
targeted deliberately, because of extremely high precision of very
sophisticated NATO weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO aggression provoked huge exodus of Albanian and Serbian
refugees from the region, he told the press.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav diplomat said NATO planes targeted and killed
refugees who decided to go back homes.
</P>
<P>
"At this very moment, despite the presence of more than 37,000
U.N. troops, we have around 170,000 Serb refugees, more than
30,000 Albanians and several thousand Roma and refugees of other
nationalities out from Kosovo, due to the terror conducted by
Albanian separatists," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO aggression has not solved anything in the Yugoslav
province but brought more violence, confusion and uncertainty
about the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is prepared to pay any price to keep its territorial
 integrity. "From the beginning, we maintained that political
solution is the only way and violence is not a civilized manner to
solve problems," the charge d'affairs said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Eclipse Counting Down, Germans Prepare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- One day before this century's last
total eclipse that encounters their long and happy summer holiday,
millions of Germans are traveling towards the south and southwest,
eagerly waiting for the two-minute highlights when the sunshine
will totally overshadowed by the moon.
</P>
<P>
As astronomers have predicted, in a belt cutting through Europe
the total eclipse can be witnessed at Wednesday noon. The belt,
beginning from southeast Britain and ending at the Black See,
covers two German states, Baden-Wuertenburg in the southwest and
Bavaria in the south.
</P>
<P>
Just at the middle of the belt, two large cities, Munich and
Stuttgart, are recommended as the best sites to observe the
"Sofi," a nick abbreviation that Germans have invented to call the
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Traffic volumes on highways leading to the two cities have
broken the historic records in recent days as millions
holiday-makers are hurrying there.
</P>
<P>
In Munich, a city which attracts thousands of tourists even in
common years, more than 200,000 eclipse observers are expected.
And a hot rock'n roll festival is due to begin Wednesday morning
at the city's Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Seats in a rotating restaurant in Munich, which will provide
special "Sofi Lunch" on the eclipse day and where observers can
have a sharp view on the black sun, were fully booked one month
ago. Expected customers to the restaurant include Roman Herzog,
former German president.
</P>
<P>
A more exciting scene is expected in Stuttgart, an industrial
metropolitan well known as the headquarters of German automotive
giant Daimler-Chrysler. The city announces that it will welcome
some 500,000 visitors, many of whom come from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
And none Mercedes car will be produced in Daimler-Chrysler's
Stuttgart factory Wednesday since the company has planned a halt
of its manufacture line to let its staff take part in the eclipse
revelry.
</P>
<P>
In cities where only part of eclipse can be seen, Germans'
enthusiasm is still kept high.
</P>
<P>
The capital Berlin, the northern harbor of Hamburg, and dozens
of cities and towns are reportedly preparing "Sofi Festivals."
Some of them have planned to hold rallies in medieval style.
Special glasses for eclipse observation are sold in all kinds of
stores and highway gas stations.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the carnival atmosphere, German media are due to
pay vast coverage over the eclipse. Leading television networks
such as ARD and RTL have planned live reportages on the entire
process with cameras on board an observation plane. Newspapers,
from the conservative "Die Welt" to the tabloid "Bild," depict the
coming "Sofi" with cover stories or special editions.
</P>
<P>
Expecting a total darkness to shadow the country for minutes
Wednesday, German authorities have been prepared for traffic jams
or disasters on highways.
</P>
<P>
But of course, everything depends on the weather. On Tuesday,
German Weather Service forecast cloud or shower would occur in
most part of the country, and in Munich, the possibility of a
sunny day would be no higher than 20 percent. It is afraid that
German and foreign visitors can do nothing more than watch the
eclipse on TV in their rooms.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Internet Security Software Market Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide market for
Internet security software jumped 43 percent over 1997 and reached
3.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, a U.S. market research firm said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This year, according to International Data Corporation (IDC),
the market will jump another 39 percent to 4.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the United States was the largest regional market for
Internet security software, representing 54 percent of the market.
Western Europe presents the next-largest opportunity, with 28
percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
IDC expects the market to continue to expand. By 2001, the
market will have more than double its 1998 value. By 2003,
revenues will approach 8.3 billion dollars, representing a solid
21 percent compound annual growth rate from 1998.
</P>
<P>
IDC splits the Internet security software market into four
segments: firewall, encryption, antiviral, and authentication,
authorization and administration software.
</P>
<P>
Authentication, authorization and administration products
represented the largest segment in the 1998 market with 1.6
billion dollars, IDC said. This segment will maintain its top spot
through 2003, when its worth will exceed 3.7 billion dollars.
Firewalls are a fast-growing segment. From 1997 to 1998, the value
of this segment increased 80 percent to 442 million dollars. By
2003, its revenues will approach 1.5 billion dollars. The
increasing popularity of e-commerce is contributing to the growth
of firewalls, IDC said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Bob Herbert, the man who
originally put together the British pop supergroup the Spice
Girls, has died in a car accident, the record company RCA said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Herbert, 57, who picked the five young English women after they
answered his ad in the Stage magazine, was killed instantly Monday
when his car crashed in heavy rain, RCA said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the accident happened on the main road through
Windsor Great Park, Berkshire.
</P>
<P>
Herbert, who was driving a red MGF sports car, lost control in
heavy rain. The car spun and was struck by another car, forcing
the vehicle to leave the carriageway and to collide with a wooden
fence.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old man driving the other car suffered chest
injures which were not serious.
</P>
<P>
The Spice Girls were "shocked and saddened" by the news of his
death, a spokeswoman for the group said.
</P>
<P>
Herbert was the current manager of the British pop boy band
Five.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Likely to Issue Resolution on Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming summit of the
Southern African Development Community slated for August 18 is
likely to issue a resolution on military support to the Angolan
government in its fight against the rebel UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaure Mbuende told a press conference
here Tuesday that all SADC members agreed that they should do
something to support the unarmed Angolan people, especially women
and children in this fighting launched by Jonas Savimbi, the
Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"A resolution is on the way to focus on what could be done for
the Angolan government which includes possible military support,"
he said. Mbuende said there is now no reason for Angolan
government to hold peaceful negotiations with Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Savimbi's friends in Africa, Europe or other
places should tell Savimbi that there is no excuse for the
existence in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"They should ask him to give up war instead of continuing to
supply him with advanced weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende believes that there is no sign showing Savimbi is
willing to end the war, since he not only continues purposefully
sabotaging the peace accord signed with the government, but also
concern himself with the purchase of more weapons including
advanced ones.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also discuss the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and be briefed on the geo-political
military situation in Caprivi, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the annual summit will discuss financial and
economic issues, especially issues concerning food security.

LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- London stocks tumbled more than 2
percent to a six-month low Tuesday as the share sell-off on both
sides of the Atlantic continued.
</P>

The index ended the session 10.3 percent below its lifetime
peak set in May as financial and growth stocks took some of the
heaviest hits.
</P>
<P>
The recent rise in bond yields on both sides of the Atlantic
sparked sharp selling of UK stocks, traders said, with telecoms
and banks the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Telewest Communications closed down 20.75p, or 8.8 percent at
216.5p. Cable and Wireless gave up 5.72 percent - contributing to
the 37 points that telecom stocks erased from the blue chip index.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Surge Puts Pressure On Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A record surge in the oil price
last month sent the cost of raw materials rising at its fastest
rate for almost 20 years in Britain, according to latest official
figures.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said oil prices rose by 21.8
percent in July, helping to take producer input prices up a
seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest monthly rate of producer input price
inflation since January 1980, and was almost double expectations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the surge in raw material costs, factory gate prices
remained little changed, suggesting manufacturers were absorbing
increased costs into margins.
</P>
<P>
Output prices rose by a non-seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in
July to leave annual inflation at 1.1 percent, in line with City
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
"The output side of the figures was much more in line with what
the markets expected," said Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of
America.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that manufacturers are weathering rising oil
prices by cutting labor costs.
</P>
<P>
"Raw material costs are just one element in costs, and their
pick-up is so far likely to have limited inflationary
consequences," an analyst said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Not to Default on Foreign Debt: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Ministry said
Tuesday that the country would not default on external debts
despite its delay in paying some debts.
</P>
<P>
"There has been some slippage in service payments, a delay of
one or two weeks, but not defaulting on debt. We are not about to
default, that is too strong a word," Masakhalia said.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of debt was maturing this year and Kenya is
required to use a lot of foreign currency to meet its
obligations, said Masakhalia.
</P>
<P>
Kenya encountered lags in available revenue to convert to
foreign currency, but the minister said the government would not
borrow extensively from domestic markets to meet their obligations
due to the pursuit of a balanced budgetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Micah Cheserem, governor of Central Bank of Kenya, said the
central bank had enough dollars to meet the country's debt
obligations.
</P>
<P>
"To say we are defaulting is not accurate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency reserves held by Kenya's banking system stood
at 946 million U.S. dollars at the end of May. The figure for
official foreign currency reserves held by the central bank was
619 million dollars by late May.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had external debt of some 4.4 billion dollars in May,
treasury and central bank figures showed.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Pool Resources for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete Tuesday called on African countries to integrate
their resources so that they could compete effectively in the
world in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students of the East African Uongozi (Leadership)
Institute in the northern town of Arusha, Kikwete said cooperation
is key to the continent's survival, particularly when economic
globalization has become an irreversible trend of the world.
</P>
<P>
African countries should draw experience from other parts of
the world in forming economic groupings like the European Union,
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Africa is pushing ahead with the agenda of economic
integration, he said, adding that the process of building the
African Economic Community has started as various countries have
formed regional groupings and are negotiating crucial protocols on
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kikwete criticized the Western media, which
constantly portrays negative sides of the continent, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
He said although Africa is still rife with conflicts for
decades, it has made great efforts in bringing them to an end
through peaceful resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is stigmatized collectively," Kikwete said during a
working tour to the college where students come from various
African, American and European countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa is not entirely in war or conflicts. The
Uongozi Institute's main goal is to foster leadership qualities of
the younger generation of east Africans. The students are
undergoing a joint program of four universities from Tanzania,
Kenya, Uganda and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Release of Hostages in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday voiced his relief that all United Nations and
West African peacekeepers had been released by a group of Sierra
Leonean rebels and called on all parties concerned to ensure there
was no repetition.
</P>
<P>
"With the resolution of this deplorable episode, all Sierra
Leoneans and the international community should now look ahead and
devote all energies to the implementation of the Lome Peace
Agreement," Annan said in a statement issued here through his
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an accord signed in Lome, the Togolese
capital on July 7 aimed at ending an eight-year civil war in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks were in reaction to the release by rebels of
the last group of military and civilian hostages held for the past
week in the West African jungle.
</P>
<P>
They included about 200 civilians, 20 Nigerians from a West
African peacekeeping force, and a U.N. military observer. Other
hostages had been set free earlier.
</P>
<P>
The release ended a crisis triggered by the seizure last
week of about 40 foreigners who had set out to secure the
release of the Sierra Leone civilians, including a large number
of children.
</P>
<P>
Annan gratefully acknowledged the "crucial role" played by
the Sierra Leone government and president, as well as other
regional leaders and the former rebel Revolutionary United
Front led by Foday Sankoh, in seeking a peaceful resolution of
of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Cattle-rustling Causes Famine in E. Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cattle rustling and banditry
have disrupted normal agricultural activities and resulted in a
food shortage in Kenya's Eastern Province, a member of parliament
Tuesday told a workshop facilitated by Kenyan Agriculture
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of residents in the province experienced
cattle rustling or banditry, making it difficult for them to
concentrate on farming, said legislator Maoka Maore.
</P>
<P>
Maore revealed that out of the 13 districts in the province,
only three districts were free of banditry and cattle-rustling.
</P>
<P>
He said livestock farmers in the province had lost thousands of
cattle to rustlers and most of the victims never recover their
livestock.
</P>
<P>
Maore said rampant banditry had scared some residents off their
home, making it difficult to engage in meaningful economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop brought together stakeholders in the food
 production industry in Eastern Province, with an aim to formulate
a sound national food policy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Stop Airstrikes on Iraq on Wednesday Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States would not
stop hitting Iraqi military sites despite Wednesday's eclipse of
the sun, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S. and British
warplanes patrolling no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq
would continue their attacks on Iraqi military sites when
encourtering challenges from Iraq's defense system.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a reporter's question whether the U.S. and
British military would suspend airstrikes to avoid hitting Iraqis
who might be out in the open watching the eclipse, which includes
Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Pakistan in its sweep.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't challenge the allied planes, the allied planes
will not respond," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. warplanes had been striking Iraqi military sites
on the average of 15 time a month in the eight months since
Operation Desert Fox last December, about six a month in the
southern no-fly zone and nine a month in the northern one.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi military sites in a
second consecutive day of bombings in the northern no-fly zone,
according to U.S. European Command based in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Air Force F-15s and F-16s dropped precision-guided bombs on two
separate communications facilities, north and northeast of Mosul,
the command said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also reporter U.S airstrikes in the southern no-fly zone
but provided no details.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Philippines for Success in Weathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) commended Tuesday the authorities of the Philippines
for the sustained implementation of economic policies under the
program that had allowed the southeast Asian country to weather
the regional crisis relatively well.
</P>
<P>
In an annual review of the Philippine economy, the IMF noted
that the country's "external position had improved markedly,
economic growth has started to recover, and inflation had come
down well within program targets."
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF said, the country still has to meet the twin
challenge of preserving the stabilization gains while bolstering
the prospects for a strong and sustained recovery.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the countries most heavily affected by the Asian
financial crisis, the Philippine economy was able to avoid a
severe recession and the disruptions to economic activity
experienced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Following a 5 percent growth of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in 1997, the economy contracted slightly by 0.5 percent in
1998. For the year of 1999, GDP growth is projected in a range of
1-3 percent, with recent developments suggesting an outcome in the
upper half of the range.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Sustains 22-month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Crude Oil prices hovered around
22-month highs Tuesday amid good demand for physical crude and
projections of faster growth in the world's thirst for oil next
year.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend crude oil closed at 20.49 U.S. dollars a
barrel in London trade, after hitting a peak of 20.56 U.S. dollars
in early trade, its strongest value since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Oil has rocketed by a full U.S. dollar a barrel in the space of
a week amid fresh evidence of restraint by OPEC producers, strong
U.S products markets and improving refinery profit margins.
</P>
<P>
The market posted a solid 40 cent gain Monday after an
explosion at a U.S. oil refinery strengthened U.S. refined
products values.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the market drew more strength from International
Energy Agency estimates that world oil demand growth would quicken
markedly next year after slow increases in the past two.
</P>
<P>
"The nascent economic recovery in Asia should continue to
gather momentum and non-OPEC supply growth will be sluggish,"
Reuters quoted the Paris-based IEA as saying in its monthly Oil
Market Report.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said good physical demand for crudes in Europe,
triggered by an upswing in refinery profit margins, also helped
underpin the market.
</P>
<P>
The IEA said initial estimates for demand in 2000 showed growth
of 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) to 77 million, double the
900,000 bpd increase this year. Non-OPEC supplies would rise only
modestly next year, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Some brokers said that despite Brent's strength, a slowing
momentum of business and light trading volumes might amount to a
technical warning that a correction could be due.
</P>
<P>
But overall sentiment remains firm following latest indication
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is keeping
a tight rein on production.

<HEADLINE> Annan Outlines U.N. Post-Ballot Role in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan proposed on Tuesday that the United Nations should play
"a substative role" in East Timor in the post-ballot period with
its increasing presence there.
</P>
<P>
In his new report to the Security Council, Annan said
irrespective of the outcome of the August 30 vote on the future of
the territory, the U.N. has to redouble its efforts to build
confidence and support stability in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The report proposes that the U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) established on June 11 be restructed for the interim
phase, with an eventual number of 460 civilian police, up from 280
proposed before.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET military component would be increased to 300 from 50 to
liaise the Indonesian armed forces and different political forces
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The military component would be also charged with advising on
security matters including the disarmament of local militias.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes in UNAMET will ensure the presence of the
U.N. in all 13 districts of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General has requested authorization for an
initial period of three months for UNAMET presence from the date
of the ballot. He had previously decided that UNAMET stay until
September 30, one month from the voting date.
</P>
<P>
Based on the May 5 agreement signed by Indonesia, Portugal and
the U.N., the world body will organize and conduct a popular
consultation to determine the future of East Timor, former
Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
If the majority of the 800,000 East Timorese accept a special
autonomy formula, the U.N. is requested to monitor and verify the
implementation of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
If the result is a rejection of autonomy, arrangements will be
made for the peaceful transfer of authority in East Timor to the
U.N. which will initiate the procedure for the territory to go
towards independence.

<HEADLINE> UK's Economy in Cautious Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The UK economy is showing clear
signs of recovery, according to new figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in the manufacturing industry has improved for the
first time in 18 months, and High Street or consumer spending rose
for the second month in a row. However, both sectors say
conditions are still tough, and warn that an increase in interest
rates could have an adverse effect.
</P>
<P>
The survey of manufacturers for the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) shows an upbeat mood in all the UK's key regions.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the start of 1998, more manufacturers
were optimistic than pessimistic, though companies were still
reporting falling output and orders.
</P>
<P>
"While many regions seem poised to emerge from the
manufacturing recession, the rises in confidence in some regions
should be treated with caution," BBC quoted Sudhir Junankar of the
CBI as saying. "Manufacturers across the UK are facing a
relentless squeeze on profit margins and are struggling to cope
with a strong pound."
</P>
<P>
The CBI report came after the government's July survey of UK
purchasing managers showed manufacturing growing at its fastest
rate for 18 months. However, the fragility of the recovery is
illustrated by the fact that the latest official figures showed
factory output was falling.
</P>
<P>
And a study released this week predicted that 160,000 factory
jobs could be lost over the next 18 months because of the strong
pound.
</P>
<P>
On High Street, shop sales grew by 0.8 percent in July, fueled
by the effects of seasonal items, from ice-cream to garden
furniture.
</P>
<P>
The figures, from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), followed
June's even bigger growth of 1.8 percent. However, the BRC said
the continuing rise in sales was being achieved at a price.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Higginson, chairman of the BRC's economic affairs
committee, said, "There appears to be the beginnings of a recovery
in sales, but we are far from the boom conditions that some people
are suggesting, judged by the performance of the housing market."
</P>
<P>
These latest sets of figures come against the backdrop of a
report by the Society of Business Economists (SBE) which saw the
outlook for the UK economy brightening.
</P>
<P>
It said consumer spending was set to rise and exporters'
prospects were improving, boosted by recent interest rate cuts and
strong house price growth.
</P>
<P>
The SBE's chairman, David Kern, said that as the UK had
successfully avoided a recession, its economy was set to return to
trend growth by the second half of this financial year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks suffered
more losses for the third straight day Tuesday as investors widely
expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones closed down 52.55 at 10,655.15. The blue chip

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges India, Pakistan to Avoid Misunderstanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday urged India
and Pakistan to avoid further provocation and misunderstanding
after India shot down a Pakistani maritime aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"We regret the loss of life. We are urging India and Pakistan
to take the greatest care to avoid provocation and
misunderstanding," a Reuters report quoted a British Foreign
Office spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made after India has shot down a Pakistani
military aircraft killing all 16 people on board.
</P>
<P>
India said the reconnaissance and anti-submarine Berguet
Atlantique plane strayed into its airspace off the coast of the
western state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan argued that the plane was brought down in its
territory while on a routine training flight and the wreckage is
on its side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad immediately branded the attack an "unprovoked
aggression" and said it reserved the right to make an "appropriate
response".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India said it had put its navy on high alert.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Set to Vaccinate 10 Million Children in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies
are preparing to vaccinate some 10 million children against polio
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has one of the highest
virus transmission rates in the world, the U.N. officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central African country's warring parties have agreed to
stop fighting so the first of three vaccination required to ensure
effective immunization can begin this weekend, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had appealed for "Days
of Tranquillity" to allow the immunization program to go ahead, has
received assurances from the country that they would lay down
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Even with localized fighting, relief agencies believe the
campaign can reach more than 95 percent of children under five
years of age.
</P>
<P>
In his call for the parties to comply with the truce to
facilitate the polio immunization campaign, Annan said the
vaccination campaigns were "a platform for the peace-building
process. They open windows of opportunity for dialogue between the
different sides."
</P>
<P>
The campaign to eradicate polio from the world by the end of
they year 2000 is being spearheaded by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF). Congo (K) is the single highest priority in the global
polio eradication effort.

<HEADLINE> India Witnesses Millennium's Last Solar Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- As the moon briefly blocked
the rays of the setting sun over large parts of central India
Wednesday evening, millions of Indians caught the last chance in
the millennium to watch the nature's grand cosmic drama.
</P>
<P>
A ribbon of darkness girdled central parts of the country,
where sunlight was totally blotted out by the moon, while people
elsewhere including the Indian capital could only witness a
partial eclipse, that brought in early twilight in a sky already
darkened by the clouds.
</P>
<P>
As the eclipse swept across India, the air chilled, an anxious
silence fell, confused birds headed home and flowers folded their
petals before the sun reappeared and made a final bow out of the
horizon later.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers here said the eclipse started in the Atlantic in
Canada at sunrise, swept through Cornwall in southwest Britain,
across Europe through northern France, Germany, Austria, Hungary
and Romania, then through Iran and Iraq in west Asia and in
neighboring Pakistan before entering India.
</P>
<P>
It was first visible over India's western coast at 17:58 p.m.
local time. The moon's shadow raced across central India to the
Bay of Bengal at 18:06 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of nature lasted a little over a minute in some
parts of the country and barely 25 seconds in other areas, but it
created an 80-kilometer-wide corridor of darkness across central
India.
</P>
<P>
However, the breathtaking sights typical of a solar eclipse
were missing for Indians this time.
</P>
<P>
Keeping in mind the sunset time of the eclipse and rainy
forecasts, several Indian astrophysicists headed to Iran, which
offered a better view to conduct experiments.
</P>
<P>
People in New Delhi missed the spectacle as the capital did not
fall in the line of totality. A partial eclipse started in the
city at 16:51 p.m. local time and lasted for about two hours.

<HEADLINE> 616 Zimbabwean Families to Be Settled Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 616 families will have
been resettled on 15 of the acquired farms by the end of this
month, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"More people will be resettled on about 54,000 hectares of land
on the remaining 23 farms that have been acquired," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The president said this at the commemoration of the Heroes Day
at the National Heroes Acre in capital Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said the second phase of the land reform program had now
gathered momentum and that the government had endorsed the
inception phase framework plan, thus sanctioning its
implementation with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the governments of Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands
and the United States had committed one million U.S. dollars for
the establishment of a technical support unit to facilitate the
implementation phase.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the land reform program would provide a sustainable
base upon which to predicate long-term peace, political stability
and favorable prospects for sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government's aim has always been to acquire at least one
million hectares of commercial farm land every year for
resettlement purposes in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The government has acquired 38 farms so far this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 559 families were resettled last year.

<HEADLINE> Create Scientific Social Environment to Fight Falun Gong: Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China should strive to create a
civilized and scientific social environment to step up the fight
against Falun Gong, says a commentator's article to be carried in
the People's Daily tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the Falun Gong issue has in-depth social
causes and a complicated political background instead of being an
accidental phenomenon, the article says.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons for the organization of Falun Gong and
its founder Li Hongzhi to be able to fan the flames of disorder is
that ignorance and superstition prevail in some parts of the
country, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Since the policies of reform and opening up were introduced two
decades ago, China has scored outstanding achievements in its
economy, social progress and the building of socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, various ideologies swarmed in by taking
advantage of the opening environment. In some localities,
sorcerers and fortune-tellers have enjoyed booming business, with
some books, films and TV programs produced full of pseudo-sciences
and superstitions, it says.
</P>
<P>
Some party officials, including a handful in leading positions,
just shut their eyes to the phenomena, and some even participated
in superstitious practices, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Against such a social background, it is easy to understand the
urgency and importance of strengthening the building of socialist
ethics to create a civilized and scientific social environment, it
says.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Political Motives and Serious Mischief: Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The 16th issue of the magazine
Seeking Truth carries a commentary on Li Hongzhi and the political
motives of his Falun Gong sect and its serious harm.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Li Hongzhi is interested in politics
and has conspicuous political ambitions, and his illegal Falun
Gong cult interfered in political and social issues and instigated
people to oppose the government.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi's ulterior motive is to grab the ideological
commanding heights from the Communist Party, it said. To achieve
this, he fabricated a whole set of absurd ideas, and made people
believe that his words were the only absolute truth in the world.
</P>
<P>
His remarks on Heaven and God, as well as Falun Gong's
rejection of other religious beliefs plainly reveal his aim of
overthrowing materialism and the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Winning people over by deceiving them was Li's major ploy to
achieve his political goal. He asked people to forsake social
activities, lose confidence in the government, and break away from
Communist Party leadership, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Falun Gong is by no means an organization
devoted to promoting health, but a political tool with a rigorous
organization. Its task is to oppose the government with the
support of a vicious political force.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Political Motives and Serious Mischief: Commentary (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary said that the Communist Party is the core of the
leadership of the Chinese people and the socialist cause. If
anything hampers this leadership, China will be in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
If Falun Gong's influence is not curbed, the Party leadership
will be threatened. What Li preached is spiritualism, the opposite
of materialism, which Communist Party members believe.
</P>
<P>
Some Party members became addicted to superstitious thinkings
and lost the basic quality of being Communist Party members. Falun
Gong has undermined the Party's cohesiveness and must be
eliminated, the commentary stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his followers stirred up incidents time and
again, seriously disrupting social order.
</P>
<P>
The late senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping stressed
repeatedly that "stability is the overwhelming issue for China.
Without stability, nothing can be achieved, and the fruits
already achieved will be lost soon or later."
</P>
<P>
Li also knew this very well, and because of this he tried every
means to cause social disorder. If Falun Gong had not been banned,
there would have been serious political repercussions, it said.
</P>
<P>
All in all, the commentary concluded, Li Hongzhi and his sect
have clear political motives and ambitions. The emergence and
expansion of Falun Gong have brought great harm to the people and
the Communist Party. The fight against Li Hongzhi is a political
one and will affect China's development. Its harmfulness must be
fully realized and its evil influences eliminated.

<P>
He deified himself and claimed to have supernatural powers. He
made people believe that he was the Savior. He may not understand
theology, but he wanted to be idolized by people, because through
this he could realize his political ambition.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi disseminated the claim that "the government is
useless" and cannot solve mankind's problems. He exaggerated China
's problems, directly accusing the Chinese government, the
commentry said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of slandering the government was to replace it, the
commentary pointed out. Li's answer to the question of who could
solve the people's problems was that Falun Gong is the only law of
the human society, and that he was chosen by God to save the
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Li demanded that all people should turn to him for solutions.
He wished to control people through making them practice Falun
Gong and thereby come to idolize him, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Falun Gong sect also tried every means to
corrupt the Communist Party of China. He cultivated adherents
among Party members and high-ranking officials. He wanted them to
break away from the Communist Party leadership and obey only him.

NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- India accused Pakistan
Wednesday of firing a surface-to-air missile at its helicopter
carrying journalists to the site of the wreckage of the downed
Pakistani military aircraft in western area bordering with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Indian Air Force (IAF) official here said the
Pakistani missile missed the target and "all the occupants of the
helicopter are safe".
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when one of the three helicopters
carrying journalists and officials to the wreckage site on the
Indian side of the international border in the western state of
Gujarat was targeted by a Pakistani surface-to-air missile.
</P>
<P>
"the helicopter immediately ducked and escaped being hit," the
official said, adding that the missile flew past the chopper by a
few hundred meters.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the helicopter, when attacked, was
four kilometers within Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
The journalists and officials could not reach the site of the
wreckage of the Pakistani Atlantique surveillance and
anti-submarine plane in the Kori Greek area by the Arabian Sea and
all the three choppers had to return to their base safely.
</P>
<P>
The official said that IAF had already taken precautions for
the visit of the journalists and fighter jet cover had been

<P>
The immigrants, including two Romanians, 80 Iraqis, 18
Pakistanis and three Bangladeshis, were later taken into custody
for violating the Turkish borders and the passport law.
</P>
<P>
The other 256 illegal immigrants, including 251 Iraqis and five

<HEADLINE> Canadian Premiers Agree on Deep Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada's provincial premiers and
territorial leaders reached a consensus here Tuesday to make deep
tax cuts due to an anticipated surplus in the next federal budget.
</P>
<P>
During the country's 40th conference of provincial premiers,
slated from Monday to Wednesday, the local leaders agreed that
Ottawa should use the impending surplus of 10 billion Canadian
dollars (6.8 billion U.S. dollars) to make deep tax cuts and
restore transfer payments to the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Conference Host Lucien Bouchard of Quebec hailed the agreement
as a "balanced approach," saying that "reducing taxes will improve
the Canadian economy, accelerate job growth, and alleviate the
heavy fiscal burden taxpayers are shouldering."
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada, the biggest private-run bank in the
country, suggested during the third day of the meeting, a 20
percent tax cut over five years, saying Ottawa would be able to do
it without making spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
In a study to be released Wednesday, the bank says the budget
surplus could reach 25.9 billion Canadian dollars (about 17.7
billion dollars) by the fiscal year 2004-2005.
</P>
<P>
Even if Ottawa set aside 7 billion Canadian dollars (about 4.8
billion dollars) as a cushion, it would still have an 18.9 billion
Canadian dollar (about 12.9 billion dollars) fiscal windfall for
tax cuts, the study says.

<HEADLINE> Situation Remains Tense in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Ambon, capital
of Indonesia's Maluku province, remained tense till Wednesday
afternoon as clashes continued to claim lives.
</P>
<P>
Three people died and 56 others were wounded Wednesday,
according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Military Command Chief Brigadier General Max Tamaela
denied reports that security forces had clashed in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about the conflict appeared after shots were heard
during rioting. After checks were made it was found that some
people had worn security forces' uniforms during the incident,
Tamaela said.
</P>
<P>
They have deliberately used the uniform to split the security
forces, he said, adding that he had seized some of them.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, military spokesman Major General Syamsul Maarif
Wednesday said security authorities are investigating rumors that
a large number of illegal firearms have been sent into Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Col. Saleh Saaf also said that police were
investigating rumors about a container of firearms having been
smuggled into Ambon.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligence officers are still investigating the rumors but
so far no indication about their truth has been found," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that some rioters had used firearms but they were
all home-made.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed about 400 people this
year. Authorities said more than 400 have been injured since
religious clashes erupted in the province in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population are Christian.
Most of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.

ANKARA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey hoped that a positive
solution to be reached at the ongoing sixth meeting of the
Turkish-Iranian Higher Commission on Security, a Turkish Foreign
Ministry official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli made the
remarks at a weekly press conference. He said that the meeting,
which began Tuesday in Ankara, is being held in a positive
atmosphere.
</P>

Local Hurriyet (Freedom) daily has said that Iran's release of
the two soldiers would show a "sign of goodwill" to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Israel Closes Palestinian Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel sealed off several
Palestinian villages in the West Bank Wednesday after an Israeli
man was moderately wounded in a shooting incident late Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers imposed a closure on areas close to the
village of Arabbe in northern West Bank, where a Jewish settler
was shot and wounded, Israel Radio reported. No organization
claimed responsibility for the incident yet.
</P>
<P>
Israelis were warned that there might be an increase in
militant attacks since Israel and the Palestinians were resuming
the peace process stalled under former Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, which opposes to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace making, has said that it would resume
militant attacks against Israel. It has carried out several major
suicide bombings in Israel since 1993, when the historic Oslo
accords between Israel and the Palestinians were signed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Police Chief Yehuda Wilk told Israeli army radio that
Israeli security forces had foiled several attack attempts in the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank town of Bethlehem
rammed his car twice into a group of Israeli soldiers Tuesday at
an intersection about 30 miles southwest of Jerusalem, injuring 11
before being shot to death by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
But the new Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) took careful steps
to avoid a confrontation after the terror attack.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity that
Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat will hold a summit after
negotiators from the two sides reach agreement on a timetable
for the implementation of the Wye accord signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat met in Jerusalem Wednesday afternoon to resume their
negotiations, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office on July 6, Barak has promised to carry out
the Wye agreement, but he proposed to fold the third and final
part, of the agreement into final-status talks, which deals with
thorny issues such as Jerusalem and settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have turned down the idea, calling on Barak to
fully implement the Wye before entering the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
During their second summit late last month since Barak
assuming office, Barak gave Arafat two weeks to consider his
propos, which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media have reported that secret channels had been
established to work out the timetable of the implementation.
Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu Mazen, told Palestinian
radio Wednesday that he was hopeful that agreement would be
reached on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides seemed to have agreed on the timetable to further
implement the last two stages of the Wye accord to hand over 11
percent more of the West Bank to the Palestinians. Israel had
returned 2 percent of the land in the first stage under the accord.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he would resume troops withdrawal in early
September and Arafat has reluctantly accepted the starting
time.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are still disputing over Barak's proposal to
delay the third stage until after a framework for the final-status
talks has been worked out, or around February next year.
</P>
<P>
Barak told a security cabinet meeting Wednesday that he would
implement the Wye agreement, but expected the PNA would consider
his proposal.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaret said Barak was now offering to carry out
the final part of the Wye accord by January. Sher was to propose
the idea to Erekat when they met, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But Abu Mazen reportedly told Barak during a secret meeting
earlier this week that the implementation of Wye should be
completed in full by mid-November in line with its original
timetable.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five people were injured
or sustained a shock in an earthquake Wednesday, the Cyprus News
Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, occurred
at 07:27 a.m. local time (0427 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake was in Gerasas region, north of
the southern coastal town of Limassol, but it was felt throughout
the island.
</P>
<P>
In Limassol, a Hospital First Aid spokesman said that two
persons suffered fractures when they jumped from the second floor
of a building to escape. Others were taken to the hospital in a
state of shock.
</P>
<P>
A Police spokesman said that there were numerous reports of
damage to homes in the Limassol district.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is located in a seismic zone and earthquakes are
common.
</P>
<P>
In October 1996, the island was hit by a quake measuring 6.3 on
the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
In February 1995, two people in the western Paphos region were
killed in an earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, when
the roof of their home caved in.
</P>
<P>
Other tremors in recent years have caused little damage and no
loss of life.

<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- the Chinese government has
attached great importance to protecting the rights of the country'
s 55 ethnic minorities over the past 50 years, said a senior
Chinese official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China is a unified nation with many ethnic groups," said Qiao

formulated and implemented a series of effective policies, such as
the system of ethnic autonomy,
</P>
<P>
On the elimination of racial discrimination, he told the
meeting that "with great help from the central government, arduous
efforts by the ethnic people have substantially changed the
situation in ethnic regions, hence the enjoyment of human rights
by ethnic peoples has been remarkably improved."

The population of the 55 minority groups amounts to 108 million,
which accounts for 8.98% of the total population of China.
</P>

MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of Russian experts
arrived in Tbilisi, Georgia, Wednesday to conduct a joint
investigation in the bombing of a village near the borders with
the Russian republics of Chechnya and Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Four people were reportedly killed in the bombing by
unidentified planes in Zemo Omalo, Georgia, the Interfax news

LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Roy Keane has not made his mind
up over Manchester United's final contract offer, his solicitor
and adviser said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kennedy, who is representing the United skipper in
talks with the club, insists Keane will make his decision by the
end of the week as promised.
</P>
<P>
One report claimed he had decided to reject United's last offer,
which would herald his departure from Old Trafford. However
Kennedy insists Keane is mulling over the club's offer following
the end of negotiations last week.
</P>
<P>
"Roy has not made any decision and he will make it at the end
of the week," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keane, who was 28 on Tuesday, is determined to take as long as
he wants before deciding whether or not to accept United's final
offer.
</P>
<P>
His present deal expires next summer and he wants to secure the
best terms possible because he knows this is his last big contract.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Ireland midfielder has already rejected one
offer from the club, which was reportedly worth 28,000 pounds a
week.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he
offered to quit Manchester United last summer after questions were
raised about his dedication to the job.
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford manager reveals in his autobiography Managing
My Life that he was summoned to a meeting with United chairman
Martin Edwards and plc chairman Sir Roland Smith.
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex felt the meeting had been set up to discuss his then
number two Brian Kidd whom, the manager felt, had been undermining
his authority. The purchase of Dwight Yorke was also expected to
be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"I was under the impression the purpose of our gathering was to
discuss Kidd and Yorke, but Martin Edwards began with a long
speech about me," writes Ferguson. "He praised my capacities as a
manager but said my success at Old Trafford had made me a
celebrity and I was not focusing on the job as much as I had done.
"
</P>
<P>
He adds: "My new found interest in owning racehorses had
obviously not gone down well. I could hardly believe what I was
hearing but let Martin and Sir Roland make their points before
asking 'Do you want me to call it a day?
</P>
<P>
"'No, no,' they both said quickly, adding further tributes to
my management and insisting they were only trying to give me
advice."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson replied: "Don't you realise the only way I can survive
is to have a release from football?"

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Compatriots Condemn Lee Teng-hui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan compatriots of all
walks of life in south China's Guangdong Province held a meeting
today in this provincial capital to denounce Lee Teng-hui's "two
states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Ye Yongchang, president of the Guangdong Provincial Association
of Taiwan Compatriots, said that the "two states" statement
trotted out by Lee Teng-hui on July 9 has aroused strong
opposition from all people, including Taiwan compatriots, in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 Taiwan compatriots living in the province have
indignantly denounced, in various ways, Lee's remarks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jinxian, a representative of local Taiwan compatriots, said
that despite the fact that many countries have recently re-
affirmed that they only recognize one China, Lee Teng-hui still
insists on explaining his "two states" statement through Koo Chen-
fu and Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council".
</P>
<P>
Lee has attempted to fool the people under the pretense of
safeguarding the interests of Taiwan's people, but his true motive
of splitting the motherland remains unchanged, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan compatriots attending the talks all agreed that what
Lee has done over the past ten years is aimed at splitting Taiwan
from China.
</P>
<P>
Lee's splittist remarks and actions have seriously damaged the
foundation for cross-straits relations and will bring catastrophe
to the people of Taiwan, as he is making a political adventure by
gambling with the future of Taiwan and the benefits, welfare and
fate of the 2.2 million people of Taiwan, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful reunification of the motherland is the inexorable
trend of history, and if Lee Teng-hui refuses to come to his
senses and continues his separatist activities, he is bound to
become a traitor to the Chinese nation, they said.

warned that such activities were not conducive to normalization

kilometers inside Indian air space and the wreckage "is located in

<HEADLINE> "Li Hongzhi Made a Fortune out of Falun Gong" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Falun Gong founder Li
Hongzhi made a fortune out of spreading his fallacies, ex-
practitioners have said.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China's Jilin Province has recently unearthed three
cases concerning illegal Falun Gong publications, two of which
involved 180,000 published volumes and 6,000 volumes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The books earned Li and his followers approximately 900,000
yuan due to low costs and high prices, said Cheng Zhifang, an
official at the provincial press and publishing bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Ying, a woman who used to be a practitioner in Chongzhou
City in southwest China's Sichuan Province, who was urged to see
doctors by her family because of her worsening health, burned her
books on Falun Gong upon learning that Li himself took medicine
and had a luxurious house. "What a liar!" she said angrily.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shukui, who used to head a Falun Gong training center in
Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei Province, broke a
bronze statue of Li Hongzhi, which he had bought for 2,500 yuan. "
I paid for his lectures and books, and this statue, but he
accumulated fortunes out of us."
</P>
<P>
Li and his disciples went to Guanxian County in east China's
Shandong Province in 1992, and organized a 140-member training
class, for which each practitioner paid 40 yuan. Half of the money
went into Li's pocket, according to an agreement, said Zhang
Dailing, the former head of the county training center.
</P>
<P>
"But when the training class was over, Li broke his promise,
demanding 70 percent of each tuition fee and another 180 yuan from
each participant to buy clothes," Zhang recalled.

ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's top defense body
Wednesday warned that it might make "an appropriate response" to
the shooting down of its naval plane by Indian air force on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would be "fully justified" in making such a response
in self-defense and "all provocations and violations" of its air
space would meet a befitting response, said the Defense Committee
of the Cabinet (DCC) in an official announcement after its meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
"All provocations and violations of Pakistan's air space would
be considered as hostile acts and given a befitting response,"
said the announcement, adding that the Armed Forces have been
directed to take all necessary measures in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the DCC was briefed on
the incident of the "naked aggression" of shooting down by India
an unarmed Pakistani plane "within its territorial limits" on
Tuesday killing all 16 men on board.
</P>
<P>
The committee expressed Pakistan's strong condemnation of
India's "wanton and cowardly act".
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the "sense of indignation of the entire nation
and "affirmed that the nation was fully united in its resolve to
face the Indian aggression," according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Senior Pakistani officials including Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz, the three services chiefs, and the foreign and defense
secretaries attended the DCC meeting.

<HEADLINE> Canada Warns of Cutting Radarsat-2 Connection with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Industry Minister John
Manley has threatened to cut the American connection with the
Canadian Radarsat-2 satellite project if the U.S. continues to
hamper the project with delays.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media "the Globe and Mail" and "the Ottawa Citizen"
Wednesday quoted Manley as complaining about delayed permission by
the U.S. to export key hardware to Canada for the 305-million-
dollar (about 207 million U.S. dollars) satellite, which is
scheduled to be launched in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The project has been unable for eight months to get the U.S.
government permission to export the satellite shell "bus" to
Canada, or to even allow the American parent company to work with
its Canadian subsidiary on the project, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they are concerned that data from Radarsat-2,
which can provide images as small as three meters through darkness
or clouds, could be acquired by potential enemies, the newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
Manley told an international aerospace conference Tuesday that
although Ottawa is still trying to resolve the issue with
Washington, his country will look for a European company to supply
the commercial satellite "bus."

<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa or COMESA is working out ways of preventing
revenue losses that might arise when the regional grouping enters
a free trade area scheduled for October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony for the grant of 16 million
U.S. dollars given by the European Union (EU) to the COMESA here
Wednesday, Secretary-General of the African regional organization
Erastus Mwencha noted that the grant, which will go to a project
on the harmonization of customs and trade statistics, has come at
a critical time when COMESA members are preparing to launch a free
trade area.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said that the COMESA has managed to harmonize customs
and trade statistics in 13 out of the 21 member countries.
</P>
<P>
"My appeal to member states is to remain on course as regards
liberalization and integration of our economics in the full
assurance that the benefits of the free trade area will definitely
outweigh the transition costs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, EU resident representative
Jochen Krebs said that his organization is happy with the efforts
the COMESA is making in creating a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Krebs also pledged EU's continued support for the COMESA
project on harmonization of customs and trade statistics.
</P>
<P>
The EU official noted that an improved customs system will make
it easier for COMESA countries to trade with each other.

BRUSSELS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Belgium viewed the
eclipse Wednesday with mixed feelings. Some managed to get a
glimpse of the rare phenomenon at a few vantage points, while
others chose to view it at home and on television. Others were
caught in traffic jams on highways and were not able to reach an
advantageous location to see it.
</P>
<P>
Dark clouds and continuous drizzle overnight from Monday to
Tuesday kept many eclipse watchers at home until early Wednesday
morning when the weather appeared as if it might clear.
</P>
<P>
The sudden rush toward the south of the country or into the
north of neighboring France caused heavy traffic congestion on the
highways, especially in southern Belgium, where highways and
national roads were reportedly packed with cars. Police reports
estimated around 70,000 cars were on the road.
</P>
<P>
Those who had arrived at points of advantage in southern
Belgium before Wednesday had to demonstrate great patience before
they could finally catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse through
cloud openings.
</P>
<P>
When the clouds would part and they could see the eclipse
occurring, they would cheer loudly.
</P>
<P>
A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes directly between
the sun and the earth, blocking the light from the sun.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's solar eclipse is estimated to be visible in whole
or in part to around 2 billion people worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Asks U.N. to Reconsider Sending Back Bangladeshi Police Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has requested the
Untied Nations to review its decision of sending back the
country's police contingent from peace-keeping operations in
Kosovo, Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our permanent representative at the U.N. headquarters has been
instructed to make appeal to U.N. Secretary-General (Kofi Annan)
to review the matter," Azad told reporters at a news briefing
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh sent 49 policemen, including senior officers, to
Kosovo late last month to take part in the peace-keeping
operations there, but only 13 had passed various tests. About 50
policemen from Nepal were also being sent back on similar grounds,
reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the country was officially informed about the
decision of the Department of Peace-Keeping Operations to
repatriate 36 of the 49 police officers "on grounds of failing the
requisite in-mission test conducted in English, driving and
firearm shooting."
</P>
<P>
Describing the incident as "unfortunate for all sides --
Bangladesh and the U.N.," the foreign minister said Bangladesh,
which has been contributing to U.N. peace-keeping operations since
the late 1980s, has earned both appreciation and honor.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to send back the police officers was not expected
since all formalities and conditions laid down by the U.N. were
fully observed," he added.

BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Wang Zhongyu has
urged relevant departments to intensify efforts to crack down on
unhealthy practices in the purchasing and marketing of
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
He made the call here today at a televised national conference,
saying that straightening out the malpractices in this sector is
of great significance for the people's health and the building of
a clean government, as well as for the reform, development and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Wang called for stringent measures to ban the dozens of
illegally established drug distribution centers across the country.
He added that extra efforts are needed to strictly regulate the 17
authorized Chinese herbal medicine markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, steps should be taken to bring into line
pharmaceuticals manufacturers who have multiplied chaotically in
recent years, Wang said, citing the prevalence of shoddy and fake
drugs, criminal activities such as giving and taking kickbacks,
and random pricing.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and related institutions should tighten control over
drugs, and take resolute measures to establish separate accounts
and management systems for drug sales, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mine Attack Toll Rises to 11 in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 policemen have been
killed and more than 15 wounded in a powerful land mine blast
Wednesday in eastern Sri Lanka, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in the government-controlled town of
Batticaloa, 300 kilometers east of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have set
off a remote-controlled device as a police bus was leaving
Batticaloa, where the surrounding countryside is under rebel
control, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the mine blast killed nine policemen and
injured 14 others. No civilians were hurt as many local shops were
closed for a Hindu festival.
</P>
<P>
The blast followed an escalation of bomb attacks in recent
weeks by the Tamil Tigers, who have been fighting a 16-year-old
war against the government to demand a homeland for Tamil minority
in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Monday, a rebel suicide bomber killed a senior army officer
near Batticaloa, in the Varakai army camp where he was
distributing food to civilians.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, 13 special task force commandos were killed
in a suicide bomb attack in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
And at the end of July, a moderate Tamil lawmaker was killed in
a suicide bomb attack on his car in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities expressed fears Monday that there could be
more violent attacks, amid police reports that the LTTE rebels had
sent out 10 bombers on suicide missions to Colombo, focusing on
carefully selected targets.

<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- With 50 days left before New
China's 50th anniversary celebrations, Beijing is stepping up the
face-lifting of roadside structures.
</P>
<P>
All untidy or randomly placed advertisements and billboards
along the roads will be removed by September 15, a municipal
government official said at a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Fu Bainan, director of Beijing's administration committee, said
that the number of advertising companies has increased to more
than 3,000 since 1978, and the number of outdoor billboards
approved by the municipal government in the past decade has hit 5,
213.
</P>
<P>
But, outdoor advertisements have somewhat grown out of control
in recent years, with the number of illegally set up billboards
hitting 259 or even more, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This has not only hurt the capital's image as a political and
cultural center, but also affected its traditional grace as an
ancient city," Fu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Wang Guangtao said that the cleanup drive covers
outdoor advertising in any forms which are against the law and
regulations or lack government approval.
</P>
<P>
He said that focus will be put on the face-lifting of Chang'an
Avenue, two ring roads, roads leading to the capital airport, and
all super-highways in the city.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 11 (Xinhua) -- People in Kuwait witnessed a
solar eclipse Wednesday afternoon, the second astronomical
phenomenon of this kind spotted here since 1952.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse, the last of the 20th century, began over the Gulf
country at about 13:44 (1044 GMT) and climaxed over 90 percent at
about 15:05 (1205 GMT). It ended at around 16:16 (1316 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Before and during the eclipse, traffic on streets and highways
turned thin as people returned home earlier than normally
scheduled, as many of them were anxious to watch the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
While thousands of people flocked to Kuwait's Science Club,
where a huge observatory is located, to see the eclipse, many
others used special glasses for the rare natural event.
</P>
<P>
People who preferred to be indoors also could follow up on the
solar eclipse through the Kuwait TV Station, which broadcast live
the event.
</P>
<P>
A solar eclipse, a rare alignment between the sun, moon and
earth, occurs when the orbit of the moon slides its disk exactly
between the sun and the earth, casting a shadow across the face of
the Earth.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Slam Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 well-known Chinese
scientists attended a meeting today held by the China Association
for Science and Technology (CAST) to further expose and criticize
Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee and president of the CAST, said
scientists should think deeply about the Falun Gong phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong cult has poisoned the minds of many people and
undermined social stability by forming the illegal organization.
If the cult is allowed to develop, it will undermine the country's
drive to realize modernizations through science and technology,
said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the fight against Falun Gong and pseudoscience will
last for a long time, he said, adding that scientists should
shoulder the responsibility to spread scientific knowledge and the
scientific spirit, methods, and attitude.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Zhaoguang, a professor with the Beijing
Anzhen Hospital, more than 1.78 million senior citizens above the
age of 60 are now living in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Many of these elderly folks suffer from chronic diseases, and
Falun Gong cult deceived many of them with promises of improved
health, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
When asked why so many well-educated people believed in Falun
Gong, renowned physicist Zhao Zhongxian, who is also an
academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said everyone
has limits in knowing the truth, the universe, and the society,
and scientists are no exception.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao said Chinese scientists must study more
philosophy, which is the basis for scientific breakthroughs and
innovations.
</P>
<P>
Scientists attending today's meeting shared the opinion that it
is the responsibility of scientists to fight against superstition
and popularize science among ordinary people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches National Reading Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday launched
the National Reading Month to encourage reading among its citizens
and make reading a national passion.
</P>
<P>
"We want reading to be a national passion among all
Malaysians," Education Minister Najib Tun Razak was quoted by
Bernama news agency as saying in his launching speech.
</P>
<P>
The reading culture should be encouraged as there would have to
be 100-percent literacy rate when Malaysia achieves developed
status in 2020, he said.
</P>
<P>
Najib wanted families to set up their own mini-libraries at
home to encourage reading among family members, saying many
Malaysians were literate but were not interested in reading and
this was not in keeping with a progressive nation.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the move by the National Library of Malaysia to
promote reading and the setting up of home libraries.
</P>
<P>
Based on 1996 figures, 41 percent of Malaysian families had
mini libraries at home and the literacy rate for Malaysia was 93
percent while 87 percent did some form of reading, and this showed
that not all who were literate read, he said.

emergency along the Yangtze River that runs through the province.
</P>
<P>
The floodwater has receded and the water level of the Yangtze's

<HEADLINE> Pakistan: Downing of Plane Fresh Blow to Ties With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf Wednesday said the Indian attack on
Pakistan's naval aircraft was "an act of aggression" and has dealt
"a fresh blow" to the Indo-Pakistan relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a positive step forward and we wanted to
establish some kind of atmosphere of trust and resumption of
dialogue, but all this has suffered a fresh blow to our efforts,"
he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Charging that the Indians have a record of aggressions, he said
they are being true to their record with the latest incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Pakistani military spokesman said that the
shooting down of the Pakistani naval aircraft by Indian Air Force
was a premeditated hostile act on the part of India.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations
Brigadier Rashid Qureshi said that there was a high-level contact
between the Directors General of Military Operations of India and
Pakistan and that if the Indians thought there was an aircraft
flying close to or within their airspace, they could have
contacted on the hot-line.
</P>
<P>
However, "no such action was done by the Indians, so it seems
to be a premeditated hostile act," Qureshi observed.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said it was an unarmed naval aircraft which was on
routine training mission inside Pakistani airspace and the
wreckage of the aircraft was within Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
"It was unarmed, there was no hostile action committed by the
aircraft, in fact it was incapable of committing hostile act," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Currency Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The weakening of the Indonesian
rupiah, which dipped to 8,000 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday
morning, is totally unrealistic and will not last long, Bank
Indonesia (BI) Governor Sjahril Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was closed at 7,700/7,800 per U.S. dollar in
Wednesday's trading.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think this would last long. I hope it will improve in
the next one or two days," Sabirin told reporters at the Merdeka
Palace here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin was at the palace for a meeting with President B.J.
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He said that the weakening of the rupiah against the dollar was
the result of the worsening political situation in the country,
following the violence in Aceh and Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been mounting in the two provinces as clashes have
begun to spread.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the central bank would intervene in the market to
strengthen the rupiah, Sabirin said this is not yet necessary.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the rupiah fell 290 points as it closed at 7,330/7,350
in the interbank spot market here, following the alleged criminal
action in an interbank transaction between publicly listed Bank
Bali and the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
The two institutions, Bank Bali and IBRA, had allegedly
committed a criminal act which also involves a member of the
ruling Golkar Party's central executive board.
</P>
<P>
Bank Bali allegedly paid Golkar's Deputy Treasurer Setyo
Novanto and other businessmen related to Golkar some 550 billion
rupiah in commission for recovering 904.6 billion rupiah (133
million U.S. dollars) in interbank credits.
</P>
<P>
Habibie Wednesday pledged that the government will probe into
the scandal that rocked Bank Bali.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is being processed by (central bank) Bank Indonesia
Governor (Sjahril Sabirin) and Finance Minister (Bambang
Subianto). Let us wait," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
On the weakening of the rupiah against the dollar, a private
bank dealer said the doubtful situation of Indonesian bank
restructuring efforts had prompted investors to buy U.S. dollars
in large amounts.
</P>
<P>
Investors have begun to feel uneasy and express doubts about
the government's seriousness in handling Indonesia's banking
problems, he said.

</P>
<P>
Lockett, Sydney football team's 33-year-old full forward, will
finish his 17-year career at the end of this season.

Lockett told reporters that he felt the "time was right" to
retire now.

<P>
"It's been a long time - 17 years now - and I'm not getting any
younger. That's about it really," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's no real outstanding reason - the time's right, more
than anything," he added
</P>
<P>
Lockett would not speculate on his future outside football,
saying he would like to stay involved in the game and would like
to stay in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"It's been five years now (in Sydney) and I've enjoyed every
minute of it and made a lot of good mates so I'll be staying here.
"
</P>
<P>
After a brilliant and often tempestuous 11 seasons with St

concedes prolonged his career.

<HEADLINE> Laparoscopic Surgery in Infancy Successful in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of doctors from the
Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have successfully used the
laparoscopic technique to perform a 95-percent subtotal
pancreatectomy in a two-month old infant.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the world for such complicated and
technically demanding operation to be used in infancy, and it
establishes Hong Kong as a leading center in pediatric endoscopic
surgery, according to Chung Kwong Yeung, head of the Division of
Pediatric Surgery under the CUHK.
</P>
<P>
The infant has suffered with nesidioblastosis (excessive growth
of pancreatic islet cells) causing persistent low blood sugar, a
rare condition affecting neonates, and the normal neurological
development of the baby indicates that her brain has not suffered
from damage after the operation, Yeung told a press conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A baby with nesidioblastosis usually presents in the first few
days of life with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia including
lethargy, poor feeding, hypotonia and repeated seizures, and if
the condition is not properly treated, the patient will suffer
from serious brain damage and mental retardation, the doctor
explained.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Department of Surgery at the CUHK also said
that they have pioneered many laparoscopic surgeries in Hong Kong
since the late 1980s, including the introduction of the first
laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Division of Pediatric Surgery applied minimally invasive
surgical techniques in many operations in infants and young
children since the early 1990s, and set up one of the world's
first pediatric endoscopic surgery centers, according to Yeung.
</P>
<P>
Yeung said that the minimally invasive techniques have been
shown to have distinct advantages over traditional open methods in
causing minimal surgical trauma, less post-operative pain and
wound complications, faster recovery as well as shorter hospital
stay.

<P>
NANNING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a hydro-power
project has begun in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a
relatively underdeveloped region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Jointly invested by the local government of Jinxiu Yao
Autonomous County and a Hong Kong company, the power station is
being built on the upper Dishui River.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that the river has the potential to have a
generating capacity of 78,500 kw of hydro-power.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage of construction, a river dam is being
built at a cost of 245 million yuan and will be completed in two
and half years, at which time a plant will be installed with three
generators, each with a 9,000 kw capacity. The plant is expected
to produce 87 million kwh annually.
</P>
<P>
The river dam will not only alleviate the bottleneck in the
region's power supply, but will also play an important role in
controlling flood and drought.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The volume of foreign currency reserves in the
Moroccan Central Bank stood at 56.5 billion dirhams (about 5.8
billion U.S. dollars) in early August, up by 34.6 percent over the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The volume, which for the first time exceeded the
50-billion-dirham (5.15 billion dollars) reserve ceiling, is
enough to cover imports of commodities and services for seven
months, said a statement by the Moroccan Ministry of Finance,
Commerce, Industry and Handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to license revenues from the
country's second mobile telephone network. The revenues were
estimated at 900 million dollars in hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Tourism revenues in the first seven months of this year stood
at 700 million dollars and private foreign investments amounted to
some 400 million dollars during the first six months of the year,
the Arab daily Al Hayat quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reserves would enable the central bank to rectify the gap
in the foreign trade balance, particularly the rise in wheat and
crop purchases by some 400 million dollars due to drought.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are expected
to make greater profits in the coming year by steadily
implementing the OPEC decision to cut oil production.
</P>
<P>
Their petroleum revenues are due to exceed 80 billion dollars,
though fears of a collapse of the agreement are still hovering, the
Arab daily Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that the average price of the Brent crude oil
will exceed 18 dollars per barrel in the year 2000 if the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) continue to
uphold the balance in petroleum markets.
</P>
<P>
GCC states may tend to increase their oil production next year
once OPEC decides to lift the production ceiling in 2000 to meet
the growing international demand, said a Western petroleum expert.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the OPEC agreement on production cut might begin
collapsing as the international petroleum storages would start
drying up, thus, inciting some OPEC members to increase production
in order to make additional profits.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq's imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
account for 30 percent of the country's total commodity imports,
the Arab economic daily Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The volume of UAE exports to Iraq, which is subjected to
international sanctions since 1990, stood at 2.5 million dollars
in 1995 and had since increased to 55 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sixty UAE companies will attend the November international fair
in Baghdad. In the previous fair, only 28 UAE companies and four
Saudi firms had participated.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq has completed the rehabilitation of the
Iraq-Syria pipeline which runs through Iraqi territory and the
Syrian side is busy with rehabilitating its sector.
</P>
<P>
The Arab economic daily Alam Al Yom Wednesday quoted an Iraqi
petroleum source as saying that Iraq will use this pipeline to
pump an average of 300,000 barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria had agreed in June last year to re-operate the
pipeline which enjoys a capacity of 1.4 million barrels per day
and links the Kirkuk oil fields in northern Iraq with the Syrian
Mediterranean port of Banias.
</P>
<P>
Syria had closed the pipeline over differences with Baghdad on
the issue of Syria's support of Tehran during the Iraq-Iran war
(1980-1988).

<HEADLINE> China Clears Last Landmines on Sino-Vietnamese Border (With Details) (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINGXI, GUANGXI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China announced today
that it has cleared the last landmines from its border with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
This marks the successful completion of China's bid over the
past seven years to clear all the landmines on the Sino-Vietnamese
border.
</P>
<P>
After a spate of violent explosions in Jingxi County in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 20 soldiers covered in
protective gears held precision mine detectors in their hands and
began searching again. They planted little red and green flags
over a 20-sq-m area when they were certain that the area was free
of landmines.
</P>
<P>
The scene was watched closely by a crowd of military
representatives, local government officials, local residents, and
journalists, standing dozens of meters away.
</P>
<P>
The 20 soldiers then fell into formation and walked out of the
area under the gaze of onlookers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, during the war between Vietnam and China,
both countries planted several million landmines along the 2,000
km border.
</P>
<P>
China's landmine-clearing campaign was the largest in the world,
taking seven years to complete. It was carried out in two stages.
The first stage was conducted in 1993 and 1994, during which the
main thoroughfare on the border was cleared of landmines, and 19
border outlets and 30 border trading posts were opened.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts, Yunnan Province and Guangxi, bordering
Vietnam, saw their border trade volume increase by four billion
yuan. The second stage started in November 1997, and was intended
to remove all the landmines left in the border areas.

<HEADLINE> China Clears Last Landmines on Sino-Vietnamese Border (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China spent about 200 million yuan and dispatched 2,000
soldiers to clear the mines, and there were several casualties in
the course of the work.
</P>
<P>
This undertaking has demonstrated the Chinese government's
sincere wish and firm determination to maintain good relations and
expand friendship with its neighbors, safeguard peace and advance
its open-up drive.
</P>
<P>
China cleared 2.2 million landmines over an area of more than
400-sq-km along the border in the past seven years, and destroyed
more than 400 tons of other explosives.
</P>
<P>
After making an inspection of the landmine clearing, a high-
ranking United Nations disarmament official said that Chinese
soldiers did a first-rate job, and could accomplish other
international humanitarian tasks.
</P>
<P>
Major General Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi
Military Area Command, and Lu Bing, an official of the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Regional government, signed a document regarding
the transfer of land cleared of landmines at a ceremony held to
celebrate the end of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, 17,000 hectares of farmland,
pastures and forests cleared of landmines during the second stage
of landmine clearings in Guangxi are to be handed over to local
governments.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhengfu, a 42-year-old local farmer, was all smiles. He
told reporters that for 20 years, he was afraid of risking his
life and dared not go to the border areas to farm and mine.
</P>
<P>
"I now feel safe to farm and mine for ore here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of border counties also feel relieved. Before the
landmines were cleared, they had to follow the tracks of cattle to
cross the border whenever they wanted to hold trade talks or meet
with officials of Vietnam. Local economic development in the
border areas was thus seriously hindered by the presence of the
mines.
</P>
<P>
Chinese border areas also have benefited greatly from the
landmine clearings. For instance, revenues of the seven border
counties of Guangxi went up from 200 million yuan before 1993 to
the present 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has reacted positively to China's
landmine-clearing campaign, and has also carried out some landmine
clearing activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAOTOU, August 11 (Xinhua)-- A senior Chinese official today
called for an all-out war against narcotics, saying that a
nationwide anti-drug campaign can not succeed without the support
of the great masses.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and secretary of the
Committee of Political Science and Law under the CPC Central
Committee, made the remark at the National Anti-drug Conference,
which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that the final success of the anti-opium movement,
launched shortly after the founding of the People's Republic in
1949, was the result of the participation and support of the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Departments concerned should not only inherit and carry
forward past experiences, such as the mobilization of the great
masses in the war against narcotics, but should also swiftly adapt
to the new circumstances," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the narcotics problem plagues more than 70
percent of China's counties and cities, and the annual consumption
of narcotics in China is now valued at more than 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Luo urged local governments to provide more funds and equipment
for drug control to pave the way for further battles against
narcotics.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Restates Ulterior Motives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- For the second time in two days,
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo reiterated that there is a
vicious motive behind the recent communal fighting across cities.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday in Kano, Nigeria's northern state, that he
could not fathom the explanation of the fighting as ethnic clash.
</P>
<P>
"People say it was an ethnic clash. Ethnic clash between who
and who? We have Sudanese Kano, Niger Republic Kano, Malian Kano,
Chadian Kano, etc. And what is happening? I know this is not the
handiwork of genuine Kano," he was quoted as saying by Wednesday's
Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The president's pronouncement in Kano came barely 24 hours
after a similar assessment visit to Sagamu, Ogun State, where he
fingered certain opponents of the civilian administration as
having instigated the crises, to unleash mayhem on the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
Certain elements opposed to the civilian dispensation and
seeking to subvert it have instigated the recent ethnic fighting
in Sagamu and Kano, he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Later on Monday, he restated the federal government's resolve
to spare no effort in enforcing peace at the communal clash
points.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said Tuesday in Kano that Nigeria, as a secular
society, could not progress if it continues to witness bloody
communal clashes.
</P>
<P>
He deplored the recent conflict, saying it did not show the
bond of love, brotherhood, unity to foster peaceful co-existence
among diverse ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He urged Nigerians to be their brothers' keepers. "We cannot
march forward in this country if we continue with this kind of
crisis."
</P>
<P>
In Anambra State late, Obasanjo regretted Monday that elders in
the communities no longer seemed to wield their traditional
mediatory influence in crises.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the theater of bitter warfare between
Aguleri, Umuleri and Umuoba Anam communities, the president was
disturbed by the scenes of devastation at the area, where indigene
engaged in blood-letting and wanton destruction since 1995 when an
86-year-old animosity flared again.

</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the plane, scattered over an area of 1.5 miles,
is still there, said the spokesman, adding that the PN personnel
were manning the area.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for the remains of our personnel martyred in
the cowardly attack by India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the body parts had been founded by Tuesday evening
while further search is still going on, the spokesman said.

SINGAPORE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices remained
nose-dived on Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as worries over a
potential hike in U.S. interest rates and currency woes continued

The meeting will be held in the southern Thai province of
Ranong on August 17 and 18, said the minister after meeting with
Myanmar ambassador to Thailand Wednesday morning at the Government
House.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third joint meeting between the two countries to
discuss problems of cross-border drug trafficking over the past
one year, said Jurin, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics
Control Board (ONCB).
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also aim to beef up the joint narcotics
cooperation, which was agreed by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
and Myanmar's top leader General Tan Shwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ONCB secretary-general Payont Pansri said that a
separate meeting between Thai narcotics officers and their Lao
counterparts would be held on August 22 in Laos' central province
of Suvannakhet to seek ways to curb the flow of drugs from Laos.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking had been more rampant along Thailand's
northeastern border adjacent to Laos, following a fierce crackdown
by Thai security officers, he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Environment Ministers to Meet to Discuss Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for
Environment Lee Yock Suan has disclosed that ASEAN environment
ministers are looking at bringing forward their next meeting to
discuss the haze action plan of the region.
</P>
<P>
After attending a ceremony Tuesday to observe the 34th national
day of Singapore, Lee said that the meeting is to be hosted by
Singapore and scheduled for the end of this month with the exact
date yet to be fixed, media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee attached importance to taking early action against forest
fires in the region, saying if the fires burn out of control, it
will be a very difficult situation, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lee was quoted as saying that "Singapore continues to monitor
the haze very closely with the satellite monitoring system and is
providing information constantly to all the ASEAN neighbors,
especially to Indonesia and Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian authorities have also given their pledge to
disallow open burning to clear land. Unfortunately at the ground
level, the implementation has not been up to expectation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Lee noted that the areas in central
Sumatra and Kalimandan, Indonesia, where first fires have been
burning, were going through a dry period and he expressed his hope
that with greater attention focused by the authorities on this
issue there would be some improvement.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Malaysia to Enhance Tourism Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has proposed that
Thailand enhance tourism cooperation in an effort to reduce the
imbalance in tourist arrivals between the two countries, Thailand
News Agency (TNA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Minister of Culture, Arts and Tourism Dato Abdul
Kadir raised the idea to Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
senior officials early this week, hoping to boost two-way tourist
traffic and organize joint promotion programs abroad, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was accepted in principle by the TAT and the two
sides agreed to solve the problems of accessibility.
</P>
<P>
Both sides demanded more airline services to link Thai
destinations such as Phuket and Hat Yai with Malaysian resorts
Langkawi and Penang.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million Malaysian tourists visit Thailand each year
while some 300,000 Thai tourists travel to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia will now jointly promote overseas
markets. Thailand is expecting more than 8 million tourist
arrivals this year.

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion Against Japanese Cabinet Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives (
lower house) on Wednesday voted down a no-confidence motion
against Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The motion was rejected with 134 votes in favor and 354 against.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), its coalition partner
Liberal Party (LP) and opposition New Komeito party opposed the
motion, while three opposition parties supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)
submitted the motion late Tuesday night in a bid to block a set of
controversial wiretapping bills from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic
Party (SDP), which oppose the legislation, joined the DPJ in
backing the motion.
</P>
<P>
The wiretapping bills, which will allow law enforcement
authorities to wiretap communications during investigations into
organized crime, were railroaded through the upper house's
judicial panel Monday by the LDP, LP and New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ, JCP and SDP protested against the forced passage of
the three-bill package, saying the committee vote was invalid.
</P>
<P>
The government says the wiretapping legislation would be a
major weapon against organized crime, such as crimes linked to the
AUM Shinrikyo cult, and gun and drug violations committed by crime
syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Critics argue the legislation could infringe on constitutional
provisions regarding the secrecy of communications and protection
of privacy.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's lower house session, DPJ Secretary General
Tsutomu Hata criticized the Obuchi cabinet and urged a dissolution
of the house.
</P>
<P>
The year-old Obuchi cabinet is "a dangerous administration"
that tries to enact controversial bills by ignoring Diet (
parliament) discussions, Hata told the lower house prior to the
voting.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, LP and New Komeito have an overwhelming majority in
the 500-member lower chamber with a combined force of 357. The
three parties also have a combined majority in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
If the no-confidence motion is passed, it would force the
cabinet to either dissolve the lower chamber or step down en masse
within 10 days.

MADRID, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Rivaldo was looking forward to a

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Impose Heavier Penalties on Torture Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has finished the first
leg of a legislative process which, when completed, will
introduce tougher penalties on torture offenders.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament's Justice Commission approved on Tuesday a bill
providing a wider definition of torture and increasing the maximum
prison terms for those convicted of committing torture offenses
from the current five years to eight years, the local Daily News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by some commission members to limit the definition of
"torture" and soften sentences on such cases were dashed by the
majority of the commission members after Justice Minister Hikmet
Sami Turk said the penalties foreseen by the law should serve as a
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to fight torture with a law that provides a
maximum six-month prison term for civil servants sentenced for
committing torture, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also opposed suggestions by a sub-committee that torture
should not be listed as a crime that deserves a heavy penalty,
thus enabling offenders to return to work after serving a
six-month prison term.
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence of six years and minimum sentence of six
months suggested by the sub-committee could not be considered as
punishment but an encouragement for torture, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added the minimum sentences for such offenses should not be
less than one year behind bars and expulsion from the profession.
</P>
<P>
The draft, approved by the Justice Commission of the
Parliament, needs to be passed by the entire parliament before it
can enter into force.

<HEADLINE> Furniture Exhibition Proceeds in Nigeria Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Furniture makers Tuesday turned
the ground floor of the Nigerian National Assembly in Abuja into
an exhibition gallery following last week's approval of furniture
allowance for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
By 8:45 a.m. Monday, one of the many furniture firms had taken
a large chunk of space to showcase the qualitative nature of
furniture, which members of the Senate and House of
Representatives are expected to procure, the Guardian newspaper
reported Wednesday
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the furniture exhibition has the
approval of Alhaji Salim, the clerk of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Monday's proceedings, some members visited the
exhibition stands before going in for committee deliberations,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition coincided with a hot protest by the Umbrella
Labor Union for Nigerian workers Tuesday in front of the assembly
building, with protesters calling the furniture allowance a
"outrageous" move.
</P>
<P>
The government, after hot debate, agreed last week to pay each
member of the 109-member Senate 3.5 million naira (about 37,000 US
dollars) and their counterparts in the 360-member House 2.5
million naira (26,000 US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The protesters Tuesday branded the awards "repulsive,
provocative and princely lifestyles in the midst of pervasive and
abject poverty." The Union president said it could not be
justified with the country's economic realities.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is today a poverty afflicted nation, per capita income
is about 260 U.S. dollars per annum and the minimum wage is 3,000
naira (31 US dollars) ," he said.
</P>
<P>
The furniture allowance issue has become quite a focus in the
country recently with some newspapers dubbing it the "furniture
gate".

<HEADLINE> Multinationals to Attend China Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 multinational
corporations will participate in the upcoming '99 China Fair for
International Investment and Trade, slated for September 8-12 in
the eastern port city of Xiamen, Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Department of Foreign Investment
Administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) told Xinhua on Wednesday that multinationals
attending the fair include such big names as Motorola, Ericsson,
Nokia, Siemens, Canon, Mobil, and Sony.
</P>
<P>
Corporations planning to set up exhibitions at the fair are
involved in motor vehicles and parts, mobile telecommunications,
construction materials, power equipment, and family appliances.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, said that all of China'
s 31 provincial localities will send delegations to the fair, and
there also will be delegations from some ministries and national
economic organizations.
</P>
<P>
Cao Degan, deputy governor of Fujian and vice-chairman of the
fair's organizing committee, said at a recent meeting that more
attention will be paid to promoting the fair worldwide via many
means, including the Internet.
</P>
<P>
This annual fair is China's only trade and investment event on
a nationwide scale. More than 6,000 businesspeople from home and
abroad participated in the fair last year.
</P>
<P>
China registered a decline in overseas investment in terms of
both contractual volume and paid-in volume in the first half this
year, according to figures released by MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
China approved a total of 8,052 new overseas-invested projects
between January and June, which represented a drop of 16.71
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The newly approved projects involve 19.39 billion U.S. dollars
of contractual overseas investment, a decline of 19.87 percent on
a year-on-year basis. The volume of overseas investment already in
place was 18.57 billion U.S. dollars for the half, down by 9.21
percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Suggested to Develop Government Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Economic
Association President R. Thillainathan Wednesday suggested that
the government bond market be developed further so that it can
serve as a benchmark yield curve.
</P>
<P>
Thillainathan made the suggestion as he said that the active
and liquid cross currency swap market that provided a proxy yield
curve and was used by investors to decide on bond issues and
trading in bonds has been absent following the currency controls,
making it difficult for traders to buy and sell.
</P>
<P>
The government should issue Malaysian Government Securities
(MGS) papers from time to time even if it does not intend to
borrow, Thillainathan said at the two-day Malaysian Capital Market
seminar which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thillainathan suggested better cooperation between the various
authorities that regulated the local bond market.
</P>
<P>
The existing regulatory institutions should collaborate so that
there will not be a conflict of interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is more than one regulator for the market at present in
Malaysia. The most important one is the central bank while others
include the Securities Commission and the Registrar of Companies.

delegates will have Internet access to UPU networks in Switzerland
for all the information provided by UPU without leaving their
hotels.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the electronic voting system, the brainchild
of Chinese researchers, will use hundreds of monitors to display
results and information, in place of the old practice of
displaying them on screens.
</P>
<P>
During the Congress, some 500 bills will be discussed and voted
on, and the new voting system will greatly facilitate the entire
process, officials with the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that China will use such technology as
host of an international conference, said Cheng Yongping, in
charge of equipment management in the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for the new systems is about 10 million yuan (
1.2 million U.S. dollars), and several companies including Compaq
and Hewlett-Packard have donated their products in support of the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The 22nd UPU Congress, the first UPU meeting ever held in China,
is slated for August 23 to September 15 in Beijing. More than 2,
000 delegates from the 189 member nations of UPU and over 20
international organizations will attend the conference.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Elected President's Power Is Limited, Non-Executive: Lee Kuan Yew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew has said that his country's elected president only has
limited, non-executive power and there can only one center of
government in the country, "The Straits Times" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the paper, the senior minister
detailed on limits of the elected president's power to debunk
popular misconceptions on the role of an elected president and to
stress the importance of rotating the presidency among the races.
</P>
<P>
Lee, the main architect of the elected presidency, said the
elected president was never intended to be an executive office to
contest the government's power.
</P>
<P>
Until there is a rogue government that will drain past reserves
or undermine the higher echelons of the public service, the
president's role remains largely ceremonial, he said, adding there
is a lot of misconception of what is required of an elected
president in the country.
</P>
<P>
His comments came in response to the current debate about the
role of the elected president and qualities needed to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Lee was quoted as stressing in the interview that "you do not
have two sources of executive power. The executive power is in the
prime minister and his cabinet and they are answerable to
parliament."
</P>
<P>
"The president is elected by the people to do a specific job to
block bad actions by a bad government but not to interfere in the
running of the government."
</P>
<P>
"He has no executive powers to initiate anything nor to stop
the government from doing something other than spending reserves
and making bad appointments."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that the elected president system was
crafted carefully and passed into law in 1992 after he first
broached the office publicly in 1984, Lee emphasized that the
president was not intended as a counter-focus of power, saying "He
can not be, because then the government will be immobilized. We do
not have a presidential system like the United states."
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the current public discussion that the president
must be independent so that the president can be an effective
check on the government, Lee said there is ignorance about the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
While elaborating the Constitution, the senior minister said
that the president can not make speeches against the government,
can not act independently of the government other than to block it
and can not act against wishes of the government except when the
government wants to do things the president is entitled to veto.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question why he refuses to take the job as a
president, Lee was quoted as saying that "You need a very wise,
bright, patient sort of person. I would be the first to say that I
am not qualified for the job because I'm an activist. So when
people thought that I was crafting this job for myself, they were
completely wrong."

<HEADLINE> Mauritian, Indian Companies to Invest in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Five Mauritian and Indian
companies have pledged to invest in Botswana, creating thousands
of jobs before the end of the year, South Africa's Business Day
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The investment fitted in with the government's plan to
diversify the diamond-dependent economy, the paper quoted
Botswana Export Development and Investment Authority's promotions
manager, Rose Tatedi, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This will help us to reduce the high rate of unemployment and
assist with the transfer of much-needed skills into the country,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The country of 1.5 million people has an unemployment rate of
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The five companies which have pledged investment in the country
are in textiles and garments, and nail and metal components.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the companies will be looking at the regional market
to export their products. However, most of the textile and
garments industries will be mainly exporting to the United States
and Britain, said Tatedi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Botswana abolished all foreign exchange
controls as an additional incentive for foreign direct investment.
The country also boasts political stability and free market
policies conducive to private sector development.

<HEADLINE> Sparrows Gaining Protection in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Sparrows, one of China's
traditional four evils along with the mosquito, the fly, and the
mouse, is now gaining some protection in East China's Shandong
Province after decades of over-killing.
</P>
<P>
Sparrows have been traditionally seen as harmful because they
flutter on the crop fields and steal grain away from people.
However, experts have discovered that sparrows eat more worms than
grain, and are generally good for the mankind.
</P>
<P>
In addition, hundreds of thousands of sparrows were lost in
Shandong to the novelty-seeking appetites of people in southern
China.
</P>
<P>
Han Yunchi, an official of an animal protection organization,
said that sparrows also help spread pollen, which contributes
tremendously to agricultural production, and that their role in
the ecological balance cannot be replaced.
</P>
<P>
However, he recalled that rampant killings have severely
affected the ecological balance, resulting in an overwhelming
growth of worms and insects in the cropfields, and that the
Shandong Provincial Government is planning a survey to determine
the size of sparrow population in order to map out protective
measures.
</P>
<P>
As of now, the hunting, trading, or killing of sparrows will
receive "due punishment," said Han.

<P>
Hwang is staring at the flag, deep in thought, and although he
is just a freshman, he dreams of working for China after
graduating from the university.
</P>
<P>
Robert Woo left China 13 years ago, and now has returned with
his 9-year-old daughter. When he sees the raising of the national
flag once again, his face beams with excitement
</P>
<P>
When the flag reaches the top of the pole, Kathy Chiang says
with tears in her eyes that she is deeply touched each time she
hears the national anthem, because her mother loves it.
</P>
<P>
She said that great changes have taken place in China, and it
is necessary to have the youth learn about the real China.
</P>
<P>
Helena Yan, the leader of the group, noted that the national
flag is the symbol of the country, and that these American kids
must first come to know something about China before they can find
their roots. Attending the flag-hoisting ceremony in Tian'anmen
Square has special significance, and is a good place to begin, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Fifty days from now, on the same square, the largest in the
world, a splendid celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China will be underway.

<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Lawscanse Hwang, a 20-year-old
Chinese-American, is standing on the Jinshui Bridge in front of
the Tian'anmen Rostrum, and looks very excited.
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later he will, for the first time, attend the
flag-hoisting ceremony on the newly renovated Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
"I am very exited to find my roots under the national flag,"
said Hwang, one of the members of the '99 Chinese-American Youth "
Roots-Seeking Tour."
</P>
<P>
None of the kids on this tour group have ever attended the
national flag-hoisting ceremony before, and some of them have
never before seen the Five-Star Red Flag of China.
</P>
<P>
Facing the rising sun, 36 guards protecting the national flag
come out from the Tian'anmen Rostrum, pass over the Jinshui Bridge
and Chang'an Avenue, and walk toward Tian'anmen Square accompanied
by the strains of "Sing for the Motherland."
</P>
<P>
At 5:20, as the national flag is hoisted and the national
anthem plays, the rising sun casts its light on the flag, and on
the faces of the American kids.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. custom, people put their right hand over
their heart when the national flag is hoisted, but these American
youngsters of Chinese descent are now saluting the flag the
Chinese way, by looking directly at the Five-Star Banner.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Distribute Rice Seedlings to Calamity-hit Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
distribute rice seedlings to areas heavily hit by floods to help
farmers recoup their losses, Philippine News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Secretary Edgardo Angara of the Department of
Agriculture as saying Tuesday night that the seedlings would be
distributed in Ilocos, Central Luzon, the Southern Tagalog region,
and the Cordillera Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
He said the four regions suffered heavy damage to agriculture
as a result of the flash floods caused by continues monsoon rains
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Angara assured the public that there is more than enough supply
of seedlings for farmers to replant rice in 130,000 hectares in
Central Luzon alone.
</P>
<P>
According the National Disaster Coordination Council, the total
damage in the central Philippine areas was placed at 786 million
pesos (17.2 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Wednesday launched a pre-dawn offensive across frontlines north of
Kabul and captured two districts, a media report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
The militia managed to take Sarai Khawaja and Kalakan districts
from forces loyal to opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood and
pushed forward to 30 kilometers north of Kabul, said the
Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press (AIP).
</P>
<P>
At least 13 troops from both sides were killed and 24 others
were injured in heavy fighting, said AIP.
</P>
<P>
No confirmation from the Taliban authorities or the opposition
side is available so far.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban hold nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan and have been
fighting to remove former defense minister Masood, the last
obstacle to their complete control of the country.

<HEADLINE> Britain Indicate Need of More Aid to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- British officials have indicated
the need to provide more aid to development projects in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The officials of Britain's International Development Office
made the call after meetings on Tuesday with Egyptian officials in
charge of environment protection, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the British delegation, which arrived in Cairo
on Monday, said the kingdom's aid to Egypt stands at an annual 7
million pounds sterling (11.83 million U.S. dollars), the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Of the aid, five million pounds (8.45 million dollars) are
allocated for projects aimed at environmental protection in Egypt,
the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in protecting environment in Egypt topped the
agenda of a recent visit to Britain by Egyptian Minister of State
for Environmental Affairs Nadia Makram Ebeid, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 2 million pounds (3.38 million dollars) are for
literacy and adult education programs and cooperation with Egypt's
Social Fund for Development in improving women's standard of
living in southern governorates' rural areas by setting up small
businesses for them, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The program of aid to Egypt in the coming period will concentrate
on offering technical assistance to upgrade sewerage facilities
in Cairo, they added.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation of the International Development Office,
which is in charge of Britain's economic aid to developing
countries, will inspect a number of development projects the
country has helped create in southern Egypt, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Germany Agree on All-cargo Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The governments of the
Philippines and Germany have agreed to have an all-cargo flights
between the two countries in view of the rising demand for the
service, Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The existing Philippine-German air agreement does not allow
all-cargo flights between the two countries, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) held talks
with representatives of the civil aviation body and airline
companies of Germany to amend the air services agreement signed in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, the German Airlines will have three
all-cargo flights per week starting in April 2000, while the
Philippines will also have the same frequencies, the PNA quoted
CAB Executive Director Guia Martinez as saying.
</P>
<P>
The German civil aviation would either assign Lufthansa or
Luftransport-Unternchmen to utilize these frequencies.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Lufthansa operates seven round-trip passenger/cargo
flights per week from Germany to the Philippines and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines (PAL) usually flies to Germany but stopped
operations shortly after the onset of its financial woes in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Shuts Down Pepsi Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Ministry of Health
on Tuesday decided to close one production line at a local
bottling plant of Pepsi Cola for one week after laboratory tests
proved that soft drinks produced by the plant were contaminated.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Issaq Maraqah said his ministry has discussed
the decision with the cabinet to suspend the plant's production of
Miranda, Pepsi and 7UP for one week before taking the plant to
court, Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, other production lines for canisters and plastic
bottles were not closed since the decision only covered glass
bottles, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Impurities were detected during laboratory tests on the glass
bottles and the factory seemed to lack hygienic standards for the
reusable bottles as well as the cleaning capacity for the bottles.
</P>
<P>
Cement pieces and grease were found in some bottles while
others contained plastic and wooden substances, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the suspension of the production line could be
indefinite other than one week.
</P>
<P>
"The production line will be closed until the plant proves
it ensures clean products that the ministry required," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi products are the biggest source of soft drinks in
stores and supermarkets of the desert kingdom, but many of
the products are locally packed and bottled under licenses from
the U.S. Pepsi company.

<P>
FUZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The "two states" statement by
Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui has seriously undermined relations
across the Taiwan Straits and hurt the interests of the people in
Taiwan, according to Taiwan specialists in the mainland province
of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Wu Nengyuan, president of the Fujian Provincial Social Science
Academy's Modern Taiwan Institute, says that Lee's statement
places new obstacles in the way of economic and trade relations
across the Straits and could mean risks or economic losses for
Taiwanese investing in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between Taiwan and Fujian have been on the rise since
the 1980s and there are more than 5,000 Taiwan-financed businesses
in Fujian with huge investment stake. Many of them ship in raw
materials from Taiwan, process them, and then ship them back to
Taiwan as finished products, helping the economy of both Fujian
and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM Meets U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General's special
envoy to East Timor issue Jamsheed Marker said that the situation
in the territory after the August 30 autonomy ballot is very very
important.
</P>
<P>
The situation will be discussed in a tripartite senior official
meeting between representatives of Indonesia, Portugal and U.N.
secretary general here on August 12-13.
</P>
<P>
"We had a preliminary discussion on the issue. I took his
advice and guidance at the meeting which we are going to have at
the senior official level, starting tomorrow," Marker told
reporters after an hour meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Alatas raised some important issues which will be
discussed in the meeting, but he was not in a position to announce
the issues now.
</P>
<P>
"I am not in the position to tell you right now but I am
satisfied and encouraged about my meeting with Mr. Alatas, and I
look forward to the very productive discussion at the senior
official meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the last day of the two-day meeting, he said, all delegates
will issue a joint communique informing about what has been talked
about and what decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
Asked his comment on an international opinion that the
situation in East Timor will be delicate, Marker said what is
clear to the U.N. is that the situation will be very very
important and appropriate measures need to be taken.
</P>
<P>
The ballot will allow the territory's people to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent. If a majority of them reject the offer,
the territory will peacefully separate from the Unitary State of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Until the end of the registration process on August 8, 446,666
East Timorese had registered inside and outside the territory.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

<HEADLINE> Congo Peace Process Hopeful: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), though still quite
fragile, is hopeful, The New Vision newspaper, Uganda's leading
daily newspaper sponsored by the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the newspaper said that although the DRC
continues to be confounding, it is not as intractable as many have
feared.
</P>
<P>
Even the weekend clashes between the Rally for Congolese
Democracy (RCD) led by Emile IIunga and the Ugandan troops, the
last twist of event in the peace process, could not spoil the
whole process.
</P>
<P>
"When the situation is viewed in its entirety, there is reason
to be hopeful. A few short months ago, it was inconceivable that
Laurent Kabila (DRC President) could sit down for discussions with
his erstwhile foes," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
A lot of the saber-rattling from the various sides promised
little progress, but a ray of light appeared at the end of the
tunnel in Libya when Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his DRC
counterpart Laurent Kabila signed what was called a declaration of
intent.
</P>
<P>
This coalesced into greater promise with last month's Lusaka
accord signed by a host of regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, leaders from Uganda, Rwanda met in South
Africa to try to remove the last tumbling block to the
implementation of the accord. The Pretoria talks mandated a team
to travel to the DRC to continue exploring ways to achieve a
cessation of hostilities, the editorial added.

<P>
The two sides of the Taiwan Straits are closely related
economically, Wu says, but Lee's remark only serves his ugly
political ambitions and neglects the interests of Taiwan investors
and it will be condemned by compatriots on both sides of the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhu Tianshun of Xiamen University's Taiwan Institute,
says that Lee's remark is similar to his Taiwan independence
proposal and was calculated to separate Taiwan from China and is
very dangerous. If Lee doesn't retract his "special state-to-state
" relations remark, then talks between Wang Daohan, the president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, and
Koo Chen-fu, the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, as
well as economic and trade ties across the Straits, could be
damaged.
</P>
<P>
The fact that stocks on the Taiwan exchange have been falling
over the past several days demonstrates that Lee's remark has
affected the people of Taiwan.
</P>

Li Baocui, deputy head of Xiamen's Association of Taiwan
Compatriots, says that Lee Teng-hui has increased tensions across
the Straits with his "two states" remark and pushed to separate
Taiwan from China. It hurts exchanges and cooperation across the

<HEADLINE> Rwandans Threaten to Fight Back If Attacked by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA)
has warned that they would return fire if their positions in
Kisangani, the third largest city in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), was attacked by Ugandan troops.
</P>
<P>
The threat, made by Rwandan government spokesman Wilson
Rutayisire Tuesday, comes after the Uganda People's Defense Forces
engaged the Goma faction of the Rally for Congolese Democracy
(RCD), the Monitor daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rutayisire dismissed the claims that the RPA had been chased
from its Kisangani Airport base, saying that the last weekend's
fighting was entirely a matter between the RCD-Goma and the
Ugandan forces although some RPA soldiers were injured in the
exchange for fire.
</P>
<P>
The RPA will defend themselves decisively if they are attacked
by the Ugandan troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also accused Uganda's Army Chief of Staff James
Kazini, who heads the Ugandan troops operation in the DRC, of
corrupting the verification process initiated by regional leaders
in Zambia on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda support different factions after the RCD
split into two groups in May this year. Kigali backs the faction
based in Goma while Kampala is behind the group with headquarters
in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Now both countries have been urged to persuade rebels to
endorse the Lusaka ceasefire agreement in order to put the peace
process in the DRC back on track.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petroleum
Corp. (CNPC) is striving to overcome deep-seated management and
production problems by launching a restructuring process,
according to today's China Petroleum News.
</P>
<P>
 Five pilot CNPC enterprises have begun reshaping, and the
remaining 49 enterprises have submitted their restructuring plans
to CNPC headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Sources from CNPC said that higher production costs, low labor
productivity, and serious economic losses make CNPC less
competitive than overseas petroleum corporations.
</P>
<P>
CNPC's assets totaled 506.9 billion yuan (63.4 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, of which more than 27 billion yuan (3.4 billion
U.S. dollars) is lying idle.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to prioritize its internal system innovation
and reorganization by next year, and frame its cross-century
strategy to take advantage of 1998's restructuring which enables
CNPC to integrate upstream with downstream production.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Parliament Approves New Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PEMH, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
Wednesday approved a new law in an emergency session that allows
an extension of the detention without trial of captured Khmer
Rouge leaders up to three years.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed with 94 votes for out of 106 parliamentarians
attending the session, would allow a court to detain Khmer Rouge
leader Ta Mok for up to three years without trial, instead of the
six months now mandated by law.
</P>
<P>
The new law states that "for the case of crime of genocide, war
crime and crime against humanity which already mentioned in the
United Nations Convention, the pre-detention can be extended once
a year, but the duration of such extension must not be over three
years."
</P>
<P>
Assembly President Prince Ranariddh said after the session that
according to this law, Ta Mok will be charged with the law of
outlawing the Khmer Rouge and the law on genocide crimes when the
law is adopted.
</P>
<P>
Ta Mok was arrested on March 6 and has been detained in Phnom
Penh since then. Under Article 14 of Cambodia's current penal
code, Ta Mok must be tried within a month.
</P>
<P>
The court has earlier considered having double trials if a new
law is not passed. The first trial will be by a 1994 law banning
the Khmer Rouge, and the second one by a law on genocide.
</P>
<P>
Key lawmakers of Assembly's legislation committee reached a
compromise agreement on the legislation last week, which would
delay the trial of military chief Ta Mok and prevent
potentially-troubling revelations from surfacing.
</P>
<P>
Some argue the law will buy the government time to forge an
agreement with the United Nations for a tribunal to prosecute
Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes committed from 1975 to 1979. The
law would also allow the government to try Ta Mok on crimes of
genocide and crimes against humanity, instead of solely on a 1994
law banning the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
But the new law was attacked by human rights groups and
opposition party members who said it is a delaying tactic designed
to put the trial off indefinitely.

Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Stimulus Package Applauded, But No Cure-All Panacea(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The latest economic stimulus
package announced Tuesday by the Thai cabinet was warmly received
by local business people. However, analysts warned it was not a
cure-all panacea and that it will take some time before the
results would be seen.
</P>
<P>
The multi-billion-baht stimulus package aims to further spur
the economic recovery by the reduction of import duties and the
mobilization of funds.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet outlined four key aspects of the package, namely
tax and tariff measures, equity investment measures, measures to
promote the recovery of the real estate sector, and measures to
improve financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approved cuts in import duties, mainly those on raw
materials, intermediate goods and products that are not being
produced domestically, to help reduce the production cost of Thai
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The government is also to set up three new funds -- the Equity
Fund, the Thailand Recovery Fund, and the Fund for Venture Capital
Investment in SMEs -- to encourage the debt-restructuring of the
corporate sector and boost the investment of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Equity Fund will be established to seek investment in
large-scale enterprises in Thailand which are competitive but so
far have been denied liquidity from the banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Thailand Recovery Fund, in which the Asian Development Bank
will become a key partner, will serve medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To support small-scale enterprises, the state-controlled Small
Industry Finance Cooperation will be providing soft-loan funding
to the sector.
</P>
<P>
The government will also mobilize another 67 billion baht (1.8
billion dollars) to create the liquidity and improve the
consumers' demand in the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the Government Housing Bank will issue a
housing bond worth 46 billion baht (1.24 billion dollars) with
three to five-year maturity, while the state-run Secondary
Mortgage Corporation will raise another four billion baht (108
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to inject additional 17 billion baht
(459.5 million dollars) in National Housing Authority as part of
the state agency's reserve to purchase and develop the incomplete
housing project for sale to the small income people.
</P>
<P>
The government also enacted a series of ongoing measures to
support SMEs, including arranging over 35 billion baht (945.9
million dollars) in credit for SMEs through the specialized
financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Stimulus Package Applauded, But No Cure-All Panacea(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said that while the
measures would affect state revenues, it would improve corporate
earnings and employment and lead to long-term gains in the
country's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The new stimulus package is the third one produced by the Chuan
Leekpai government over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
On August 14 1998, the government introduced a 300-billion-baht
(8.1-billion-dollar) program to recapitalize the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, 1999, the government announced tax cuts worth 130
billion baht (3.5 billion dollars) and new spending to help
stimulate consumer demand and create up to 486,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
One of the distinguished characteristics of this new package is
that it contains measures to boost the real sector and the real
estate market.
</P>
<P>
This aims to silence those critics who say that the government
has been paying too much attention to tackling the financial
sector at the expense of the real sector.
</P>
<P>
Thamma Pinsukarnchana, director of the Federation of Thai
Industries, said the tariff cuts would raise profits for exporters
by cutting production costs.
</P>
<P>
Soonthorn Nikomrut, president of the Rubber Holders'
Cooperatives Federation of Thailand, said the package would help
local businesses, particularly farmers and agribusinesses reliant
on imports such as fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely agreed that the package came too late as
many firms have been on the verge of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the results of the package would not be seen in a
short period of time.
</P>
<P>
According to Nimit Nontapuntawat, executive vice-president of
Bangkok Bank, the short-term impact of the package would be mainly
in sentiment and increased confidence, with the actual result not
to be felt until mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said despite the new package, underlying problems
remain in financial and corporate sectors.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans are still persistently high, accounting
for 47.7 percent of the total loans in the banking system at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
This reflects economic weakness, the slow pace of corporate
debt restructuring and the unwillingness of the banking sector to
deal with its won problems, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They said that great challenges are still ahead for Thailand's
economic recovery, such as how the credit system can be restored,
how effectively the financial sector is reformed and how quick
corporate debt restructuring is implemented.

<HEADLINE> Oman, Dubai Step Up Cooperation in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities in Dubai
and Oman are looking at ways to step up cooperation to draw more
tourists to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are to further enhance cooperation in unified
entry procedures for tourists, collective marketing and
cruiseline business development, the Gulf News daily reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the emirate and Oman had met recently and
discussed the creation of a framework for increased cooperation to
jointly attract tourists to the region, said Khalid Bin Sulayem,
Director General of Dubai's Department of Tourism and Commerce
Marketing.
</P>
<P>
Dubai and Oman have been sharing important information and data
relating to tourism activities and ongoing evaluation of tourism
developments, trends and perspectives.
</P>
<P>
"We are linked by the mutual challenge we face to deepen and
strengthen cooperation and coordination in a wide variety of
fields," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the long time cooperation between the two
sides to the long-standing friendship between the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Dubai, a commercial center of the UAE and the Middle East, has
made great efforts in recent years to develop tourism to
diversify its sources of revenue.

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of Downed Pak Plane on Display in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Salvaged parts of the wreckage
of the Pakistani "Breguet Atlantique" military aircraft downed
over Gujarat were put up for display at the Prime Minister's
office Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the Pakistani naval aircraft, shot down by an
Indian Air Force (IAF) plane Tuesday, was brought here early
Wednesday morning along with some personal documents of Pakistani
navy pilots, IAF sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The documents included flight manual of the pilots and
checklist of the aircraft besides personal documents.
</P>
<P>
The salvaged wreckage brought to the capital included fuselage
wing, cable hydraulic system, one parachute, a dingy and cockpit
of the anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The salvage operations were carried out through Tuesday
afternoon in the slushy and marshy areas of Kori Creek on the
Indian side of the Indo-Pakistani border in the Kutch region of
the Southern state of Gujarat, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
IAF pressed MI-17 helicopters to airlift the parts of the
maritime surveillance aircraft, which crashed after being hit by
an air-to-air missile fired by a Mig-21 fighter on the edge of the
Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an IAF spokesman rejected the Pakistani claim that
the Indian jets "violated Pakistani air space" and that "the
wreckage was well within Pakistani territory."
</P>
<P>
"How could we salvage the wreckage if it was lying on the
Pakistani side," the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not rule out that some parts of the plane may
have landed on the Pakistani side as it came down.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Declares 8 New Tourist Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives has declared eight areas in the Philippines as
tourist spots in bills passed during their first session to
bolster tourism in the country, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"These bills aim to bring in foreign as well as local tourist
to these places," PNA quoted House speaker Manuel Villar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The declaration and promotion of these areas as tourist spots,
Villar said, will help the local economies in these areas in
bringing in tourists and increasing money flow.
</P>
<P>
"This will be good for businesses there and will help generate
employment for our countrymen," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that eco-tourism should likewise be coupled
with efforts to preserve and protect the environment while
allowing tourists to enjoy the country's beauty.
</P>
<P>
The eight areas that have been declared as tourist spots or
tourist zones by the House are: the Cabul-an island in Buenavista,
Bohol; the Calawagan resort in Paluan, Negros Occidental; a
tourism resort in Cua Puzon, Apayao; a waterfall in Bagangan, Sta.
Cruz Marinduque; the Lamintao beach resort in Barotac Nuevo,
Iloilo; a portion of the Bulabog-Putian national park in Iloilo;
the Island of Lubang, occidental Mindoro; Murcialegos island in

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Issues Gun Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has issued a 10-day ultimatum to those holding illegal firearms
to surrender them to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a meet-the-people tour in the capital Nairobi
Tuesday, the president said there was proliferation of illegal
weapons in the country and the firearm holders have up by August
20 to surrender them to nearest police stations or administrative
offices, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those who will surrender their arms within the period would not
be arrested, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that after the expire of this amnesty, the security
agents would arrest and prosecute those who defied the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the Kenyans to provide information to the
authorities on the whereabouts of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Local media earlier reported that there are more than 5,000
illegal guns in the Kenyan capital and thousands at large
elsewhere in the country being used by criminals. The illegal
firearms are mainly smuggled into Kenya from the neighboring
war-stricken countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Reduce VAT Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has been urged
to consider the reduction of the current Value Added Tax (VAT)
rate of 17.5 percent as Zambia had the highest level in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACC)
chairman George Chabwera said the current VAT level impacted
negatively on businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Wednesday's Zambian newspaper, The Post, as
saying the reduction of the VAT levels was part of the ZACC
submissions for the proposed additions and changes to the budget
for the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera said both the high VAT levels and duty had negatively
affected companies to the point that the Zambia Revenue Authority
company tax collections had fallen due to continued losses.
</P>
<P>
A revision of the current tax regime would favor sound and
profitable operations of firms and increase collections as
companies would now start registering profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among other submissions is the reduction of the current 125
percent excise duty which had disadvantaged producers of beer,
carbonated drinks and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera also called on the government to further reduce duty
on raw materials to help make the locally manufactured goods more
competitive and stimulate growth of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera was commenting Tuesday on the invitation by the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development permanent secretary
Boniface Nonde for budget submissions from the private sector and
members of the public to be included in next year's budget.

<HEADLINE> Closed-End Loans Expected To Boost Ailing State Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Better management of closed-end
loans is expected to give money-losing state-owned enterprises an
opportunity to gradually pull out of their difficulties by means
of more profitable products, according to Chinese financial
analysts.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, has
asked all commercial banks to make a greater effort to support
profitable products of these companies.
</P>
<P>
Closed-end loans first appeared in the second half of 1997
after a series of People's Bank policies that encouraged
commercial banks to provide support for the market-favored
products of money-losing companies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the bank made a decision about managing
closed-end loans, providing regulations and verifying procedures
to standardize practices. A bank spokesman says that closed-end
loans can help companies increase profits and help commercial
banks improve their assets and management.
</P>
<P>
China's major commercial banks say that closed-end loans in the
past two years have already had good results and some state-owned
companies have recovered somewhat.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the Bank of China had provided 3.95 billion
yuan (about 477 million U.S. dollars) and 9.4 million U.S. dollars
worth of such loans to 405 money-losing companies.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has provided the
loans for more than 500 state-owned industrial enterprises, worth
3.6 billion yuan, and 25 of the enterprises have cut their losses,
and 275 enterprises have increased profits to some degree.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts say that the central government's decision
to recognize closed-end loans as a major way to promote economic
development means a great opportunity for money-losing companies,
which are expected to do more market research and product
development to help find a way out.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Posts 48.6b U.S. Dollars of External Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' external debt
has climbed up by 783 million U.S. dollars to 48.6 billion dollars
in the first quarter from 47.8 billion dollars in the end of 1998
due to the government's massive foreign borrowings, the Philippine
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the higher debt stock, the country can still service
its debts without posing threats to the stability of the external
sector, Philippine Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura was
quoted as saying in a speech before the House of Representatives
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In January-April, the nation's debt-service ratio stood at a
comfortable level of 12.3 percent, which means for every dollar
the exporters earn, 0.12 dollar will be set aside for debt
payments, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Of the entire foreign debt, according to Burenaventura, medium-
to long-term loans account for 86 percent or 41.796 billion
dollars, which is the bulk, while those which are short-term
comprised only 14 percent or 6.804 billion dollars of the total.
</P>
<P>
During the financial crisis of the 1980s, short-term commercial
bank loans formed the majority of the debt stock, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the peso appreciated by 27.5 centavos to close at
38.89 pesos to the dollar Tuesday from the previous day's 39.165
pesos to the dollar due to an alleged intervention by the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
The traders added the central bank sold dollars through
unidentified "conduit banks."
</P>
<P>
This sale, however, was again denied by central bank officials
who said the government is leaving the pesos to market forces.

<HEADLINE> Thai Consumer Confidence in Economy Boosted: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai consumers' confidence in a
resurgent economy and possible recovery over the next six months
had been boosted in July, according to a survey available on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All economic indicators in July showed improvement,
particularly the index measuring the confidence of consumers in
the future of the Thai economy, noted a survey conducted by the
economic and business center of the University of the Thai Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index rose to 106.2 points in July,
topping 100 for the first time after hovering between 60 and 80
points in the past seven months. The index only recorded 85.8
points in June.
</P>
<P>
The center based its findings on interviews with 1,823 people
of all ages nationwide. The respondents were asked about their
confidence in the Thai economy overall, employment prospects, and
expected income in the future.
</P>
<P>
The index has a full scale of 200 points, providing a snapshot
view of the economy. Under the index scale, between 100-200 points
reflect consumers' full confidence in economic growth, with
exactly 100 showing the economy remains in good shape. An index
below 100 shows people believe the economy is in poor shape.
</P>
<P>
The index for employment prospects in July edged up to 61.2
points from 48.6 points in June and the index for expected income
in the future at 103.9 points compared with 101.4 points in June.

BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A housing complex in Beijing's
Fangshan District is China's first to use new environment-friendly
technology, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Beiluchun Housing Complex was built on 14.46 hectares of
land to provide 32.22 percent of the units with lawns. Residents
separate the garbage by type for burning or recycling and the heat
generated by the process can be used as energy-saving heat for the
complex.
</P>
<P>
There is also a sewage treatment plant whose treated water is
used on the lawns and for cleaning the community's streets. Units
have their own heating system to save energy and stop air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hui, who helped design the complex, told Xinhua that
using these high-tech methods does not add a significant amount to
building costs and the recycling has obvious benefits in reduced
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The complex is expected to provide a good example for China's
housing development, he said.

<P>
The two centers were reportedly accused of improper or

<HEADLINE> Bankers Welcome Decision To Expand Foreign Involvement In RMB Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China's recent decision to
further loosen restrictions on foreign banks doing business in
yuan has been welcomed by both domestic and overseas bankers
because it provides opportunities for foreign banks to increase
activities in China and for Chinese bankers to improve their
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks in Shanghai now can look for customers in Jiangsu
and Zhejiang provinces and banks in Shenzhen can do yuan-based
business in Hunan and Guangdong provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, since some restrictions on the scale of
business have been eased. Previously, foreign banks could only
deal in yuan on a trial basis in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
T. C. Kwan, the president of the Bank of East Asia's Shanghai
Branch, says that the move may help increase yuan funding sources
for foreign banks, something that has been a problem for them.
Kwan's branch started doing business in yuan last year and now
handles deposits and loans in yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nie Ming, the vice president of Fuji Bank's Shanghai branch,
says that his bank has paid close attention to the new policy
although it doesn't deal in yuan right now, but is considering
applying for a license because there's a great deal of demand from
customers.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Lu, the president of the Bank of China's Shanghai branch,
admits that Chinese banks have felt the pressure of growing
competition from foreign banks, but says that it could help lead
to further reforms.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jiasheng, the president of the Bank of Communications'
Shanghai branch, says that his bank is preparing a cooperation
program with foreign banks in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.

<HEADLINE> China's Key Think-tank Explains Need To Ban Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A front-page article in today's
"People's Daily", China's leading newspaper, says that banning the
Falun Dafa Research Society founded by Li Hongzhi was necessary to
support the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by a group of researchers at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) who are studying the Falun Gong
(Falun Dafa) phenomenon, says that the organization jeopardized
society and damaged the laws of the country. The CASS is one of
China's top think-tank and highest research institution of social
sciences.
</P>
<P>
It says that none of Falun Dafa's branches were registered and
that the lives, health, and property of Falun Gong practitioners
had been seriously hurt by Li Hongzhi, concoctor of Falun Gong
whose illegal gatherings disrupted public order.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to ban the group was proper and
legitimate, the researchers say, because the organization violated
the Constitution, civil, criminal, and tax codes, and regulations
for organizations, publishing, assemblies, parades, and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
They conclude that dealing with Falun Gong in this way shows
reverence for social legislation and was needed for building a
socialist country ruled by law and will provide an education in
socialist legislation for officials and common folk.

<HEADLINE> Coach Ma-absent China Eye One Medal in Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Forget Ma's Family Army, forget
the three gold medals they won at Stuttgart in 1991. China's
goal this time is to get one medal from the 7th World Athletics
Championships, which begins in Seville, Spain, on August 20.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to win a medal of any color," said Shang Xiutang,
General Secretary of the Chinese Athletics Association (CAA).
</P>
<P>
China will send 33 athletes, including 12 men and 21 women, to
compete in 18 events at Seville and their biggest medal chance
lies in the men's and women's 20 kilometers walking events.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongyu, women's 20km World Cup champion this year, is most
likely to realize China's hope of winning a medal.
</P>
<P>
Liu, ranked second in the world and also the 10km champion in
last year's Bangkok Asian Games, will be joined by teammates Wang
Yan, 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in the 10km event, and Gao
Hongmiao, World Cup 10km champion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We might not be so strong as Russian opponent individually,
but as a team the three athletes are hard to beat in the 20km
event," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 20km walking, Yu Guohui, who finished fourth in
the 1997 Athens World Championships, also has the caliber to take
a medal.
</P>
<P>
Yu has made a remarkable progress in endurance and technique in
the past two years, winning the gold medal in last year's Asian
Games and the silver in the World Cup tournament early this year.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, women's long jumper Guang Yingnan,
winner of the Linz Grand Prix in Germany last year with 6.91
meters, is also hopeful to take a medal.
</P>
<P>
In the other events like women's shot put, triple jump and
discus, where Chinese athletes are dominant in Asia, it will be
not bad for them to enter the final eight in Seville, Shang said.
</P>
<P>
"You can not say Chinese athletics has declined just because we
failed to win a gold in the last two championships," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
"In 1991 and 1993, the fact that only a few events got
prosperous did not indicate that China had become a world track
and field powerforce. Our overall strength has been improved in
the past few years though we seldom won a gold in the world
competitions," he added.
</P>
<P>
But as a whole, China, the track and field giant in Asia, will
face the toughest challenge in Seville since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 Tokyo meet, China claimed two gold medals through
Xu Demei in the women's javelin and Huang Zhihong in the women's
shot put.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993 Stuttgart championships, legendary coach Ma Junren'
s women runners emerged from nowhere to bag three gold medals in 1,
500-, 3,000- and 10,000 meters. And Huang retained her shot put
title.
</P>
<P>
After the glittering performance in Stuttgart, Chinese
athletics plunged into crises with the breakup of Ma's army. Huang,
who had competed for more than a decade, won a silver in 1995,
which was China's lone medal there.
</P>
<P>
But the 1997 world championships in Athens was more disastrous
for the world's most populous country when they returned home
empty-handed. Ma, who had nurtured a new group of runners, refused
to go to Athens but to save strength for the Chinese Eighth
National Games held two months later.
</P>
<P>
The world-famed coach finally surprised the world in the
National Games, where his two proteges, Jiang Bo and Dong Yanmei
broke the world women's 5,000 meters record.
</P>
<P>
But a row broke out between Ma and the CAA because the coach
did not want to compete in the 1998 national Grand Prix, which CAA
ruled as a precondition to qualify for the Asian Games and other
major international meets.
</P>
<P>
Ma and his runners had to stay at home during the Asian Games
last December, but this year they made concession to the country's
governing body CAA and appeared in the field after a layoff of 18
months.
</P>
<P>
However, their comeback was like a nightmare. Among over 10
runners from Ma's training camp, Dong Yanmei was the only one
qualifying for the Grand Prix Finals in Shanghai, where she
finished a humiliating seventh place.
</P>
<P>
But Shang said: "Perhaps Ma does not want to take part in the
World Championships. Like 1997, he is resting his runners in a bid
to make a surprise in the National City Games at Xi'an in
September."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ma is still upset with the humiliation
that the CAA denied him a chance to compete in the Bangkok Games.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Ma hopes to embarrass the CAA officials by
watching them experience another medal-free world championships
but breaking world records again in a home meet.

BELGRADE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain

<P>
CARACAS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Interior Minister
Ignacio Arcaya on Tuesday denied any compromise with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on the release of
eight hostages aboard a plane hijacked on June 30.
</P>
<P>
He also denied, during a television program, that the issuing
of a FARC statement about the release of hostages has been part of
the negotiations between the Venezuelan government and the
Colombian leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the FARC repeated its claims that it had
nothing to do with the hijacking, which it said was done by a
group of Venezuelan dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Arcaya insisted that he did not hold talks with any member of
the FARC.
</P>
<P>
The plane, owned by the Venezuelan Airline Avior, took off 11
days ago on a domestic flight from Barines to Guasdualito with 15
people aboard. It was diverted by a group of kidnappers to the
Colombian border province of Arauca.
</P>

The plane was flown back on Sunday to Vara de Maria airport in

<P>
ALMA ATA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A section of an ancient
elephant tusk has been found on the bank of the Amu Darya river in
Turkmenistan, a central Asian country known for its vast desert
land.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Turkmen Telegraph Agency on
Tuesday, preliminary appraisals by paleontologists established
that the bone-like piece, measuring 23 centimeters long and 13
centimeters wide, belonged to the tusk of an elephant living some
60,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was the latest in a series of evidences found in
Turkmenistan that prove the living of ancient pachyderms in the
area. The first such remains were discovered in the country in
1945.
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists believe that the Amu Darya river basin was
covered by a thick forest and a rich vegetation 60,000 years ago,
where various animals roamed, including elephants.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan is a land-locked country with 80 of its territory
in the huge Karakumy desert. The country is one of the driest

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Urged to Implement Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Tuesday accused
the U.N. mission and the international peacekeepers in Kosovo of
failing to fully implement the related U.N. resolution on Kosovo,
which it said has caused "a fairly complicated and serious
situation" in the province.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo has become "very complicated and
serious" as the U.N. special mission and the peacekeeping force
did not earnestly implement the resolution adopted earlier by the
U.N. Security Council, said Zoran Andelkovic, chairman of Kosovo's
Provisional Executive Committee, in Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Executive Committee, created in September 1998
to oversee the work of the then local government in Kosovo, is
composed of 18 representatives from all ethnic groups in the
southeastern province of Yugoslavia's Serbian Republic.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with a group of Russian parliamentarians,
Andelkovic said the international peace-keepers rendered the
border between Kosovo and Albania un-defended after the withdrawal
of the Yugoslav military and police forces from the province in
late June.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, a large number of Albanian citizens
entered Kosovo illegally and the population of ethnic Albanians in
Pristina tripled the figure before the NATO bombing of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission should cooperate with the delegation of the
Serbian government in Kosovo if it really wants to bring peace to
the region, Andelkovic said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the U.N. mission and the international peace-
keepers should unremittingly carry out the U.N. resolution and
respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.

<P>
KIEV, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is concerned about Russia's
latest government reshuffle, as it was adversely affecting the
social and economic situation of Ukraine, Prime Minister Valery
Pustoviotenko was quoted by the Ukrainian Inter-fax news agency as
saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During June and July, the prime ministers of Ukraine and Russia
reached a number of agreements, and now it is time to carry them
out. For Ukraine, Russia's government change was unusual, said
Pustoviotenko while chairing a government work meeting.

Earlier, Ukrainian officials expressed the hope that Russia's
political turmoil will not affect relations with Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Reports Less Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Croatia, a country with half of
its land covered with forests, reported drastically less forest
fires in the first seven months this year due to a series of
preventive steps taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,116 forest fires were reported during this period,
just half of the number reported during the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The average area burnt by each fire this year was five hectares
as compared with 16 hectares last year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of forest fires is attributed to a package of
government measures, including extensive publicity, closer
cooperation between professional and voluntary firemen and
improved equipment.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- After winning three straight
events, American Pete Sampras will put his 17-match winning streak
on the line against Dutchman Jan Siemerink Tuesday night in second-
round action at the 2.2 million U.S. dollars ATP Championship in
Cincinnati, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, one of eight seeds to receive a first-round bye, has
not lost since a second-round upset to Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine
at the French Open, collecting titles at the Stella Artois
Championship, Wimbledon and the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked player, Sampras is set to renew his
rivalry with Patrick Rafter that heated up in the event last year,
when he lost to the Australian in the final on a contested match
point. The two have had a frosty relationship since.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the second seed, will begin defense of his title on
Wednesday against Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, seventh seed Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands crusied into the third round with a 6-1, 6-3 victory

Toddy Martin, Jim Courier and Michael Chang headlined this
afternood's first-round winners. Martin, seeded ninth, got past
Ramon Delgado of Paraguay 6-4, 5-7, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a two-time champion, recorded the only break in each set
of his 6-3, 6-4 win over Russian teenager Marat Safin. Chang is
unseeded as he looked to turn around a season in which he has won
half of his 28 matches.
</P>
<P>
Coming off a quarterfinal showing in Montreal, American Jim
Courier beat slumping Croatian Goran Ivanisevic 7-6 (7-1), 6-2.

<HEADLINE> New Supply Route Opened in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A 56-km-long new supply route
through northern Sri Lanka has been opened, enabling travel and
transport between areas controlled by security forces and Tamil
rebels, newspapers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new land route ended a six-week deadlock
over a safe passage for civilians between the security forces and
the rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The 32-km road between Vavuniya and Mankulam goes through
security forces-cleared areas while the 24 km section from
Mankulam to Kilinochchi is held by the Tamil rebels, the official
Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
For many years the route was closed with the LTTE rebels
refusing to allow a passage.
</P>
<P>
The government has traditionally supplied food and other items
to civilians in rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
An earlier route was closed in May when the army launched a
fresh offensive against the LTTE rebels who have been fighting for
a homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new land route was achieved with the
intervention of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) in agreement with the LTTE rebels, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the first convoy of 10 buses with 412 civilians who
had been stranded and 10 truckloads of food commodities were
driven along the road escorted by the military while rebel cadres
lined the route a distance away.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Discarded by Former Practitioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Many former practitioners of
Falun Gong say that the cult has harmed their physical and mental
health, and vow never again to have anything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
Peng Haiyun, an employee of the railway station in this capital
of southwest China's Yunnan Province, started to practice Falun
Gong in January 1997, with the hope of curing his chronic ill
health.
</P>
<P>
But under his influence, his 26-year-old daughter, perfectly
well and just married then, started to practice Falun Gong too.
After a few months, she developed a big tumor on the thigh, but
refused to consult a doctor.
</P>
<P>
"Three months later, her condition grew worse, until she could
not even walk. We sent her to a hospital, where she was diagnosed
as suffering from advanced heart disease. But after a month's
medical treatment, her illness was stabilized." Peng said.
</P>
<P>
However, when they returned home they gave up all medical
treatment and started to practice Falun Gong again. "But this time
it was too late to save may daughter's life," Peng said with
remorse.
</P>
<P>
Also in Kunming, another 20 former practitioners of Falun Gong
demonstrated their determination to sever all their connections
with the cult in another way.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of August 2, they went to a local army hospital
with a letter of gratitude and a brocade flag to thank the doctors.
</P>
<P>
They had suffered because they had heeded the fallacies of
Falun Gong. The doctors at the hospital had gone to their homes to
persuade them to abandon Falun Gong. They gave timely treatment
and actually saved many of their lives.
</P>
<P>
Now the former practitioners have vowed never to have any thing
to do with the cult any more, having concluded that only science
can make their lives better.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans who
filed bankruptcy declined 2 percent during the 12 months ending
June 30, the first yearly decrease since 1995, the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Personal bankruptcies in the year mentioned, numbering 1,352,
030, accounted for 97 percent of the total 1,391,964 new
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
New bankruptcies filed during the second quarter of 1999
dropped to 345,956 from a record 373,460 during the quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"While bankruptcy filings are still very high, the trend over
the past six months suggests that 1999 will fall short of last
year's record pace," said Sam Gerdano, executive director of the
American Bankruptcy Institute.

<HEADLINE> 15 Foreign Banks Ready to Guarantee L/Cs Opened by Indonesian Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- As many as 15 foreign banks are
ready to guarantee Letters of Credit (L/Cs) opened by Indonesian
foreign exchange banks in the name of Bank Ekspor Indonesia (BEI).
</P>
<P>
BEI's commissioner Mukhlis Rasyid said that the 15 foreign
banks include Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank,
ABC Bank and a number of banks grouped in Japan Export Import Bank
(Jexim).
</P>
<P>
"These 15 banks will act as confirming banks for letters of
credit issued by BEI to finance the imports of local export
companies," he was quoted by national newspapers Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
BEI was established in May by the government to support
export-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
Unlike a conventional bank, BEI will raise funds from
international financing agencies like Jexim rather than the public
to finance its activities.
</P>
<P>
BEI's main tasks will be to guarantee L/Cs and issue guarantees
for domestic exporters who need loans from local banks to finance
their operations.
</P>
<P>
"BEI will begin operating on September 1," Mukhlis said. BEI
was previously slated to begin operations earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Objective Assessment of Its Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Tuesday that
one and half million Iraqis have died as a result of the nine-year
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 children are dying every month due to malnutrition
and lack of medications, said Iraq's Permanent Mission to the
United Nations in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The devastating long-term effects of the radiation resulting
from the depleted uranium weapons used by the American and British
forces in Iraq are beginning to take their toll on the population,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The embargo on the Iraqi economy has brought down Iraq's GDP to
no more than one third of its pre-1991 level and "has effectively
cornered the Iraqi population into a seemingly endless situation
of hunger, deprivation and lack of prospect," the mission said.
</P>
<P>
It accused the United States and Britain of continuing to
interfere into its internal affairs and threaten its territorial
integrity and of continuing to obstruct any move in the Security
Council to render justice to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Iraq has fulfilled U.N. requirements for its
disarmament, the mission said Iraq "demands nothing more than the
application of the resolutions of the council legally and fairly,
which requires the objective assessment of the record of
implementation by Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq on August
6, 1990, against its invasion of Kuwait.

Dutch international Dennis Bergkamp put his side top when he

Petit had given the Gunners the lead after 40 minutes with a

halftime with a stunning volley from even further out that skimmed
past Arsenal keeper Alex Manninger.

LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Rod Richards has resigned as the
leader of the Conservative Party in Wales, the BBC reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Richards said in a statement that he felt he was left with no
choice after being "undermined" by his party members.
</P>
<P>
His announcement followed the news that Nick Bourne, his former
rival, had been named the new acting leader of the Tory members of
the National Assembly for Wales.
</P>
<P>
Richards had recommended 29-year-old David Davies to be the
deputy leader but was rejected by the Tory members who believed
Davies was "too inexperienced."
</P>
<P>
"I asked the Tory group to endorse my appointment of David
Davies," he said in the statement. "They did not do so. I
therefore feel my authority as leader has been undermined and I
have no alternative but to resign."
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Bourne as acting leader was made at a
Conservative party meeting in Cardiff, just hours before Richards'
resignation.

WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged the nation Tuesday to "intensify our resolve to make America
a better place" in the face of shooting in Los Angeles and
suggested the shootings again showed the need for tighter gun
control laws.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by
an act of gun violence," Clinton said at a press conference at the
White House.
</P>

A man with a high-powered gun burst into a Jewish community
center in Los Angeles Tuesday and sprayed the lobby with 20 to 30
shots, wounding five people, including three boys attending day
camp, and then walked away.
</P>
<P>
Police searched the center grounds and the surrounding suburban
neighborhood for the man, described as a bald white male around 40
years old.

Clinton said he had been getting updates on the search for the
gunman, and called the shootings "another senseless act" and
offered federal assistance to local law enforcement agencies.
